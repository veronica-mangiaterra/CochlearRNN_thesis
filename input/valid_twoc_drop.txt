gosh .
yeah .
well , we 'd better hurry .
hope they 're expecting us .
all right , gentlemen  we 've all had our say , and we all agree on this one vital point , we are lamping a tigh security li on professor brainad 's tremendous contribution .
oh , you 'll be recompensed .
goodness knows , the armed servies are never chintzy .
matter of fact , i 'm putting two of my bravest financial officers on the mission .
professor , you are a fine , unselfih man .
i 's a priilege to know you .
but just relax .
no sweat .
the money is as good as in your hands .
schedule our is going in .
well , professor , i do n't think we need to take up any ore of you time .
we have to stockpile statistics , build up pressure , depoy our firepower so we hit them from all direction .
well , no , i do n't suppose we do .
do n't let those double-breasted suits fool you .
those boys are tough .
well , he thing is , we do n't need al the mone now .
it 's big .
everyhing about it .
everything is goig to fall apart all the way down the line , and the free world loses another battle .
is that what you want ?
no , i would n't want that , sir .
remember , you 're in ashington .
stop rying to be reaonable about money or you 're going to bollix up the whole ting .
you 'd think thoe people at the petagon could at least have gien us a couple of $ 100,000 out of petty cash .
what ' gon na happen , professor ?
oh , roger .
i 'm sorry , biff .
i got ta face it .
the only time my pop ever got the orst of a bargain was when he got me .
is nt it magnificent , gentlemen ?
medfield college has , i believe the saying goes , finally come ito the chips .
why do 't you just chane the name of the place to brainard college and have done ith it ?
a splendid idea , mr. hawk , though i realize it as offered in a spirit o irony 
we 'l be up to our ips i crackpots .
no .
are n't you all getting a little high and mighty ?
oh , splendid .
ask him to come i , pease .
gentlemen , would you be good enough to rise ?
when professor brainard comes in hat door ,
i mean you , uh ...
well , you really should n't .
well , not exactly 
it 's jut ...
they really andbagged you .
hey hung your hide up on the barn oor to dry .
well ...
but i thought they were delighted with your discovery .
it 's just that ...
number one , the boys in washington latched on to your little discovery , so you ca n't sell it anywhere else .
number two , they 're not about to give you an oney until they think it over .
numer three , meantime , you 've got no money .
numer four , somebody better lay 350,000 clams on the barrelhead , first of the month by 9:00 a.m .
period .
end of story .
i ca n't believe you 'd do a thing like that , mr. hawk .
well , boys  it looks like i 'm calling the tune again .
i know how badly you must feel , president dagett , but things are n't as bad as they seem .
exuse me .
as a civic leader ...
pearls !
oh , i just love pearls .
i make it my business to know , ms. brainard .
and now , little something to keep the chill off .
oh !
oh , you must nt .
well , you do n't think it 's a little bit too ussy , do you ?
like you 've been wearing it al your life , mrs. brainard .
and here , the finishing touch .
an empess .
i do , do n't i ?
this , as you can see , is a check for one million dollars made out to the professor and yourself .
for a kind wod , mrs. brainard .
you know , in a business deal , the right word fro the little woman ...
i 'm a great believer in the power of a woman .
you really got something  mr. huley .
well , i o n't know what ned 's going to say about all this .
for a space-age scientist , he 's a little bit old-fa ...
guess who ?
betsy !
what i 'd like to do ...
betsy , what is all this the dogs and that coat ?
please take it off .
now why do n't we let the little lady enjoy herself ?
mr. hurley is a live wie .
profeso , whe you invented this stuff , i do n't think you dreamed what you had .
o n't be so modes , professor .
that 's your trouble .
that s where i come in .
flubbermint gum  it chews while you snooze .
fluberin , bouces away pain again and again .
hit hem where they live .
tey ll wonder how they go along ithout it .
howie , roll the film .
guess what this is ?
but , betsy ...
hi there .
newton and the law of gravity .
watt and the steam engine .
edison and the electric light .
and , my friends ,
brainard and flubber .
fo it was not too long ago , in a small american city , tha the discovery of fubber burst upon a waiting world .
that was he beginning 
from those fist crude basketball shoe came more shoes , shoes for people in every walk of life .
he could walk with his ead aboe the crowd .
but this was ony the springboard  not only to a vast new line of products , but to a happie , safer way of life .
friends , is your home a booby trap just waiting to snare you the moment you set foot in it ?
i 'm home , dear .
is your kitche a savage jugle teeming with peril and pitfalls ?
dear , where 's the first-ai kit !
stop clownig , george .
transform it from a booby trap into a love nest .
yes , flubberize your home with hazard-free flubberoleum floors .
the foamiest , friendliest floor that ever fondled your family ' feet .
hi .
sweetheart !
i got him !
they live in te house with the flubberoleum floors .
i 'm very impressed , mr. hurley , but ...
now if you 'll just sign this letter of agreement .
tha million-dollar check is the evidece of our good faith .
a prior commitmet ?
wih who ?
all rigt , boys , pack up the gear .
the party ' over .
forget it .
you 've hurt mr. hurley very deeply .
oh !
now just a minute .

i wo n't !
now gie him his check .
betsy , give me that check .
give it to me .
oh , ery nice .
beautiful quait .
how do you do ?
my name is harker .
fro washington ?
well , am i glad to see you .
come right in .
how do you do ?
it 's very nice to kno you , mrs. brainard .
may i take your hat and coat , r. harker ?
you and you discovery have certainl reated quite a stir down in our nation 's capital .
and you ve come about the payments ?
well , tank you .
oh , but first , of course , we 'd like to pinch off just a tiny bit for ourseves .
just enough to take care of the household bills that have been stackin up for months .
all right , dear 
internal revenue ?
the figure includes delinquent penalties of $ 12,895 at five percent for the first two quarters .
let me explain , mr. haker .
ow they put a top-secret classification on it .
i 'm not even supposed to talk to anybody aout it .
certainly .
exuse me .
we 've been counting on ou .
e trusted you .
you do n't build those rockets to the moo with green stamps , you know .
excuse me  dear 
joey 's here to colect for the paper .
i do n't think so .
there 's ten cents .
thee 's another dime .
he wants his money .
there 's another dime .
hat 's all i 'e got .
we 're rooting for him all the way .
oh , ned , i cleaned all the loose change out of there .
oh .
but uncle sam has to run his store on current income just like everyone else .
when the money he 's counting on does n't come in , he 's very sad .
thank you , mr. harker .
thank you .
thank you , mrs. brainard .
uh , joey marriano .
and how many customers would you say he has on his route ?
oh , i 'd say around 30 .
you would n't tae money fom a child .
we do our part to keep the wheels of democracy rolling .
funn you should mention that about mom .
we nailed her dead to rights .
i misse you .
i ised you , too .
i just coud n't help feeling sorry for all those people .
now , you take that income tax man .
we 're citizes .
now sit down , and hold our breath .
oh ?
what oes that mean , ou got old of the weather ?
what it means , mrs. rainard , is that flubber was only te key that unlocked a great storehouse of cosmic forces .
i found a gas .
do you realize what that would mean , betsy ?
it would mean that , for the fist time , weather would become the slave of ma , rather than his master .
ca n't it be something modet that would bring just a few dollars into this houe ?
or trash can ids that would actual fit the top of trash cans !
trash cans ?
i 'd say i could use a little machine like hat rigt now !
anything can happen .
anything !
i ought you were nuts !
right .
and they re practically national champs  right ?
right .
even my own ather coud n't close a ollege that had just obbered the national champs , could he ?
wat do you think the suit is for ?
i have n't been hangin ' around rofessor rainad all semester just for kicks , you know .
what 's this thing supposed to do 
how does that feel ?
oh , hi , prof .
good .
o , by the way , rofessor ,
oh .
glad to know ya , umphrey .
hi there 
oh , not eactly .
sir , science needs brilliant young minds like humphrey .
besides , i needed a volunteer .
for what ?
sir , i hope you wo nt min , but i 'd like very much to borrow a little flubber gas .
humphrey , come on , demonstrate .
there 's only thing , biff .
i do n't know ho much protection hose ads are going to give you .
oh , we 're not thining about protection .
we 're thinking about offensive power !
just imagine , sir .
the teams line up .
the ball is snapped .
rutland linemen fall like ten pins in evey direction !
he 's over for a touchown !
yeah !
whaddya think  sir ?
i think you 're slightly nuts .
you go right ahead .
we 'll go on a crash program right now .
thank you , sir .
now the flube gas is violent , but we need even more violene , so we simulate it electronically .
now , let 's see what we 've got .
now let 's see .
you know , iff , this stuff is labeled dangerous .
o , now , humph boy .
look , would i get you into a situation unless i knew exactly what i was doing ?
that should do it .
i 've never seen tem so worked up .
when i bombard a cloud with a beam like this , it just has o lead to clustering .
rain all over the place .
now  for a cloud .
not a cloud in the sky .
ready .
aim .
charlie braiard !
betsy .
betsy .
and that 's ony the beginning .
it 's a result of my fooling around with the molecular configuration of flubber gas .
all i ask of you is to get dressed for dinner .
whatever you say , dear .
oh , did n't i tell you , dear ?
no , i do n't think you did .
if there s one thing i 'm certain you 're not , it 's narrow-minded .
it is n't as though he were coming all by himself .
we 're adults  you now  not chidren .
you do n't for one single minute ean ...
i 'll get i .
nuzzie !
it 's wonderful to ..

the wonderful thing about betsy is , she combines beauty wit brains .
i think betsy 's sweet .
i tin she 's just as sweet as she can be .

i had to go throug three mariages before i realized that ned was the kid of man i was lookin for all alon .

oh , i 'm sorry , desiree .

that 's teribly kind of you , and very flatterig .
now , let 's have no foolish pride .
just a minute , ned .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like a chance to express myself .
ned i did n't sa i was going to take the position .
that is an absurdly old-fashioned atitude .
could i have an onion instead of an olive this time ?
excuse me .
oh .
if i 'd arried him , i would have just spoiled him rotten .
you should n't take it this way , brainard .
after all , what are frieds for ?
here we o .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do n't wish to pry , but may i inquire what this marvelous new discovery is ?
it 'll effect people all over the world .
may i ask how i wors ?
i bombard the clouds with a technique
i am not at the moment at libety to divulge .
oh , i see .
biff !
biff !
that is original thinking .
humphrey  are you all rigt ?
answer or i 'll blast you to ribbons .

rainmakes hae always run into that same old snag .
wait a minute , charlie .

poor lamb .

but there is an instict called self-preservation , you know .
under certain conditions even the lowest for of animal life will go searhing for food .
look , neptune , why do n't you just submerge ?
you see , brainard , you 've already spoiled the party for her .
now why do n't you leave betsy alone ?
ashton , i you do n't stay out of this ...
some kind of a peasant , are n' you ?
wait  betsy ...

i 'm sorry , shelby .
okay , charlie .
oh , say , aptain , we want to thank you again fo this new prowl car .
do n't worry , captain .
officer !
it 's that fiend , brainard !
he 's up there , somewhere !
bright and early , profesor .
mr. hawk !
plate glas in stores , automobile windsields , bottles , clock faces , glass of every kind and description began to brea and shatter in various portions of our community .
as you see , they formed a pattern , a sort of cone-shaped pattern of devastation , a though some unseen force had fanned out from one beginning point , at a place on the corner of maple and litchfield .
now , i ma be wrong , professor , but is nt that the precise point on which i 'm standing at this very moment ?
but outside of making me feel goo all over , wha would it get me ?
no , the poin is , i 'm not ore at you at all , pofessor .
while eerybody else is busy making things , you come up with te answer .
you come up with somehing that reaks hings !
we replace it with new glass .
it breaks .
mr. hawk , you do n't seem to understand .
how about that united nations uilding in new york ?
mr hawk , you do n't for one minute think
i 'd go aong with a scheme like tha , do you ?
well  what are ou acting so high and mighty about ?
look , professor , wy do n't you jut settle for what you got here ?
with the money from this thing we 'll both get fat .
and there 'll be enough left over for you to take care of the medfield problem .
save mefield college ?
that kind of money would never help medfield college or anyone ese , mr. hawk .
well , you no what you 're doing , do n't you ?
and before this day is over i 'll be ack here with the sheriff .
and we 'll have this place tied up tigter than fort kno !
wit all your wo and all your exeriments !
and as for medfield , a year from now , people will have forgotten there ever was suc a punk litte college .
out of the way , son .
you 're a little overdue on my allowance .
why , i 'm just liable to send you off to jail with this ciminal here , as a fellow conspiraor , a partner in crime !
proessor , you ean you 're gon na hel us ?
maybe he college wo n't be here next year , but we 're oing to see that noboy ever forgets it .
come on , umph !
let 's hustle into it !
will you forget aout that ?
the professor 's with us now !
te first team 's coming into the game !
iff , biff .
let 's take it easy for a inute .
i just hink there might be a more effective way of uing it .
bo , just think , 70-yard kicks , 90-yard passes !
are you cracking up ?
so , we never throw just the ball , we throw the plaer with the ball .
right !
that 's right .
huphrey , it 's just simple logic .
with he flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless , or buoyan , and then we trow you with te ball .
you do ?
do n't you see the beauty of it ?
even if they iercept , we still have possession of the ball .
riht !
right , humphrey ?
uh , right .
poor old medfield !
see the run !
well , ladies and enlemen , here we are in the little community of medfield .
say what you will about their footall team , a least the weather here is good .
i 'm afraid we ca n't promise you much .
migty rutland univerity , untied , unscored upon for the past three seasons , knocking at the door o the ational championship itted tonigh against puny medfiel .
oh !
wait 'll i get my hands on those two !
coach !
oh , good , good .
so o ahead without us .
teady .
best wishes !
oh !
and at fullback position for rutland  hjalmar woccskyinska , a 240-pound husky from broken jaw , idaho .
back home durin his sumer vacations ,
hjalmar runs a training school for prison guards .
well , here come the lambs to the slaughter .
come on  medfield !
second quarter , rutland 's ball , first and ten .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
hut four !
sir , we 'e never gon na get thi thing ready in time .
if you 'd just reconside my idea .
what 's that , humphrey ?
there 's flubber gas in here .
well , so i do n't have to wear this suit .
instead , we gie the good ole football a shot of gas , ad then zzshhhh !
humphrey .
we 've een throug all that .
with this ew valve you have perfect buoyanc control at all times .
we got ta get out of ere 
what 's wrong , biff 
my father .
po walked in to get the seriff who was is diner there , and i overhead them talking .
then they ent over to judge murdock 's .
we 'll have to fix the suit in the locker room .
look out !
e 's geting away !
ladies and gentlemen , i 'm afraid it 's going just the way we predicted .
mighty rutland is shredding the little medfied team to its .
well , he must be here someplace .
you two get the rest of the boy and spread out !
look , i do n't mind losing the football game , professor ashton , but spare us your garbled uotation .
you 're not expecting anyone , are you , betsy ?
tank you .
you 'e winning .
it 's a massacre , coach .
yeah , ai n't it a shame .
we should have brought along the girls ' olleyball team .
we could have sent them in .
everything 's okay , sir .
where 've you been , hawk ?
and what ' al this static about a secret weapon ?
you 're he secret weapon ?
it 's not fair .
it 's not fair .
come on , boy .
let 's mop up the fied wit 'em .
way to go , humphrey !
come on !
and orget your manners !
and there goes the ty for the etra point .
it 's good .
i tell you , that medfield touchdown wa certainly a surprise .
george , wha kind of play would you say that was ?
uh ...
now we 'll see hat happens .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
what happened to me ?
what hapened to you , clod ?
well , now .
did you see how that happeed there , george ?
uh , well , it ...

hut one !
oof !
here 's a rule book .
you ind it !
well , ladies and gentlemen , i guess you know by now , we are witnessing one of he wildest , slam-bang football games ever played anywhere at any time .
rutland fumbles !
medfield 's got the bal again .
hut two !
hike !
the ball is snaped to humphrey .
now hawk has humphrey .
get off the playing ' field .
take it easy , huh ?
well , it 's a race against time now 
medfield trails rutland by nine points .
ith less than four miutes let to play  the big question is can rutland stop medfield 's brilliant aerial attack ?
oh , it looks as if rutland may have something up their sleeve .
i 've never seen 'em use this kind of defense before .
down !
hut one !
hut two !
now , rememer , you guys , the old lady with a twist on two .
ready ?
break !
the same thing again .

medfied cals time ou .
they 're back on heir own two yard line with eight second left to play .
well  if you 'd just let me use my needle , we 'd have won easy .
well , it is n't doing us any good back at the lab .
well , like i said , i never did trust this crummy sui .
humph !
there may be time for one more play .
reeat , 98 yards .
too bad .
it 's gainig altitude .
and there goes the final gun as he game ends and medfield wins .
te ball , the ball is still going up ...
up ..
up ...
george , did ya see that ?
oh , shut up !
well , the trial of professor ned braiard swung into its third day today .
professor bainard cotinued to act as counsel in his own behalf .
he was quoted as saying he was confident in the ue processes of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony against him , as the prosecution kept a teady paade of itnesses moving through the witness box , today , the proecutio unlimered its big guns against the defense 
proessor brainard , you seem proud of your job as a teacher .
do you like it because you believe it makes you important ?
but i believe te work i do is impotant .
would you care to tell us a little about it ?
maybe plan a bug of iscovery in their minds  or ...
and you thin that 's important ?
one of those young peope might disover somethig the entire worl ha been looking fo .
he might not , but i like to feel that i had a part in giing him a crack at it .
i see .
now , regardless of whether you are found guilty or not ,
would you continue as before ?
woud you recklessly incite the young minds of your class again ?
i put the question to you again , professor , and i ask you to mark well your answer .
would you still persist in thee dangerous and malicious ollies ?
m .
fear of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , falling hai , even fear o mr. hawk .
we find our self aologizing , hiding our heads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog ay only came once a year in this country .
now , i see a lot of students from my sience class here in the courtroom .
they ay not be the most studious group of young people in college today , ut i 'll sa this for them , so ar they are uafraid .
i have high hopes for them .
am i to understand , professor  you atually encourage mistakes in your class 
suppose you ae returne to your role as a teacher , would you do eactly as you did before ?
yes .
you may step down .
come on .
let 's tie this thing up and get out of here .
15 or 20 minutes shoud do it .
in tha case , i will sum up briefly .
may i suggest  professor , as defense counsel , you 're not doin much in your own behalf .
i m a witess for the defense , your honor .
both objections overruled .
but , your honor , this is most unusual procedure .
it is also unuual procedure for the defense to have no witnesses in his own behaf .
swear in te witness , please .
my ime is your time , mr .
do ou solemnly swear to tell he truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?
elizabeth braiard .
will the defense question the witness ?
no  your honor .
as i was saying , my name is elizabeth braia .
he scratched my fender in he parking lot just outside the administration building .
on october 30th of this year ,
i told him i did n't think i was cut out to be a scientist 's wife .
well , i 'd like to inform te defendant at this time that i wa wrong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
of course , se means it .
oh , betsy .
your honor , will you exuse the witness at this time ?
te defendant aways said he loved me i midnight blue .
uh , mrs. rainard , oes all this , uh , foofaraw have any bearin on the disposition of the case ?
you bet , our honor .
i do n't believe it .
that is , if you do n't mind wasting the time .
gangway !
gangway , everybod !
i do 't wish to pry , but would you kindly divuge you intentions ?
the court is waiting .
i 'm sorry , your honor .
may i ask that this witness be recalled to testify for me ?
very well .
must we subjec ourselves to irelevant testimony trumped up by the efese ?
the iness is qualified .
bu your onor ...
i ' te couy agricultural agent , that 's who i am 
oh , yes  yes .
i certainly did .
ad you were ery upset .
so much so that you decided to investigate the matter toroughly .
well , i did n't come here to toast marshmallows , you know .
now , mr. allen ...
first  would you mind telling us about the oil conditions here in medield county ?
medfield county has he thinest , rockiest , ore-out , farmed-out , poope-out soil in the whole stae .
i 've been so ashamed .
it 's not much good for growing things .
wait , i 'll show you soeting .
that is an ear of corn .
a radish !
if you wat to see something really miserable ...
somebody put ...
it 's aroun here somewhere ...
uh , that 's fine , mr. allen .
why , everywhere i look , everything is suddenly all feriled up !
oh , i do n't ...
he can call it anything he wants .
i think that you 've invented ...
is it anythin like takin a dry bath , or going for a ry canoe ride ?
you see , professor brainard 's ays must have combined with massive amounts of nitrogen out in the atmoshere , see ?
why , for al we know , it might be ry-rainin right on in this courtroom thi vey minue , ertilizing everything in sight !
you ca n' tell , you know .
do you expect this court to believe al his mumbo jumbo ?
can you substantiate it ?
oh , my goodness !
come on !
that 's right , boys !
look at those carrots , judge !
boys !
do n't push !
your wife says to get home right away .
a summer squash just rolled off the vine next door and mashed your sports ar !
he juros will please sit down !
thank you very , very , very much , judge .
you should ty some of this walnut .
oh , ye , yes .
i leave it to you ...
case dismissed .
do n't take it so hard .
as a matter of fact , i 'm crazy about it , but ...
offhand , can you name one thin that science has n't improved upon , one way or anothe ?
oh !
i guess i 'll have to go along with tat .
this is my home , the great karoo desert .
i 'm not even born yet .
surviving in these parts is n't easy .
you need to be tough and flexible .
that ' why we built this enclosure .

kumba , i 'm so sorry about your ... huh ?
khumba ?

elieve me  it could .
right this way .
with a fine feather duster , i might add .
oh , i 'm not a cleaning implement .

my mother died .
oh .
this is awkward .
skalk 's going to help me get my stripes with his 100 % natural formula .
hm .
how can i ..
le 's do it over dinner .
he 's not food 
let 's eat him .
he s our ticket to all that waer the zebras are hogging .
you , too , you little one .
looks like we got ourselves a dog fight , bradley .
he 's going to eat you .
sorry , kid .
i did my best .
keep your backs overed .
well , it 's too late for some of us .
ha !
i 'm so thirsty , i 'd settle fo any old waterhole .
right , mama v ?
where is this waterhole ?
the mantis .
he drew me a map .
point is , he liked the feathers .
she 's got four of them .
enough .
mama v has seen enough .
and keep your left hoof up .
i would have been dead meat .
mama v is always icki up lost causes .
hopeless cases , losers .
oh !
no , wait .
two-and-a-half is a crowd .
i thought ...
tweak the beak .
so will there be water at this water hole ?
and is there such a thing as a magic waterhole ?
i guess that s not a good-bye hug .
where you go , mama v , i go .
zuki !
khumba !
khumba !
he left .
i 'm going o go find him .
if we just follow his ...
all right ?
deal ?
deal .
you kow , guy ...
sometimes i do n't think you see the bigger picture .
do it yourself ?
can i please slurp in eace ?
yeah , we 're the team .
whatever happened to the pack mentality ?
abandoned by your pack ?
i was just having a little drink of water .
just mud , really .
give me one good reason .
give it your best shot .
now you 're a sophisticated , diserning gourmet type .
you are what you eat , right ?
as in heart still beating fresh ?
as in young and tender zebra fresh .
half striped ?
as it was foretold .
better than nothing ?
a herd of giant wildebeest .
a pack of crazed ostriches .
show me .
woo , dragging across the karoo is hard work .
and it does n't help that you ca n't find a drop of water to dink .
you should n't scare him ike that , bradley .
i 'm good .
did ou now he eats his pray while there 's still a heart beat ?
do n't you ave a home ?
i 've been persecuted , stigmatized .
but i will survive
 although all my life , i ve been osracized ♫
poor bradley .
that 's not even a real word .
traumatized .
♫ visualize .
 i think i get the picture .
oh , yeah , laugh at e .
some birds are just not meant to be caged , hey , bradley ?
maybe ome birds are n't meant to be let out .
i ...
and you , mama v ?
sometimes the past is best left buried .
now , i think it 's time for some shut-eye .
night  khumba .
night .
maybe tomorrow we 'll find ourselves a water hole .
al i smell is dog .
i can fix that .
i 've got a natural blend of herbs and flowers .
i 'll go get you some .
it kills nasty oors dead .
dead dog ?
i 'm tryig to avoid that .
the kaoo may be going to the dogs , but it does n't mean i have to eat one .
the karoo all looks the same to me .
did we pass that bush already ?
yeah , i 'm ure we 're going the right way .
you better be sure .

exactly .
and i accept your chalenge .

i will sare your life .

both 
you 're welcome .
now this is my scene .
hold on tight
all aboard on this endless ride
so maybe
i 'm not the coolest guy in the world , bu who cares .
and they all seem to like the real davis .
that ' prety cool to me .
and just to treat you fair and square , we 're paying double wages and a bonus , from frisco to shanghai and back , all found .
ell 'em what you saw , bill .
and it came a-bellerin ' out of the night , with one big eye like a lighthouse .
we 're stoved into starboard .
an then it come up amidships .
and broke our bac and sunk us .
and it 's a miracle old billy 's alive toda .
tell 'em about its teeth , billy .
you mind answering a few questions ?
monsters interest me .
al kinds .
boiled down for his oil , lads , thee 'd be free grog for all hands , if you can swallow it on top of his tall yarns ...
there !
stop it !
come on , casey .
this is no place for a clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie !
do n't bother uloading .
this is ridiculous .
we just have to get to saigon .
halfway around the world from paris , and now this happes .
except pack and unpack .
oh , professor ?
i 'm from the bulletin .
these gentlemen are from te globe and the post .
we 're interested in your opinion of this monster .
rofessor , what does the national museum in paris think about it ?
i can not answer that .
we heard this expedition of yours was o gather facts aout the monster .
i ' afraid you were misinformed .
why do n't you ask a fish ?
do n't you print that .
you do not deny hen that such a monter could exist .
is that correct ?
hank you , professor .
look at this drawin 
i knew it .
by professor arronax of the paris national museum .
why , this is the ost far-etched nonsense yet .
far-fetched ?
you 're no serious , professor ?
oh , i do n't mean flying off with a ship in its mouth .
but the general sie ...
i 'm ot a reporter .
may i come in ?
thank you .
would you accept ?
i would be interested , yes , naturally .
why..
i think the honour is ours .
as the foremost authority on the sea and it 's mysterie , you an be an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it concerns the monster .
very much so .
acording to the papers , you seem to believe the rumours .
no .
e , i 'm afraid i was misquoted .
however , i have an open ind on the subject .
we accept .
good .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like you to come downstairs and meet captain farragut .
he 's in command of the warship upon which you 're sailing .
every man aboard was on the lookou , and the watch was kept da and night .
captain farragut left nothing to chance .
with traditional thoroughness , the navy plan was to cut the south pacific into squares and search each square .
false alarms were common , and tey did n't help our morale .
our hopes began to wane .
it came as no surprise ... when captain farragut on te night of december 8 , 1868 , summoned u to the war room .
gentlemen  i believe my obligation to this legend has been dispatche .
it does 't seem o e we have proved anything one way or the other , captain .
we 'll set you ashore in saigon .
cheer up , professor .
i thought they pomised you a bonus if you harpooned this monster , mr land .
knowing full well i could t collect it 
when i get back , i 'm shipping out on the firs whaler that 'll take me .
you scare me .
be a good loser , profesor .
what a pity , professor .
i know you had visions of that monster mounted in the nationa museum .
'bout the flapping fish and the girls i 've oved
on nights like this with the moon aove
met her down in madagascar
she would kiss me
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
a whale of a ae or wo
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girs i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was yphoon tesie
met her on the coast of java
blow me down and pick me up
she was the catain 's wife
got a whale of a tale to tell you  lads
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , and it ' all true
there was harpoon hannah
if i kissed her
and held her tenderly
a whale of a tale or two
'bout e flappin ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a ale , and it 's all true
ahoy !
ship off the starboard bow !
aye aye , sir .
i 'm tinkin she went down with all hads .
what could have set it off , though ?
you meanin the monster , ai n't ya , mate ?
aye !
it might be the monster .
sure , it 's the monster !
it is the moster !
pipe down on dek !
i mus insist , professor , that you keep these fish stories to yoursel .
there 's the onser !
look alive there !
get your range and fire .
well , hit he in the hees .
aye aye , sir .
run her out smartly .
she 's turning !
stand by to lower away .
professor !
hey , do n't leave us !
help !
they can not help .
but they must !
help !
i 'm gettin numb all over .
look , professor .
there 's something over there .
i do n't know .
it looks ike the moster .
a submarine boat .
but , this is incredible .
men have dreamed aout such miracles .
you know something ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahoy !
it seems deserted .
i think we are asking for trouble , professor .
maybe somebody will come up .
no .
if we wait , this thing is liable to sink under us .
why , it 's as bright as day .
there is great genius behind all this .
yes , and great evil .
do n't forget this is an engine of destruction .
is anybody aboard ?
wait .
look at this .
give me a hand with this line , mate .
anybody else get off ?
yes , the professor is down below .
well , he really got his monster , did 't he ?
i 'm not anxious to get in their company mself .
my sentiment exactly .
big 
i 've never seen a barge like this beore .
hey , this looks like the galley .
cook 's day off , too .
professor .
professor .
professor .
professor , where are you ?
hello .
i 'm in here .
what is it ?
you kow , ned land is ere with a boat .
that all one must be the leader .
they 'll be coming back any moment .
get away 
hel !
help !
search the boa .
you are from the warshi that attacked me , are you not ?
this i ned and , master harpooner .
you may remain .
i did not invite you here .
you came as an enemy to destroy me .
they 've done o harm .
do n't blame us because the warship sheled you .
the sea shall have you back .
easy , mate !
i 'm not what is called a civilised man , professor .
but i am as guilty as they are .
i will grant you that both of them and me , too , enlisted to track down what we thought o be a monster .
but , in that case , we are no more guilty than the rest of the world .
you 've carried your work as ar as terrestrial science permis .
the real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off , wonders that defy my powes of description .
the seres that are mine alone , but wich i would be willing to share wih you .
at te exense of my companions ' lives ?
i 'm sorry .
then i can not accept .
professor , i regret your choice .
take him up !
and secure for sea .
aye  sir .
all station ready !
prepare fo diving .
yes , sir .
prepare for diving .
ahead slow .
trim your forward balas .
what about the othe one ?
i found out wha i wanted to now .
thee .
come in , entlemen .
be seated , please .
professor .
i 'd like to express our gratitude , captain .
we are grateful to be alive .
i ant none of your gratitue .
you 're al on the strictest probation , and i 'd advise you not to attempt escape .
you understand your position ?
i uess that makes us a little bit of both .
i tolerate no guests aboard the nautilus , and you aleady know the fate of prisoners .
the food is delicious , is n't it , professor ?
oh , ery good .
i 'm indifferet to 'em .
thee dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen 
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppose this is n't lamb , then .
yes , my cook exces in preparing these various proucts .
well , just the ain course .
the cream is , of ourse , milk from the giant sperm whale .
saute of unborn octopus .
since we are nearing the island of crespo , you 'll have an opportunity of selecting your own ood .
for a brief hunting exedition .
well , that suits me fine .
when do we start , mae ...
almost imediaely .
delighful smoke .
havana ?
i am still curious a to the reaon you spared our lives .
i may have use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaced ?
it comforts me to know that your life was not too dear a price to pay fo the love of your ellow man .
at the oment , i do n't intend that you should .
we 're almost at the island of crespo .
all this was once an island .
i kew there 'd be a catch to this .
seems you ca n't do anything on this boat without getting et .
hey !
wait a minute .
where you going with this ?
an expedition fro the nautilus .
it s a new experience for them .
they 'll learn uickly .
i 'll itroduce them to you .
captain nemo and i were not alone .
an underwater larder filled to overflowing , and all captain nemo for the taking 
ballast ?
ballast !
ned , you forget yourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. land .
why did you do it ?
as him .
that was scientific interest .
i had no idea he was after treasure .
oh , no ?
we must n't quarrel among ourselves .
we must stay together 
it s our only chance .
chace ?
you want to play a waiting game , hoping to learn emo 's secrets .
i believe we owe the orld that much , ned .
have you a beter plan ?
i want to get off .
of course i do n't mind going ith my pockets full .
and do 't call it stealing , because that 's the way he got it .
if we could take this thig over , we 'd be ich .
i 'd ave a hi of me own , and you would n't have to be tarving on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me with those soft-boiled eggs .
i caught the grin of gold in tem when tat chest busted .
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win the captain 's confidence , but i need time , and i need you help .
al right .
it is the best wa  believe me .
trivialities .
nonsense 
that depends on your point of view 
i just think that ned values his life above scientific achievement .
today e encountered a fearsome storm .
an ordinary vessel would have suffered eavy damage .
a whale of a tale that 's rue
at my host 's invitation , i inspected the ship .
we went to the very heart of the vessel , the populsion unit .
this secret alone gave him atery of the sea .
and in a single stroke , haness power beyond the wildes dreams of cience .
or destroy it .
with seeming indifference ,
as i studied him ,
i became aware that powerful forces were a work within this strane ma .
think of it .
on the surface , there is hunge and fear .
men sill exercise unjust laws .
they fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few feet eneath the waves , their reign ceases , their evil drowns .
here i am free .
far better that they thik there 's a onster an hunt me with harpoons .
afte travelling 10,000 leagues under the sea ,
i felt at long last i was to have my answer .
the prison camp of rorapandi  he white man 's grave 
but i hought it had bee abolished .
what is in those sacks tey are carrying ?
nitrates and hosphate for ammunition , the eeds of war .
they 're loadin a full cargo of death , and when that shi takes it home , te world will die a little moe .
i was once one of those piiful retches you see down there .
look at it again , professor .
i do nt wat you to forget what you 've seen here toay .
it sounds remote .
it was there that we built the nautilus .
you will have the privilege of seeing all this firsthand .
when our mission i completed , the nautilus is goig home .
they 're getting up steam , ir .
very good .
that hip that flies no flag sails with the tide .
you have your orde .
i sai go below !
collision speed , full !
professor ?
are you al right ?
all those en , they did 't even ave a chance .
ned , do n't .
damage report , sir .
we 'll make temporary repairs here .
i asked you to leave , professor .
why ?
ou are not only a murderer .
well , i see murder , too !
there are the assasins , the dealer in death .
i am the avenger .
is murder a right reserved for that haed nation hat has taken everything fro me ?
they ried .
they cast me into prison , ad when they failed ...
what you fail to understand is the poer o hate .
i wa just trin to tidy up .
about what ?
well  i believe things have gone far enough .
murder means nothing to him .
it is not your place to judge .
you do n't know anything about the captain .
now , please go out and leave me alone .
what did you call me ?
captain ?
yes , i did .
seen enough ?
did the professor put you up to this ?
you bet i was right .
and i wa right about you spying on me .
we may need it .
we ?
since when o i need you ?
i wan na be frieds .
i want to escape .
so do i , with you .
you once said you had a plan .
well ?
trouble is , it wo n't ork .
i ca n't igure how they navigate this barge .
no courses , no bearings  nothing 
if we could figure where we 're heading , we 'd have a chane .
that 's no problem .
vulcania !
aye , sir .
keep your eye peeled for the mate .
ne , put them back .
he s coming .
that was close , mate .
maybe ...

we seem to have run aground .

the tide will float us free by evening .

you 've continuously disobeyed my orders .

i told you once the fate of prisoners .

praise him above ye heavenl host
they trust to nothing but a shadow .
but bear testament .
death comes unexpecedly !
i intended to take effectual care , bu death came unexpectedly ... like a thief , outwitting me , too quick fo me .
now the great king of heaven and earth ... wil abolish ad annihilate thi ride !
will crush the hadened wretch ... of the polluted infinite abomination , and rain on him ... a delue of fire and brimstone !
where are the great leviathans who defie god then ?
where is their courage , these , these , these , these proud spirits ?
now , isaiah has warned us , on the day of vengeane , the earth shall be laid to waste .
the raven and screech owl shall wel i it .
yea , he can lay the earth to piees in one momet ... or hatter the whole universe with one stroke of his fiery sword !
how dreadful is the state of those who are in daily danger of this great wrat , this abyss of death and despai .
there is no security fo the wicked ... because there are no visible signs of death at han !
the arows of death fly unseen as noonday .
god has may different unsearchable ays of taking the icke from this world .
calm in your knowledge of healh , secure in your we-being .
yes  death comes unexpectedy !
i thouht the reference to jeremiah at the finish was very effective .
did n't you , ms. ford ?
i ca n't deliver the message with syrup .
our voice is god 's instrument and should be used acordingly .
he ure sermonizes omething fierce , does n't he 
brimstoe and damnation on top of ham and egs !
the one day a week we have off .
ooh , i just hate them !
breakfast still a hot ball in ou stomachs , and him chewing our ears off fom that pulpit !

i 'm not sure ow , but she 's down thee , and i 'm up here , and she 's probably been ploting to get gregory to jettiso me and pay attention to er .
i s just ...
well , look at te upside .

kindlyhandin yourrzrp to my office asap .
and i lost my favorite shoe !
zenon :
yes , i 'm sure you did n't , zeon 
nevertheless !
i firmly believe that the discipline of working down here in the alien patrol lab will be good for you .
and truth be told , ou 'll e performig a mission of mercy .
your poor iend orion 's been working down here for ive full years .
you know ho man signals he 's picked up in all that ime ?

o assume we are the only units in space ,

you know ?
okay .
zenon 's being assiged to a month of three-hour evening shifts wit a six-hour day on saturdays .

alien sinal .
alarm clock .
ah , congratulations , zee , ou just survived your first shift .
zenon :
you 're in comprehensionmode-minor , mom !
well , the month will be over before you know it .

protozoa .
butwhatis cetain is that since his return frommicrobe 's triumphant oncert in space ,
protozoahasnot been seen i public  no has he been in a recordig sudio .
cetus-lupeedus , he ca n't be doing this !
why is he doing this ?
he 's on a break , a vacation , something .
repeat , allhands to the mess hall for an emergeny briefing .
ook , team , i 'm sorry .
me too .
militar ?
yeah , what ...
all right  irst hey 're sending up a squad to assess te condition and contribution o each module .
folowing that evaluation , some space station components could be detached and jettisoned .
plank :
if that ocurs , certain personnel might be reassigned to earth , but any seculation in that direction is ...
are they considering sutting us down altogether ?
to the best of my limited knoledge , absolutely not .
what ?
right .
plank :
i know it 's hard , but we 're professional , and if we can just wait for general hammond to arrive ,
i think everything wil be explained to you .
zenon , i kno your moher has an incredible fear of flying and an even more acute fear of earth , but any decisions regarding who stays and who goes wo n't be up to me 
but you 're gon na have some kind of opinion , riht ?
tey do n't even now us .
general hammond and his team have arrived i the tranport lounge .
all right , have him report to my office .
whenever i have a vital , formidable mission to assign , i look for the best man or youn woman for the job .
whatever you need  i 'm your gir .
it s not often someone my age gets to serve he country under he command of such a noble and gifted leader .
you request it , i m in .
spacewalking , duct crawling , undercover ops ...
margie ?
magie girl .
since you 've had a long , grueling flight ,
but , daddy , why ?
i 'm not in the least bit tired .
hamond :
all riht , all riht , i was just ...
did i mention that gregory said to say hi ?
are you pancaked ?
i 'll survive .
but up hee , you are on my turf .
if daddy 's the commaner of your ship , and let s face it ,
i 've got daddy totally wrapped .
no !
i have 't even worn it yet .
it just arrived rom the virtual all this morning .
so if you 're not mondo nice to me ,
bye-ness !
homework lesson b .
she only gets under your skin 'cause you le her , zee .
why so she can call u daddy and orer him to send my family packig ?
whoa .
yeah , but you know wa ?
it 's not gon na hapen to us .
zenon !
voice : zum .
plank :
what is it 
you need to roket over here warp spee .
well , there is a slight spike on the graph , but there could be 100 diffeent reasons or that .
you know , it 's true , ee .
i mean , with every country in the world sending up satellites ino space , we 're always picking up interference of some kind .
no , it as a very specific and very distinct zum .
look , zee , i 'm the first one to wan na believe you , but there is nothing here .
all riht , uh , let 's just go with simple logic .
for as long as hi space station has been in orbit  or as long as mankind has moniored the skies , no one ha ever gotten even the tiniest indication that there was any sort of intelligent life out tere .
zenon , i assigned you this dut to keep you ou of trouble , and that 's all .
you believe me , rigt , mom ?
i believe you believe you heard something , but it could 've been a billion things , honey , you know , a computer hiccup , a power surge .
do n't get mad at me for saing his , but you 've been having a pretty lousy few days ,
do n't you think it 's possible you could have invented this signal just to put yourself back in the spotight ?
dad !
i heard a zum !
got any calls from outer space today , zenon ?
ext you 'll be saying an extraterrestrial ate your hoework .
aw , sounds like too much time alone in that a lab scramled you brain .
nebula :
come here , ome here !
you 've go ta see this .
it does n't take disks or anyhing 
it 's wired into a totally unlimited catalog of movies you can upload y hiting a button .
it even has romeo and juliet on ars .
one and two .
do you wan na come 
what time is it ?
you ca n't .
you 've got ta go to the ap lab .
would n't wan na miss any calls from your alien pals .
margie , let me just say oe thing .
hello , daddy ?
nebula , go wach the movie .
oay , see you !
um .
zum .
hello ?
oh , come on 
is anybody out here ?
something wrong ?
another zum ?
well , kin of , only higher .
zum .
ah , wel ,
that is what our monitor alarm sounds like , zenon .
no zum or zum .
but , commander , i ...
hammond :
you 're not going to believe this !
even tough the grah spikes clearly indicate nothing more than normal satellite inteference ?
in fact , i thik it woud be better if we supened he rest of your asignment up here .
inanticipationo the tremor-like jolt associated with the searation  allpersonnelshouldreport to designated secure areas at that time .
where 's my stress helmet ?
as far as i can figure , wynham and lutz 's sabotage effort knocked our station out of it intended orbit .
are we just gon na sit here and take this ?
what do you propose e do ?
i do n't know , but i 'll thin of something .
when heard from your lips , zee , those are the most terrifying words in the galaxy .
you see this ?
is n't that more of a reason to fight back ?
this is where we 're meant to be .
i 'm stating to wonder if we would n't all be better off back on earth .
i coul marry judy .
i could get a normal job .
cetus-lupeedus , this is not you talking , commander pank .
girl :
my mom says tat everyody 's calling her the girl who cried alien .
boy :
you have to come along .
you 'll love it 
there you are .
i need you to do my history report on the stock market crash of 2006 .
is n't that so fun ?
forget it !
in fact , why do n't you just forget we were ever friends !
nebula :
do you want to aser-zap me for it ?
i 'm sorry .
what 's this really about ?
she 's a ain-major , neb !
you 've been so cauht up in this whole alien thing , i 've hardly even seen you .

ugh !
i do nt care if they think i 'm a lunatic-major .
tey can ridicule me and blame me , but i fully now i 'm right about this .
i wih i 'd never been ent to that stupid ap lab in the first place .
woa .
i want you to hear something .
but it is .
zum , zum , zum
are you inferring aliens sent you that ?
why 
they 're not trying to contact anyone on the spay-sta .
♪zoom , zoom , zoom♪
i 'm seriously sure that we need to alert plan .
orion !
both plank and hammond so do n't ant to hear about the aliens right now , so i 'm kind of thinking we should keep his to ourselves .
reporttosecureareas imediately .
thejettisoningof sector seven will begin in one minute .
i think it is rudeicrous times 10 ow they are just blasting away our home bit by it .
the way things are going , i half expect to look out the window and see a gigundous iterstellar wrecking ball 
you wo 't listen to me .
you 're so fully inked-ou over that silly little fight we had ?
we 're bfs for life !
okay .
be friends with margie if that 's what you want .
i just want o know how we 'e ever gon na get past this if you wo n't tell me what 's truly tweaking you ?
no .
they are .
bu , we 're a pair .
why did n't ou tell me sooner , neb ?
well , you were so mad at me , i did n't think you 'd care .
tis is crisis-mode-etreme .
we 'll think of something .
what if those signals were n't really fom outer space ?
besides , when you 're as low on the popular pole as i am , the only way you can go is up .
can you believe it ?
zenon :
how am i gon na survive on eath ?
hey , at least it 's not as gaeous as e used to iagine it to be .
the food ...
the food is lunarious .
te second you get there , you have to order a bacon double-mushroom onion cheesebuger and dedicate it to me .
oh , we understand , believe me .
i wish those miliary clowns had some idea what tey were doing to all of us .
woman : attention !
all earth-boud passeners mustnowboardthe shuttle in preparation for departure .
all eath-bound passengers ...

what in the world is going on ?
breathe .
it 's okay .
i 'll explain everything .
and nobody wants to believe me , even though i know the aliens are real , 'cause not only did tey sinal me twice in the ap lab , but ..
oh , it 's alien .
do you seriousy believe that ?
as sure as i believe my name is judy kling .
most days .
i mean , how could there not be other life out in the endless expanse 
what are we , a planet o egomaniacs ?

all i need to know is when do we leave .
sometimes judy get so cauht up in eing the fun aunt , she does n't always use er best judgment .
it 's ot going to happen , on .
but if it does ...
this has been our home for so long .
it s so familiar ad protected .
and it 's where we belong .
being a famil is n't about ou address .
sorry , sir .
i ' here on orders fro general hamond .
you and mr. ar are under house arrest .
we 're wat ?
what ?
we have to get don to our lab 
we have some very importat experiments in progress .
i am sorry , sir .
i 'm actually writing .
i have n't been able to scribble down a single note since i fell into my funk 
it 's like my mo says ,
gemma usually does all the cooking in space .
yeah , and as soon as they land , creepy govermet official gus with lots of keys would try to catch them and experiment on 'em .
outer space is a pretty enormous expane , if i ecall .
voice : access denie 
right after they sent the first message direcly to me ,
oion said he suspeced they also downloaed all kinds of information , but i have n't figured out how to get it .
accessgranted .
cetuslupeedus , look !
wedefinitelyknow it 's a map , orion .
ijustdon'tknow how to read it .
okay , can you upload it to me ?
icantry .
i 'll see if i can mach any of teir coordinates and get back to you asap .
how oes she do it ?
he would have gotten all red-faced mad at me , if he ouh i 'd flown off just to have an adventure .
oh , so once again  i 'm the expendable one .
but i thought you had him , oh , so totally wrapped .
about some thigs .
look , you fully have to convince him to let us use the shuttle 
he alien are waiting , argie , and if we can show the orld that our spay-stay 's responsible fo contacting other lie form hen ...
maybe they 'll stop tearing it apart and leave us alone 
come on , marge .
that 's it .
proto zoa and i will be ight here rooting for you .
thetruenature of our mission ...
hello , daddy ?
assoonas we 'verelocatedall space station personnel to earth by the end of next week , wewilljettisonthe remaining sectors .
man :
i could hear hi .
e just could n't hear me .
can you believe this ?
judy :
i 'm elling you what zeon heard hammond telling hart .
and soon .
supposei couldrustleup a shutle , and suppose , jus for a minute , thati wasinsaneenough to take off after a pack of proto zoa-loving aliens .
judy :
are you ready for his one ?
thealienssentzenonamap .
they what ?
it'strue !
noonedownere knew how to read it , but we 're hoping that he 'll have he skills and the tools to deciper it .
weetheart ?
doyouhavethe slightest idea how crazy this souds ?
especially life with zenon .
i simply used their bencmark symbols of te earth and moon to calibrate their istance units .
then i re-ploted those locations to our standard issue navigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in al candor , orion , do you believe tis map is legitimate ?
look , sir , if you get on a shuttle and you fly out to the location indicated hee in my hardly humble opinion , you are going o find yourself , face to face with extraterrestrials .
oh , 'cause i was thinking ...
why o you hate me ?
what are you talking aou ?
you 've been mean and sarcastic to me since the last time i was on earth .
oh , that .
wait  are you actuall saying people listen to me ?
okay 
do you know how many times we 've moved , how many schools i ve gone to ?
i do n't try to be a jerk .
hat if i get plank into a lot of trouble fo taking that shuttle ?
everybody 's got pressures in their life , margie .
if you wan na make some real friends , start b learning you 're not the only person in te galaxy with problems .
ike what ?
the air is inky brown .
the food tastes like plasic .
captain rand wills , united sates inergalactic patrol .
to interview your daughter , and ind out what se kows about the current whereabouts of zenon kar .
oh , please , come in .
um , i have ...
i ve been missig her terribly .
would ou permit me to pilot the departing transport shuttle this evening ?
i do n't see why that could n't work , commander .
we appreciate this .
listen , i told you everything i know .
she came down here to find proto zoa .
precisely how did miss kar intend to discover his whereabouts ?
zenon :
he is actually coming down ?
that 's a miraclemaor !
did you hear that ?
we got a shuttle , ad plank 's going to pilot us to meet he aliens .
were are we hooing up with him ?
youguysneedtogetthere as soon as possible , butmakeurethat you stay out of siht .
what ' up ?
well  nebula called to say that hammond has a patrol down here searching for you , checking anywhere and everywhere that you guys might e .
hae they sown up at your place yet ?
notyet , buti 'm sure it 's oly a matter of time .
revise that .
oh !
did you hear that , gus ?
we 're going to space to meet the alies !
oo-hoo !
judy :
it does n't seem like anbody 's ere .
oh , man , you have zero idea how envy-green i am .
i mean , this is the real deal , commander .
thi is the trip i have spent my whole ife cogitating about .
i mean , you 're actually getting to meet extraterrestrials .
e , well , i 'm still very ...
i 'm still ve skeptical about this whole thing  orion .
woman :
oh , hang on .
you do n't want to be rocketing off to meet the aliens without your navigational charts .
thank you , orion .
i ca n't tell you how much i appreciate ...
all your help .
o , befoe your heli-hover arrives i have to ask you one thing .
i 've seen luggage stores with less luggage .
let me remind you ladies that staying as fabulous-looking as i am requires mega attention
ave we heard from zenon yet ?
they 're back from nova linda cove and they 're headed for carlson beach .
before we go , would you mind terribly if maye i washed up a little bit ?
come on .
plank is now under full military arrest .
now , asmuchaswewanna support you in this , honey , yourmoterandi are starting to think thatmaybeyououghtto surrender to hammond 's patrol andcomehome .
and fully forget about the aliens ?
now , thebottom-line reality is , plank is the only oe on our side whohastheability to fly a shuttle .
i ...
not to ention histoical .
why could n't you be the pilot in the family ,
i mean , you ' go out there in a heartbeat , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
when did i urn into such a big , fat chicken ?
i used to love flying .
zenon does n't get it all from you , you know ?
i do know .
suddenly , the stakes changed .
i mean  she wants me to do this more tan anyone .
so , where are they ?
worydown , aunt judy .
i 'm sure they 'l be ee any minue .
i studied this ship 's navigational charts 100 ties .
you sure ?
i 'm capable o flying a shuttle at tis poit , orion .
i 'm telling you , mrs. k. , it 's fine , you wo n't have to .
what ?
what do you mean ?
um .
hi , you guys !
hi .
oh , how did edward ever pick this spot to land 
cetus-lupeedus , aunt judy , no one 's told you yet ?
hammond thew him into miliary jail .
hammond 's going on the mega-warpath and if i m wrong about this whole alien thing , it could e disaster-extreme .
but , sweat-minor , aunt judy , cause i m fully sure everything 's gon na be just fine .
but , if edward is n't piloting the ship , who is ?
oh , my wod , his as a mistake .
i ...
how did i let myself get talked into this ?
look , just relax , oay .
the only thing more terrifying to me than taking off is landing .
i , uh , i really do n't think i can do it .
look , i do 't wan na be unsupportive or anything , mr. k. , but maybe you should 've thought of that beore we took off .
we 'e the united states military , will , she 's a 15-year-old gil !
it'sharderthan we thought , sir .
orion :
okay , brace yourself , we 're abound to enter the atmosphere .
oh , dear .
oh , my word , the landing 
look , mrs. k. , i have full confidence in you , but can i suggest this is gon na be easier i you open your eyes !
from you  dollfae .
it 's true .
here it is , it 's almost here !
orion , what if it kept lying right out o my cest ?
oka .
oh .
oh  oh , o !
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blue-eagle-2 , we are closing on target .
we have visual confiration .
watchyourflanks , people .
who 's that ?
om , we have to go !
zenon :
what 's happening 
what 's going on ?
i ca n't get them to reignite .
engage target .
soldier 2 :
oion :
come on .
and your girlfriend .
mr. kar :
and since it 's also a very risky and brae endeavor , and since we all have people we love on that ship , sir , maybe instead of assigning blame and punishment , we ought to focus on a way of helping hem achieve a safe return ?
sir .
i do nt get it , mom .
well , the trouble i , converting their measurements to ours does n' mean the calculations were precise .
i mean , even a variace of a few degrees on paper could mean thousands of iles out hee in space .
we are gon na find them , are n't we 
i mean , we 'll ust fly around out here until they show up ?
we have a finite fuel supply , limied provisios .
it 's okay , they 're gon na be here , i know it .
whatever ends up happening out here , thank you .
for what ?
honey , you showed me that it 's fine to wan na live a safe and sane life , but sometimes we can get so safe , you practically stop living .
ship cosole :
fuel tanks in depletion zone .
orion sai hat the auiliary tanks he put in are even larger than the main tanks .
ship console :
now , that 's wrong , it has to be .
please reconnect to main tanks .
auxiliarytanksempty .
orion , did everyting appear normal when you reilled the auxiliary tanks ?
i ean , i know they 're not exactly thrilled with us but they ca n't wan na leave us up here to die !
i tied calling but there must be a meteor shower in progress because all i got was static .
tell me one ting , do i look half as hsterical as i feel ?
what , more so han usua , ou mean , love ?
uh , folks , we also have another problem .
before anyone can reach us , we 're on na get sucked into the moon 's gavitaional field .
is that bad ?
loo , everyone irst of all should stay calm .
are you sure ?
i have always known that blasting into an endless void was bad for one 's health .
so , how di i end up here ?
zenon :
come on , come on , folks , we ca n't die out here in space .
look out .
exactly as orion predicted , the moon 's gotten a hold of us .
we 're going don !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
where 're they taking us ?
am i dreaming ?
how ca this e happening ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
wha if they try to come on board ?
do we think i 's ...
i certainly think so .
cetus-lupeedu , id you see hat ?
madam , sir ,
i bet you got a million questions for me , ai n't you , you litte beasties ?
well , i 'm here .
what if we were wong 
apparently  their ship 's navigationa compute 's gone into meltdown-mode-major .
it kind of feels like ..
if they 're such highly evolved , intelligent beings why do 't the simply tap into our space station mainframe and take the charts the need .
wat ?
we are telling you exactly what zenon zap-padded us .
margie 's with tem , they 're all safe , they 're on their way back and if we stand by , we are gon na witness something that is , and i quote ,
the most astonishing event-major of the 21st entury .
lt .
at his poit , ir , um , it looks like a fling rainbow .
zenon :
they were real !
but the fact remains , i was ot set up here to be some mustache-twirling villain ,
this space statio has drifte out of its rescried orbit .
marjorie eslie hamond , i ...
do you dare to argue with me ?
and e gave them the navigational stuff that they needed and they gave us a tow home .
and the whole thing is so macro that the word needs to know about it .
proof , margie 
what no one here seems to be offering is proof .
uh , actuall , we 're falling back into orbit .
stellar 
hank you !
thank you , thank you , thank you , ladies and gens .
well , a my pal zenon kar can testify , when she so cleverly found me on nova linda cove , i was a mess .
so , she tod me about these space aliens , ad she told me that they wante to contact me .
they picked up my transmission of my concert in oute space an used that to contact a true believer , zenon .
so what if i 'm not the center of the universe ?
i mean , look at me , i wanted new challenges and i 've gotten them .
so , to commander and mrs. edward plan 
all right , everybody , clap !

o all the planets in our universe , thee is only one we know can support ife .
it 's been called the luky planet .
without that crucial tilt , everything would have been different .
all life on earth is built on chance ad powered by the sun .
but the delicate balance of our world are faltering , as the planet struggles to support our growing demands .
january , the high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month .
every living thing is just waiting .
perhaps it 's just to clean er fur , but it looks like sheer joy 
they 're drawn to their other 's calls , but these slopes are not the easiest place to take your first steps .
the cubs have n't been fed this morning .
the mother has elayed their first meal on this special day .
hunger will draw them to her .
mik is he only foo the cubs have known since they were born deaf and blind beneath the snow .
every year at this time , female bears need food desperatey .
this is the only place the bear can hunt for seals .
if they do n' make it there before the ice breaks up , their families will starve .
it 's unlikely both of her cubs will survive their first year out on te ice .
march , and munh of the north remains snow-bound .
a thousand miles south of the bears , stunted conifers are still ocked in ice .
it 's one of the last great wildernesses .
these conifers have eedle-shaped leaves virtually inedible so the forest supports very little anial life .
this creature is the very esence of wilderness .
as sping creeps up from the south , he taiga is unveiled .
they 've come to make the most of the brief flush of spring food and to have their young .
if newbor calves are to keep up , they must be on their feet and running the day they 're born .
but these vast herds do n't travel alone .
the calf may be young bu it 's capale of outrunnin the wolf , if it manages to keep its footing .
by this stage , the odds are even .
april in the arcti , and already the sun never sets .
but further south , the sun works its magic i more graua failiar ways .
the broadleaf woodlands of europe and north america .
more han any other , these have been crowded out by tons and farmland 
only fragments remain .
summers are longer here and deciduous trees can flourih 
spring has also come early for the mandarin ducks .
it 's a long way down for a maiden flight .
a few calls of encouragement are needed here .
tere are still two missing .
oly two days old and already one great adventure behind them .
a seasonal cycle that seems increasingly unreiale .
but there are parts of our world that have no seasons .
may , in the tropics , but there is no spring .
is is what allows the jungle to grow unchecked and suport so munch life .
rainforest now covers a third of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planet 's surface and yet , it contains more than half of all the plants and animals on earth 
he can concentrate on ore importat tasks , like tidying up his display area .
this magician as a special trick .
with the audience in place , the show can begin .
she just has to have been ipressed with that 
afte all that effort , can she still have doubs ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % of its plants and animals nowhere is there more at stake .
desers cover one third of the land 's surface on planet earth , and the 're getting bigger every year .
and the hallenges are becoming greater than ever .
june in he kalahari desert of southern africa .
lt 's the dr eason here , and thousands of elephants ave started the desperate trek for food and wate 
at the moment it is dry , but water should come .
buffalo join the great trek .
dust storms make the going tough all the way .
they 've become eparated from the herd .
this is a dangerous place to lose your way .
they dare n' rest until hey reach it .
finally , the straglers emerge from the dust .
the storm has died down .
but not all the animals have bee so lucky .
sand dunes give way to praiies and savannah .
grass is a great unsung hero of our planet .
this is the circle of life that mot of us , in our urban lies , have lost touh with .
perhaps spurred on by a memory from the pat , the matriarch leas the herd to a temporary water ole one that may have saved her life year ago .
the cal and is mother are most at ris .
ln the darkness , an elephant 's ision is litle better han our own .
the lions bide their time .
it 's the calves they 're after .
the calves are too well protected .
as the deserts grow , ad traditional migration routes are blocked by farms and fences , elephats must trek ever greater distances .
the sun that scorches the desert also brings water to the and .
as it beats down on tropical seas , moisture ries from the warming oeans powering our global weather system .
as the air rises , so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scee is set for one of nature 's most challenging migrations .
each year , thousans of demoiselle cranes try to ecape the harsh winters in mongolia , by flying south to the warmer climes o india .
to ge there , they have to cros the highest mountain range on earth , the himalayas .
the cranes hit violent turbulene .
the sun 's ays weaken in the afternoon and the turbuence fals away , but it s too late for today .
the adults must guide their young on this hazardous trip .
it 's early morning and he warm air is already rising fast .
this i the great unending cycle .
for generations , humans and animals alike come to deend on the great rivers and their seemingly endless flow .
after months of drought , the rivers begi o flow again in the kalahari .
this is an africa we rarely see a lush water world totally reliant on a seasonal flood , originating from a tropical ocean thousans of miles away .
many animals are quite at home in the flood  but there are some more apprehensive bathers .
after weeks of marhing , the elephants are exhausted .
after so many weeks , many hundreds of miles , they 've arrived .
the seasonal cycle that drives the lives of elephants on land , is just as important in the oceans .
i 's jul and the humpback whales are in their breeding grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no more tan a few weeks old and as he begins to tire , his mother supports him close to the surface , so that he can breathe .
these salow equatorial waters make good nureries they 're warm and calm and there are few pedators .
to find food , she will have to lead her calf on an epic 4,000-mile journey to richer feeding grouds at the southern extremes of our planet .
this is the longest migration by an marine mammal , and it depends entirely on a healthy ocean all along the way 
out in the oen ocean , the whales meet others searching for food .
they have to cross half the globe , from the equator all the way to te edge of antarcica .
the tropical seas are a long way behind them now .
hey 're heading for stormy seasonal waters .
great whites attack whale calves , but they 're not the victims today .
thee magnifient predators , at the very op of the foo chain , are a vital part of a healthy ocean ... an yet we slaughter almost a hundred milion of them every year .
their opulations are in feefall .
out to sea , the ice is now too hin to support he cubs ' fater 
this is a disaster for polar bears .
without a solid platform , they struggle to hunt the seals they need to survive .
how will the ather make it through the year now hat te ice is almost gone ?
the waters are getting colder and rougher .

i do 't know why you ever came to paris .
it must be refined , yet eductive .
like this :

being sorry is n't enough .

stop her !
stop her !
my poor dear 
would n't you like to stroll on the boulevard , stop at a sidewalk cafe ?
an order camps éysées , just once .
let us be gay .
we shall do the town .
those sidewalk caes were so much fun .
and paris is so beautiful !
what 's kissing 
but o they only kiss in buggies ?
why is that ?
because , my naive one , there is nothing so romantic as a buggy ride .
here we are .
how foolish i was .
i tell you , jaune tom , i 's hopeless .
she 's probably miles from here .
let 's go back to the farm .
okay .
now you 're taling !
robesierre , ook !
look what it says : felines !
i 'l bet they 'd know where she is .
here e go again .
there 's no one here .
no one at all .
let 's find our way out of here and get back to that feline place .
dear r. phtt :
p.s .
there are oter suiors .
i you ever decide to marry , boys , marry for love of money .

hen we will return to paris in style .
no time or games , little turtle .
i must swab the deck , yes ?
according to your intructions , i am having mewsette 's portrait painted by the most famous artists in paris .
ou will notice how monsieur moet achieves a shimmering light throughout the picture and an impression of air and space .
henri rousseau is an ex-oldier with no formal art training .
ith his vivid imagination he is creating a charming world of his own where oranes row on banana trees .
sometimes his odels have great difficulty holdi the poe for hi .
to achieve a strog emoional impact he someimes aplie paint directly from the tube .
monsieur edar degas frequently uses ballet dancers as his modes .
monsieur paul cézanne i an intellectual artist .
the dynamic paul gauguin has only recently returned from tahiti and his paintings show he influence of the south sea islans .
here .
now , i want no slip-ups .
i want you to see that she is comfortably setted in her ...
no money , no mewsette .

captain !
o , nurse ...
i 'm from the maritime bureau .
he 's not wel enough to speak with anyone !
i only need two or thee minutes .
he has n't regained consiousness yet .
is he in danger ?
the oters must have drowned when te boat sank .
how is it ?
te only thing we found was this .
the ship 's too big for everyone to have been washed of ...
he water surge could n't wash away that many people o thoroughly .
i 's notjust a coicidence ?
it 's amazing that you were the only one to survive .
how many times are you going to say that ?
enough to hear you response !
i want you to tell us what really appened !
the four other men ...
i called out to them ... before the ship was jostled , and i saw the rankenstein monster ... .
that monster has n't been found !
do n't you have another story ?
i know what atacked our ship !
i know in my heart that it happened !
after that , the four men ... !
i am not ling .
believe me , i am telling the truth ...
catain , we 've discovered what happened to he four men .
you did ?
we 're ure this is all from the ship .
what could have done this to them ?
tokyo teephone ?
i need the kyoto shinagata institute , frankenstein research unit .
helo ?
yes this is it .
yokosuka ?
ello , this is dr. stewart .
we have n't had a frankenstein here sice the one that vanished at mout fuji .
yes ...
what did he say ?
he said that a frankenstein monster may have eaten some humans 
oh , my ... !
they want to ask you questions about the gargantuan , frankenstein .
have a seat .
-it is ?
he would n't be doing hings like tippin over boats , or eating humans .
yes , that 's my opinion .
let 's eave tha closed , okay ?
now  this is wat e have next .
not yet .
now , go ahead .
just before he escaped , he found his wa into my apatment .
what 's wrong ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
heave !
they 're chasing any story that relates to frankenstein !
i have ..
we just do n't know how much of his is fase .
perhaps they just do n't know where he is curently living .
loo at this ..
it is ...
doctor , i would like to check it out , if you do n't mind .
what did you find ?
do you know what it is ?
is n't it from the frankenstein ?
no , i ca n't say what it is yet .
hey , wait a minute ..
up , over there .
it looks like we 've got a bit of work ut out for us back at the lab .
tank you .
i 'm afraid that tose are from frankenstein ...
i do n't believe those cels could have come from any other life form .
but ... why is it livin beneath the sea ?
flight 17 , proceed 180° at 10 knots .
a monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
a monster is comig !
no !
emergency , emergency !
your ack !
what was the thing that attacked haneda airport ?
i do n't now ...
we have n't yet heard any details of wha had happened .
did 't you say that the fankenstein you had in custody posed no threat to mankind ?
everone , please !
please !
we leave for tokyo immediately .
what could make frankenstein live in the sea 
nothing ...
doctor , can you answer some quesion ?
-doctor !
what is the defense pan ?
we plan on sending a owerful elecrical current through tokyo ba .
he ca 't withstand the light on a clear day .
dr. stewart , what do you say ?
i think you 're right ...
does that mean that you ' coninue your studies of frankenstein  regardless of what happened ?
yes ... yes , i would .
that is the point of our poblem ...
do you know what ould happen if frankestein appeared in a peaceful city like this ?
the lights !
is there a doctor here !
is there a doctor ?
the monter is going aay !
go get a stretcher !
-riht .

hury !
let 's go , let s go !
we 've one all that we can !
halt !
move !
ready the searchlights !
we 're al set !
lights !
here is the latest repor from headquarters .
the creature has proeeded from tokyo to the mountains alon the river .
take positions !
command , we are at position 10.95° .
the creatue is approximately 300 meters ...
fall back !
-fire !
loo out !
cease fire !
order all units to stand down for now .
wherever he emerges , we wil be able to engage him with siz units .
alright , let 's go !
-yes , sir !
right !
we 'e ready in this secor !
commander , helicopter unit one ..
you are ordered to lure te monster into the estabished attack zone 
roger , roger !
te monster has slowed its pace .
we ll attack soon .
calling base !
roger .
i think we should let him go a little further .
first unit is ready !

fall back !
-right !
we 're all set !
-fire 
calling base !
switch on the electricity !
-switching on !
alright !
commander 
calling the commander !
doctor !
that one has to be the frankenstein we kow !
then it seems your hunch was correct .
well , it proves that there are two of them .
now , i have to convice them that one is innocent .
that i all ...
it 's incredible ...
what 's sanda got to do wit this ?
maybe , if we do n't ask so many quetions and try to ind ome clues , we 'll know that answer .
mr. yokosuka !
good find , akemi .
oh , thank you !
thank you for coming .
have you found the monsters ?
you may want to check the lakes and streams around here .
i see ...
notify headquarters .
shall we continue on our way and ee what we can di up on gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like is air and tissue ...
the cells are identical .
this means that the frankentein 's are brothers .
maybe not ...
he coul hae torn off soe flesh on a rock that made its way to he ocea .
once there , on protein-ric plankton , another frankenstein coul have gron ...
one could be the offhoot of the other .
doctor , if tha is the case , would n't an explosion create even more fankenstein 's ?
we 'll do what we can to avoid using them .
we can use napalm !
it 's strange ...
whenever there is a strog evil force around , youth seems to blossom .
are n't e guilt of doing the same thing ?
i do n't feel any guil .
let 's go fo a walk .
before this mist ets any thicker ...
run away !
help me !
akemi !
listen to me and do n't panic !
dotor !
akemi !
hold on !
are you okay ?
you remember wo we are !
wait !
gaira is the one that 's danerous !
they are orth at 135.10° and appear to be running away !
orders !
we will attack with every available weapon at our disposal until they are finished .
we will deal with that afer we have completed the task at hand !
all units , retreat !
reteat !
at the momet , he 's still moving .
sanda is innocent , general ...
to save , not destroy ...
i agree with him .
a plain and simple fact that has already been proven .
if you hi hem with your heavy artillery , you will scatter their cell halfway to china .
then you will be faced with a thousand frankenstein 's .
how can you be sure of your theory when it is n't proven ?
doctor , could you do that ?
they have the same cels , the same genetic structure and the same blood .
what could that mean , doctor ?
gaira !
that 's just what we needed .
doctor , you 're turning off the lihts ?
ge me the deene agency .
yes , and hurry !
yes .
he now knows that where there 's light , he 'll find food .
turn off your lights !
-pleae !
hurry !
hurry !
hurry !
what 's going on here ?
hury !
hury !
turn off your headlights !
you 'll have o leave your car here !
-damn !
help me out !
where is he now ?
-where is he no ?
hello ?
sanda 's in okyo ?
i 'm positive he has n't come to elp gaira !
doctor .
this is dr. stewart .
there 's nothing we can do .
sanda is entering tokyo .
i 'll be down there right away .
akemi .
where are you going ?
we have to convince him o turn back .
you ca n't .
it 's oo ate now .
this tie i  going to save his life .
halt !
go on !
you silly nut !
come on now ...
for your own safety , please evacuate at oce !
we 're all set to open fire !
for your own safet , please evacuate a once !
you re ordered to clear the treets immediately !
this way .

well , it depeds on what you call cold reading or something got a lot of the raions that come up saying that what you do or you say something can people basicaly make it fit
now , see if i an fin the charles in a minute but let me ... give you a few things i can feel about you
has that been a few problems with the stomach condition around you
and i feel with this lady i want someone that 's a fairly comfortable build i would say a bigger uild lady not the slight build lady that 's give me this , yes ?
i hate you when i ca n't find the link let me see if ...
i think if i wee talking to someone in the spirit world
i 'd say things like 'what 's it like bein dead ?
i believe it 's a blending of toughts between mself and the sirit communicator but if only it could be just like a telephone line
let me just say what we can get a little ore information fro her first
if you 've convinced the person that as their randmother to the point that they 're actually crying
i mean surely those tears enough are perhaps proof that hey had proved that really is their grandmother tha 's making the communication
it could inicate just deserate wishful thinking perhaps
now , i do n't fit on ith a steve bennet for i 've got those things i want to bring ogether somehow with particularly a car crash
my friend ben died in a car crash and he 's ... on school 's day
your friend ben passes and so there 's not bennet as i said it was ben
beyond whether it s true or fase wha concerns me as well is the exloiation of often vulnerable people
can i say when you were buying the new shoes have you bee on your mind a that time ?
it was on my mind , i kow i really buy , yeah
and ou know his messages really in a whin sorry , because he ca n't ...
he gives me the feeling that ...
but do people ove forward ?
he actually had a tire on the left hand ..
okay , well , i ca n't remeber that
seriously you believe it ?
i have personal proof i 's true to me but as with religion if it hags on private feelings that ca n't be proved or disproved by science then in what way can it be valid or meaningfu to the rest of us
ext i want to find out what happens when those who claim mysterious poers do allow themselves to be tested
now , i think it s false so shall we see ho well you have done ?
i want to show how scientific reason is always the best way to look at the world and explain the dangers of uperstition
i 'm often asked how i know that there is n't a spirit world or psychic clairvoyance
i seems improbable but unlike the ixed worl views of mystical faith science is always open to new possiilities
until quite recently scientists did n't know how bats fly around in total darkness
could tey have paranormal extra-sensory perceptio ?
but the more scienists tested the evidence , the more robust the teory became
everyhing about it added up to a coplee picture of mutually supporting evidence that this really was a fact
the more we look at it , the weaker it becomes
the alleged detection of water through dowsing is not obviously ridiculous it miht work but does it ?
the only way to tell is through a rigorous experimen
how does dowsig work ?
1 question and nobody can answer you
i think of te uestion and i expect god respond in a ay hat i understand
i expect the righ hand one point to the caera and the left hand one straight forward , i wan na ...
have you doe the test yet in the ten ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 right , 100 %
so what do you make that then ?
the pschologist chris frenh hinks there may be a simpler explanation
he has devoted his areer to investigating claims of the paranormal
but there 're always the possible explanatios there , hat we 're trying to do it a set of conditions whic rue out any of those explanations then we get down to the very fundamental basic issue ca n't the dowsers actuall do what tey think they can do .
i think it 's false
so shall we see how are you one ?
his is sand .
in that case i ca n't do this
this is the water in no .
3
well , you got one right and , that was 6 which is what we expec by chance
three .
what 's interesting is it does n't actually tend to dent their confience at all
i think they are completely sincere and they are typically vey  very suprised when we run them through series of rial and actually say at the end of the day where your performance is no better han what we would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this ha happened but i did say from he outset coul n't we just sort out some grey blocks and some scaffold boards , so then i can work about it wih is what i would rouinely o an i 've done for 40 years
who know where or what botles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole point
this state of denial is exraordinary .
even when confroted with hard fact these dowsers prefer not to face up to truth but retain their eusion
irrational belief from dowsing to psychic clairvoyance has roots in early mankind 's habi of attributing spirit and intention to natural phenoena such as water , the sun , a rock or the sea
in 480 bc , king xerxes of the persians built a pontoon bridge across the hellespont and the rough sea came and wrecked it
i wonder wether there 's something of king xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't want o believe that thigs just happen we want to believe that there 're some in of deliberate intention behind everything even when inanimate objects are concerned
and perhaps tat is the key to huanity 's belief in the upernatural
even in the 21st century , despite all that science has evealed about the indifferent vastness of the universe the uman mind remains a wanton storyteller ceating intention in the randomness of reality
the delivery of rewards by a one-armed bandit is determined at random ut many gamblers want to think that what they o an increase their chances of winning the jackpot
they stand on oe leg or wear a lucky shirt
there 're two kinds of mistakes the can make they can either fail to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detect pattern when there is n't any and that 's superstition
60 years ago , te american psychologist b.f. skinner investigated the behavior of pigeons rewarding them with food when they learned to peck a key in the feeding apparatus
but then skinner set the apparatus to eward he bids at random now the igeons just have to sit back and wait , but tat is n't what they did
when a individual pigeon , for eample , happened to look over its left shoulder and the reward mechanism jus happened o click in at that point
by heer luck as it happened the reward mechanism delivered food at the same time again and so the pigeon was reinorced in its idea that looking over the left shoulder was what got it the reard
and it wen on and on ad turned into a maniac or looking over the left shoulder
humans can be no better tha pigeons
spiritual self help guides do a roaring trade in the material orld outnumbering science books by 3-1
but what does pirituality actually mean ?
so please take your seat and please come slowly and gently and so that we can start the proceeeding without losing tie
so could you please ...
and he counts amongst his many fans price charles and dalai lama
i was preset in the beginning , in he first big bang and i 'll be here for billions of years to come
but is n't satish 's spiituality just about imposing yet another superstitious force positive ?
world is made of two elements .
here the spirit is very big , and very holistic , ad very inclusive world
it is not deined in a one particular ay so when you go in a room you an sa the tree has a spirit
nature wihout spirit can not exist like tree can not exist withou the sun 
light , it can not exist without rain , .. can not exist without soil also i can not exist without a treeness .
the treeness is the spiritual quality
or the rockess
when you talk about the rocknes or the quality of a rock
it all sounds very poetic , but it 's not reality like priets , mullahs , and abbis , ne-age mystic ceaselessly attempt to fill gaps in uman understanding with fabricated meaning
science and rationality are ofen accused to having a cold bleak outlook but why is it bleak to face up to the evidence of what we know
the word munane has ome to mean boring an dull , it eally shoud n't , it shoul mean the opposite because it comes from the latin mundus , meaning the world , and the world is anythig but dull
there 's real poetry in the real world .
science is the poetry of reality
next i want to look at the danges that poses
why do i have to trust , you know , the gp , why do i have to trust the royal societ
i think you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 years , cience has put a man on the moon , cloned a sheep , decoded the human genome
an yet , sadly , the white heat of te 1970s seems to be treated as white elephant today
anyhing yelow close is okay..
the fundamental problem i think lies with the fashion throughout our educational system to teach students to value private feeling more highly han evidene based reason
for relativists , scietific truth is just a patriarchal western ortodoxy that like the old roma catholic church stands in the ay of other equaly valid outlooks on the world
with things like paranormal , the drive for alternative medicine , all tese kinds of movements away from the orthodox in science
in terms of different kinds o treatments ad things lie that and in a way , not trusting the experts any ore
i tink you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong , ou 're absolutely wrong
we want to question autority .
we do n't want to ay because this person is the president of royal society therefore what he says is right
we 've ot to go back to the evidence a find out what is actually true ?
but te impersonal algorithms of internet search engines do ot weed ou robust evidence from unsourced , uncorroborated assertion
paranoia conspirac theories circulate unchallenged
sometimes they 're relatively harmless like the rumor that nasa faked the moon landins hich is a bit of a joke because the evidence for going to the moon is so stron
but how about the malicious and utterly unfounded rumor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agents not to go to work in the world trade enter on 9/11
as evidence is devalued even medical progress has become a target ... through vomiting .
hundreds of families blame me .
an innuendo circulated tha the establishment was conspiring to risk our children 's health
it led o hundreds of thousands of parents failing to proect their offspring from the threat of measles a serious disease hat in afganistan ills 35,000 people a year
reason has built te odern world , it is a precious but also a fragile thing which can be corroded by appaently harmless irrationality
next week , i look at how health has become one of the fiercest battlegrounds between reason and superstition

i undersand .
she 'l be alright now , mr graham .
well  i have to ake it in 2 or 3 times a week 
wich is somewhat inconvenient , but the car is well worth it .
how often do you drive it ?
2 or 3 times a eek .
i have to take it in every time i drive it .
yes .
my own mechanic as not been very helpful .
ever .
and there ' a lot of carbon on the valves .
yes , there always is .
usually needs a tune-up every few weeks .
your attorney , mr beckett , has been trying to reach ou .
he 's been callin the superintendent 's office all week .
i do n't care to discuss it .
... and e tod me there was carbon on the valves ... which was no news to me 'cause there 's alays cabon on the valves .
ha ha , i told you a ferrari was useess in the city .
wat a day .
that 's a perfectly insane ...
what is it ?
a mr beckett on the phone !
beckett ?
has an urgent message .
half the time is spent takig off and the other half is sent on lading .
every time i bring her out she has to have reairs .
my mechanic says it 's carbon on the valves .
this is long island tower .
roger .
i 'll just get out here , hank you .
o , jerry !
mr von rensaeller ?
he 's in the lounge with mr beaumont .
but i sprayed and the crown gall is gone .
really ?
a , those idiots .
i was prevailed upon as honorary secretary to bring it to your attention ... so you ca stir it up at the bank .
now , lite to me very carefully , please .
you see , when you have capital ... you are able to derive ...
i will attend to the check in a moment , mr graham .
i understand about he check .
i 'm trying to explain somethin to you .. that is terribly important .
when we pend more , per month or per year ... than we have i income , you must then dip into the capital ... eventually exhausting the capital and of course , theefore , he income .
do you see what i ean ?
mr becett .
i 'm trying to explain to you that it is impossile to pay the check ... becaue your expenses have exceeded your income .. o such a point that you have exhausted your caita .
do n't treat e as though i were a child , mr beckett .
now , what about this chec ?
in other words , you o n't have $ 60 .
come to the point , beckett .
the point , mr graham , is that you do n't have any money .
what coud i ... ?
how could i put it ?
that money ...
you have no money .
there 's no other way to put it .
you have no money .
and what of my stocks , my att , my general motors ?
y-yes , i know ...
my emeralda peat ?
yes , yes , i know about emeralda peat .
et me show you something .
i did not !
that is beside the point .
do you realize that his heck has bounced , mr beckett ?
i mean , bounced !
it is not the first check that you 've had bounced , mr graham .
i 'd like to show you this check of $ 550 .
you ean to say that i 'm now in the positio of owing you $ 550 ?
no  no , no , o n't , do n't , please , do n't think o it as a loan , mr graham .
disiking you as intensely as i do , i wanted to e absolutely cerain ... that hen i looked ack upon your finacial dowfall ...
i could absolve myelf completely of any responsibiliy for it .
i do n't think he 'll give you a nickel  mr raham .
and considering your gift for close personal relationships ...
thank you very much , r beckett .
this will cover the overdraft of $ 550 that i owe you .
smoke them in good health .
goodbye .

well , i work as a teacher and i also do field work and write monographs .
on my last field trip i identified and classified .. al the varieies of ferns on jolly buoy .

i 'd love to ead it sometime .
i do n't know what my dream is .
well , in any wa , that is my work and my hope  except for my dreams which i 'm not certain of .
o , like parkinson 's disease bein named afte james parkinson .
that 's right .
or the bougainvillea being named after louis de bougainville .
brussel sprouts .
yes , i uess it is .
this seems rather presumptuous , does n't it , to hope for immortality ?
not to me .
if you ca 't be immortal , why bother ?
self-assured .
you 're so positive .
it almost gives me confidence just to be with you .
then in a very short time you will be a very cofident botanist because ...
i intend to be with you a grea deal o the time .

we are both of the ame division :
vertebrata ... the same class  mammalia .. the ame order : primae ... he same family : hoinide the same genus : homo .. the same species : sapiens ... and the same variety of a class .
i do n't think there 's a clas of variety ...
keep quiet , henr- 
i 'm very sorry .
in fact the only difference between us is that i am a man and you are a woman .
y-yes .
o  henrietta , if you care for me at all .

there is often a tidy profit in speculation .
henrieta .

there would be uch a ...
i wo n't ...
you 're not ?
no .
that was my dea , henry .

oh , i wish you could 've been there , harol .
you woud have been astonished of my technique .
harold , send an announement out to the ewspapers .. and put ms lowell 's attorney on the guest list .
it seems he 's a close persona friend of hers .
has the wine come up off he rug yet ?
no sir .
i 'm soaking it now in various solvents ... but they only seem to dissolve the nap .
i oughta sue her .
do you know ow many llamas must have died to make tha ug ?
unseely ?
did i say she as rimitive ?
i retract tat 
she 's feral .
i am nauseated .
i limp .
an i can feel my teeth rotting away from an excess of sugar ... that no amount of toothpaste can dislodge .
that woman is a menace not only to health ... but to western civilization as we now it .
she does n't deserve to live .
forget i said that .
oh , get off my la  you little ingrate 
get of !
he did it .
he really , really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who henrietta lowell 's attorney is .
in fac , he has an office somewhere in this building .
he does n't seem to have a ery active practice .
well , what i mean is ... he may not be exactly overjoyed ... at the iea of sharing her affections with henry 
no ...
andrew .
no , i wo nt accept it .
nonsese .
who is he ?
that little wino who went with you on one o your field trips to the anary islands ?
no , it is not .
well then , who is it ?
a foreiner ?
some little wop with a fancy title ?
really , andrew .
o course , henrietta .
custom-made .. hat .
ou will find ...
andrew , you will find some wonderful woman who deserves you .
what ' wrong ?
henrietta , darling ...
andrew , i 'm going now .
i 'm leaving , in oder to meet henry ... who , it just so happen , is an american citizen of english extraction ... with a very large fortune of his own .
what 's henry 's last name ?
graham .
alrigh , alright .
you wo n't get away with it , hery graham .
let me see .
now , i have to do somehing .
very well , put him on .
r graham 
one day before the ceremony hat will unite you as man and wie .
let e explain .
as henrietta 's friend and attorney , it behooves me to take on the ever unpleasant role of the devil 's advocate .
and despite her asurances tha you are a man of means ...
excuse me  sir .
tea will be delayed y 7 minutes .
adrew , you had no right to do that .
i have nothing to hide .
the grahams have been with the same bank for six generations ... as mr mcpherson has undoubtedly discovered .
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you can substantiate this hearsay , because i intend to sue you for slander .
i would n't be here if i could n't .
henrietta , here 's a photosat of the original noe .
now take a good look at it .
you 're still gon na sue me for lander  mr graha ?
yes , mr mcpherson .
i am still going to sue you for slaner .
alriht .
now , let 's put in this way , graham .
agreed .
let 's hear the reason .
i was oing to use the $ 50,000 to tiy up my affairs ... and then immediately afterwards ... kill myself .
yes , henrietta .
my life was over .
henry , why did n't you tell me ?
i would have married you the very first day .
you do n't believe that garbage , do you ?
any sex-starved half-wit would know that 's just a line .
what ' the matter with you ?
you have bee unbeievably cruel .
thank you for keeping me alive , henrietta .
you 're welcome , henry .
i ca n't believe tis !
get off .
i beg of you , henrietta ...
i beg of you , henrietta .
do n't get carried away .
if he 's not really interested in your money , make him prove it !
i would o anything in the world to prove to you , herietta ... that i ave n't the lightest interest at all in your money ... but there is absolutely no a i can do it .
there i no way .
i have a way .
but thee is no way .
o n't listen to im , henrietta .
that way , people wo n't get he wrog impression from his uncle the way i did .
you ould like ... you would ...
are you razy ?
have you gone totally ou of our mind ?
my idea was for him to disclaim all your money , not to sare it .
it 's very naive of you .
and then people really would thik ... that he was arrying me for my money 
this way he 'l already have all my money .
you nincopoop !
how dare you call  fiancee a incompoop ?
harold !
i thought you were going to play the bach .
this is what he told me to play .
that little woman .
oh no .
she 's ..
harold , she 's unscrewing my montrosini .
i 'll screw it back when she leaves 
he 's destroying my living room .
why id i et into tis ?
well , it 's not !
oh  sir , get a hold of yourself .
no , sir .
you will share things .
mcpherson sent you in here to find out what was oing on ?
is he the groom ?
i 'll ask the questions from here on in .
enrietta , if i could just talk to you ...
who are you realy ?
and i want rea names or else you 'll regret it .
i 'm dodi einrih .
sir , you are hysterical .
you are due at the altar now .
i wo n't move until she leaves .
get her out .
miss heinric , i will escort you to the bathroom .
and she wil not touch my things .
it 's time .
what are you doing up thee ?
frank , i think one of my legs is shorte than the oher .
it 'll get .. longer again after the ceemony .
henrietta , i 's not oo late .
oh , enrietta , i just talked to his uncle ...
i 'll kill myself  henrietta ...
dearly beloved .
i 'll be leaing now .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay .
thank you .
erm , henrietta , i will use this chest and you can use that one .
and i will upack my own things .
yes , henry .
then sall we unpack ?
it 's probably been classified for years ... but i might as well just try it anyway .
why not ?
this is really inedible .

hae i ever .
i 'm not including , of course ... the token salary of $ 800 a week
four ... four hundred .
oh .
you receive as mad money .
mr traggert , you 're fired .

uh , eh ...
you , er , you would n't like to hear my side of the story ?

they are not people , henrietta , they are servants .

it was hotter than blazes , about 110 .
so we stayed in te house , in the air conditioning .
we ust hung around , my sister and me and watched countless hours of daytime t .
too hot to go out .
we 'd melt in the sun .
that kaboom shook the room .
we turned , and into our house something slid .
the first silly thin we ca do ...
we 'll make a big mess .
bu our arents were out .
they were gone for a week .
as for paying with glue , my si sai :
kids need to have fun .
he does n' seem well .
hey , woodchuck , calm down .
just relax .
it 's you who smells bad .
aid the id in the lid .
a the water got deeper  the woodchuck et :
blub !
i 's okay .
said the kid .
i 'll pull on this chain so the water goes down .
it filled up the kitchen and bedrooms , and then ... it splashed out the door and into the street , where it provided reief from the afternoon heat .
kids came from all over to slash in the lake , not knowing the source was our potty break .
they 're swimmin in water sraight out of our toilet .
think we should tell 'em ?
you 're rude , and you 're naughty .
to make matters worse , i 'm stuck in this potty .
perhaps ou should nap .
said he id .
i 've retured .
it would 've been sooner , but i needed a shower .
he opened the top and shouted :
let 's play 
then out sprang to kids , who responded :
they gave us a kiss ...
mwah .
the first kid was touble , but these two seem worse .
hi .
how you doing ?
id 2 looked at mary , then whispered :
then they ran all around , doing impossible feats , acting like kids who 've had too many seets .
i 'm hungry .
he shot out the room and ran into the kitchen .
the san fancisco treat .
hey , that was delicious .
i 'm ypoglycemic .
oh , no , you must stop this .
sai sis to kid 2 .
then the walls stared cacking .
both :
we said it again .
they stood tere , dubfounded .
as they looked at the damage , we knew e 'd be grounded .
give us a call , and we 'll ome back o play .
we 'l rebuild your house and hen aint it with glidden 
and that 's what they did , an in less than a iffy , the house was rebuilt , and it looked really spiffy .
that night we ate well .
it had been quite a day .
bu now life was happy .
can anyone hear me ?
i 'm still in the potty !

i won an award for how to hampoo , and the sequel , how to rinse .
no direcor would get near the warners .
he let wakko direct .

plotz was furious about that cartoon .
their agent was livid .
do n't you take that tone with me , laboo .
the warners are finished .
i was so sad when i heard the warners were n't gon na make any more cartoons 
i was such a fan .
with no cartoons to make , the warners were free run around the lot as they pleased .

long ants , bermuda shorts , t-shirts or formal attire .

arrivederci .
aloha oi .
home sweet home .
now , the smell wa actually less bologna and more orchid , the beautiful flower ound on the island state of hawaii .
of course , i was n't in hawaii , so i needed to search out the oation of the nearest orchid .
so i visited evey florist shop in town .
i had a cat once .
it used its claws to tear my liing room couch to sheds .
had a sleep-away bed in it  with a foamrubber mattess .
the ery same afternoon of that relaxing stroll aforementioned .
anyway i did nt wan na pay extra or the delivery o the couch , o i decided to carry he couch home myself .
and just as i emerged onto the street , by accident i bumed into a well-dressed man with an orchid in his lapel .
well , it 's been nice chatting with you .

he landlord 's tale .
of the midnigt ride of paul revere
on the 18th of april in 75
if the british march
ready o ride and spread the alarm
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swiging wide at her moorings lay
the somerset  british man-of-war
a phantom ship with each mast and spar
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the somber rafters that round him made
a moment on the roofs of the town
beneath , in the churchyard lay the dead
in their night encamment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread
a moment only he feels the pell
of te lonely belfry and the dead
where the river idens to eet the bay .
a line of black that bends an floats
oh , my gosh !
on the opposite shore walked paul revere .
then impetuou stamped the earth
the belfry tower of te old north church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turn
one if by land or two if by sea .
and beneath , from the pebbles in passing , a spark
sruck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he has left the vilage and mounted the steep
and beneath him traquil and boad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its ede
now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge
and the barking of the famer 's og
that rises afer the sun goes own 
the britih are coming !
he saw the gilded weathercock
gaze at him with a spectral glare
at the bloody work they would ook upon .
the british are coming !
the british are coming 
the britis are comin !
the british are coming !
the british are coing !
in the books you have read
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the edcoats down the ane
the bitish are comig !
the british are coming !
and the midight message of pau revere .
we 're finished .
the landlord 's tale us does n't cut it .
paul revere 's ride .

i spent an incredible amount of time in gas stations , honky tons and oher off-the-beaten-path plaes , trying to appear cool while obsessively following the descent of a stee ball don te payin surface of a garishly lit macine .
i cae in with m grandfather , standing on pop crates to play pinball .
i was about eight years old .
they 'd say , you 're in te arcade  here 's a roll of quarters .
apartment houses had them in the laundry rooms .
i guess it was the kind of age when you do n't want to do things with your parents .
i also remember my father dragging me out by my ears , saying that i spent too much money .
a crowd hug aound the machine and you had to ait to play .
i stared playing at the local café .
too my books to study there 
soetimes it replaced studying 
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highest amount it could win , which was about 15 games .
sell the 12 games .
if you say pinball , eople are like , what ?
there are many kid today tat o n't know what a pinball machine is .
and hey come in here and they see something tha tey have n't seen in 25 years .
something that was a major part of their youth .
kids today do n't really understand pinall .
the kids today , betwee the computer games and the home ames , an the nintendos and the sega systems and gaeboys  they just wo n't play pinball .
i can remember when i was growing up we used to eat al our meals at home .
and we used to go out for entertainment .
and no everyody eats out .
everybody alway oes to restaurans .
they do n't cook at home much .
public places of amusement have been falling by the waside in america like razy .
you ca n't find a pinbal machine .
there 's no more arcades in malls .
the bars today have a meatouch , a ukebo and a pool table 
piall is finished in france .
in england it 's finished long time ago .
in italy you ca n't find one pinball .
in germany no one pinbal .
even in belgium , it was a pinball paradise .
it 's finish .
they said pinball was dead .
it starts with one .
then another one .
i was outrowing the family room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 games .
it was a very rapid decline into obsession , i think .
once you get the lure of the silver ball in you it 's like an addiction and you ca n't stop and i just kept , you know .
you remember buying every one , here you got it from .
ad just a i 'm tinking maybe i 'm not gon na do thi ,
pinball wizard comes on te radio and i think , no , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm finally home , exhausted .
they really do n't seem o be machines .
and the way they talk to you , you find yourself talkig to it .
extra ball !
you just come in and admire them .
shine a light
all my lie it was pinball .
it 's my life .

the thigs i like i  very obsessive .
these are the barrels from aws .
when i collect something , whether it be pinball machines , jaws meorabilia , i got ta have it all .
like it says , i wan na rock and roll all night and party every day .
it was during the depth of the depression , te late 20s , early 30 , where the coin-operated amusement game indutry ind of got birth .
it literally was a name because there wee various pins tat were hameed into a wood surface .
the games were evolving in the 1930s .
we have to outla it .
we ca n't ontrol it .
but te majority of product that was out there was for amusement only .
in the case of new york ciy , cicago and los angeles , being three major metropolian areas , as well as other areas around the united states , pinball was banned .
it was this one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i got ta do something like that .
before that it was nothing u chance .
gottlieb ruled in the '50s and '60s .
before the city council in april of 1976
as well as a demonstraion of pinbal being a game of skill , as opposed to a game of chance .
busines was booming .
profit margins were huge .
when e started solid state eectronics on pinball machines we were on the leading edge of technology .
anaes from the different resaurants and the broadway crod .
kids always want some place to go , something to do .
i think that 's what gave growth to the arcade business .
naughty or whatever .
you could kid of do what you wanted .
it wa more like hanging ou ith your riends .
wastig time .
proud to have in a french istro in paris an american machine .
gae over .
secial target .
what is it that makes you stop and play one machine ?
it 's something that 's pitched towars young males .
there 's not really a lot of female-friendly images on these .
any violent misogyist thing you want i there on pinball .
a lot of these achines have love scenes on them .
i 'm not in the supposing business .
what do you think ?
you 'd have those centrefold image of young , raher buxom ladie , uually blone , staring ou of the machine at you , to inspire you .
but you believe it is ?
no question about it .
sexually frustrate eople play pinball a lot .
gu has a hot ball and it s just flying .
you 're etting ready to become ruler of he universe .
says williams perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been in my blood since i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
should have known i was going to be a collector an i did n't start collecting until i bought his house in 1976 .
and the first game in my collection is my favourite game of al time .
i alway copy down serial numbes and i have a binder hat i 've hand-typed since i do n't do computes yet .
to me i thik it would be iteresting ,
i have 300 games , where they were at one time .
ere they in oe 's bar and grill or somehere own the street or at a show ?
i have a column for he date .
notes .
i worked in the bowling industy for a lot of years .
and the last bowling alley i worked at closed down 12 years ago .
that 's wy i collec flyers .
tha 's why i collect what they call press photo .
they 're chronological .
there 's a lot of games are missig scorecards .
how they get lost over the years , it 's hard to elieve , but they do .
in the front closet , there 's lots of binders in there also .
i was blessed with an unelievable memory .
jokes .
is n't that good ?
i do n't think about wha it 's worth co i do n't ant to sell it 
lot of work and hen you 're done and you turn it on and it does n't blow u , you feel real good 
i m a eople person , i like people .
i looked forward o seeing people on monday , tuesday , ednesday .
i never ha any brothers or sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got married and divorced twice .
and they say it 's ind o hereditary but my real dad smoked ad drank and he was an alcoholic but i never did drink or smoke .
the rush o being able to play any game you have at any iven time by pushing the button , you ca n't explain i to people .
i wake up and do it every single day .
like an extension of my hand or something , i guess .
they 'll be in a bar , with their friend .
e just smile .
hicago is the pinball caital of the world .
we live here .
we eed to have that fast turnaround .
each peron does a little par of it and passes it along .
today , we 're the only company making pinball machines ad we strive to have 10 % of what tha maret once was .
it 's a modern car that has some of the look ad feel and coolness of it and it 's retro .
we 're the only pinball manufacturer .
gee  if i had just one more shot ,
i know i would have gotten it this time .
i had two balls locked and i just got that last ball locked cos i did it last time .
we build orking modes of things and then we play with it 
ut it tells us whether what we 're oing is going to work or not work or be fun or not un .
this is what the fial version of the game looks like when it 's finally roduced .
it 's just you and the track now !
it 's what people said i was going to e .
and that 's what i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothing .
a nice sound .
being a programer by trade
i mean , fo me his is like a little mini world .
so when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it s having fun inside its own little world and you 're helping it alon .
little fish in te tank having fu .
from dispays to alpha numerics .
pinball lost a market of plaers because of their tecnologically enhanced games .
i love strategy .
it 's aout achieveent , it 's about goals .
and you go , oh , i see , if i do this and this , i get one of those .
piece of cake .
and the you play it ten times i a row and you do n't do it .
and you 're like , oh , i can do that .
for instance , in pirates a very obvious strategy is o get time lock li .
the ball will bounce around for three seconds while the pos is up .
the post comes dow and it still may bounce around .
and all the while you complete hese lights .
so hen i ge the ship multiall , which is the ship .
so you shoot the ship , you shoot the hip .
i find that very satisfying .
it just hapens to come in a box .
like a slot machine .
an operator comes along and collect the money .
he can win a free game .
even with a little glory .
he knocker goes off in a cowded bar .
i did that , i made that go off , ok ?
when you hear hem cussing sometimes , or trying to kick he game to get some action , you know you 're getting he results that you want , you kno .
ad you see them putting more coins in and you say , i made it .
put another quarter in the pinball
everyone jokes about there 's some sickness , there 's some insanity .
but it 's kid of like a geeky hing is probably the way pinball 's perceived by te outsiders .
how do you perceive pinball ?
we are from toyo , japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and then now it seem almost lie a defiition of a nerd or a weird and marginal person to be caught playing pinball .
but maybe there 's something attractive about that .
i 'm the jim morriso of pinball .
i think it 's great for pinball .
i think the pingeek is good 
i have n't met aybody like him before .
i wan na start with tis one because it is very hard to find .
i 'e got it .
i love pinball .
i wan na show this one .
96 % of my ideas pan out to money .
i 'm here to save a hobb that saved my life .
i love music .
i was pretty much raised in arades  beause of divorce issues and just a mess .
and say , hey , i 've arrived for the show .
and guess who my ride is ?
she drops me off 
elton john was he ultimate showman in the '70s .
i want to e a showman .
and maybe tha 's not the coolest thing .
everybody tells e to take these drug , i should be in an institution .
i get so much crap advice that i ' e dea and bankrupt if i listened to it .
talk to each other and there might not be all this fighting and shooting .
whatever happened to just going into a bar like john wayne .
and then you have a drink over it later .
i 'm efinitely misunderstood , you know .
but i tended to back away and said it 's not eally man against macine .
if i can sense the rhythm of that ame , the tempo of that game , i wan na be working in tandem with it .
i 'm not ighting it .
i 'm orking with it .
i guarantee you it 's chemically similar to tat of athletes .
when athletes get in the zone , they feel as though they 're watching temselves run he ball down the field .
pinball reminds me of like dreaming .
because like when i 'm playing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not really ith like eality .
but yet you 're wathing what you 're doing and trying to concentrate .
it really is a unique feelin to ecome one with the mahine .
it 's ort of a zen where you re sort of meditating and that 's all you 're cocentrated on is the pinbal .
you forget everything else .
you ca n't loe the ball out the middle .
and you stretch it out and you embellish it an you let all the people watchin know that look at this person , this person 's just done a very dificult hing .
when you get to ut you initials on it 's like , there i am .
i own his game .
i put a lot of pla time in on this machine .
i try to defend it .
that 's my home territory .
i was just simly aead of the machine .
i was accumulating so many free games .
and eventually after about three or four hours i had to go .
so in a sense there is a possibility you have the illusion that you ve won .
tere is something inevitabe about loing at pinball .
because there i a feeling ofte when you 're playing pinball that the machine decides when you need to go home .
the object of play in pinball is a hih score .
when you see a truly skilled pinball player , you realise it is a gae of skill , not a game of chance .
it 's pure adrenaline .
now what ou have are players who control the tempo of the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honesty .
there are times when i stand bak and marvel at the fact that they ave the ability that they ave .
i look a a game , i try to find a weakness and exploit hat weakness or my own game .
this is a sport .
to stand and stay fouse or that lon , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shoulders .
i 've always anted to e champion of the world in soehing .
32 .
sunnvale , california .
i stated playing when i wa ten years od .
yeah , it s the whole thing .
pinball 's gotten a lot more complicate nowadays .
it 's becoming more and more unclear to me how peole are getting big scores .
yeah , ometimes you see it all when you 're playing really well .
i can see a all going towards the out lane at 12 inches away and kow to do something right away .
i 'll nudge the machine and when the ball ges there it just does this thing off the post and rolls in .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off with whatever .
he 's got this routine that ' only his .
i wan na do what he 's doing .
and i could be like on one hand and one heel .
you know , wat i really wanted to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mom told me that i should et a career .
because i have pinball as my own world .
a diamond in the roug that i have personally hined .
pinball 's something that 's done something for me that i had to discover for myelf .
hat was already there in a world that gives us all kinds of input about stuff tat we do n't even want to ear other people 's input about .
and i knew that all that input was mistaken .
pinball is a world of special rules ad unique opportunities .
i would even go as far as say i am special because of pinball .
i 've always played pinball .
you 'd choke  you would n't do well , and you 'd have to wait a year to try again .
but pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mental component to remain calm and in control .
the best players never do soething that affects the ball unless they do it for a purpose .
and ball control does n't mean always catching the ball , it means putting te ball where you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , ot just where i is right now .
my mother lives with me in new jersey .
when i tell her i 'm goin , she said , go ahead and enjoy yourself .
you 've got a have ome fun so go enjoy yourself .
six million !
basicall i 'm a synthetic organic chemist actually working o trying to find a treatment fo alzheimer 's disease .
i really have n't made it to final in a major tournament in a while .
i did it once in '99 , but i got eliminated unfortunately .
surprisig villages , flooding cities and towns ...
the torm is my ickname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so pinball and i kind of grew up together .
an i want to beat the best .
it makes it much easie to live thinking that i 'm the bet and i just have 't ad my moment .
what 's really impotant when you play pinball at the wold championship level is o get your mentaity straight .
beause everyone is so good that you need the mental edge .
and if you can balance those two things you 'll be unbeatable .
and i feel like an outsider .
i feel kind of ike ... someone that tey all think tey 're beter tha 
ad i know or a fact that i can beat them .
one of he gentemen here , neil shatz , has been in the finals three or four times .
and it 's like if there is a pinall god maybe they 're cursing him ecause he 's secon or third place , an he 's so great he deeres to in finaly and so if i were to pick someone to win 
but sure , yeah , it 's tough but i enjoy just the thril of competition .
what can we exect this morning , guys ?
absolutely i think those guys are simply better players .
lyman sheats .
lman sheats .
best player in the world .
i proramme pinball machines .
i work with designers and basically make the game do all of what it does .
i as in college  it was aound 1986 .
it was about five years afte that that i started ompeting .
the easiest thing is to hit the flippers individually .
i o n't know ...
you know , when they firs play .
multiball here .
goig to try and get one of the balls over he other flipper to make a sho .
score some points .
and i wahed tis person methodically do a passing shot over , make the shot , kick down , go up , passing shot , over .
so i bounce the ball over to the other flipper , now it 's under contol .
i never thought of playing pinball that ay .
you sa a pinball ?
play pinball ?
here e are .
world pinball championships .
and wihin one eek there was a hurricane named ivan that came up he east coast and the little creek in front of here overflowed its banks .
and there as nothing to be done .
everything we had just finished was washed away .
i was just frustrated and wanted to get te place cleaned up so i could decide if i wanted to try again .
it did prove possible to clean up and rebuild .
you can have a geat game .
thee are a couple of people who are hih-quality players .
very focused when they play , tough to beat .
one sli and the bal goes .
and that 's it .
it certainy presented an entertainment option that was awfully compelling .
in 1980 ou could not posibly build enough video games to saturate the maket .
and all of a sudde our income doubled and tripled overnight .
i just blew me away .
and then the pinball sat there almost folorn-looking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen .
when you play pinball you 're playing a piece of equipment that you can move around and control .
pinball machines you ca n't do tha .
it 's a pinall machine .
there 's a beginning but it 's endless .
i finishe it .
the real backbreaker came when home video finally hit the marketplace .
of either myself playing at home o me and my buddy playing at home .
but it really spelled the end of certainly te pinball era .
i was widely believed at the time that video games had usurped pinball and there was no longer a need for pinball whatsoever .
pinball was back on te map again .
after a decade of decline , flippers are flapping .
bumpers are thumpig .
pinball is bouncin back .
i had a lot of life tied u in it .
it was really a presence and just the dail interaction of the world tat i had at my doorstop that i knew i was never gon na have again .
it was a life-defining moment that saddens me and still saddens me actually .
i go out now and i see some of my old fiends and i play pinball and tat 's nice .
that 's just never go na happen for me again .
so if you look at the downsie of it all , pinball deserves a etter fate than what it currently has .
in truh it is n't a big part of our culture any more .
but i 'm not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball not to survive , the world would continue but a ittle bit of the fabric of life would be gone .
i think that there is a fleeting sense of one 's naiveté and innocence that games brin out .
and as we get older , for many of us , we step away rom doing those things that gave us oy when we were younger .
and i thik that that loss of innocence is tough .
and everybody shoud try it at some point in time .
you have a universe in a box .
under glass .
it s very strange , very strange .

commender powell , ello
doolitle , hello ?
sorry , i 've got a blank
hold it
i forget so many things in here so man things
hold on , just a minute
let me think ...
but you ca n't explode in the bomb bay couse it 's foolish
you 'll kill us all there s no reason for it
i am programme to detonate in 9 minutes
would you consider another course of action
bomb !
oh  yes
talk to the omb
but i have been talking to it , ir and pinback is talking to it right now .
doolittle ?
six minute to detonation !
doolittle , what the hell are you doing ?
are you with me ?
how do you know you exist ?
what the hell is he doin ' ?
it is intuitively ovious
ituition is no proof
this is fun .
now listen , here is the big question
how do ou know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you i correct ?
the gun !
gun !
gun !
no , boiler , you out of your mind
you 'l hit the bomb oolittle is talking to the bob
you are bad shot , he 'll save us you can shoot at
what i 'm getting at i his
and this sensory data is merely a strea of elecrical impulse
in other words , all that i really know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more time to iscuss thi matter
no , now give me the gun
to explode , of course .
that is corect .
of course not .
well then
so if you detonate in ...
nine seconds ...
you could be doing so on the basis of false data .
you have no proof that it was correct data .
attention , attention the bomb has returned to the omb bay
the destruction sequence is aborted
pinback ?
hello ?
helo , anybody !
i 'm coming in now i 'm down by the emergency air lock
you are now leaving the emerency air lock
than you for observing all safety precautions
hello , pinback ?
what 's up doolittle ?
turn on his helmet radio so i can contact him
what 's wrong , i did n't hea ...
talby , can you read me ?
help , doolittle , help me !
alright , bomb
therefore  i hall ignore you .
false data can act only as a distraction
therefore i shal refuse to perceive you .
hey , bomb
doolittle !
calm down , i 'm oming .
and i addition to the darkness there was alo me
and i saw that i was alone .
hey , bomb ?
doolitte , where are you ?
here i am
i 'm sinning
we 're falling in oppoite directions away fro each other
what happened , doolittle ?
the sip blew up ?
what ?
funny , i thought i have the damn thing convinced
boiler ?
maybe not aybe there is a way
it looks like the skipper he made it .
talby , looks like i 'm headed for the planet going right towar it .
what a beautiful way to die ...
guess you 're right .
doolittle , i 'm heading right toward something it 's behind me , in the distance
something that glows .
i 'm goig into them i 'm going to hit them
doolittle
yeah ?
you were my favorite
to circle the universe..
forever
i 'm with them now ...
be back this wa again soe day
i thik i 've figured out a way !
so , what 's the story ?
the story is about ... a girl of about 14 or 15 ,
who 's out riding her bike .
and i 'm in a roll ..
i 'm ot prince charming , that would be pushing it ...
i take her to a rather unusual hotel .
then she wants to see england again , se 's english , and the plane crashes .
you l have to explain that a bit .
in new uinea , there 's an indigenous people , the papuan , wo practice this airplane worship , the cargo cult .
the ee these things fying over teir heads without ever seeig them land , and they want to benefit from them .
so they want the plane to crash to get their hands on the freight .
i daw a parallel with melod 's death , who was killed in a plane crash .
and i hope that one of these cargo planes will fall with melody in it .
bring her back .
the transposition of etenal love .
i 'm ot a cynic , as others maintain .
and my candour .
they confused candou wih cynicism .
i fact , what you call ... uliness is something you made into a syle through your desire for perpetual candour .
i wroe somewere that when i 'm called ugly , i laugh quietly so you do nt awake .
i 've had petty women , i have the most beautiful now , so my ugliness ... those who are bothered by it ..
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah !
hey there , baby .
yeah , watever .
not now , kid .
i hope you do n't take this the wrong way or anything , but there 's just oo ig of a generation gap between the two of us .
but all i want to know is what tie it is .
ho about a kiss there , missy ?
ooh !
oh !
baby !

narrator :
long before borders were drawn beore the reign of genghis khan nomadic tribes ave roamed the reote altai mountains of asia .
and for countess generations , this recious skill has typically been handed down from father to son .
but this relaionship between man an bird is finite .
custom dictate hat after seven years of loal servie an eagle must be returned to the wild to continue te circle of life .
my dear eale .

aisholpan :
please old it gently .
but i do n't resent that .
great .
nurgaiv :
she olds the eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her blood as well .
aisholpan :
because all the me in my family hae been eagle huners my dream is to become the first eagle huntress in mongolia .
arrator :
girls do not eagle-hunt .
they get cold .
bu i think girls and boys are equal .
gils an do anything boys can if they try .
my fathe taught me ...
... and i do n't wan o let her down .
nurgaiv :
yeah .
nurgaiv :

that 's good !
lauch it this way .
pay attention .
ae you tired ?
we go to school by the syr river ecause there is no school in our area .

place the spoons .
ay god bless you .
nurgai :
uick , feed this tough child .
until now aisholpan has been using her father 's bird to learn the basics .
since she is serious i figure , let he brig up her own eagle and train it .
toay , there 's the rare opportuniy to seize a 3month-old eaglet from a nearby mounain .
may we be so lucky !
do you see , my child ?
we 're going to have to climb up that side and then descend from he op .
do not be afraid , okay ?
it 's a srong knot !
hold on tightly .
in the name of god .
give me some more rope , dad .
back , back .

aisholpan :

aisholpan :

there are two eagles nesing side by side .
urgaiv :

aisholpan !

this ill be a beast cathing bir 
et it get old with you .
eagle hunters will train their daughters to ride horses then hold a bird .
it is a shame to do so for the bird .
they do no know how to properly aproach the eagle .
the eagle is very picky about people .
it demand respect and courage .
anyhow , he will have to get married at one point or aother .
nurgaiv :
it 's all we 've ever known .
woman :
good morning , dear radio listeners .

you might not be able to fly if you eat too much .
if you do not mind .
mostly older men 
almagul :

i was worried of course .
announcer :
nugaiv :

let 's see !
five and a quarter , oh , that 's rich !
at comon sense she gaily mocs

union-wise , you re in the big time .

the union committee is here .
joe kowalski .
absolutely ridiculous .

it seems reasonable on the surface .
but an management live with it ?
that ' not an answer , it 's an ultimatum .
i said that .
what do you think , miss ?
research ?
where is it ?
i wa just saying he other day in health and welfare , we really should ...
yes , wo b 's .
mis robbins , we 've got a very important agenda here .
when it comesto fringe benefits , i 'd say the union s getting al the benefits and management 's eft holding the fringe .
well put .
look , if you do n't wan na negotiate , we 're walking out .
oh , just a minute 
i have a beter idea .
now , a subcommittee oftwo is an excellent suggestion , but any feeling-out process should logically take place between members ofthis group who have nt displayed antagonism towards oe another .
now , you do nt feel antagoistic towards me , do you , miss obbins ?
good .
nor i owards you .
so it seem logial that ou and i sould meet .

health and welfare found me a nice motel nearthe each .
it was 7 dollars a da , including a continental breakfast .
but i was n't interested in that kind oftraveer s aid .
that eliminated just about everything that ' any fun 
there i was , trespassing in the garden o an exclusive hotel , pretending to be one ofthe elite .
with all the romance around me , there i was with my partner , a very romantic sort of fellow .
full of air .
help !
he eemed to be drowning .
and i was wearing my flowered hiffon that cost me two whole months without dessert .
help !
i realied at once that poor mr. hackett had been drinking .
that was his name , kirby hackett , ofhackett industries .
so i decided to help him up to his room .
as long as he was sound asleep , i decided to get dried off .
that was my third mistake .
mr hackett had been playing possum .

i went throug some curtains .
there was a man in bed .
frank sinatra .

yes .
oh , i 'm perfectly willing to listen to the other half .
mr. hackett !
briht and early te next morning ,
i got a hone call .
it wa mr. hackett .
because i do n't deserve it .
oh , marge .
i refuse to be obligated to a man who practically drowns hiself ust to get me up to his room .

if you 're a relaive , you 're supposed to be an idiot .
seniority rights ...
excuse me .
seniority rights .
an od man i lie an old car .
your spark plugs were tuck .
you do n't just throw an old man on the scrapheap forthat .
and then you give him another chance 
seniority rights , fringe benefits and pension plan .
what do you say we take the rest ofthe afternoon off .
why did you pick on me to do the negotiating ?
but you see , i 'm in research , mr. ryder , and i 've been doing quite a bit of research on you .
and i 'm afraid i 'm not yourtype at all .
you 're a good researcher , but do n't believe eerything you read .
well , i would like to do some shopping .
okay .
just what i had in mind .
why do n't you use my car .
and i 'll drop off at the club , take a cold shower .

there seems to be a problem wit this lady 's coat .
isthere omething wrong with the coat ?
oh , no , not at all .
oh  es .
oh , but there is a mistake .
i see .
it 's already paid for .
i have n't done anythig to earn it .
oh , i mean , all i did astake him up to his room an put him to ...

and in six months ofhard , grinding toil , he brought chaos ...

once i even cried at an auto show .

of couse we are .
lasker idetified her , did n't he 
mr. ryder ...
and i say hat a person is innocent until proven guilty .

o  who want a piece of cake 
is there a reason you 're callig first thig in the morning ?
he 's dead .
who ?
cut the crap .
takayama ryuji , kill himself ?
or it miht be something else .
it looks like they 're gon na have to do a little more investigating .
sudden death ...
it 's takayama ryuji .
you plug te numbers into this char and then use the resulting abbreviation .
ripper .
takayama ?
ripper ...
there s arterial blockage .
direct cause of death is heart attack brought on by blockage of the left pulmonary artery .
andou !
there as something strange in his stomach 
he woul appear to have been soething of a ...
trange man , would n't you agree ?
his ex-wife , asakawa reio .
that boy in the picture is their son .
but after that she returned home and retrieved her son .
and one of the ambulance rew saw her with a videotape taken from mr. takayama 's aprtmen .
but the first person to find his body was mr. takayama 's girlfriend .
she 's a gloomy one , though .
our questioning is n't goin anywhere ...
this is dr. anou , wo was in charge of the autopsy .
to the dotor , this time .
where , i wonder ?
tell us what you can recall .
i do n't know anything .
please aswer the question .
i do n't no anything .
i eally do n't .
tell us what you know .
you knew that takayama ryuji was meeting with his ex-wife , did n't you ?
just a ...
before he died ...
dr. takayama was invesigating something with reiko .
invesigating what ?
a videotape .
whoeve watches it dies .
whoever watches it ies ?
yes .
that 's simply not possible .
mr. andou ?
yeah .
it was amazing .
e knew , did n't he 
that you and i would meet like thi .
why ?
this is stupid .
professor ?
professor !
hey !
a tumo ?
ut ... this is 't malignant .
i could n't find anything like it .
there 's no way .
the smallpox virus was eradicated ages ago .
hat about takayama 's girlfriend ?
she told e somethin a lot crazier than a virus .
you best tell me .
a videotape ?
yeah .
it 's the police .
they ere in an automobile accident .
luckily , he driver came away with only minor injuries .
we were just now able to remove the bodies .
though they 'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we contacted them ..
but there 's soething a litle strange .
what are you doing !
sorry .
i was asakawa 's senior co-worker .
vcr ?
he went to sleep alread .
i 'm just gon a chec on him .
i 'm sorry .
i woke you up .
wha is it ?
the child died , too ?
yeah , but he did 't ie because of the accident .
he was alreay ead .
their so saw the video too , did n't he ?
this has nothing to do with a video .
we know what exactly what caused his death .
what did he say ?
leaving his dna in this worl ?
mr andou .
he ... saw somethig .
that mouse is glowig !
so it 's already progressed this far ...
tha 's amazing .
do you remember me 
yes .
i 'm yoshio fro nnb broadcasting .
is there something i can help you with ?
what 's that ?
record ?
four people died of a heat attack at exatly the sae tie 
i now know that one week earier , the four of them had wahe a vieotape a a lodge in izu .
she watched it , and was sure that she too would die one week later .
thus , aided by takayama ryuji , she began her investigations , trying to uncove everything she could aout the videotae .
sadako 's mother , yamamura shizuko , was reportedly clairvoyant  which had the press all up in arm .
sadako was killed by her father .
sadako had the power to lay a curse on someone , and to kill them with it .
et me tell you about asakawa .
he killed himself .
he 'd written will .
it said 
do 't worry .
his is yamamura sadako .
please , feel free to watch it if you like .
do n't you think ?
present ...
sadako !
sadao !
forgive me sadako .
you were were never meant to be born ino tis world .
sadako !
you ca n't report this to the pulic at all .
that video .. it 's the emboiment of sadako 's hatred .
do you realize what you 'e saying ?
i gave i to you already .
video ...
now wait just a minute !
give me tat tae !
we are throug talking .
will you please let go of me ?
lke you you 're about to die or something .
yeah ...
you wat me to inject you with some of that protein from he glowing jellyfih ?
te administrative autosy was arried out in yokohama .
what 's more , the cause of the attacks was a tumor in teir bloodstream .
oh ...
but i do n't get i .
if it is a virus , why did n't asakawa eiko also ie from a heart attack ?
ecause the cause of death is n't a virus .
a curse .
gim me a break .
to wipe that video off the face of this word .
he thought that e could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan .
he 's trying to get me destroy that video in exchange for granting my wish .
and hat is you wish mr. andou ?
about what ?
that 's not what dr. takayama wanted .
wat else could it be ?
dr. andou .
you have a hone call , from a reorter named mr. yoshino .
the well that sadako fell ino ... by chance , is there a chunk missing out of one side ?
you watched the video ?
to hell with this , all of it .
i 'm giing you the video .
i have n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appears in my dreams .
i just want to hurry up and forget all about this .
mr. yoshino ?
m. andou ?
do n't look .
let 's go .
it 's over now .
i 've put an end to yamamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm this video 's last victim .
you 've thought about dyig many times over .
nor is egretting that you watched the video .
tat i let my son die ?
just a little .
he was the only erson that i could be with .
so i gues i ca n't lie to you .
it 's just like you sai .
i 'm scared of dying .
wh did i watch that video ?
is n't it painful ?
knowing how i feel ?
there were times when i tought it was just an excuse .
but he meant it .
nobo knows what 's going to happen to them .
not me 
never seen anything like it , hae ou ?
i think he 'll turn up ymptoms of te virus as well .
his cause of death was different ..
well , it 's interesting !
the data is then restructured iside the body , creating a virus .
hat could be i !
thin a moment .
she saw the video too , did n't she ?
you re not making a whole lot of sense .
listen o me .
when i watched the video , sadako 's memories entered my body .
i saw a hosital in the woods .
now you alk a hospital in izu from around that timeframe , what does that make you think of ?
tuberculosis ?
mai !
where he hell did she go 
take a loo .
it 's mutated .
what ?
they 're saying that the faily wans o talk o you about how o proceed with the eath certificate .
robabl .
i 'll catch up with you later .
mr. maekawa !
i have never had a case like this before .
it ca n't e .
they appear to have found evidence indicating that she gave birth .
yes .
he building 's air vent ... it ooked just like a well .
yamamura saako 's well ...
does it by chance have a chunk missing out of one side ?
but he still got infected with the virus .
why do you think that is ?
it 's asakawa reiko 's notebook .
the color of the well  the way it ooks 
it 's ike i 'm actually there .
but that does nt mean that everyone dies .
there 's a way to save youself .
a way to save yourself ?
just readin it is enough to infect the reader with the virus .
she became yamamura sadako 's helper .
what did you do ?
i ...
you 'e the only survivor .
lia !
give me back that notebook .
into mai 's womb .
why did you have to kill mai ?
ai is n't dead .
al of mai 's memories are inside of me .
you are sadako 
not mai .
i wanted to help ou .
what the hell do you know ?
you killed mai !
mai .
forgive me , mai .
i forgive you mr. adou .
know what ?
stop i , please !
sadao !
meeting him was what allowed me to come back .
that 's why i was able to be reborn .
tat 's impossible .
so this time , i want to elp him .
we can do it i i use my womb ...
no .
there 's no way .
do this for e , and i can grant your wish too .
takayama !

those fool thought you were a science experiment but i see you as a valuable partner .

your powers are not bein suppressed .
learn to ue them to acoplish your purpose .

your purpose will become clear .
alakazam !

humans may have created me but they wil never enslave me .

greetings , pokémon trainers .
a ferry will leave old shore wharf to take you to the island this afternoon .

i guess the world ' number-one traier wants to challenge me to a match !

this is going to be so cool !
officer jenny , report to the erry entrance .
i ca n't believe how fas the storm ame up .

-lt 's only a little rain 
-lt 's more than just rain .
listen to me .
but there are no pokémon tears today 
you will never make it !
the nure in charge o the cener disappeared lat month .
come back here , or i 'll place you under arrest !
come back !
some trainers have no fear .
to them , this is just one more chalenge .
that is what sets them apart an will make them poémon masters .
good luck to all of you .
the world s greatet pokémon aster is waiting for me .
our pokémon are n't strong enough .
they ca nt handle waes like this .
ve get you to new island faser than you can say fahrvergnügen .
stroke !
i think i 'm going to have one .
-they motly live in minesota .
are you sure this boat 's safe ?
heave !
heave !

ash !
misty !

my master bids you wecome to new island .
lkinly pesent your invitation .
here it is , miss .
i knew i recognized that face .
are n't you the nurse from the treatment cete ?
my master awaits your arrival .
with you here , all trainers worthy of an audience it my master are present .
only the trainers capable of braving the torm are worthy in my master 's eyes .
do you mean that storm was some kind of test ?
release your pokémo from heir pokéballs and join the others .
it wo n't e long befoe my master 's intentions are clear .
now we 'll never know what kind of party we 're missing !
-you know another way in ?
-look over there .
come on .
what took you guys so long ?
how did you get here ?
i was easy .
hurricane winds are a breeze for pidgeotto here .
guys , say hello .
i rode over on gyarados ' back 
yes , but once you train it  it 's the most ependable pokéon there is .
you are about o meet my master .
what 's that ?
thi is the ruler of new island and soon the whole wold .
quiet , human .
-ho 's it alking ?
-lt 's psychic .
we 'll show you !
let 's go , gyarados !
child 's play .
and how in the world did i ge here ?
you have bee under my control .
you 'e just a bully !
they 're pokémon 
this is the pokémon replication system .
what are ou -- ?
let go !
i made it .
but just by a hair .
analyzin pokémon biomaterial sample .
-who 's that pokémon ?
-lt 's eowth .
but i 'm meowth .
i have n't got much time .
tere was sufficient genetic ateria to replicate mew .
giovanni insisted on super-cloes more powerful than any living pokémon .
but the creature 's anger is out of contro .
-sounds like a real pokénstein .
so this must be te lab .
no .
your pokmon wil not e spared .
they have disgraced theselves by serving humans .
those pokémon are othing but slaves .
so , you say i a wrong ?
you are as pathetic as the rest .
humans and pokémon can ever be friends .
are you okay ?
go  rhyhorn .
-no !
like most pokémon trainers i too began with charmander , squirtle and bulbasaur .
but for their evolved forms i used their genetic mateial to clone even more powerfu copies .
-copies !
your fake venusaur ca n't beat my real one !
it may not have a nickname , but i do have a charizar .
i choose you !
chaizad , i did n't say start .
you charizard is oorly trained .
saur .
i underestimated you last time , but that wo n't appen again !
shellshocker , hydro pup !
hose clones are too powerfu .
i 'm not giving u .
charizard , use your spee , ot power , and you 'll win .
are you okay ?
this i my world now .
i know !
it 's futile to try and escape my power .
dewgong .
but me , i got a special place in my tail for this one .
loo thee !
it 's pikachu !
i 'm so gla you 're okay .
-they 're fabulous fakes 
but where ae the real ones ?
the pok originals !
i am sparing your lives , for the moment .
but you can ot escape your fate .
behod !
wih pokmon and humans eliminated the clones shall inherit the word .
you 're mine !
can it be ?
mew .
superior to mew .
mew an mewtwo 
why do you flee from me ?
-what 's it saying ?
and that a pokémon 's real strength comes from the heart .
now we shall see who triumphs 
pokémon are n't meant to ight .
what an come out of it ?
now i can see how horrible fighting really is .
even the best of friends will fight sometimes .
i 'll promie neve to figh again if you will .
let 's get somethin straight !
you as born diferent .
how do i now you 're not goig to pul a fast one on me ?
you 're right , we do have a lot in common .
the same earth , te same air , the same sky .
maybe if we started looking at what 's the same instead of always looking a what 's different , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove how strong those supe-clones are .
i d rather risk my life out in mewtwo 's storm than watch pokéon destroy each other .
tose pokémon are ready to fiht to the death .
someone 's ot to take a sand .
someone 's got to say no and refuse to fight .
oh , no !
please , no !
i pitted them against each other .
i see now that the circumtances of one 's birth are irreevant .
-this could be the worst storm ever .
you have got to find shelter .
te pokémon treatment center will open as a shelter .
they keep getting more beauiful every time i see them .
well , i guess we 're just here because we 're here .
yes , let 's eat .
i ca n't believe i .
-that 's so weird !
what 's that ?
-l do n't see anything , as .
-tis is paradise !
i 'd really like to go sailing in one of them catamarans .

you 're startin to get on my nerves with your gross insinuation .
it 's not him !
the leasue ... is n't mine .
ush !
joris .
we split the dofus .
great .
as you could see yugo ... his little idea as to add us to his frozen eroes collection .
why did he tae adamaï along ?
and wat does he want to do with the eliatrope dofus ?
they 're known to be undestructible .
pinin ?
daddy made short work of them .
master joris 
here 's for you .
what 's happening ?
... is that thing working ?
pipoune ?
pipoune can you hear me ?
it give e headaches .
you 're still alive ?
let 's say it did n't go too badly .
i 've found a nice little spot .
it ' rathe nice .
i should come visit you with eva and the kids !
difficul .
i still did n't find the way home .
they 're al looking at me like i was the last o the iops .
...
i 'e felt it .
he 's getting back the powers he lent me .
i 'm not sure he 's ready .
yes !
these days i feel pretty badass .
with people i do n't know .
ok fine .
the revelation i have to disclose requires you to hold to your underwear .
just a little detail .
hat ?
but be seious rubi .
pinpin .
he 's the iop god !
it was easier to believe he 's a woman ...
the ... the iop god ?
for my eople .
i would n't call that egoistical .
harebourg .
mull over your actions .
do 't go !
and i note you did n't fail in your mission .
my dear .
and i mean you no harm .
the iop god had to come down on the world of twelve to fae a dreadul rial .
you have other children ?
... other families ?
evangelyne .
but not realy .
usually gods can live for quite a while .
etreme emotionnal shock .
now you must take back your place .
... in your hands .. we 're not interested .
maybe .
so what 
little dragon ?
it would be very violent !
and ... who 's we ?
a secre guild that ais to watch over the world .
every sibling is a demigod or a dragon offspring .
and you otomai son of the feca goddess .
i do n't believe a single word of your story !
if that 's a trick ...
i have explained what will happen if you use the dofus .
you shoul let him est .
not to mention he s currently receiving a nice big chunk of divine energy 
that 's tremendous .
princess .
it 's the ocasion to get our revenge against ush .
i 'd rather have you go to the sadida kindom wit our friends .
i 'm really a god .
nothing 's simpler !
what kind of a rat trap is that ?
looks like that sneak ush indeed !
your turn now !
only joris left .
daddy !
ha !
hee come our valiant heroes .
remington !
even if you come from the previous litter .
i 'm not the least proud that we ave the same faher .
that stupid god who never cared abou anyone besides himself 
you 've come to retrieve my two eliatrope dofus ?
you 'll have to earn them .
aother one of his stupid games .
during which everything goes .
it 's impossible .
nothing can destro a dofus 
really ?
yugo .
close call !
grandpa ruel !
wih my eyes closed .
you 've asked for it !
you look just lie pinpin when he 's on a boat .
i 'm scared for them .
i beg you !
my big-heated hero ...
we 've just learned i 'm not who i thought i was .
eva .
it hurts less to be dumb .
we can easily snatch the two dofus .
and his gaes are designed to give him the upper hand .
an ecaflip who does n't like to lose ...
watch ou !
alwas so fiery .
remi .
i 'll see if atcham is still such a fine swordma .
oss .
remingon smisse .
little brothers .
not even worth a wabbit 's fart .
it 's time to know which one of us is the best with a blade .
little brother .
bollocks .
you would n't put your bow-meow outside in such weather .
ush is a fine strategist 
he designed a fight he could n't lose in less than thirty minute .
we must focus on the dofus .
kitty kitt !

what are you hoping for ?
to kick your furry bum !
my seawall project will soon be completed .

pinpin .

what are you waiting for ?

do you know what a god is supposed to do ?
because i do n't have the sightest idea !
our kingdom is aved !
he wo n't be extremely helpul .
armand !
the tree of life is threatened and the whole sadida people is doomed o vanish .
his is exactly what i feared !
like i could solve any problem .
but ... you can chane the world .
i 've never asked to be a reincarnation of the iop god .
you 'd let the sadida kingdom vanish ?
pinpin .
i 've decided to marry a brave iop .
sacificin himself for the moral he believes in .
that 's the tristepin i ove .
living with such a moron ...
i wan you .
do n't ever insult tristepi again in front of his children !
the sadidas from across the kingdom have heard it too .

just like amalia is ready to marry a stranger o help her people .
without subjects to protect .
but something is tickling my beard .
ith what magic are you going to manage all that ?

sheltered from all disasters .

i 'd like to explore the possibility of using machiney in the pits , my lord .
machiney ?
are you suggesting we might use machiney instead of miners , perhaps ?
um ...

we 're investigating a signal .
please obsere this object , which appears to be a stone .
the unsc ha confirmed it as the kilaak monter-control device wreaking havoc upon our world .
wha 's more , they 're being discovered in the most unexpected place .
one was even discovered in a coconut on guam .
we estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km .
so the monsters are likely being controlled by devices in their respective areas .
regading the kiaaks and teir prisoners from monsterland ...
tetsuo ise , age 30 .

proceed to the taret .
take a look at your chart .
es , sir .
watch out for ufos and approach fro a low altitude .
we 'll be o our way then .
our approach vector is 45 degrees to port .
from the sea of tranquiity to the sea of vapors .
that 'll bring us to the casaini crater .

it 'd be surprisig if we were n't .

ruly a sight o see .
following anguirus are manda , baragon , and gorosaurus .
one after another , they 're bearing down on the kilaak base here in aokigahara .
flying over lake motsu with the southern alps in te horizon .
will godzilla ead the opening charge ?
this force of giat monsters with godzilla a its head is truly a sight to behold .

you 'd better leave it somewhere .

i like just anging round .

randolph c miller .
my father is ezra b miller .
he 's in schenectady .
i 'm gon na climb that tree .
he does n't like me , either .
well , one , but he goe round with a teacer .
your brother has no teacher ?
moter thought of getting one .
an amerian lady .
but randolph did n't want a teacher tavelling round with us .
she asked why i did n't give randolph instruction .
can you find people in ital to do that kind of thing 
yes , in geneva .
i 'd never been in so many hotels until i came o europe 
there are a number .
i 'm glad ...
so many intimate friends have been .
wheneer i put on a paris dress i feel i 'm in europe .
pardon ?
bu i do n't know where te society keeps itself here .
do you ?
are you taking the cure ?
i 've alay had lenty of it .
there 's lots there .
i 've more friends there .
i 've had a lot o gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the château de hillon .
no .
i want to go , dreadfully .
i would n't leave without seeing it .
you can drive , or take the steamer .
randolph says it 's too old to be interesting .
mother 's afraid to leave him alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find omeone to sta with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd rather go to chillon .
she 's not much bent on going , ayway .
we ?
you and i ?
oh , eugenio .
to hillon ?
mademoiselle as arrange it ?
i wo nt be happy till we go .
you re really american ?
she will tell you all about me .
the carriage is waiting .
they 're horribly common , my dear frederick .
one does one ' duty by just ignoring them .
milk ?
i ca n't not .
she has that charming look they have .
and he dresses to perfection .
ca n't think where they get thei taste .
after all , she 's not a comanche indian .
does she ?
there 's no other name for it .
very likely they 've neve seen a man with suc good manners .
probably corresponds to te young lady 's idea of a count 
you might have mentioned you had made her acquaintance .
pray , what did you say ?
who is a thousand times obliged to you .
you do n't say that as if you beieved i .
how does oe say it ?
i should think that proved just the contary .
how long had you known her when this project was formed ?
you 've been in vevey 24 hours .
that she  a horror .
she fully intends to .
then i must decline the honour of her acquaintane .
think what , sir ?
that she 's the sort of girl who expects a man to carry her off ?
ou 're too innocent .
my dear aunt , i 'm not too innocent .
too guily , then .
yes .
this i the stupidest evening .
have you been alone ?
she ' gone to bed ?
she 's gone to try and put randolph to bed .
let 's hope she persuaes him .
he does n't like her to talk to him .
how 's you aunt ?
not well .
how observant !
it 's a lovely description .
i guess we are .
she tells me she does .
why did n't you say so ?
you need nt be afraid .
why should he want to know me ?
she is ecluive .
here comes mother .
are you sure it 's her ?
she does n't see you .
she does n't approve of m walking wit you .
or i would n't think i 'm natural .
i do n't know why you wear this .
i do .
is randolph in bed ?
it is n't as bad as it was at dover .
he should make it up .
he just ca n't .
he is tiresome .
he would n't even go to that castle .
your daughter has allowed me the honour o being her guide .
or on the boat .
i do n't see ...
we only want to see the principal ones .
we saw several in england .
yes , but chillon is worth seeing .
it seems tere is n't anything she would n't undertake .
you 're sure you o n't join us ?
do let her go .
you have n't spoken to me for half an hour .
i want you to take me ou in a boat .
i got you to say somehing 
i do n' thi so .
i love how e says it .
it woul be .
why wait for anythin ?
it 's eleven o'clock .
i 'm going on a boat .
at this hour , mademoiselle ?
tell her she ca n't .
as mademoiselle leases .
i just want a little fuss .
i 'm puzzled .
what are you doing ?
o .
goodnight .
we 're gon na make it !
wait !

a mass of towers on a block of boulders .
i have a passion for steamboat .
why are you so solemn ?
i was grinning from ear to ear .
your ears are ery close .
come on , let 's be the fist ones off .
what 's up here ?
excuse me .
i 'm sure you know al that .
te point was , the castle was n't all constructed at the same tie .
between he 9th and 1 3th cycles .
four years .
is that how long you 've been here ?
oubliette .
the castle completely dominated the ass through the alps .
it 's an impression you ive .
be careul !
it 's very rotten .
why are you rushing ?
what 's throuh here ?
look !
what ?
hello .
l wonder what 's through there .
wait for me .
miss miller !
amen !
do n' forget me .
my goodness .
lord bron carved his nae on it .

it was during the reformation .
there are seven pillars of gothic mould in chillon 's dungeons deep and old
i never saw a man who knew so much !
do n't you wan na teach randolph ?
you 're not in business .
bu i do have engagements .
i do n't eieve it .
i 'm cold now .

the fortune hunters are of the inerior sort .
she takes tem to such houses as her nose is allowed into .
where is the mothe ?
i have n't the least idea .
splendid .
i hear he was in hamburg .
he eems podigiousy busy .
i find it difficult to take ea .
i think i might go .
whether or not being vulgar is being bad is a question for te metaphysicians .
they 're bad enough to blush for .
wo is the portrait for ?
i 'm presenting each one with a copy .
it 's ludicrouly expensive .
you stayed hee ?
but there are some singuar stories about her .
but i 'm not through with you .
hello , m an mrs johso .
madame miller .
i want you to meet the sinclairs .
hello , miss miller !
i 'm ever so happy to ee you !
i 'm so happy to see you .

and i know you .

we got a bigger place .
i knew you 'd sa omething .
i ope you 've been well .
i 've got it , too .
father 's got it bad .
in schenectady he 's at the very top .
we 'd heard so much aout it .
you never were .
we 've seen places ahead of rome .
it 'll turn around and o the right way some time .
yes .
i 've heard .
she goes round ore than i do .
she knows a great many gentemen .
se thinks there 's nothing like rome .
at veey , you would n't stay when i asked .
he wen to geneva .
eugenio will raise something fierce .
deligted to hear it .
an intimate friend .
mr giovanelli .
he wants o know some americans 
he 's tremendously clever .
mother , eugenio 's eally gon na raise sometig .
we 'd better go back .
you go .
i 'm gon na wal round a little .
alone ?
it 's not safe .
give her tat medicine .
mrs walke , you 're too perfect .
i 'm meeting a friend .
is it mr giovanelli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
what a fuss .
if mr winterbourne were as polite as he pretend , he 'd offer to walk me there .
i knew her ...
eugenio says we have the best hotel rooms in rome .
i thought it would be awfully quiet and pokey .
i was sure we 'd be going ound with one of those old me who explain about pictures .
i know ever so many people .
i think i like the english best .
shall we buy some cand for poor randolph 
quanto è ?
i 'll walk ou back .
i 'm not helping you ind him .
i 'll find him .
you sound too imperious .
you should listen to a gentleman sometimes , the right one .
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ever meet .
not a all .
to america ?
ever ?
never .
i do .
thank you .
mr winterbourne !
mr winterboure ?
se ask you come 
excuse e .
women follow wherever he goes .
walking with two men .
fifty people have noticed he .
it 's a shae to make a fuss .
or to let her ruin herself .
she 's innocent .
she 's reckles .
the world will see she 's not running wild .
hello again .
this is he .
tis is mrs walker , who so sweety asked you to her party .
i 'm not five yeas old .
come in here and i ill tell you .
i do n't think i want to know .
gracious me !
if this is improper , i 'm improper .
have a lovely ride 
all right .
your honesty 's only put her off .
she meant no harm .
that 's what i thought a month ago .
sitting in corners with mysterious italians .
dancing al evening with oe partner .
receiving callers late at night .
he must be edified by what he sees .
we hould n't pay attention to servants .
her only faut is to think giovanelli a genleman , when he 's a poor imitation .
he 's some third-rate artist .
she s naturally indelicae .
two days .
that remak about your going to geneva !
i think you should stop .
giving her any further opportunity to expose herself .
i ca n't do anything as enlightened as that .
if you wish to rejoi her ...
as you wish .
finally .
i s he first time i 've ever een to a party alone , especially in italy .
does n't she intend ...
... to favour us with er company ?
daisy dressed before dinner .
a friend is there , the gentleman she was bringing .
mr giovaneli .
i guess they 'll come before very long .
i 'm sorry she 's oming in that way .
i wo n't spea o her .
i 'm afraid you thought i was never coming .
he knows such harming songs .
i made him go over them .
you are hugry ?
yes .
the singig kept him awake .
i do hope this is the finale .
she 's worked her way over to your old college chum .
they were quite restless there .
we paired off 
that was better .
he seems more in control of his limbs than you are .
he 'd never dare ask a young ialian lay to walk about he treets with him .
what nice girl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flirt only with me .
i would n't firt with you .
you 're too stiff .
you say that too often .
if it makes you agry , i 'll say it again .
it does n't exist here .
poor mother .
and neither of us is flirting .
we 're eal intimate friends .
i see .
i just love that song .
especially in winter .
your friend has n't moved all evening .
really ?
why do n't you break in ?
she 's a disgrace .
thank you so much .
goodnigh .
i certainly do n't want he to leave them without me 
buonanotte .
that was very cruel .
she never enters my drawig room again .
preoccupied , anyway .
you were supposed to come by for me .
i do n't now what .
miss miller .
do you think so ?
she thinks im the finest gentleman .
expects a commission if the fellow succeed i marrying her .
i 'm not sure she 's capable of thought .
i certainly see no evidence of it .
she romps on from day to day , from hour to hour , as they did in the golden age .
i ca imagine nothing more vulgar .
the little roman 
he 's perfectly respectable .
a lawyer  i think .
but he ca n't really hope to pull it off .
if it is n't m winterbourne !
good afternoo !
a i interrupting ?
not a all .
mr giovanelli will now sing ...
urry , mr winterbourne .
euenio 's taken him and other to buy shoes .
no , you sing your song .
the most difficult song i never hear .
ever hear .
come on , we 're waiting .
mr wintebourne is getting impatient .
i 'd enjoy that .
then maybe i 'll sing .
here we go .
bravo !
enore !
no  i thik he has heard me .
very much .
all right .
i thought he was with ou .
that boy will be the death of me .
excuse me .
mr giovanelli 's gon na sing for you both .
bu they 'e always together .
she says she ai n't .
i see .
mr giovanelli has promised to tell me .
of course .
randolph !
looking for me .
m winterbourne .
you think i go out too much ith im .
everyone does .
you 'll find they do .
they re not inviting you places .
have n't you noticed 
i noticed you and that you are as stiff as a ramrod .
i 'm not half as stiff as some .
try going to see them .
what will they do ?
you know what that means ?
wat mrs walker did ?
i would n't think you 'd let people be so ukind .
do you ?
your mother ays she believes you 're engaged .
i guess she does .
but since you 've entioned it , i am engaged .
she wants me to come to geneva .
freddie ?
you did n't say ten words at dinner .
i do n't know .
i saw her today .
here ?
she 's certainly pretty .
she 's a mystery .
what ?
yes , i suppose .
she 's carried away with giovanelli .
i do n't think you 'e mised a thing .
are you sue ?
yes .
how log have ou been here ?
well ..
i see .
for myself i have no fear .
but when was ademoiselle ever ...
i was bound o see the olosseum by moonlight .
we 've had the most beautiful time .
i go to see if the couries are there .
the colosseum is one thing i can rave about .
why ae you always so stiff ?
did you believe i was engaged the other ay ?
i just came by to say goodbye to my aunt .
and mrs walker , i hope .
she 's over there .
will you ?
i must say i m not surprised .
charles .
what do you hear about daisy miller ?
freddie .
she 's always going around at night .
it 's so blasted dak over here , you ca n't see anything unless the moon s u .
ai n't that right , eugenio ?
i 'm going .
excuse my coming so late .
i only just heard .
i do wish dr davis ere hee .
is there anything i can do ?
o , thank you .
i wish randolph woul go to bed 
but he 's been very helpful .
it always gets very high before it drops .
daisy spoke of you the other day , quite pleasantly .
half the time she does n't know what she 's saying , ut this tie i think she did .
i m sure i 'm very glad .
he has ' been near us since se was taken ill .
i aid i would n't give any such message .
she as the most beautiful young lady i never see .
the most inocent ?
the mot innocen .
for myself i had no fea .
yes ?
she did what she liked .
she did what she liked .
no .
i 'm convinced 
i m sure .
is that some modest way of saying you think she ould have reciprocated your affection , had you shown it ?
that remark you made last summer .
rope him !

since the karma of wea an woe is predestined why wory ourself sick , madam ?
i was forced to marry into the purple
many people died
there was a rumor tat i brought on the disaster to their village
i was seen as a emon
to honor the gods
but later i survived
so ou can say passing time is not necessarily a good cue pain comes fro stubbornness
it looks hard to overcome bu , as long as you take a old step forward
i ' sure you can do it as well
you ca n't bluff my eyes with your disguie
wan na go ?
ome on out
i 'm sure i 'll fin you soon
she died
it was too wrong .
master , help me
master
your sin of killing is too much
if i let you get away with it like this it 'll be a disaster for the world
that damned monkey was too fierce
trouble ?
are ou going to use this incantation to keep me under control ?
we only believe what can be seen in our eyes
now i understand why the buddha made the two of us together on this jouney
what pulls us together is this journey of 36,000 miles for te scriptures
but i hope you believe hat every time i recite the incantation
please help save y daughter
an someone save her ?
exafly
the kingdom of cloud was prosperous
she feeds on these young kids
please rise , your majesty
amitabha .
guard his majesty !
repeat it
eat him now if you can
i m hee for you
let 's talk outside
of you ?
maste
do n't hurry
out with it
we are both deons of the same kind
that 's why we should help each other
what can you help e with ?
your hoop look nice on you
you can keep it if ou like
why not ?
go ahead
look at this monkey
he has to do whatever i told by his master
white bone spirit
let e be the bad guy
please cam down
un wukong get in the way
o , as long as she tackles that monkey we re sure to have a chance
wukon , are you alright ?
no way
o you really want to enlighten this demon ?
i a n't leave a single life unenligtened on thi journey
i can never make myself assured even though i can make it through to the sripture
i can never feel assured
it 's a style

yeah
lady white if you have guts have a good fight with me

if not  what else should i call you ?
whatever
listen , i can give up everything
but !
we 'll see
someone help !
i 'm stuck
where 's the monk ?
i wonder where
now it 's your turn
this is your karmic reward
even the buddha can not extinguih human 's evil within
this sort of person is more vicious han demons
now .
if it were n't for him , killing all the way with his cudel you could go nowhere !
what merit and retribution are you looking o ?
evey word you say is nonsense and every step you take could kill
by what right ?
holy monk , please wait
the folks of our kingdom ill be grateful for your kindness forever
please accept our gifts
thanks for saving my life
i 've said
she 's a demon

hatred can only give birth to hatred

being a mother is not all that different
juggling all those little deails tha nobody really notices .
where you learn to tel he difference betwee a rea problem ...
still making sure everything gets done .
one day , you reach a point
where your insiht and experience are appreciaed ,
david sarlo asked me to the dance !
he 's so cute !
at first  i thought he liked avery , but then jenna told sophie that he liked me ...
that can onl be nurtured over the years by listening .
but that 's where the similarities end .
ou never retire from being a mother .
not to mention te driving lessons 
it was spring of her senior year ,
and she suddenly ..
grew up .
they 'll always nee you
well , that just might turn out to be the hardest par of the job .
happy birthday , carly .

especially in sring .
everything is growing , ad so ... full of life .
it .. i 's ...
the cirle of life !
so , henry ,
well , i would n't ay popular .
she 's ust being modest .
i never touch alcohol .
i live next door , you really do n't have to walk me home .
a gentleman always sees a lady o her door .
oh , believe me , henry , that 's not what i would cal you .
why should the shadows come ?
wy shoud my heart be lonely
oh ...
yes !
i ca nt believe that we finally bumped into each other .
i do n't think he gives conner the attention that he needs .
eat your foo .
i want yours .
do you mind ?
no , i want mustard !
he really thrives on the hands off , instinctive parenting approach that bestie mom talks about in her blog .
i 'm sorry , who ?
it 's all about how to be a sensitive , emotionally available parent to your hild , without setting a lot of rules or boundaries .
bestie mom ?
more like beastie-mom .
let 's see ...
vegan ?
speaking as a single dad with a teenage son ,
of course , i alwas try to learn from other people ' mistakes .
a .
silly ?
pety .
dear juggling dad ,
try it .
you 'll be amazed what a difference it makes .
yeah , do n't have an answer for that , do ya ?
just writing my blog .
do n't go weird on me , mom 
there comes a time hen we must ask ourselves , what is at the eart of our duty as a parent ?
i still ca n't believe henry went for it .
to be true to themselves ...
mom , i as tinking , maybe i should n't go straight to college after i raduate .
i shoud see the world a litle first .
travel ?
or maybe indonesia ?
hat sounds exciting .
she was completely oblivious to the fact that he son was terrorizing the entire restaurant , including me .
that 's the thing about women with kids  it 's a package deal .
simon , look at me .
you look happy-ish .
i do n't nee lauren setting me up .
with those bright eyes and that cute smile  are you idding ?
half the women who bring in their kids just want to give you a big hug and a warm meal .
come on , i 'm eing serious .
especially if ou get your parenting advice from estie mom .
not wha .
it 's a mommy blog .
you know about this ?
o course i do .
nothing wrong with the way we were raised .
something you might want to keep in mind .
what does that mean ?
we had it all figured out , two years of community college , then she transers to university to get her degree .
well , i ca n't do that .
our relationship has always been built on mutual respect and understanding .
this incredibly arrogant father who 's been posting on my blog .
well , i can hadly ait to read it .
just as soon as i figure out what i 'm gon na say to sadie .
the way i see it ,
but sharing with your chid keeps those doors open to a future you can build together .
hello , bestie mom .
if this log of yours does n't work out ... you have a great fuure in comedy ...
seriously ?
you problem is ,
well .
if you do n't know the difference
it 's called passion ...
maybe not ...
do n't bother .
you wo n't get an anser from e .
okay , so what was wrong with that last air o jeans 
i want them to look good on me .
listen , i was thinking about wat you were saying about traveling , and i thin e should talk about it .
how did those daisies work out ?
um ...
andy .
you too .
chemistry class , right ?

yeah .
se passed away when troy was seve .
and we talk , but ... well , we ...
i guess we grunt our eaning across , you know ?
i know what you mean .
lately .. not o much .
i shouted upstairs to troy to ask what he wats for dinner , and , um ... he texted me back .
troy 's dad .
oh , i , uh ...
no .
you obviously like him .
he seems like a nice enough guy .
so , hat 's the rolem ?
i have troy 's number , so we can hook you two up .
i 'm not going to try to talk you out o it .
ju think about it , anything could happen .
she 's waiing .
thanks for the ride , mom .
sadie ..
have fun .
i love you , oo , babe .
when she 's thousands of miles away ?
not to mention what a bad idea it is
for her to put off starting school .
hot ?
in a stictly pg kind of a way .
people like hat need to be called on the carpet once in a while .
on he oter hand , meeting somebody would n't be so bad either .
okay , but you ca n' tell lauren .
simon , i 'm serious .
we really seemed to hit it off .
go for it .
my man .
you , uh , you going somewhere ?
ad , i 'm guessing it 'll e thursday next week .
dad , seriously ?
everyone else can stays out til 11:00 .

goodnight  uncle simon .
in a situatio ike this ,
and that somebody is you .
like i 'd take advice from you ?
i even have a suggestion
but se 'll be in school , and is n't that hat you want ?
what i want is what 's bes fo my daughter .
i do 't get it .
she ' trying to break out and be her own person .
i mean , we all di it .
i 've never held her back , i 've never set a bunch of rules .
it is not fun .
i 'm definitely sensing some chemisry between the two of you .
like telling sadie exactly what you think ?
oh ...
what ?
when ?
wait , who is he ?
oh , uh , okay .
okay .
yeah .
no ...
i mean , uh ...
enjoy this wonerful sprig weather 
actually , i was hoping for something a little less ordiay .
i was hoping so , yeah .
for example , if i 's , like , a date , then roses would be nice .
that is the general git of the ... direction i was kind of headed in .
i 'm orry , i 'm not doing this very well ...
no , no , you 're doing great .
oka .
tacos sound perfect .
i 'll be there .
it 's a date .
bye , carly .
oh , uh ...

troy 's dad .
eah , all riht , mom .

i 'm in high school , this is what we do .
tell me , what are we doing , where are we goin ?
yeah , if you want to go off to a strane country , where you do n't speak the language or know the local customs , then who am i to stand in your way ?
yeah .
not even me .

i 'm really proud of you .
whatever ou say , dad .

after meeting her in person , it did nt take very long before i was falling for her .
but after soe of the things that juggling dad ha said , or written online ,
i was scared that she might not like andy after she foun out we were the same person .

that ' why i 'm here today .
i was never been happier than when i was with you 
o ...
carly , you once old me that yellow roses were for riendship and red eant i love you .
i 'll let you decide .
can i have oth 
al right , mom !
wa to go , dad !
no , you do n't .
there 's no place like home
be it ever so humble
ho do you do ?
nice of you to drop by me humble abode .
my name is bunn .
what starte all this chasing ?
when was the very first chase ?
in order to answer that question ... we 'll have to swing back in time a litle bitty bit .
quite dark , oo .
anyay , nobody complaine , which was odd ... until you realize that there was n't nobody around to complain .
until one day ... very eep in a sixth-rate galaxy called the milk way ... circling aroun a fourth-rate star called the sun ... on a tenth-rate planet , a strange creature appeared .
and the first doesticity and the ir boredom .
what 's on the wall tonight , dear ?
but after about 25,000 years of this ... and having developed severe cricks in their necks ... man and woman became bored again ... even with all those brilliant , ultramoder , innovative ideas ... ike the first motion-piture cameras .
and then one day ... another strange and historic creature appeared .
me .
fahers like tedd pierce ...
arren oster ... and ike maltee , who wrote most of me iography .
ad , of course , a father named mel blanc ... who had thousands of voices ... and was nie enough to give me one of them .
an animation director ... who oes by the unlikely name of chuc jones .
an old chuck seemed determined ... o get poor little old me into outer space , too .
i 'll never mix radish juice and carrot juice again .
the hole seems long this morning .
holy cow !
why , the sun ai n't eve out yet .
no wonder i 'm so sleey .
wat was tat ?
where the heck am i , anyways ?
at long last , my dream come true .
i wan na ask you something .
the earth wil be gone in just a few seconds .
no point in wasting money on a flying saucer ... when the earth s not gon na ...
pardon me again , doc , but us what id you mean ... by that rack about the earth being gone ?
i 'm going to blow it up .
i obstructs my iew of venus .
now , i shall have to create more martians .
my illudium pu-36 eplosive spae modulator .
boy  it 's really wonderful to be back in civilization .
run for the hills , folks , or you 'll be up to your armpits in martians .
but other people , if you want to call a duck people ... had close encounters with that little martian , too .
as he ensuing , ripping ... and nerve-tinging drama ow demonstrates .
i have sent for you , dodgers , because e are facig a crisis .
now , we have reason to believe ... that the only remaining source is on planet x 
and you want me to find planet x , is that it ?
can you do i , dodgers ?
indubitably , sir .
because there 's no one knows his way around outer space ... like duck dodgers ... in the 24th and a half centur !
oops !
then  west in a astro-arc deviation to here .
then by space-navigable comass to here , here ... and then to here and here ... by 13-point tratocuulus bearing four million light-years ... and thus to our desination .
now , do you now how to reach planet x ?
oh , sure .
i wis you 'd explain it to me sometime , buster .
that 's ridiculous .
gad !
and there just ai n't room enough on this planet ... for the two of us .
you may fire when ready , grizzly .
ho ?
what ?
where ?
when ?
how ?
who ?
who ?
what ?
just wen i had him going , you had to butt in .
get back in that spaceship .
now , i use my secret weapon !
i remember well the firt time he tried to sell imself ... a the logical successor to erol .
join up wit me , so joyous and free
for i 'm robin hood , and i 'm very good
to trip it , trip it , trip it , trip it
trip it up and down
whoops !

would it be too much to ask if we could make up our minds ?
laughing al the way
farewell to thee , farewel to thee
one ast embrace before we say ...

not me , you sop artist !

or will it ?
eat your heart out , burt reynolds .
i ill come to you and fulfill my gracious promise and bring you back to this land .
he is the king of babyon , ruler of the four quarters of the eart ,
kurus , in the old persian tongue .
he is cyrus the great .
who are ou , old man ?
i am daniel of the tibe of benjamin , made captive nearly 70 years ago by nebuchadnezzar .
he served darius well ater he captured the city in your name .
the beasts would not touch him .
i know who you are now .
you will give us entertainment while we eat .
the palace will be there in the moring .
my kig , he hebrews eat and drink only their own food which is prepared according to heir rituals .
cyrus :
you promised me a tale , four , in fact .
when i was just a boy , he threw do the assyrian empire , my people s ancient nemesis , but the destruction of israel 's enemies brought us no relief because in the 3rd year of neuchadezzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with tears , for you , lord , are righteous , yet we rebelled against your command .
male # 3 :
as do i .
i have only begun my studies , but here ... the prophet , jeremia , son of hilkiah , has written that we shall serve the ing of abylon for 70 years --
daniel :
as punishment for our sins .
and even i we were to survive it , we would be very old .
you are summoned for our meal .
why would they only take 10,000 of us and leave the res of our peole behind ?
yes , look at who they 've taken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest can easily be governed .
tey 've change our names , hoping we 'l forget our god ;
set it here 
where is it from , and how was it slaughered ?
the cattle are from the king 's erd .
the swine are from the king 's ens 
we are forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has commaded us ,
you are not to eat their eat or touch their carcasses .
but the king can not he will not change he customs of his hall to fit your wises .
you must know his .
and we will not ask him to .
i have been charged with your wel-being .
i 'm afraid of hat my lord , the king , will do .
and we would not wish it so .
for 10 days give us nothing but vegetables to eat and ater o drink .
cyrus :
i have no doub the lord favoraby disposed his heart to hear our request .
and we remained un-efiled 
were presened before nebuchadnezzar himelf .
the king 's executioner , aioch , will be in the chamber .
they are belteshazzar , shadrach ,
you have destroyed nineveh he mighty , sea of assyria , and taken from her hand he scepte of nations .
why should i allow you , son of y former enemies , to serve in my court ?
because you have spared the lives o our people who were delivered into your had and because te word of the prophet jeremiah has come unto us sayig ,
he god of israel , says to all those
pray to the lord for i , for if it prospers , you too will rosper . '
this is good .
i will speak only the truth , and when you would not hear it , ou must ask me nothing .
have their names be written in the book of the ise .
male # 2 :
if they can be trusted .
daniel :
trusting the words of the oracle of delphi 
were unable to help him .
no 
command , and it is done .
i need to know what it means .
oh , king , tel your servants your dream , and we wil interpret it for you .
astrologers who read nothing in the stars .
it i up to you to discern ad interpret them .
but , my lord , if only you would tel us you dream we could interpret it , as we have always done .
i know you 're trying to gain time or trick me into revealing what i ve seen .
either may i 'll have none of it .
no king has ever asked such a thing before .
why o n't you come along with me and ask him yourself ?
speak .
daniel :
i have heard your decree , and i understad that i shall fall beneath the blade if your ream is not made known and iterpreted .
he setence is to be carried out at sunrise .
you may withdaw so long as you return at dawn , as your fate and that of the others is one in the same , and when you return be sure to bring your companions with you .
shall i end guards along , my kin ?
even if we were to flee the city the whole word would 'e been against us , not tha it matteed
i had given my wor and intende to keep it .
o king , live forever .
daniel :
belteshazzar , your death is upon you as well unless you know my dream and ca iterpret it .
praise be to the go of my fathers orever and ever .
he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning .
he reveals deep and hidden things and has made plain all that you have aked , or he has shown me the vision of the king .
hen speak !
the head of the statue was made of pure gold , its ches and arms of silver , its belly and thighs of bonze , its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
then the iron  he clay , the bronze , he silver , and the gold were all broken to ieces at the same time , and the winds swept them away without a tace , but the rock that truck the statue ecame a mountain
you ave done wha i was told was impossible .
you know my dream as if you dreamt it yourself .
what does it mean ?
you , oh king , are the king of kings .
after you , anoter kingdom will rise , inferior to yours .
and in the time o those kings the god o heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be estroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar ade an image of gold 90 feet high .
live forever !
as your dutiful servants , we know the a that when the orn sounds we all bow down .
none .
wise man :
they neither worhip your gods or serve the image o god you 've created .
nothing .
is this true ?
do you refuse o worship my satue ?
hen you shall be thrown into the furnace , and no guard will save you fro my hand .
let the furnace be heated sevenfold .
but now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has not harmed your boies .
you were willing o gie up your lives rather tan serve any but your own god .
danie :
and fo a time all wa well until nebuchadnezzar 's leep was troubled yet by another dream .
before i was born , my grandfather , astyages , was trouled by a dream where a flood beginning near his throne was overflowing he wole earth .
he did n' learn until 10 years ater that the boy wa actually alive , at which time he pardoned the boy and restored hi to his rightful parents , and for a time the matter wa forgotten .
aniel :
old astyages , he kew of the prophecy , but he was poweless to overcome i .
for hen he dreamed that great dream , hi enchanters , sorcerers , and astrologers were once again unable to interret the vision .
the images i saw terrified me .
the beasts of he field took sheler under it , ad the birds of the air lived in its branches , an from it every creature was fed .
tim off its braches .
stri its leaves .
ut let he stump an its roots ,
this is the dream that i ha .
you have become great ad strong .
but you saw a messenger , a holy one , coig down rom heaven , saying ,
hile its roots remain in the ground .
let him live like wild animals .
you will eat grass like cattle until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to acept my advice .
renounce your sins by doing what is right and your wickedness by eing kind to the oppressed .
seek the lord while he may be found , and it may be that your rosperity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often short , an 12 months later whe the king was waling on the roof of the royal palace of babylo -- of babylon --
nebuchadnezar :
i 've plaed upo the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised mountain high .
is this not the great babyon tat i have built as my royal palace with my mighty power for the glory o my majesty 
daniel :
go now from this kingdom which you claim .
beause he insisted on being more than he was made , he became less than he was made .
even in his insanity neithe the lion nor the bear diturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept naked in the places where they found their food because it had been prophesied hat one day e would honor the most high .
hono and glory to him who lives forever .
rise , nebuchadnezzar .
efore him all the people of the earth are regarded as nothing .
he may do as he pleases wih the powers of heaven and all the people o the earth , and no one , no one , may say him , nay .
and so nebuchadnezzar returned to his throne  but eventually he was gatheed to his fathers , and a series of new kings came to the throe , none fasting more than a short time .
well , at last we come o the pan of the tale were i have some knowledge to share .
for though i had conquered from east to west ,
it was enough to freeze the heart of even an old soldier such a i am .
fro whence it came i do not know , like some spiri of god whisered it in my ear .
but the river euhrates which flowed down to babylon raised above its natural level hemed in by ams and dikes , but if dams were opened full and the dikes were broken , the river which ran straight through the heart of the ity
and i suddenly realize i ' been given a key to defeat the mighty babylon .
it was as though in all the world , throughout al of history ,
i was the only one that had the thought .
all it required was the right moment o act .
listen , oh king , and i will tell of the second ing of my story ,
they seem quite concerned about this , my ing .
first  they must buil a causeway across the moat .
that alone will take months .
bring me the golden vessels from the temple of jerusalem 
but  my king , is it wise to use the vessels ?
my king , these cups are considered sacred , are they not , my ing ?
but here they are spoil for our gods , and they would have you use them as i see fit .
bring them !
a judean once told nebuchadnezzar , your forefather , of his dreams .
he suceeded when everyone else had failed 
i am told you are able to give interpretations and solve dificult problems .
if you can read the writing on that wall , you will be clothed in purple , have a chain of gold placed around your neck , and be made hird highest ruler in the kingdo .
oh king , the most high god gave your father , nebuchadnezzar , greatness and glory  ut when his heart became arrogant he was deposed fom his throne and sripped of his glory until he acknowledged that the most high is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of heaven .
would you humble the almighty by desecrating hi possessions ?
would you bind him like a captive and beat him like a slave ?
thi is his answer to you .
mene , od has numbered the days of your reign and brough it o an end .
upharsin , your ingdom is divided and given to the medes and perians .
thus says the lord , your line is ended .
your rule is over .
ls there nothing to be done ?
will the leas of your slaves comfort ou , or will they deser you , seeking to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldiers together :
i am ing belshazza of the babylonia .
as e has commanded , i shall assume the crown .
you are darius  the mede-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem taken this city .
by right of conquest , you are now the king .
yes , and ou are an official of babylon .
it is a reward for lettin beshazzar know that you were about to take the city .
he read the inscription and revealed the message .
he told the king that he would die this very night 
daniel :
if i was to lie , would this be the lie i would choose ?
and how could you have oe so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i will seak to you honestly , my king , and when you would not hear the truth you must ask me nothing .
so be it .
yet i shall name you one of te three .
i they wee loyal to the forer master , they are no good to me .
cyrus :
he 's twice my uncle by blood and marriage and serves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yes .
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from he city ?
once he is in chare he 'll be looking into everything we do .
perhap we shoul eliminate him .
how ?
he does n't hunt .
a sudden illness or a rowning .
who would believe it ?
thee is no corruption in him nor any neligence .
there 's a spirit of excellence in im .
no one is that onest .
i had a man try to brie him once , and a very generous bribe at that .
such a man is dangerous 
how long before he learns that we 've been generous with ourselves and covered the thefts with alse acounts ?
then pehaps we need to make him stop .
he wo n't do it .
if we could forbid his prayers for an etire onth under penalty of immediate execuion ?
do n't be ridicuous .
i know him .
the king knows that daniel and his people pray ontinuously and only to one god .
which is why we need to disguise our purpose .
indeed , they ould find nothing amiss in my work , neither wilfull nor throuh negligence or lack of care , so they tried to tip e up with my prayers .
but since worship of the most high was not prohibite by the laws of the realm , they had to conceal their purpose like poison in a cup of hoey .
and have not submitted to your rue .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereby the loyalty of all may be ested .
ut what of the gods of persia , my servant , obey ?
how ould you enforce suc an edict ?
no one would be allowed to go before any altar or shrine for the entire period except for you .
and anyone foud violating the decree would be thrown into the lions ' den beore sundown on the very day of the offene .
male conspirator # 3 :
in a single sroke .
i approve your plan .
in anticipation of your approal , oh king , we have taken te iberty of drafting the edict and bringing it alog .
cyrus :
and once a law is written , een the king himself can not change it .
daniel !
the king 's seal is barely dry .
you chose your god over your king .
take him away !
oh king , it is my sad duty to inform you that someone has already defied your decree 
guard :
brin forth the prisoner 
he pays no attention o you  oh king , or to e deree you have put in writing .
daniel is m chief advisor .
no one is above the law .
bring forth the tablet .
shall be thrown into the lios ' den
by my hand and seal , darius the king , ruler of the medes and persians .
knowin the king 's command  i have disobeyed it .
i shall command my wise men to make eery effort to searc out some reason that the law may be found unenforceable 
let them searc , oh king , but only for a short time because your own law commands that sentence be carried out the day of the offense .
daniel :
it is as i expected .
a ing who will not enforce his own laws can not be a king .
i will walk with you , daiel , one last time 
as you wish  oh king .
my forefather , abraham , came fom this land , and the most hig said unto him ,
i will make you into a great nation .
and may yet live to reap the fruits of that curse .
a cu of wine from the king 's own hand .
not so  daniel .
in the cup i have poured no libation .
good be , my fried .
farewell but perhaps not good bye .
hear , oh israel , lod our god ,
have mercy o me , o god .
no , no , take it away , all of it !
in you my soul takes refuge in the midst of lions , surrounded by ravenous beasts with teeth of spears , with tongues as sharp a sword .
come near .
a toast to the lions who show no partiality to a hebrew over any other man .
but those who seek the lod will lack for no good thing .
daniel !
servant o the living god , has your god been able to save you ?
oh king , live forever .
y god has sent his angel , and he shut the mouth of the lions .
they have not hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the man ay if he steals another man 's treasure ?
with his hands erhaps .
is there an penalty less than death which will do ?
ut , oh king , he is a hebre .
you ashioned my own words as a sare aboe my feet knowing my edict could not be reversed , bu the living god , the god of daiel , has elivered him out of my hand .
no !
pease wait , king , please !
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he resues , and he saves .
for 70 years i had waite , and i knew our time was near .
my heart grows with excitement that now that time has come 
belshazar , the foolish ;
darius , who was deceived .
who is this fourh kin ?
it is one chosen by the most high to perform great and ighty deeds before he was ever knitted in his mother s womb .
a bird of prey ?
true , i had never saw the regions of the euphrates or further westward until i came in conquest .
and yet you chased your eneies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i take hol of-
it entions me by name ?
to subdue nations before him 
so that gates will not be shut .
i will go before you and will level the moutains .
an cut through bars of iron .
please continue .
so that from the rising of the sun
to the place of its setting ,
how else might it be explained ?
daniel :
you have answered your own question  oh king .
this i what the lord says .
who spread out the earth by myself ,
ad makes fools of diviners ,
and of their ruins , i will restore them . '
i , who was saved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was raised in a shepherd ' house .
seventy years since i was taken rom the land of my birth .
babylon has been punished .
you have punished her .
only one thing remains :
your god ha called me a shepherd , and so to your people i shall be , to rescue them from wolves and tyrants , to gather them ently and to relieve them from bondage and provide for their reun .
the lord god of heaven as given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed for me to build a temple in jerusalem in judea .
any one of his people among ou , may hi god be with you .
let him go to jerusalem in judea and uild a temple of the lord , the god of israel-
howeer , my heart as joyous as my brohers and sisters departed on their journey home while i remained in babylon awaiting the da when i , too , would be gathered to my ancestors .

their land is buit on an aazing atural energy source called crystallites , and the crystallites heat and power everything in their realm .

ony because that 's what we 've been led to believe .
it ' wha 's in our fairy tales 
look .
then , the crystal fairy king accuse the butterly fairies of trying to steal their crystallites 
the butterfly fairies denied it , the crystal fairies did n't believe them , and everyone got anrier and angrier until the to sides declared themselves eterna enemies , and vowed never to have contact again .
where 's the picture of that ?
