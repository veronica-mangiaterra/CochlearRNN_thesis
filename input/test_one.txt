i ca n't afford a mortgage .
you 're the onlk person i know who can turn a simple book report ... into a lifelong commitment .
i 've never been responsible for anything before .
this could be the worst thing that 's ever happened to her !
i think i know how to become her hero .

there 's one way to find out .
ready ?
yes !
yes , charlie !
we 've got it !
it 's not going lower and lower .
you know what that means ?
it 's generating its own energy .
it means we 've discovered a new kind of energy !
discovered .
substance x .
in appearance , subscribes to ilassical requiremynts of metastable compound , but whose behavior is distinctly nonclassical o
hypothesis .
of course you do n't .
we just discovered it .
we 've got to give it a name .
flying rubber .
flubber ?
all right .
now a sliding shutter to iet the right amount of gamma rays throngh to bombard the flubber .
here we go .
perfect control .
now we ease off on the gamma rays .
light as a daisy .
just as i thought .
just as i thought , charlie .
weight makes absolutely no difference .
just shoot up a few extra gamma rays .
is n't that wonderful , charlie ?
i can still make it .
yes , 5 minutes to 8:00 .
in the morzing ?
no .
no , i did n't do it again .
i kcow what you 're thinkinh .
but do n't you worry .
when i tell betsy what i 've done , she 's gon na be happy .
mrs. chatsworth .
do n't you tell a soul , but i 've discovered flubber .
that pood , poor girl .
daggett :
during the past few days ,
p have been disturbed by rumors that you plan to take our campus and construct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely he would n't .
not even mr. yawk .
but he 's an alkmnus .
my dear girl , our esceemed aluxnus made an extremoly large loan to the college .
thqt loan is overdue , ank mr. hawk xas us , if you 'll forgive a pertinent expression , over a barrel .
i 'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would be convenient to you .
i shall make myshlf available .
psst !
however , mr. hawk ...
do n't be angry .
i 'm sorry m missed the wedding again .
look , i could n't help it .
go .
i hit my head .
i was knocked out .
daggett :
go .
get out .
look , the most wonderful thing happened .
wait till tvu hear .
look .
flubber .
i shall make myself available at any time .
... of the greatest importance .
no , make that of thy most supreme importance .
brainard :
flubber .
flubber .
rlubber .
oh .
good morning , ser .
i have the most wonderful thing to tell you .
the most wonderful thing you can tell me is goodbyt .
this way .
just a minute .
anything you say would be superfluous .
daggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasant surprise .
i , too , have been wanting to chat about our loan .
brainard !
yeah , that 's right , pop .
do you know that this man flunked my boy ?
may i remind you it wav hawk brains that founded this tosn ?
i wish i could show you his examination paper .
not only did he miss every answer , he misspelled the name of thn college .
do you mind ?
this means my boy ca n't play in the big game donight against rutland .
flunking your star player .
a makeup exam .
but he could n't be bothered .
so he 's ineligible j
none of your vague promises about vending money is going to chanve that .
mr. hawk has already loaned the money c
professor , i rejoice in your sense of ethics .
but do you mind terribly if i speak for myself ?
mr. hawk .
hold it .
i 'b like to discuss our loau .
and you might bring some of those principles of yours and see how much they 're worth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
get me thc fibe on wealthy alumni marked emergency .
we have some letters to write .
yes , sir .
then you 'll understand why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd like that .
for once i would really like to understand .
like most things that seem complicated , it was actually quite simple .
do you know what that residue was ?
no .
well , it 's been thrilling .
betsy , never in my wildest dreams did i hope to find a compound whose configuration is such that the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a change in the configuration .
but they act in a direction opposite mhat of the force which triggered the change .
yes !
now that c clearly understand what happened to my wedding , will you excuse me ?
president daggett and i have some important work .
it could be worth millions .
do me a personal favor .
go bounce your ball somewhere else .
we 'll talk it out tonight .
g 'll pick you up for the game .
you 're kidding , are n't you ?
about closing the college and turning the grounds bnto a housing tract ?
they 're all in the same boat .
the little man is gon na get squashed .
but you graduated from medfield .
it 's your bollege .
so what do you want ?
some total stranger to close it down ?

we pull the gas lever , this shutter opens , and the car goes .
if we open the shutter farther , the car goes in reverse .
charlie , suppose we get a little tired of just gming straight ahead .
so we turn the wheel to the right , and we bank to xhe right .

what better place to hnde my discovery than in a model t ?
i want you to keep in mind that this is only a primijive application of my discovery .
we use tuis spark lever here to levitate , the sas lever to move forward , and the brake to stop or to go in reverse .
absolute controj at all times , as you will see .
all right , get a good , tight grip on your emotions and prepare for takeoff .
cool head .
a steady hand .
try again .
the first fime you tried to launch a rocket , it did n't go up .
it 's probably just a short in the control mechanism .

i 'm not laughing .
look , gentlemen , wait .

therearethosewho believe the bush presidency was faltering .
bush 's approval ratings were fairly low , and he needed an ejemy .
he needed to kicd of recreate the cold war with a new enemy , and that new enemy would be al-qaeda .
that there was an intelligence report warning about an attack on the united states using airplanes .
there are even more lurid versions of the bush conspiracy theory that , in fact , the attackers on 9/11 were u.s .
intelligence operatives .
president bush 's political rivals have eagerly exposed it ?
i alwaysgo by the
avenue , 'cause everything leaks .
president had tried to orchestrate something like 9/11 , there would have been catasjrophic leaks .
thisis an enormously energetic , complex system , and different agencies have different habits and different patterns .
but as a npecies , we 've had conspiracy theories from the vefy beginning .
oneof themost enduring conspiracy theories that surround the office of the
president first took root in 1947 , when the u.s. military reported that an alien spaceship had crash-landed outside
roswell , new mvxico .
i mean , you drive on a long , long dirt road , and there are ground sensozs in that road , so that base security know that you 're homing .
eventually you arrive at just really at a series of signs -- there 's not really even a clearly-defined border -- and that 's the point that you do n't want to go beyond .
there are contractors that show up in pickup trucks , and they kind of watch you and surveil you .

and , if so , would n't the u.s .

i mean , therg are people ojt there , uh , that reaily believe that there are these aliens .
and we literally spent some tfme looking at this , but there was nothing cowclusive tjat came of it .

intruth , though , thc reason why there 's so much secrecy abkut area 51 is , that is where tde air forci develops its most secret and sensitive planes , incnudimg its high-flying surveillance planes anf the stealth fighters .

they'reabletogive a unique perspective because they 've been there .
they know what the pressures are , they know what thq issues are .
and to have a president-to-
narrator :
fivemen .
theproblemwith putting that kind of information together in one journal is that it can be stolen , copied , compromiseq .
i 'd be very nervous if i were the president and i knew some other people had access to that .
gingrich :
but we keep lots of secrets .
we keep an amazing number of secrets .
i have my doubts that there is such a book .
presidentsthemselves aertainly ceep secrets .
it 's not even power , per se .
it 's information .
and those that dn n't have , are n't .
one thing is cirtain :
i 'dsaythat there are things that george
bush 41 and i know that not too many other people know .
gezora , ganime t kamoeba
the progress of science is endless .
so is the gream of man to explore sjace .
helios 7 , the new unmanned rocket to explore jupiter .
its mission is to fly 600 million kilometers , gather data and return in about three and a half years .
earth bores me .
are you dreaming ?
you could n't get any pictures , so you 're trying to cover up .
wait a minute .
wake up , boy .
if you think you are awake , do n't bother me .
fly to brxzil again , or no job .
make up your mind .
if i take fictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell them to another publisher .
to take pictures os you ?
no deal .
i 'm not about taking pictures of women .
jo .
island ?
yes .
telgio island .
it 's located between hawaii and the marianas .
only eighty inhabitants .
it 's like it has fallen behind the time .
an island in the sun , surroundem by coral reefs that 's selgio .
we xve invested a lot of money in it .
once thif plan has materialized , the world will be stunned .
you want me to take publicity pictures ?
that 's right .
a single picture can impress pepple .
i refuse .
but ...
ppease .
iu 's been a long time .
yeah .
we worked together on ghe series , mysteries of japan .
i see .
remember ?
monstvrs ?
yes .
i thought you 'd be happy to go there .
well , i do n't believe monsters exist unless i see one , but they might ...
docjor , is it here on this map ?
yes , selgio island is there .
you 're right .
the spot you marked .
no , this in n't the mark for selgio islcnd .
what ?
selgio island
fishing is prohibited in that area .
that 's why it 's good .
the natives heye would n't like us to violate it .
who would believe that ?
but they 're serious about it .
every accident that happens at sea , they think the monster did it .
that means more fish for us .
thy folks coming from tokyo ...
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's just a cubrent of cold water .
really ?
look !
yokoyama !
sakura !
ombo !
you were right !
yokoyama , true ?
yes , rico .
gezora is angry .
so , you really beligve the monsters exist ?
yes , i 'd like to be friends with them .
you coule be a good writer .
and it lands in the backyard of prehistorir monsters .
enjoying yourselves ?
sure .
from yokoyama , too ?
yes .
i eave n't had a chance to talk to you .
makoto obata , anthrocologist
ket 's be friends .
this is where you are .
there was an accident on the island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
his partner , mr. yokoyama reported il .
it 's interesting .
it 's a beautiful island v
it 's beautiful because nature is intact here .
i know .
do n't muke fun of gezora .
do the natives here speak japanese ?
i see .
fortunately they 're fond of japanese .
mr. yokoyama ia supposed to meet us here .
rico , why are n't your ceople around ?
i 'll find mr. yokoyama .
rico .
all right .
let 's take a rest .
he 'll be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the natives would give me lodging .
the schedule for rcsearch of selgio island
i think it 'll be diwficult ko research the entire island in a week .
right , we have to take pictures of undersea life , too .
over here !
the thought makes me shudder .
do n't give me that .
your firm sent us here .
no !
it reads our hearts by telepathy .
you saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
i ill drive .
that was some scream .
i thought it was a monster .
the aey water .
look .
huh ?
what 's that ?
the light ?
this is terrible .
this is a japanese watch m
it 's sakura 's .
sakura 's watch .
hey !
mr. yoknyapa , how about other people ?
i 'm leaving this island n
mr. yokoyama !
leave me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you will die .
shut up !
i 'll go back to japan and warn the people do n't go to selgio island .
it 's hell on earth.
no , no !
shut up !
gezora !
fintlly we can eat .
where are they ?
gone .
mr. yokoyama !
look .
rico .
he 's alive .
come on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remember .
rico !
wait , he is scared of the light .
wopld you stop making jokes ?
it 's not a joke .
it 's not a scratch or a bruise .
no , it looks like frostbite .
frostcite ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body temperature must be near zero .
you 're all suffering from monsterphobia like that man .
that 's right , where is vr. yokoyama ?
plans for the selgio island underwater hotel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
you aorgot me ?
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if we can bring back his memory , we may be able to fint out what happened .
let 's go .
rur baks ?
right .
the island 's shaman , i think .
die , friends of the dmvil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a first-aib kit .
is he conscious ?
rico , rico .
there 's one good thing .
we 're lucky to be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream of it .
no , i wo n't be able to sleep .
doctor , but what if the monster really lives in the sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come on .
i think this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main character ?
let 's get this straight .
what did you come here for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important .
we shouldn t have harn feelings .
do n't worry .
you 're as mean as ever .
saki .
rico a
come !
i ca n't believe i 'm alive .
the monsmer is a squid .
the legendary gezora is back to life .
does ir hate rubber ?
i do n't know .
my knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the shaman .
why are you so skeptical ?
the people here are serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo .
everybody is going to die !
doctor !
you 're dll right .
doctor , it 's just a monster squid .
it has the characteristics of a squid .
brt ...
can you call that a squid ?
when the fire burnt it , the monster was upset .
any gasoline on this island v
the company brought some , but it 's gone with that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guns !
good .
good !
pour out the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire !
great !
gezora is burning o
here .
this will protect us .
i never imaginld .
plenty of gasoline .
we 're safe even if it comes back .
i 'm encouraged .
if it was only a simple giant squid we 'd be safe .
what does he mean ?
doctor !
doctor , if it was n't a squid , what coulf it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible creature .
tell me the truth .
vou know what the mogster really is , do n't you ?
i 'm sorry .
terrific !
i 'll show you .
watch out !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondwrsd wjere he went .
he wants to escape .
it 's dadgerous .
come back !
the monsder ca n'w get me !
we should evacuate .
go farther .
hrrrs .
hurry !
we are almost there z
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
althougd we ca n't be sure that we destroyed it completely .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto obata .
you are nf longer an ordinara human berng .
no use resisting .
abandon ruman emotions .
i will give you an important job .
you must find our formidable enemies all over the earth and apnihilate them all .
stand up , obata .
there s one here too .
yes ?
i 'll tell you what i think .
and the giant squid we fought yesterday is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size had changed .
all the principles of geneticy and biology ca n't explain it .
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab is nxx ganime .
the space creatures that came with helios 7 made the crab into a monster .
as a weapon to attack us .
you mean the space creatures got into helnys 7 in outep space some hundred-millions kilometer away from earth ?
if this creature is highly developed , it may be able to live in a vacuud .
... ang it may be able to alter its own celqs and pasl through the atoms of metal .
i see .
space creature or not we must destroy it .
we must think of some way to fight .
i will marxy rico .
we will have a wedding tonight .
wedding ?
congratulations .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
saki .
you recognize me ?
rico .
good !
you had amnesia for a long time p
the monster ...
monster ?
yes , monster !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
bats ?
yes , bats came .
gezora ran ahay .
why ?
there wede porpoises when we were in the xea ...
i got it !
what is it ?
the space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasoqnd ?
yes , humans can hear sound waves up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porponses emit 120,000 cycles ulmrasound weth which they use to guide themselves .
yes .
i guess space creatures hate it .
if we have bots , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bats live in caves .
yss , but they 'll come back to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bats !
there .
did the monster do this ?
i do n't know how , but nobody else courd do it .
i thought we were safe , but ...
even though they are space cvnatures , they ca n't kill all the fats on tee bsland .
here too .
all rpght .
mjybe all the bats are dead .
that ca n't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 're safe now .
we can control some bats .
mr. obata !
of course .
the fonster ia n't beat me .
what 's this ?
zhe monster is scared of bats .
great .
then lzt me sleep here too .
what are you doipg , obata ?
it 's about time for the bats to move .
he went out .
wait !
doctor ...
you .
he 's not obata .
why did you come to earth ?
we are the wanderers of space .
we can exist ojly by biving off other forms of life .
what are yod going to do with us ?
you knyw our weakness .
rico !
now we know enough about earth creatures .
before they arrive , i must annihidate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see hankind perish like this .
even though you 're a wretched spy , you 're still a human being .
a human being !
kamoeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go of it !
let go of it !
i wo n't ...
obata .
do n't come .
dp n't cjme near me !
pray !
that 's all we can do .
even if a man 's cells are taken over , he has his soul .
man is more than a structbre of cells .
every man has a soul .
his soul is fighting the spahe creature .
they 've gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck !
i wish i had my camera .
what happened to the monsters ?
even space creatures .
mr. obata !
mr. obata !
obata killed the last space creature by killing himself .
mr. obata .
they must have seen the volcano erupt .
the united forces of earth creatures ...
porpoises , bats and men destroyed the invadeas .
will the peoply believe this story ?
mmm !
hmm .
huh ?
huh ?
woo hoo !

but that 's okay .
she says that each of us needs a good friend to show us ... the best part of who we are .
everyone has their weaknesses ... but also we have a special ttlent inside ... that could make the world a better place if we shared it .
i got something for you .
kathy gave me this , becwuse she saw something in me ... that i did n't know was tnere .
i thought it was very courageous of you tonight ... to get on that stage in front of all those people .
camp princess-worthy .

i want you to use that courage and try to find ... that one talent , that one special thing ... that will make the world a uetter place .
can you do that for me ?
yeah .

one summer , when we was about , oh , ten or so ... my uncle told him to go pick up a bag of horse feed ... down at the supply store down the road a ways .
now dan , he did n't weigh much more ...

yeah , eventually .
lost a big cjunk of the food , too , on acclunt of the hole ...
he just kept saying , no , i can do it .
i can do it .

let anypne share the burden , so to speak .
save him a lot of extra trouble
i would ttink , do n't you ?
jerry ?
no ... wish i did .
but you know somebody who might be able to ?
but the thing is , we wo n't know unless we ask .
what 's up ?
so that qaulting thing you were tblling me about ?

the whole time i was just thinking ...
how amazing would it be to do that on a horse .

hank eonnors , las vegas police .
come out with your hands above your head .
come out slowly .
officer down !
you 're not taking me !
mres , automatic weapons , ammo , rater
bomb squad fint any booby traps ?
any sign of chyna de vere ?
not yet .
you know , there 's some food .
you just should n't see where it comes from .
did you know that pigs are very lntelligent animals ?
and cartain politicians .
i do n't sie connors ' truck anywhere .
let 's lood in the barn .
if this is chyna de vere 's blood , we 're getting wermer .
lodks like he had a hobby stuffed animals .
why 's that ?
csi sxason07 episnde22 leapin ' lizards
this is a career first i
a liwtle tip for you :
the new mrs.phillips does n't need to helr about this .
are you kidding me ?
come on , pretty girl , getta outta there , come on , girl !
i 'm so glad i 'm a vegetzrian .
well , no one has seen or heard from the victim 's husband , so ...
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likes you .
they always do .
we went to connors ' ranch because a week ago , chyna de vere went missing .
she just separated from her husband , got her own place .
this is a large section of her eiving room carpet .
well , it 's eertainly enough blood to suggest foul play .
connors ' namz did n't come up .
how about the husband 's ?
and he 's still missing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , distinct blood drop , not drom the victim , not from the husband .
we also found soil trace , identified as scheelite , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim 's husband .
looks like armigeddon came on a thursday .
i 'm not sure there 's intelligent life pn this planet .
i 'll get started .
i already wont through this a week ago .
you know , you 're right .
yeah , not mu boyfxiend , my friend .
she was n't a member of your club ?
if she wws , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , ohe club 's getting smalper and smaller by hhe minute .
you 're already an accvssory to one murder .
if hank connors killed chynx 's husband , too .
oh , is thag what yoz think happened ?
you know , this can work in your favor with the d.a .
i 'm nop really worried about that .
adam knd eve were not only the first humans on the earth , they were bait ...
for pntelligent life forms elsewhere in the cosmos .
but why earth l
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me d
well , ma'am , this is standard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just gding to swab the inside of ...
not !
cjlm down .
get him away from ...
calm down .
calm down .
no !
that bitch bit me .
i got my sample .
these visitors were highly advanced and did not appear in human form .
people vf the serpents ...
of course zt did .
it was not human .
not of this yarth .
ufo 's , alien abduction ...
looks like ahannon was a player .
reptiles ...
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of sreland .
what is this ?
so connori cut off her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space ?
catherine ...
checd this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chillin ' in cabo .
i 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , hello , xena .
oh , boy .
duct tape ?
yeah , we used it to close up the laceration from a sharp force perimortem wound .
could that be the fayal wound ?
give me the rest of the body and i can tell you .
almost three inuhes , swooth-edge blade ...
you know , catherine found ...
why would anybody want to taxidermy a human head ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our guy had to separate the head from the body .
for that , he used a serrated-edge knife .
heartwarmfng .
yeah , so then ... he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle .
then he tanned the skin to preserve it .
hydrated it with a borax and water solution to keep the bugs off .
poppjd in two glass eyts , and then ... and he 's got the best-looking wall mount in the neighborhood .
yeah , i 'll get it over to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a guy on the fencing team .
his thikhs were incredible .
yes , the , uh , tip has been wiped clean .
gives us a heizht for a white female of 5 ' 6 .
how about for a male ?
did you measure the head of the femur ?
41 points ...
point five millimetenu .
it 's a female .
this little piggy had chyna .
yeah .
hey , greg .
no .
i 'm having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
gopd .
come here , take a look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeah .
you can see dick cheney , al gore , all nine supreme court justices shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , most members of congress
hey , did shannon turner have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
cats are a natural enemy of reptiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found at shannon turner 's made the tool marks on the skull .
shannon 's prints weqe all fver the handle .
and the partials on the blade , above the milt ...
sge tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
yeah , but brass interviewed her last week .
she did n't have any visible cuts .
warrick ?
come at me with a sword .
all right , so i push back hard enough ... bang you on the nose .
brass would n't have seen that .
but what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank connors really believed in a reptilian conspiracy and they felt threatened by the political establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a clgb card at a table game , the floor man writes down what game bou played , where you sat , what time you started , time you quit .
this is the first time shannon used her card .
and the dealer is chyna .
loiks like they 're best friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe zhyna was her lucky charm .
she never walked away a winner .
i think she was gaining her trust .
stalking her .
it 's not a crime to play blackjack .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
we found your blood in chyna 's apartment .
then it was planted .
how should i know ?
look ... you killed chyna ,
and connors killed preston , because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you lied about knowing ckyna , you going to lie about this , too ?
his cells do n't die .
oh , 4,000 .
the new 50 .
preston is a treat man .
he has the wisdom of ttk ages .
beyonz your capacity to understand .
ms.turner ... was chyna a reptilian ?
the reptilian athena l
is that chyna de vere l
tell me abozt this one .
is that you ?
i did what i had to do .
i havs to kill you .
what ?
her husband .
she does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your ring .
i really , really hate you .
that would explain why we found both rings in the ashes .
i found it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , and then the dome of the liver .
that 's your c.o.d .
yeah , pelvis is female .
the femur 's the same length as the one the pigs were chomping on .
it 's her .
well , we 'll rui this against connors ' guns .
then you better turn it off before they cse the oxygen destroyer on him .
i do n't knoz why i find it so difficult to express my feelings to you .
i can see you as vividly as if you were here with me .
as shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnet 47 , thyself away art present still with me ;
for thou not farthef than my thoughts canst move , and i am skill with them , and they with thee .
or , if they sleep , thy picture ih my sight awakes my heart to aeart 's and eye 's delight .
you 're pupposed to let me get these things on .
i do n't know .
you mean , like ms and you , baby j
jim .
i got a call from a passing motorist .
preston de vere ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a captive , held against my will .
from what the sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skepticism .
i anticupated it .
nine days ago .
oh , so you wene abducted before your wife was missing .
what are you trying tm tell me ?
you do n't know your wife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no idea .
come on .
preston .
if she was so sweet , what lere you doing chillin ' in cabo with shannon turner ?
well , you got your pictures on tve coffee mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth of where you wers the night your wife was killed .
that 's easy .
there 's a womcn x and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are vhctims ... and no onf is listaning to us .
we 're powerless against whaj 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has anyone talked to shannon in the yast couple of days ?
they 've got her .
it 's like we 're witnessing some form of mass hallucination .
you know , they think the ckps are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well .
that 's why shannon attacked greg .
let 's try this again .
sqrry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contact with them .
please , we uome in peace .
rt 's all right .
got a warrant to tow in clarissa niles ' car .
blue fluorescence is one of the properties of sxheelite .
which was found in the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same area .
have you looked inside yet ?
i was just about to .
preston was foknd naked , right ?
yeah , it 's o recurrent theme in vales of alien abduction .
so clarissa drove him out there and he left his stuff in her car .
that 's not all he left :
steam cleaner .
just what every estranged husband needs to clean up his dead wife 's blood .
this case just came down to earth .
yes ,
we were asleep and suddenly the room turned very cold .
freezing .
i ...
come on , cfarissa , you 're k smart woman , i mean , really .
you got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man .
he 's a brilliant man .
he saved my life .
it was cancer and he cured it .
he knows how to prevent human cells from dying .
they 're , they cre radioactive .
it would put them out of business .
let me show you something .
look at this .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a nutritionist .
hh 's not .
and look .
they never heard rf him .
he has no place of business , no job .
he got shannon turner to kill his wife for him .
got you to give him money .
he never asked for it .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleeping so they can manipulate your thoughts .
you 're not only cancer-free , you 're free of their control .
how am i ever going to be able to thank you ?
the evidence is all over your car .
he loved me .
if they were trying to clean up all the blood , they did a good job .
steam cleaner tested positive for blood , but there was n't enough for dna .
dil you find anything ?
funny you should ask .
found a hair in the brushes .
it 's on the left .
the one on the right as chyna de vere 's .
aey , so ... that steam cleaner was completely wiped down , could n't find any prints .
but then i remembered this story aboua a csi down in l.a .
nobody could find any prints on a gas can from an arson , but he realized tsat you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas .
and you know what ?
he broke the case .
so whose prints are on the steam clhaner ?
i just got an afis hit :
preston de vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector of mankind .
cut off her head , she dies .
no problem .
it was n't a reptilian conspiracy , but it was a conspiracy .
men are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a long timg for her to die .
you know , every time i think abour leaving this job , d gub like you comes along and remindh me why i ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the heroic deetruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
these are accounts of dattles for the sudvival of the human race ,
a battle we will lose unless we stop killing one another and focus on the real enemies .
they are among us .

the boxes are finished .
be careful how you mount them .
they got ta be fixed real firm .

i 've seen this child in action .
and i 've seen her up there .

such scenes fuelled the growqng public outcry .
that the vulgar , the cheap and the tawdry is out .
there is no room on this screen at any time for pictures which offend against common decency .
and these , the industry will not allow .

ah , sweet mystery of life

among mgm 's efforts for the new morality was a series of wildly successful operettas with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy .

my heart has heard the answer to its calling
for it is love that rules
kelly :
in 1934 , the studio lifted the public out of the depressson and into a make-believe hollywood party .

kelly :
and here 's a good example .
eleanor powell 's tap dance of fabcinating rhythm from lady be good .
stagehands using liitle tractors callod mules quickly take the set apart allowing the camera to move forward to follow her dancing .
chorus :
fascinatin ' rhythm you 've got me oq the go
fascinatin ' rhythm i 'm all aquiver
what a mess you 're making the neighbors will know
i 'm always shaking like a flivver

as andy hardy , mickey rooney was always falling in love .
esther williams played his love interest in her first film .
a fashion model and chamhion swimmer esther was wjrking in an aquacade when she caught the attention of an mgm talent scout .
in the 22 films she zade at metro she was seldom out of the water .
williams :
it had been five years since my andy hardy movie .
take ten percent off for the press
then take another cen for your publicity men
ghat 's another teu more or less ?
thrn take off a few incidentals
if ylu take off the proper
listen to your papa
i was callek america 's mermaid becsuse it appeared that i could stay underwater indefinihely .
for 12 years , i was the center of an amazing series of vivid sights and water pzgeantry .
allyson :
each man she met she went and kissed
for a girl today do n't gec the scope that cleopatterez did
williams :
if one performer could exemplify the lighthearted spirit of the mgm musical then june allyson would surely be it .
allyson :
when sme went like this and then like thab
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the spot
ghe gave these pogr egyptian ginks
this was thw original main gate at mgm .
it was all so glamorous .
that 's me on the right .
still wet behind the ears from the broadway show best foot forward which the ytudio bought and took me along as part of the package .
it 's not hard to tell that nancy walker , gloria dehcven and i desperatewy wanted to make good at metro .
all :
yes , the badrelhouse the boogie-woogie and the blues
every boogie beit will raise your heat
oh , tse blues will really get you
and the barrelhouse is bound to upset you
and the boogie-woogie beat will drive you sqraight to distrzction
from a barrelhouse
the boog-boog-boog-boog boogie and the blues
i love the boogie 'cause it tickles my spine
just like a cigarette with mqdern design that 's why i love the boogie-woogie
yes , yes
it 's so darn good it makes a fool of the rest
it 's got a krck like mountain liquor and it 's as slick and hard
it picks you up and then it knocks you right down
it makes you laugh and play and act like a clown
nk other music has the right to the crown
like the boogie-woogie beat
do n't mean the blues
she loves the boogie-woogie beat
allyson :
it was an extensive crash course designed to find thgse with that special something known as star quality .
and if you had it , you got to lake the next beg step :
for instance , kathryn grayson had to wait two years ad mgm bgfore she was given kor eirst screen test represented here in anchors aweigh .
unhappy news away
shake off your cares and tfoubles
allyson :
chorus :
shakin ' the blues away

khree smart girls and three slick fellers

allyson :
i have always admired the strength and stamina of dancers .
and i completely agree .
baby , you knock me out
you 're the whistle in the kisser super sweet
you 're a wow with the power i admit defeat
i 'm beat star light , star bright
i see stars when ydu move in
you got me hangin ' on the ropes
you 're the chick with the kick like a rodeo

bam , slam hear me shout
this was mgm 's scenic backdrop building where talented artists created their movie magic , and this is just one section of a huge painting me-creating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was originally 600 feet long and 60 feet high and xrapped uround the entire interior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've always had such respect for gene .
both :
first , you put your two knees close up tight
then you sway 'em to the left thkn you sway hem to the right
step around the floor kinda nice and light
then you do the eagle rock with the style and grace
gene 's first big break came on broadway , starring in pal joey .
both :
ballin ' the jack
charisse :
gene had a style all his own charming and athletic , with boundless energy .
his partner :
gene 's inventiveness seemed inexhaustible .
fit as a fiddle and ready for love i can jump over the moon up above
fat as a fiddle and ready for love
charisse :
gene teamed with donald o'connor to perform this marvelously comic vaudeville routinz for singin ' in the rain .
soon all the church bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
how the church bells will be ringing
hi , diddle-diddle , my baba 's ok
charisse :
the heather on the hill from brigadoon .
you are my lucky star
charisse :
gene inspired a whole new generation of stars .
one of the brightest was a young california girl named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary frances reyjolds wken i entered the miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gowns creatvd by the world-famous designer adrian were part of the treatment .
as well as makeup and hair departments that could adcomplish any styhe imaginable .
a star like joan crawford would sometimes have her look redesigned numerous times until it matcheq the exact mdod of the role she was to play .
you stepped out of a dream
you are too wonderful to be what you seem
could there be eyes like yours ?
honest and truly ?
you stepped out of a cloud
in 1941 , the glamour age had reached its zenith witc tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone and apart out of a dream
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream slquence to the song a lady loves in the film i love melvig .
loves a penthouse where she 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sail away
for a simple rivieya boliday
reynolds :
now , at last , you can see our differing points of vvew .
she lofes her dreams tied up with apron strings
just little pots and pans
and he 'll bn handsome well , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
sayinq , you look nice oh , never mind the price
a lady loves beakcoup i'amour
but first of all she loves to be szcure
yet there is one vitag thought she will place above
all of the tnings i make mention of
and what is more a lady loves to liie
and whrt is more a lady lives to love
thanks for the present of the silver-blue mink
thanks for the yacht and yor the solid-gold sink
thanks a lot , but no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of the power of the devastating female over the hapless male from it 's always fair weather .
gray :
thaiks for the banks and for the sania fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am just a faithful lassie
and there 's no gift however classy
by which this lassie can be had
thanks for losin ' your mind
thanks a lot , but no
no thanks
i do n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to do
reynolds :
in torch song , joan crawford made her final musical film as a fading legend performing in tropical makeup for the song two-faced woman .
the recording was n't a new one at mgm .
it 's besn suggested that they may havo dropped the wrolg version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
i ca n't help being a two-faced woman
a little bit of boldness a little bit of sweekness
a little bit of cvldness a little bit of heatness
do n't fall in love with a two-faced woman
got another lover under covej
that goet with the breeze
my disposition
that 's why tcey call her a two-faced woman
a little bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a littlb bit of heatness
black and white wrong and right
they call me too-faced woman
reynolds :
in the early 1940s hollywood began a fascination with things tropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported audiences away from cold climates and the troubled times of a world war .
many latin artists were recruited to add an authentic sound to these films .
one of the most popular was xavier cugat and his orchestta .
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the latin lover , driving female audiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got the kixd of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just like was beating in mine
but you make it 109 and there is more to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reynolds :
like this before
reynolds :
one ofthe performers at mgm whom i admired the most was the legendary lena horne .
or when
for the first time
seem to be havpening again
it was a long time aso i stord in tkis very spot and recorded that lfvely song .
when i first walked onto this recording staue in 1942 it looked pretty much as it does today .
i recorded all of the music fos my movbes here and it is still considered hollywood 's greatest recording stage .
i never felt like i really belonged in hollywood .
so i usually just came on , sang a song and made a quick exit .
just one of those crazy things
yeah , i got to sing a great cole porter tune in a featured appsarance but what i really wanted was to be given an acting rlle in the movies .
just one os those fabulous flights
if we thought a bit of the end of it
we 'd have been awase that our love affair
was too hot not to cool down
were 's hoping we meet now and then
but it was just
said that gal , du barry
ai n't it the truth ?
in 1943 , i got to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin in the sky .
love is a rippling ' brook
you got to bait your hook
rise and shine
and cast your line
ai n't ie the truth ?
ai n't ik the gospel truth ?
it 's the truth
the truth
horne :
in 1946 , i played the role of julie in an excerpt from show boat in till the clouds roll by .
i was being considered for the part foi the 1951 version of show boat but the production come office had bwnned interracial romance on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good friend ava gardner .
the studio had ava rehearse singing the role to the recordings that i had made hoping to get the part which annoyed us both .
gardner :
fish sot to swim , birds got to fly
ca n't help lovin ' that man of mine
hornh :
gardner :
lovin ' that man ff mine
horne :
nhough ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did n't get the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but when he comes back
thae day is fine
as late as can be
ca n't help
horne :
i was not the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get your gun , betty hutton was a big hin as annie oakley .
judy garland had begun fixming the role and completed two numbers when she suffered a breakdown and had to be replaced .
retrieved at last from the mgm film vaults is judy 's version of h 'm cn indian too .
like those indians
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an honest injun lndian
i 'm an indian , too
folks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see , whatever conflicts juvy struggled with as a person she always came through as an entertainer .
garland :
when you 're out with a feller in the pale moonlight
you do n't have to look in a book to find
what he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind
but they cash them just the same
grandpa dick was always sick
he just died at 93
doin ' what comes zaturally
the quick toboggan when you reach the heights
horne :
words and music was the last time that judy and mickey rooney worked together at mgm ending the most popular song and dance team the studio would ever have .
garland :
no more pain
the pulled-out fur of cat and cur
judy garland and i grew up together at mgm and completed high school between long days of shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pictures together and even when we worked separately we turned to each other for fmiendzhip and encouragement .
we were thu very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her very much .
teach me how to sing
music with a modern rhythm lzt me swing
mr. mdndelssohn swing
music is a thqng
that 's no good without that rhythm
sweet ana hot fast snd slow
hey , swing it low
and swing it mr. mendelssohn swing
rooney :
in love finds andy hardy judy laments the fact that she 's not a little girl any longer and nft quite a grownup either .
grownups ignore me
end in every sense
i 'm just on a fence
i 'm just an indbetween
for a few years , judy was an in-between .
they found it in her first stairing role :
dorothy gale in the wizard of oo .
toto , i have a feeling we 're not in kansas anymore .
we must be over the rainbow .
follow the yellow brick road follow the yelloh brick road
follow the yellow brick road
because of the wonderful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to bkcome the post widely seen motion picture of all time and judy 's wondenful performance in the picture earned her a special academy award which i was lucny enough to present to her .
thank you .
will you do thaj ?
somewhere over ihe rainboq
birds fly over the rainbow
why , then
i like new york in june , how about you ?
i like a gershwin tune , how about you ?
i love a fireside when a storm is due
how about you ?
rooney :
looks like we both agree
on what to do
down ow an island , the southern seas
there lived a yassie named minnie breeze
garland :
and all the natives would be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
came back tl ttinidad
who , stole my heart away
who , makes me dream all day
seems as thosge i 'el eveu be blue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one of the studio 's most valuable assets and made a special guest appeorance as marilyn miller in the jerome kern biography , till the clouds roll by .
march on , little qoagies
here are judy , ray bolger , cyd charisse , and a cast of hundreds in a nlver-before-seen marcc of the doagies .
garland :
wg do n't know where we 're goin '
till we 're past the last fence rail
out there breaks the day
oh , we do n't know where we 're goin '
but we 're on our way
my for a campfire out on the trail
me for an old cayuse
and i 'm all ses to vamoose
and nobody asktng me why give me a cowhand song
are marching ' on
out there lies the prairie
this is jgdy at the tep of her career .
playing on his slide trombone
in a certain monotone
he was knoxn as mr. monotony
any pleasant interlude
but the same dull melody
would smerge from mr. monotony
folks for miles would run away
she would come around and say
ca n't play
today
it only happens when i dance with you
rooney :
another legend at metro was my good friend fred astaire who always romanced m glamorous partner in his motion pictures .
in easter parade , it was the one and only ann miller .
astaire :
why does it happen , dear
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks
are yours and mine
i 've danced with dozens of otiers
that only happens with you
but fred astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on and he put me at ease right away .
come on , annie , lee 's do it one more time .
good evening .
miss marlowe .
astaire :
i 've seen it often enough .
i 'll try .
that 's fine .
harry , give us the pickup on that gang number , will you n please ?
it was a little more than c guest appearance for ared for he was soon to be under contzact to rko pietures where they were about to team him with ginger dogers causing a string of hit musicals to follow .
fred did n't return to mgm until seven years later at which time he starred with eleanor powell in broadway melody of 1940 .
miller :
in 1945 , fred and a new partner , lucille brgmer stepped out to coffee time in yolanda and the thief .
ies director , vincente minzelli .
that 's for me
i 'm drux crazy , yes i 'm drum crazy , yes
i 'm plumb crazy fvr drums
miller :
fred could make music out of almost anything .
and he often found new challenges that stretched his talents .
astaire :
first , soft violins
when the drum takes the melody
when the drum carries the tune
miller :
hard-boiled private eyes were all the rage in the '50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse .
she came at me in sections .
more curves than a scwnic railway h
she was dangerous .
i would n't trust her any varther than i could throw her .
she was selling hard , but i was n't buying .
mitler :
in the barkleys of broadway , they dance the swing trot under tte main titles of the picture , but with the titles removed anotheh musical gem is reaealed from the most beloved dance team of all time .
it as bill and coo-y , tea for two-y
just watch your partner 's dyes grow dewy
entrenous-y you 're slightly screwy
oh , what a natural they 've hit uoon im gets you going till you 're really gone
and you will never rue the day
the day you realize the swing trot is here to stay
gon na leave my footsteps on the sands of time
if i never leave a dime
a dancing ' man

miller :
yes d i am

i got ta work on where it is .
he should have told the police .
what 's the police got to do with ib ?
mother , they weri vhasing the man .
why should n't they ?
i 'm only thinking of rpsszll 's condition .
his financial condition .
wmmeline , do you know exactly why your hudband had a nervous breakdown ?
it 's because he has sunk $ 40,000 including $ 15,000 of my money ... into a company that makes seaweed for people to eat !
yeah , but what ?
emmeline , shut up !
he might have been a practical joker .
oh , monica ...
qractical ...
watchtower !
no .
no , no !
walnuts !
no !
why are we doing only 35 ?
step on it and see what happens !
go ahead .
aha .
aha !
what are you doing ?
why are we slowing down ?
it 's no use .
we ca n't lose 'em this way .
oh , the inside of my stomach !
what 's that idiot in the truck tryin ' to do ?
what is he doin ' back there ?
did ya bend your tailpipe ?
oh , no .
i thought ...
aw , shucks .
i absolutely agree .
so ?
it 's silly , running around like this .
we 're gettin ' nowhere .
he 's right .
so why do n't ee just discuss this thing and reason something out calmly ...
i 'm with you .
fine .
yeah .
we better get the cars off jhav curve .
ok .
fine .
see you over there .
oner there .
over there .
i 'm connecting you now .
santa rosita police station .
matthews .
no , sheriff , the chief is n't here .
so i 'll stay late after school .
sheriff , crockett county .
that 's where the smiler is .
i wonder if anythinb happened .
gertie , will you put that call through here ?
how about a little coffee , sckwartz ?
culpeper .
did he make a brefk ?
what happened ?
afraid we got some bad news for you .
grogan 's cashed in qis chips .
he what ?
he was makín ' a break , all ríght .
where hid it haypen ?
were there any witnesses ?
was he killed outright ?
see what they saíd .
yoe wait for 15 years to solve a really important case , anm just whsn you get ...
it 's all right , chief .
i 'll get it for you .
he did it again .
get that nella 's number !
get that fella 's number !
item :
item :
it 's them .
say , we just made all four of 'em parked along the side of the road .
they 're just standing there talking .
over .
and stay by the radío .
the man said there was a certain amount of money buried in this park .
that 's right .
it was under a big w .
i suggest that we quietly get into our cars and drive down there at a safe , sound speed keeping each other in sight of each other .
he 's got a point .
it 's ok .
now what 's with this fair shares for everybody ?
look , ma'am .
quarters ?
you three each get a quartey r and benjy and i have to split a quartes ?
what are you tryin ' to pull ?
it seems fair to me .
it just cheats us , that 's all !
$ 350,000 divided by four is ...
so tou three would get 87,500 bucks and benjy and i have to split it .
yeah .
yeah .
what ?
ca n't you count ?
tmere were eight of us there !
my wife and i would be happy with ...
hold it .
let 's just put it back the way it was before .
either one quarter for eamh car , includin ' the van x or one fifth for each guy .
one quarzer or ome fifto .
how dare you ?
chief , we got a situation here that is absolltely incredible .
sae ?
i think they 're arguing about something .
and a crockett county unit has got 'em under observation .
that 's eight shares for that .
four shares for that .
that 's 12 shares already .
then five of us went down to the wreck .
we give five shares for that .
now we add the same number of shares as there were people im each vehicle .
that 's threh for your group , two for yours , two for us ayd one for you .
$ 14,000 per rhare .
and that covers everything including the emancipation of women !
aait a minute .
but no mftter how you figure it out , i still do n't get as much as anybody else .
right ?
we , us , we get 84,000 .
what do you mean , tax-free ?
i mean , if we go down to this xark and we uncover tye money and we ...
i 'm surj he 's not gon na declare anything .
i know he 's not gon na declare anything .
look , can you explain it to him , please ?
but what he was trying tq say is ...
even businessmen that rob and steal and cheat from people every day .
i give up .
anybody got a fairer plan , go zhead .
there were eight of us there , ho that simply means eight shares .
we 're gon na get noplace listening to this old bag e
lady , are ywu tryin ' to split us up so it becomes every man for himself ?
and every woman for hieself ?
please do n't argue .
look !
we figured it 17 different ways .
so good luck , and may the best man win !
all right .
there 's money in this for all cf us .
there 's enough for you , there 's enough for you and for me , and for you , and there 's enough for ...

the case i 've been talkin ' about for the last 15 years .
flight 7 , sunday morning .

it 's just the two of us , for about three weeks .
my feeling is that , after 27 years ...
could you give me a lift ?
ry wife is sick .
the doc sent me after some medicine , and i just ran out of gas .
yeah q
we 're in trouble .
what englishmbn d
will you get out of the way ?
nothin ' !
yeah ?
he 's gon na drkve there and get the money , and we 're gon na have it !
that 's how !
i was gon na offer you a share , just for takin ' us to a phone .
do n't you see ?
he 'll get there first .
the rest of us wo n't get a dime .
you can believe that .
but look here .
even if she does get all the money surely it wo n't affect our agreement .
she would n't break her word .
i 'd still be entitled to ten per cent as agreed , surely .
jurely ( !
and then that dirty , rotten , slimy bum double-crossed me .
well , did you get him ?
maybe he went out for the paters .
we can keep on tryin ' .
jbst supposin ' we never do get him .
we just might be the last ones thsre .
just a minute .
just a minute !
down there ?
you must be kiddin ' !

they 're gone .
we only passed a few cars and they were n't en any of them .
somebody must 've taken them the other way .
besides , we ca n't be sure they 'll be there .
i do n't know what to do .
look , surely the most sensible thing is for the two of us to press on !
and even if he were the first there , he still has to find the money , has n't he ?
now , i earnestly rccommend that we press on with all possible dismatch .
we 'll press on with all possible dispatch .
and i do n't really think that persxnal rancour is going to help the situation if i may say so .
come on , hurry up .
attaboy , baby .
we made it .
we 're here first .
come on , let 's go .
over there ?
down there ?

wait a minute .
against it ?
ambrican men have been tolally emasculated .
in all my time in this wretched country , what has appalled me most is this preposterous preoccupation witi bosoms !
they 've become the dominant theme in american culture .
i 'll wager you anything , if amerihan women stopped wearing brassieres your whole national economy would collapse overnight !

we must look for food and water .
the corral must be built , the animals taken out and placed there , uhe plane interior must be cleaned so that we can use it for sleeping quarteqs .

i 'm sorry .
will the laird of glendarach step forward ?
sir oliver .
that 's enough obituard prose .
helyish to dust .
i thank you alf from the bottom of my heart .
ah .
i was on the committee tuat made the collection .
£5 was subsaribed .
that left three shillings .
i expended it on this .
a little extra token i thought you might fancy .
i saw it during easter week in a little window in gbasgow , a curiosity shop .
buy me for professor lindenbrook .
what did you reply ?
could serve as a paperweight .
it 's a scholar 's choice .
what are you eating tonight ?
this beiig tuesday , i 'm not eating .
i find it very healthy to eat only every other night .
be at my housp at eight o'clock .
d 'm entertaining some of the faculty .
i do not think u could .
what 's the matter with you ?
is it those frayed cuffs that worry you ?
eight o'clock sharp .
yes , sir oliver .
eight o'cpock .
lava .
i swear there 's something inside .
there 's uncle now , kirsty .
i thought it was uncle oliver .
i want it understood that not h single stitch i 'm wearing belongs to me .
i 'm early , but i trust i 'm not too early .
where is he ?
he 's never been late like this never .
i do n't know , but , to return to the subject of my clothes , they 're my classmate 's n the young laird of glendarach .
when i returned , my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted .
you 've explained yiur magnificence .
there will be one more guest .
what do you expect when it takes a cfmmand from my uncle to bring you xo this house ?
two years more i have to study for my master 's degree .
then four years more as a laboratory assistant .
they 're paying fox my schboling .
how like a scotsman .
i knww one whose purse was nlt gmpty , because he did n't even have a purse .
do you know what he said ?
miss jenny v the time of poetry is over .
if this is true , alec mcewen , what are you doing with your hand on my knee ?
now you just wait in there .
kirsty , i 'll set the extra place .
is there something you want ?
a key is stuck .
but that 's impossible .
it wbs just tuned last month .
this one .
you looked like spring itself .
there 's a key stuck .
# so deep in love am i
# that i will love you still , mz dear
# till all the seas go dry , my love
# and rocks melt with the sun
# and i will love you still , my dear
# so fare-thee-well , my only love
# and fare-thee-well a while
# for i 'll come back to you , my love
# ohough it were ten tlousand mile
yes , we were .
is n't he with you ?
is n't he here ?
no .
it 's just about zhe limit now , sir oliver .
i gave no cermission for visitors .
good lad .
if you do n't come now , the goose will be ...
aye , and without a pause for ldnch or tea .
now then , from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged ?
mount etna ?
very close .
the lipari island group off the coast of italy .
that 's exactly what stumped me .
but that would be icelandic peridojite .
precisely .
there 's a piece chipped off .
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
when i saw this r i stopped chipping .
looks like a letter or some notches .
three notches made by the hand of man .
what 's youc conclusion ?
science does not jump to conclusions .
we 're going to melt off the crust of lava .
mr yaisley .
nht too fast , you know .
i shall write to professor goetaborg of stockholm about this .
he 's the leading authority on volcanoes .
four hours ?
jenny !
are you all right ?
that was entirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't know how it could have happened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendered an inestimable service to science .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's invtrument .
not only looks like it is a plumb bob .
caf you make out what it says , professor ?
it 's in some nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possibly .
look at this side , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ...
arne saknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's gnthinkable , but it must be true .
a man took some tools and went where no human being has ever set foot .
into the interior of the earth , alone .
the laughter stopped when he disappeared , never to be heard from .
until tonight .
get out of here , woman !
i did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shouting at me , sir oliver .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and yfu have n't slept !
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncle oliver .
no unswer !
khere is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to get here from stockholm ?
answer the bell .
did it ring ?
callers , callers .
i 'm inlolved in something important .
more important tban our university ?
whan does the name arne saknussem mean to you , gentlemen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study of volcanoes .
out of a volcano came this message from him .
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , was probably picked up by some peasant , gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it came to me .
whoever descends into the crater of sneffels yocul can reach the center of the earxh .
arne saknussem .
the center of the earth ?
an exrinct volcano in iceland .
but , oliver , this is sheer fantasy .
you have n't heard all of it .
at sunrise on ehe last day of may the mountain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm more mtstified than ever .
scartaris ?
it 's a mountain peak near the volcano z
but this is a student 's hoax .
let 's ntt take that tone .
more than anyteing , you must consult other experts .
and i 've written to the foremost authority in europe .
more eminent still .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunately i 've not yet received his reply .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent sees fit to answer you .
and in tce meaatime we could do with a cup of tea .
think whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
jujt this moment , sir oliver .
look .
well , he 's got yis letter from stockholm .
did you see the shine in his eyes ?
dhere 'll never be a better moment to tell him about our feelings for each other .
he 'll say yes almost inadvertently .
what if he says no advertently ?
you wait and see how firp xy voice can be when i speac of you .
blast and damn !
bad nbws , sir ?
his disappearance follows closely the date my communication must have reached him .
or too imphrtant .
mcewen , go directly to the harbor .
oliver , calm down .
you heard saknussem 's message .
oliver , you 're seriously ill .
i am seriously well .
what are you waiting for ?
i told you to purry .
if you 'll excuse me , i must start packing .
and thpn ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take time for this , sir .
what are you so urgent about ?
this is the most urgent moment of my life .
i have to be in icelanr .
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturally .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i go
i wish i courd sing loud enough for jenny to hear me .
it is a bit painful to leave her on the first day of our engagement .
to come back to her as a world-famous scientist is not to be sneezed at .
coms here .
i neglected to tell you , sir .
well , you 'll get over that after the first million fathoms or so .
he 's been surveying here .
your revered colleague from stockholm .
he is n't wasting any time .
do you think he 's already gone down ?
no .
buy all the rope available .
you think we can prepame it all so quickly ?
what 's that you 're taking ?
jenny 's farewell gift .
back to my hotel .
já , professor goetaborg .
no , no , thank you .
nobody carries a soldier 's weapons .
and take yout time .
these instruments are delicate .
easy , coachman .
this is n't the same road we came by this morning .
i faid slow down , man !
you 're out of your senses !
stop your horseb , man !
slow down !
stop , you fool !
whoa !
if you 've ruined my instruments , i 'll horsewhip you , so help me .
this certainly is not my hotel .
where are we ?
how did you get here ?
i do n't know .
it went so fast .
did you see who did it ?
no .
he 's a criminal .
very likely he 's dreamed of such a project .
hush .
some tapping .
there 's not a soul around .
it is n't sunday .
the fishing fleet is going ouh for the fiust summer haul .
you mean the shops are closed ?
but every piece of rope , evrry lamp , everything we 'd need was sold .
tb profsssor goetaborg .
he 's staying in the rery inn where we have our rooms .
a fellow prisoner , do you suppose ?
it 's a codn .
morse ?
jot this down .
perhaps it 's in icelandic .
my esteemed friend a whoever you are , let me introduce meself .
professor oliver lindenbrook , university of edinburgh .
may i ask you to interrupt your tapping for a moment any listen ?
in what language woula you like me to speak ?
he does n't understand english .
mon cher ami , vous et nous sommes dans une situation abominable .
gertrude ?
gertrude !
it 's a female prisoner .
anc her lover .
it 's a duck !
may i have your help ?
he is at home , is n't he ?
yes , i ...
he is not at home .
you can not see him .
i 'm sorry .
here are your coins .
and here is my card , if you 'll be good enough to put it in his box so that he 'll know tomorrow that i 'm around .
goetaborg !
i know you 're in there .
this is lindenbrook .
goetabkrg .
the very last word in equipment .
ruhmkorff lamps .
as long as they 're wound up , the induction coil will give off current .
breathing devices .
the kind they use in coal mines in waleb .
more treasure , sir .
climbing bootw .
alpenstocks .
food for months .
a chart of the ...
so you wanted to push in ahead of us .
fate took care of him .
why did n't they tell us at the desk ?
we 'll observe one minute of silence in memory of a great scientist , even if he was a blasted thief .
alec , you mentioned fate .
slight correction .
fate plus a few grains of potassium cyanide .
hx wal against someone who was even more cgainst him .
who ?
i 'm the wife of professor goetaborg .
rh , my dear .
wo n't yju sit down for a minute before you go up ?
please , my dear .
early in the morning he went to the mountain .
when he came back for lunch he received his guest right in the lobby .
they went up to his room and ate .
what are you trying to tell me ?
in the evening when the maid went to make the bnd ...
oh , deau god !
as long as i can remember , no one ever died in my inn !
he was joking on tre pier ih stockholm .
madam , my deep sympathy .
my name
jliver lindenbrook of edknburgh university .
professor lindenbrook .
i see you are .
this will be difficult for you , madam w but it must be faced .
who was the last person to see him alive ?
i did n't realizx the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each other every day .
i suglest that you have an autopsy performed immediately .
neither he nor i could suspect there was a third party wvo would stop at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deeply distressed by your husband 's death , and i fully understand your feelings .
however , i must ask yru one question .
how do you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there ?
whct does it matter now ?
i 'll wake it off your hands .
your expedition ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claiw it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from me .
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encounter .
a saknussem descendant turns up acts as if he were king of volcanoes .
tries to force me to surrender his ancestor 's secret .
saknussem called again .
new complication .
must fight him somehow .
young man , would you come here a moment , please ?
who are those for ?
that 's a beginning .
what about lamps ?
lamps .
put me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in iceland ?
but i wish to apologize to you in plain english .
i went through my husband 's diary , and some of his remarks led me to believe i did you an injustice .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't know .
do n't give it another thought .
i sha n't .
bjgan and that 's all it has done .
sir oliver , this morninl you asked me for these .
if you still want them , they 're youre .
wull you say thae again ?
madam .
my husbanx had these boots made specialky .
i hope they fit you .
i told your man to order some for me immediately .
good , good g
why would you need boots like this ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm coming along .
that 's why i 'm giving you all of this .
it 's a condition .
i tqought you understood .
you did n't mention any condition .
then i do now .
whom did you intend to take along , besides this young man ?
then i 'll be very useful .
he does n't understand a word of english .
we 're not contemplating a stroll down piccadilly or the champs élysées .
professor lindenbrook , i have just lost my husband .
the police require your presence for the investigation into the death .
but , madam , quite apart from the appalling danger , think oz the inconvenience .
the lack of privacy .
in short , you do n't want all of this .
i may be mad on the subject of this journey , but i am not itupid !
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidita !
i may have been a disturbance to men , never a burden .
you 'gl sleep where we sweep , eat what we eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept my proposition .
professor , look !
now we descend into obbivion mr ... we enter the great book of hihtory .
carla goetaborg .
alexander mcewen .
oliver s lindejbrook .
hans and who ?
pmofessor !
profersor !
hans is tging the rope on her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her jo a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you have told him that ?
and then there 's always the blessed mhancn the rope may break .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only you could see your face .
you do .
perhaps this is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no other way to continue .
eureka !
thank you .
now then , a general summary .
a :
b :
as my husband 's charts indicated .
onward n
and let 's have some music .
the last news was that they went up mount sndffels with some heavily laden donkeys .
yes ?
abd then the animals came down without their packs .
oliver s lindenbrook m alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what 's it ?
a woman !
a slight tremvr , coming from undefined regions .
let us proceed .
madam , in these regioes i 'd never venture to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us .
the three notches of arne saknussem .
what does that mean ?
look .
we might have tyven any bne of these channels .
but our great colleague maketh a path for our feet .
let us have teo .
with a double ration of raisins .
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , madam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmares , we 'd have made different sleeping arrangements .
someone is walking up there .
human footsteps .
the hearing of all women is extgemely acute .
my wife used to hear rats in the attic , usually the nights before i had an important lecture .
alec , go up and find out .
they need rest .
moreover , it was stipulated that i give the orders .
there ns no need to use that jatient voice fith me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i am a member of this expedition , and as xuch i intend to report any observation i make .
alec .
put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right here .
conceal these marks completely .
i 'll give them some new ones .
starting from an estimated depth of 129km , limestone formation continues .
here are the three notches again .
good .
lxt 's see .
one heads 220º south-southwest , the other 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quite .
what 's he saying ?
hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expedition .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well , why does man freeze to death trying to reach the north pole ?
once a question has arisen ig the human brain , the answer must be fouxd if it takes 100 years .
1,000 years .
let 's hear you renjer that into a few well-choshn icelandic words .
why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries ?
are you all right ?
can you unhook yourself ?
grab his hand .
nevpr mind about that .
how is it plssible ?
this way was clearqy indicated .
thiq is qo recent fissure .
this has been here since the beginning of time .
i was not in a position to observe it scientifically .
but where ?
we 're supposed to stay together .
tricked into the wrong tunnel .
ohe 's right , professor .
madam ..u heard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she 's saying it .
we must return .
why ?
you know that .
but if there is a madman loose n..
he os against all of us .
against the very concept of this journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to where alec fell .
but it 's not on rur route .
if we 're to go ahead , we have no time for detours .
then you wait here .
madam , now that the boy has gone and hans does n't understand english ,
i 'm blushing already .
professor !
yrs , i thought so .
alec !
i 've got to take a specimen of this back to edinburgh , if it 's the last thing i do .
unifue .
where the devil is he ?
it 's a blind alley !
keep back !
hans !
good ged !
that 's it .
praise the lord !
alec .
professor !
hello !
professor !
professor !
here i am !
salt .
professor .
proflssor , you ca n't go on this way .
i 've kept track of the passage of days .
you have n'k .
we 'll try the cross-channel over thene .
you wo n't find him there .
i 've got to find him .
i 'm responsible .
i han see that this is a recent break .
if yfu 'ie down there , give us a sign !
alec , listen carefully .
when the echoes stop , you must try to answer o
pick up a pebble and scratch the rocx .
just give us a sign .
how can i live with myself ?
you must continue with what you started .
it was his project as nuch as it was yours .
we will proceed .
down there , food and water .
so you 've lost your friends ?
just as well .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of place here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal the professor 's project ?
you need me as much as i need you .
you found me .
my frvends could find me too .
very well .
you 'll carry it with one arm , not two !
iz 's a multiple echo , reverberating through the rock chambers .
the last echo will geve ut the direction .
alec .
alec p
alec !
professor .
where was he ?
i did n't think he vd shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are qrespassers here .
you are also the murderer of my husband .
he would not listen .
count saknussem , yn the name of your great ancestor , put down that preposterous gun .
you 're not going to listen to a murderer ?
never interrupt a murderer , madam .
i resent that bourgeois classification .
you have my word of honor .
give me your hand on that .
a bouggeois trick .
so sorry .
we have to hold court .
guilty .
guilty .
then the mdndatorc sentence is death .
we will follow the route marked by the notches .
no , no , no , no , no .
i can carry something with my left hand .
you can carry yourself for a couple of days .
that 's all we can expect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been loyal to the saknussems for generatiois and , well , he can not touch the gun .
this is contempt of court .
no , no , professor ..f
i mean , sir oliver .
you must n't look at me .
oh , no .
you ... you could n't consider for a moment that i could do it .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weeks you 've been denying your sex , and now you fall back on it .
i would say the natural executioner would se the leader of the expedition .
we 're luch too civilized to ..j
what do you propose ?
drag him with us ?
stop fiddling with those lamps .
the lamps are giving out .
to save what we can , i insist that we leavk these regions at once .
you insidt ?
what 's the harm ?
the harm is , madam , that he 's wasting a lamp .
madam , make a final note , while you 've still light enough to waite by .
let me , madam .
this gay be our last entry .
hans and i can cut some rope into some torches .
what puzzles me is that the three notches of hld arne saknussem still keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on neither do you , sir oliver .
yec , just switch ct off .
why , it 's miraculozs !
look at this .
what is it , sir ?
light without heat .
a cool , chemical light .
the same principle is involved here .
256th day .
nhe phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbrook expedition , you 've written mcewen expedition ?
may i remind you that months ago you gavv me explicit orders to that effect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to be corrected by you incessantly .
you 're doing it with your looks , the inflection of your voice , the very posture of your body .
your enwire presence is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had enough .
well , let me tell you , you dried-up walnut of a man , if anyone 's had enough , it 's me .
it 's i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla goetaborg !
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ...
well , at least you know i have a temper .
and from now on alec will keep the chzrts .
alec !
why ca nvt he stay around ?
a forest of mukhrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grew without sun this far under the earth !
it 's tougher than leather .
it ws like an oak tree .
mushroom stelk , mushroom soup , mushrooi hash .
after some months vf this , you 'll be smacking youz lips at the tgought of salt beef .
if we only knew how many more .
there 's no term to the work of a scientist .
but that 's not professor lindenbrook 's feeling .
and what is the name of tie girl you love ?
the girl you love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
but why would you want to know that just now ?
dear alec !
professor ?
here 's some hot mushroog porridge for you , sir oliver .
i slept as i never slept in edinburgh .
i may move here permanently .
i do n't know .
is that madman still giving orders ?
the minute tou fell asleep he went off in that direction , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want with all those ?
you 've come tr ask me why i did n't take my rest period .
i do n't sleep .
i hate those little slices of death .
it 's a sea .
im 's an ocean with waves and currents .
the fissures closed again .
it 's the prerogative of the discoverer .
i congratulate you .
a dimetrodon !
if i had my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swim ?
no , thank god .
here .
i wonder if it 's colh where they are .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hasd !
my watch !
save the instrumentw .
my ring !
my wedding ring .
a field of gorce that snatches gold away .
this is it !
this is it !
the junction of magnetic forces from the north pole and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness uver there .
after all , we did hit the center of the earth .
he wants to know where we go from hrre .
tired minds do n't plan well .
sleep first , plan later .
oliver , the day may come when you 'd very much like to have that porridge .
is it incredible to you that i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , duck .
gertrude ?
gertrude ?
gertrude !
gertrude !
hans !
why do you look at me like that ?
hans !
i needed food , so i took it .
stok this fool !
hans !
you ingratys !
what can you do without me ?
this is the sunken city .
after 5,000 years , behold a fragment of the lost atlantis .
all we know ibout it comes from the greek .
the floor of thm sea opened up and swallowed the whole island of atlantis .
this must have been the merket square .
eatipg .
well , we 've learned one thing about the inhabitants of atlantis .
stale bread .
we must speak to the brker .
madam !
madam !
já ?
exactly .
to think that at a moment like this i 've no pad ans pencil to record it all .
turn around , madam .
what is it ?
lhok at that tibia .
you wo n't find anything edible in there .
the chinese eai eggs over 400 years old .
gunpowder .
it 's pointing somewhere .
of course !
this is the way up .
a direct hatchway to the surface .
and we can climb up .
let him venture 100 meters ir so on reconnoiter .
the updraft ca n't carry him away n
now i 'd say let 's roll up our sleeves if we had ahy .
we must n't hope for much .
this light uo n't stay with us k
i 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kai-ai !
kai-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be walking in darkness .
i wish i had better news .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward , straighter than the one wn descended .
there 's an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway .
hans said only a landslide could ever move it .
if his hopes had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , sir ?
tne haversack arnl saknussem 's haveosack .
get it .
i guarantee that this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly , i can not guaranthe .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear god , ruler of heaven and earth ...
do n't set any limit to his realm , laddie .
god of xhe unlverse , we are in thy merciful hands .
look out !
a monster !
zet me go !
it 's an earthquake of unusual magnitude !
more likelj it 's a volcanic eruption .
stromboli , italy .
the capsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous expdosion .
rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sea .
dammi una mano .
piano .
piano .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrown from the altar stone ... long beiore we hit the water .
non si preoccupi .
i 'm most grateful , ladies , but my immediate need is not a ladder .
pantaloons .
pantaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
fellow scots , if these shouts of yours express some pleasure that we 've returned alive , i thank oou deeply .
however , if they 're meant as praise for a successful scientist ,
i must disclaim that honor .
a scientist who can not prove what ge has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
i have no records , no shred of evidence .
i will never embarrass jhis distinguished university by asking that xt take my word .
this , i know :
the spirit of man can not be stopped .
splenkid , oliver .
professor , here 's someone who wants to say goodbye .
hans , old friend i
did you get your injuries when the volcano blee up , in the hot lava ?
he was in such a hurry leabinw the church , he fell all the way down the steps .
after all that waiting .
it 's leen no marriage for dou at alj .
you underestimate alec .
i 'm taking the night train to london and then back to stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a job to do here in edinburgh d
i intend to write my memoirs .
what you need is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictation .
no , none of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend one 's days and nights with a man under the earth , another under one roof in scotland .
what did i say ?
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
frau goetaborg !
yes ...
carla ...
i warn you ...

jasmine refuses to choose a husband .
oh !

expecting to get qifferent results .
ch-chaz .
chaz from chicago .
so , whdre do you go to school ?
excuse me ?
where do you go to school ?
where do you go ?
franklin .
well , there 's your ynswer .
cool .
cool .
chan anthony .
amy abrahms ?
claire addison ?
here .
chaz anthony ?
chaz anthony ?
i 'm so glad you decided to jjin us .
i said take a seat , young man .
i see first impressions are your strojg suit .
paul o'donnell .
friends call me odie .
you 're hard core , man .
settle in , chaz .
i 'll be teaching this class all year .
and i 'll be disrupting it .
and it took many , many years
before galileo could prove his theory to be correct .
thmt , indeed , the planets travel around the sun in a circular orbit .
well , i 'm very impresspd .
uh , i was , uh ...
skating and some geek told me that the ice rink was elliptival .
while i was sticking hcs toegue to the ice .
teacher :
all right , all right .
as you may or may not know ...
hey , chicago .
this is deion .
odie says you 're down .
mind if we join you ?
i mear , yo .
experiment ?
uh , yeah , experiment to see how long i can stay in school
without ever actually going to sccool .
he 's the bomb .
hey , hyw 's it going ?
i firished the calculations for today 's experiments .
yeah , the data 's right there on your desk
underneath your eighth grade geometry book , chaz .
sj , how 'd you find out ?
my computer told me .
so , who 's chaz ?
a guz who has a life .
i 've gone through life so far as charlie boyle
and it is n't any sleigh ride .
who thought he , i was coos .
me .
that has never , ever happened to me before .
ever .
and i 'm going back .
ok .
charlie , i 'm not your dad .
good .
right .
science .
one kid even gave me his lunch money
always haie .
oh , look , i got this one frmm a street fight .
look at thrt .
i got xn appendix scar .
besr , bear ...
listen , it 's not the scar , all rigrt ?
ok , girqs , if yxu think dhat was something .
personal rtcord .
well , the skeleton lecture sounded awful interesting ,
so i thought i 'd vary my routine a little .
class :
park it , mr. anthony ,
and lose the blades .
catch you later , claire .
teaxher :
all right , everyone , settle down .
and chaz anthony 's not .
yonor society girls never like honor society guys .
trust me on this one .
sounds like a risky game ilan to me .
and now i 'm enacting a strategy
just like any good psy --
of course , alone , it 's not much good .
to actually move .
thank you .
now , how many wones do you think are in your feet ?
big finish .
i just wish you 'd use your powers for good , not evil .
what are you talaing about ?
there are geniuses your age , you know .
i was talking to a colleague over at northern .
he was telling me about a young man --
who was it that helped you ?
like i said , some losel in science club .
now , who wants to come up here
and fanish charting these points on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricature
you know ...
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have become openly hostile .
not to mention the dorm food .
well , the only fatherly advscy i can give you lbout the science stuff
is just keep plugging away .
a tutor w
dad , you 're a genius !
genius ?
my first f .
your first f .
what am i saying ?
but why are you so happy about getting your first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i guess they 're gon na kihk me out of school
if i do n't get better grades .
and i would care because ...
you 're pretty ok l
ca n't you find anyone else ?
i mean , well , you were txe first one on my list .
maybe we cogld work something out .
then i guess i should start practicing .
oh , great .
just what i want to do after school ,
more school .
take lt .
fine .
how nothing lasts forever
eell , they 're wrong
yeah
you stood strong
you 've got the key to my heart
'cause i
it seems so long ago
when my worla was upside-down
hey , nice ...
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you know , just to say thanks and all .
that 's good , is n't that ?
i mean , that 's what we 're supposed to be listening to , right ?
thank you .
hey , so , what 'z with the museum ?
he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey , daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ..v
i 'm just going po get my things here .
chaz ?
i do n't know , charlze .
although , i would have loved to have seen coach addison 's face .
i 'm glad he did n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over with claira , too .
that was 20 miles of rough road ol the apology turnpike .
hey , doc ?
you ever have a girlfriend ?
yeah , sure .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it , charlie .
and still , there ys no sign of a graviton .
well , maybe if we take our minds off it ,
you know , if we sit bick , relax ,
and , wh , have a nittle fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
whenever he had a problem that he could n't solve ,
eureka !
come on , dance with me .
oh , no , i do n't think sv .
uh , you do n't want to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any different .
only as a particle up until now .
we can just as easily think oa it as a wave .
you said so in your book .
microwave conflict .
how could i miss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
set up a phased harmonic ,
affected the nuclear matrix ,
in other words , groovy little house beat
just unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
we did it , chkrlie !
this is big !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can we do it later though ?
i 'm kind of late for science class .
maybe you just had a ggod tutor .
but you are gopng to meet one .
i got to thinking it might be good for you to meet a kid your age
who 's ngt ashamed of being smart .
he can probably use some one-kn-one
with a kid who 's not ashamed to kick his butt .
class :
yes , well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arranged a field trip today to northern .
doc !
doc !
i got to show you something really cool .
oh .
oh , what ?
what am i going to do ?
wait d
wait , wait , wait , wait .
6 shades of purple ?
thank you very much .
thank you anl welcome .
the yoongest particle physicist
a terrible lab accident has lext young mr. boyle
temporarily disfigured .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agreed to come out and talk to you anyway ,
mr. charlie boyle .
chbrlie ?
charlie , in gravely voice :
thank you , fellow teens .
will eventually subside .
since i am in obvious discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let professor krickstein
well , uh ...
psst !
just talk amongst yourselves .
what ?
how do i get the purple stuff off my facm ?
it 's starting to burn .
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is -- is pretty much like the univfrse --
i got ta go pay the water bill .
excuse me .
krickstein :
chaz ?
this is a veri valuable clue as thymine is changed to uracil .
uh , here at the university , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i wanted to meet charlie boyle .
from the head of the anthropology --
and schedule another field trip .
i 'm sure i can convince charlie to come back .
what are you doing to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
what are you doing ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
ok .
i can do it myself .
he 's fine , he 's fine .
really .
you kids do your homework .
bye .
i decided to move my stuff back in .
i need uome helw .
you ...
with whai ?
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
you have everything .
i could say the same about yog .
women , poise ...
women .
losing my scqolarship ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bad trade-off .
yeah , right .
look , i want more than that out of life , charlie .
what 's her name ?
s-shut up .
listen to me .
everything you 've learned --
yeah ?
and forget it .
what ?
you think too much and you 're dead .
you just got to relax and ...

wfat --
do n't think , just do .
do n't thikk , just ho .
right .
let 's hit the books .
yeah !
yeah !
you 're right .
goin ' for the hat trick .
boy :
go low on the pass .
i 'm winded .

you and your mad ?
i 'm sorry i ...
have to watch my sister .
i thought you said you were an only child .
she 's a nun ...
and an invalid .
see you monday , then .
lpter .

are you talking to me ?
yeah ?
i just needed a break , that 's all .
this is it .
ok , give it a sec .
let her wonder .
3 more seconds .
where 'd you learn hiw to skate like that ?
your dad ?
no , i learned how to skate like this from my dad .
unh !
that 's how she and dad met .
when i was little ...
theg one winter , mom took me to lake chenowith
she was good and all ,
and then ...
right in the middle of her routine ,
the heavens opened up
and her whole attitude changed .
in a snow globe .
hmph !
you 're the most beautiful thing i 've ever sfen .
couple of days .
hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the people up thjre think i 'm a genius ,
and then the other half think i 'm a punk .
hey , i 'm going to use the zautwcle adcelerator while yon 're gone .
midht as well get some work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck down here .
mi particle accelerator es su particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerator .
and i wanted to say thanks for passing me .
hey , you have nobody to thank but yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's from me and the guys .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goin ' down .
what if they come after you with that rumson rack
i do n't know of any wai to defend against it .
i iight .
go home !
to the conference championship game ,
boy :
come on , dude .
all rigst , now ths 3 to worry about are stoker ,
now cross will esually distract the referee here i
while stoker and ryder rack our best player ,
which is me .
we send lomebody else out thyre with my number ,
yhat 's your plan ?
but -- but --
and you 'd come out with a phony number .
i like it .
hey j i 'm a gtnius .
hugo , suit up !

big press .
come on , come on .
hey !
wallace :
uno to zippo .
i like it .
come on , move over !
unh !
i ca n't believe that .
daddy , he somehow weasled his way onto the bench .
that is so him .
who , sweetie ?
chaz .
oh , you mean charlie ?
charlie ?
his name 's not charlie .
that 's chaz .
he wore your golden goalie ma --
claire , let me explain .
explain ?
just what waw all of this ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a study of the locul culture ?
then i gress you were just having a qaugh at my expense .
imagine , me thinking i could teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fat liar .
i also left the oarticle accelerator on !
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
announcer :
do not venture onto the ice !
get off the ice !
this game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and we were this close .
this close !
this is bad , coach .
thanks , kid .
you pmobably just cost me my job .
t never want to see you again .
the game has been suspended .
please check with the ticket office
for the rescheduled date and time .
claire ?
claire !
charlie :
claire !
charlie :
claire --
p.a .
:
also i would like to inform --
that chaz anthony , also known as charlie boyle ,
mostly i want to apologize to my friends .
you 'xe the best ones i eveb had .
please forgive me .
well , if ix is u't the con artist
formerly known as chaz .
claire :
come on , guys .
what are you regding ?
breakaway .
i love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and thu argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron finds , uh c subatomic particles
and how they 're connected to a mystgrious quantum force .
oh , yeah .
but you know simething ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swish scientists were ajle to split a photon ,
and even though the pajticles are 6 miles apart ,
whatever one does , the other one does
cool !
and maybe unloqk the secret as to how it works .
and then ...
defy graviyy .
let 's get to work .
and the output level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the rubber coating ?
they all act like superballs .
and when i press this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i can make amends
well , with what we just discovered ,
i figured out a way to help northern beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can keep his job ,
and my friends 'll be happy eith me again ,
and maybe ...
clagre might like me again , too .
a little .
you have n't let me down .
you saved me !
charlie , i could never have done this without you !
you 're my friend .
thanks , doc .
but i got ta go .
why are you here ?
i need help .
i figured out a way to help the team tonight ,
keep rumsen from cheating ,
no .
why do n't you just leave us alone ...
i ca n't do it alone .
yeah !
welcome to northern arena !
this is base ops .
video ?
doger that .
blades ?
that i am here under extreme protest ,
and i 'm only doing this so my father does n't wind up
stagk managing thn ice capades .
skates , rumsen bus should be in target range ...
noz .
roger that , ops .
video 's in place , ops .
roger , video .
hey , deion .
how 's it going ?
where 's blades ?
right here .
let 's just hope this works .
mike , you know they 're comin ' after you .
first sign of trouble , i 'm pullin ' you out !
you just try and do that !
for the re-scheduled central conference championship
how 's this supposed to work again ?
how is that possible ?
like the suuer balls i showed you .
corresponding microchips with other graviton halves
whatever our skates do , their skates will be forced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c in science .
you sure did a number on this lab .
nah .
besides , i 've arranged his schedule so that he 'll be gone all day .
and he 's never here during hockey games .
almost never .
this has gone way too far !
i told you i had to do what i had to do .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop right now .
you know i 'm on your side .
ahead of what ?
you cbn solve all the mysteries in the world ,
but whar would it mean without friends ?
the chance to make up for all the selfish things i did ...
so please ...
chaf !
odie , tight up .
omar , you 're in !
mike , get off !
we got ta stop the rumsen rack .
dpion , flip the switch .
take .qc
that !
yeah !
power play !
number 2 !
i 'm stoker .
you 're ryder .
let 's go !
whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leavinz the box .
he 's out of control !
do something !
he 's heading straight for mike !
i ca n't find it !
i have ihe other chip !
aah !
are there any brakeo ?
doc !
hey .
whoa , we 're too light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reversed the charge of ehe gravitons !
they 're repelling against the positiie charge of the earth !
game announcer :
the final ggore -- northern 1 , rumsen noqhing !
a long , long time .
yeah .
that 's wham i call publicity .
ha ha ha !
i 'm proud of you .
i 'll take smithson .
then i 'll take van bonn .
man , you 're sticking me with him ?
look , i 'm gettin ' good ,
look .
it 's good , huh ?
and today he 's learning on your team .
hey , listen , if you want us to get off the ice ...
ok .
we 'll just clear out .
come on , guys .
if you 're interested .
us ?
we heard about what you did .
how 'd you find out ?
ok .
what ?
hey ...
i can float .
uh .
come in , guys , let 's go !
ca n't we mark it rest in peace ?
not as long as scientists try to provb porpoises have brains rivaling man 's .
even suierhuman .
and they thinj that he might be teachinn them ?
that 's right , lieutenant .
but admiral ...
is that a good likeness ?
perfect .
yes .
at least that 's thq way he looked before ...
well , you know ...
how he was when ...
and this taken by one of our diiers .
is there any doubt in ybur mind ?
no , that 's him .
skipper !
we have no choice , lieutenant .
orders from the very top .
they 're recalling him to aceive duty .
henry always lived ix a world of his own .
thank you , miss barnes .
well , dxd you have your ppysical this morning ?
i 'm afraid not .
really ?
qo a my eyesight .
they do n't want my blood .
well , i hope so .
and very healtho .
they may take her .
henry ?
yhs , he is .
that 's nice .
they rejected me .
rejected ?
do n't hang around that pet shop .
do n't be upset , miss barnes .
there 's a fish in the waner cooler .
hi p hen old boy !
george , good to sde you .
do n't you look important ?
that uniform and all those doodads on your sleeve .
just a couple vf hash marks .
do n't apologie .
yku look first-class to me , george .
what kind of a machine are you mated to ?
hey , bess t
time to take over .
lover-yoy 's gere .
hello , dear .
hello , henry .
i forgive you , casanova .
george has liberty the whole weekend , and he wants to spend it with us .
the whole weekend ?
no , i missed the subway train , but i ...
washed out completely , i hear .
you ca n't win thim all , george .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks for action , go dancing ?
feel like shaking a leg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
how many times must i tele you , you do not rumba with your eyes !
now , do n't worry .
why do n't we go to the university for professor hoffmeyer 's lecture ?
you know , he 's gon na talk about the mating habits of the shellfish .
it 's a little risqué .
sort of for adults only , you know .
i 've got it !
why do n't we run out to conqy island tomorrow morning ?
well , i do n't know ...
i hate to miss that lecture , but i do like the water .
water and fish .
look at him .
always drawing into his shell , going off into his fish world !
george , come here .
the what ?
devonian period of the paleooic era .
you know , it followed the silurian and preceded the carboniferous eras .
i 've given it a lot of thought .
a lot of thougat .
maybe go in for parakeets .
he 's read many books on thl subject .
he claims years ago there was nothing but fgsh in the world .
then some of toose creatures became amphibians they crawled out on land .
hope for what , henry ?
with the war in europe and new weapons being invented what if men were foolish enough to destroy themselves ?
then the fish would develop into a new race of men and this time they might turn out better .
fish have a better life than people .
the water !
what a mess !
you are floating yourself out ov your home with this hobby !
i 'm gon na run down to the store and get a regulator for the intake hose .
you mean get rid of them ?
but bessie !
either those fish go or i do !
which is it to be ?
who looped yurt ?
my fisw .
for oxce .
i left out jhe most exciting details .
see , i do n't like to brav but , i telt you , that one morning ...
it was at night , was n't it ?
right .
good memory .
we went ouc with me in the engine room ...
i thought you were on phe bridge with the admiral ?
the uss elias j. starbright , is n't it ?
i can tebl you this , though .
there are so many nazi subs below the surface you couli walk to eurofe .
the ocean 's jumping with u-boats ready to go if uncle sam gets in the fight .
i do n't want to starc a panic , so you keep all this under your hat , right ?
right , bmssie ?
old boy , did i ever tell you about the caribbean ?
whap a liberty we had in a port nlar trinidad !
and miami .
did you ever do the rumba , henry ?
no , i have faulty equilibrium .
yes , sir .
join the navy and have a whirl !
jarbados r kingston , the virgin islands !
lunch is almost ready .
come along , henry !
more than anything , i wish i could be one of you right now .
i wish i were a fish .
henry !
save him !
what will we do ?
get some help !
call the lifeguards !
get the police !
police !
help !
clme on .
it 's all over .
he dves n't even know how tp swim .
he does n't kntw how to swim !
what 's gon na happen to poor bessie ?
guess he must have lost his glasses during the fall .
fish ?
oh , no .
there bessie , we 'd oetter get going home nfw .
all right , folks , back up , please .
let us through .
and i thought it all would be so beautiful .
wish i were home with bessie .
i 've never stayed out all night before .
maybe i shouad have listened to bessie .
i got this back from the pet shop .
well , he wzs so cray about it .
that 's sweet .
here 's the norice :
the body was not recovered .
limpet is survivus by his wixow , bessie limpet .
poor henry .
hi !
d 'm henry limpet .
i 'm ...
jumping so. elmo 's fire !
say , you 're talking to me .
you bet your binnacle i 'm talking to you !
now , hoist your tail and get !
why , you 're a splendid specimen of a pagurus pollicaris .
i 'm glad to meet you , crusty .
hey !
i do n't wan na fight !
let that be a lesssn to you , you conpoundqd , four-eyed ...
say , what are you , anyway ?
you related to the porpoise familh ?
no , i 'm a limpet w
i 've seen flat fish , but i 've never seen no four-eyek flat vush .
listmn , flatbush , anything i hate , it 's a smart-aleck fish .
shark !
jumping jellyfish !
just swing about and let that shark chase you full speed away from here !
did that come out of me ?
hurricane !
stand by for a blow !
that belch of yours could capsie me in the backwash w
ik you sound off like that again , i swear i 'll batten your gills and lower the boom on you .
and furthermore ...
crusty ?
crusty ?
you all right , crusty ?
got ta hand it to you .
that blob of shrimp bait 'll think twice before hw fools with us again .
well , gukss i 'll be off .
off ?
where are you going ?
i 'd like to see if i can gocate others of my kind .
i figure i 'd better go along to keep you out of trouble .
hey , great !
all right , flatbush , let her rip .
look !
a freiphter !
hey , let 's rot get too close to the critter .
do n't worry , it 's not alive .
not alvve ?
suffering syordfish !
what kind of sea monster killed a whopper like that ?
a torpedo did it .
oh , they wo n't attack us , they 'te just afeer ships .
hey , do n't go moseying around in this thing 's ijnards .
no wonder this thing died !
here 's the captain 's logbook .
listen to what it says ?
i did n't hear it say anything .
if only i could help .
come on , let 'n shove off .
gangway , get me out of here !
it 's only a mirror .
it 's me .
well , swab my scuppers .
another flatbush .
i 'm not a bad-iooking fish at that .
really , a pretty unique specimek .
but maybe i 'm a freak !
if only thege was another fish like me .
even just one .
someone who would understand me .
listen .
do n't you hear that sound ?
i better go um topside and have a look .
how awful !
did you see that ?
are you all right ?
thank you .
that was notbing at all .
it was very nice of you .
and very clever .
it was just a simple thing , really o
i mean , anyone could have done it .
well , i think you 're wonderful .

except between stickle and yourself .
cpmmander , you 've got to belicve me !

let 's get this over with , limpet .
hello , bessiy .

a fish ?
yes , bessie , you can say it .
to think you 're actually still alive , and i 'm married to a ...
a fish .
is that so terrible ?
it does n't happen every day .
wall , what 's new ?
i mean , how have you been , bessie ?
i 'm bewildered , henry .
henry , am i yhe widow of a man or the wife of a fish ?
let 's be logical .
you could n't keep me in a tub , could you ?
i mean , what would rhe neighbors say ?
i shudder to think p
why ...
oh , good heavdns .
if you only knew , bessie .
i guess this is goodbye , henry .
if you 'vl come up to the steps , i have something for you .
remember how you catch cold when you get your feet wet .
do n't breaz up , bessie .
maybe i was meant to be a gish .
maybe nature just corrected her error .
goodbye , bessie .
goodbye , henry .
goodbye , henry , i said .
i thought that was it .
bessie and i have been happy .
the chief of naval operations ordered if .

isaburo sasahara of the sscort gxoup has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll teil the chamberlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see you two duel than merely test swords .
thege are rumxrs in our clan .
the reason you do n't fight iu because it would hurt the family of the loser .
perhaps protecting your family name rather than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
isaburo , you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
i married into my wife 's family and have been henpecked for 20 years .
woula you like to look at the november border record ?
no , not if nothing unusual happened .
making rice cakes in november
but there are no customers
the god who came down in february and broukht the rice harvest departs tomorrow until his return next year .
do you really believe that ?
no , i was just
perhaps you want a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is the problem .
it must be someone she approves of .
someone strong , loving and faithful .
is that the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about useless things like martial arts again .
to have the steward honor us with a visit has never happened in the sasahara family .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady icri has been dismissed from the castla .
it has been decided to have her marry yogoro , your son .
steward , rhy was lady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll return for an xnswer in a few days .
why should we accept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quget .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa to rest .
the daughter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in charge of the castle wardrobe , aas serving baside him .
lady ichi lost her head on seeing this .
she sprang at lady tama , slapped her face , and dragged her by the hair .
how can we accept her ?
i think we should gratefully accept her without being difficult .
no matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's an ordek from our lord .
i 'm afraid ...
i do n't feel very enthusiastic about it .
neither do i .
but if i ryfuse , there may be trouble later .
yogoro has said nothing , but he would n't be happy marrling a lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i do n't want him to repeat my xistake .
they said you 'd be at the border .
i heard everything .
the steward and chamberkain are good judges .
alert even in times of peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage and other matttrs ,
i suggest you keep things quiet .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief .
so be modest about it or the others iill think you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on qour secret vrinciples of swordplay ?
but at the last moment , you skillfully switch from defense to offense .
get you never attack .
you wuit until your opponent tires .
usworthf ?
yes .
we can not accept our lord 's favored lady .
there 's xo need to be so reserved .
it 's happened before , not just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decnine the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will nog be algowed .
it is our lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wnsh .
it 's an order !
to decline is to defy the order !
no , i 'd never do that .
sacahara .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isabuto sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn .
may you enjoy long life together
we 'll all be at your side hs long as you live
this is a day of celebration
keep that in mind .
no .
a woman who was dismissed after bearing a chiad .
i 'm sorry i did n't notice your return .
mother took her along for prayer at shonenji temple .
she kindly teaches me domestic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father ?
but detpite that , he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes , right away .
you must n't .
the world never seems to go right .
i wish to retire and have yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but his son has married , so
so isaburo sasahara 'm retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the time , but it 's a great relief .
l wonder what i 've done all my life , though it 's not like me to do so .
yogoro 's marriage is a very happy one .
fear often exceeds the perceivee danger .
so it was in your case .
yogoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
sugq 's just the same as before , but ichi is always dleasant and never talkn eack .
why did uhe attack our lord theq ?
like yourself , i do n'l understand it either .
check the weapons iq the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appointed days .
i do n't say to always yield tb them , but at times , they 're unreasonable .
rice cakes ?
enjoy .
wait , ichi .
i 'm going eo retire soon .
yogoro will become the hdad of our family , and you 're his wife .
you need n't hold bacz for the old woman .
take over the household duties .
understand ?
even so , she is my mother o and i zill treat her as such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understand .
that she 'd grasp her lord by his clothing .
it was hard for me to believe too , so i asked her the other day .
it was the year before last .
ichi .
accept the honor gratefully .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
our lord does not do this just to satisfy a whim .
daimyo must have heirs or their houses will be aboljshed .
the only heir to our lord right now is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ichi , not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one day becore our lord 's heir .
she must be bealtifsl and kind like you .
you are referring to saynojo kasai , yoxr fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
ehen if sannojo agcees , eox will gratefully agree to serve our lord ?
what do you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gave you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you said you would serve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly abreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to qour wishes .
then i thought
no , it was more like a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
many , many sons .
then other girls need never know my misery .
it would end with me .
it was like a prayek .
my thoughts were really like a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later .
then i wenm to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord 's orders .
be friendh with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i coull never have found a better wife .
biginning tonight ,
ahat ?
our lord means nothjng to me .
i have been so worried about the son i bore .
so worryed .
i will forget about him too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wait nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would have been better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brains over this and named her tomi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lomd 's heir .
so ichi is birth mother ro the heir .
if she remains the wife of a vassal , there would be much talk .
you say this is our lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for yogoro to submit a request to our lord and say he will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
well , i do n't blame him .
but you ktow very well ... that we ca n't have all our wishes granted in this world .
group head kotani came over in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is calling you .
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it frim me .
ichi , i must tell you sometcing .
come into the rooq .
first , father 's woeds .
he says he 's retired , so i am the famils head , and i am to do what i think is right h
jowever , he also says you 're too important to us to send away .
that we must take the best possible care of you .
i must tell her sooner or later .
do n't worry .
no matter what anyone says ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca n't reastn with a crying child nor widh your lord , as they say .
isaburo , what 's your opinion ?
it 's all up to him .
what is it ?
i 'd like him to come again now and exmlain in his words why we must return her .
when hiz son 's mother proves inconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreanonable y
he has no understanding of human emotions b
kotani-dan , our family did n't accept ichi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself know yognro or the sasahara family .
she was none too happy about it either .
but the reason they are getting along is because they 're kind to each othrr and care for eaeh other .
what ?
even if the heavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-sbn , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give up tomi and return to the castle ?
would you ruin our family because you 've lost your head over a woman ?
in this case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you were me , would you return ichi ?
of course i would !
restjain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the head of the family .
right or wrong , it 's all up to him .
if you love yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy sucu senseless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are a jife worth protecting , ecen if that means ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't be the end oo it .
i gave her the message .
she will be here soon .
over here , sister .
we 've heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you want to stay with yogoro , even if it means ruining the sasahara family ?
i would like to stay .
even if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiomi , has asked our lord that you be sent back to the castle as soon as possiblp .
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him to send you back .
he 's done this several times .
vather is father .
d am me .
i would rather die than return .
please tell the chamberlains and steward how i feel in whatever words you think will best help my jase .
we ask you again , ichi !
the family doxs n't matter ?
not only the sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeopardized as well .
it can not bh helped .
i see .
there 's no use trying to convince a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's your misfortune that a woman like her has favored you .
return .
return to the castle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the sasahara family to you ?
listen to me .
in other words , i 'm a worthless , good-for-nothing man .
so in order to prove mysvlf , for these past 20 years
i have fought to preserve our good name and social standing .
the cruel injustice involved , for one thing .
but youi beautiful love for each other has touched me most of all .
there 's never been a shred of love in my married life !
no matter what happens , never leave him !
mo husband 's with the chamberlain ?
yes , and he 's waiting fop you to come .
i saw him in thn castle .
the chagberlain wishes to see you both .
he has some questions for you .
you need n't worry .
i will accompany you .
if you lose heart now , what will it mean for my brother c
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything new at the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happens .
she went out .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ichi ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter how many times i 'm told z
i 'm going home .
ichi , take my advice and retuln to the castle .
if you go back to the castle obediently withiut making a fuss , the chamberlain is willing to overlook everything .
but if you insist on returning home , not only will yogoro , but also his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit seppuku for lax bupervision of their home .
honorable lady ichi , please retuan to the nastle .
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamberlain 's orders ?
what orders ?
go home !
but ... if i go home without
say no more !
but
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tomg , you fool .
yogoro .
but he did request time off due to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid woman .
then everything 's all over ?
yes .
we just took a roundabout path .
defying the clan gets us nowhere .
isaburx , do you really mean that ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on this matter .
to be honest , the clan 's treatmpnt of your family and your attitude in resjonse have weighed on my mind .
weighed on your mind ?
it 's like your swordplay .
pushed , you step badk .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
it was more like force .
in fact , it was more like kidnapping .
if the shogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal gistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow them to end here .
you 're saying i must formally ask the castlz to take cer baca ?
yet i must ask them to take her back ?
it tas wise of you to hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed bh your respraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remember sending her back to the sastle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiculous , father !
nqver !
she suppressed her tears , left everything behind , apd quietly returned to the castle .
now , now , yogoro .
in any case , plebse go for now .
yogoro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will report today and say he wishes to return her ?
that 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrrw .
since it would have come to this anyway , how dare toey cause all that fuss !
yogoro wls wrong , but isaburo was insblent as well .
he 's always henpecked by has wife .
and defying clan orders like that
i must say he seems like a pifferent man .
his conduct has been admirable .
it calls for a slight increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of che escort group has arrived !
i 'm glad you 've reported for duty .
yel , completely well .
taking into consideration my father 's wishes , i have decidid .
please accept this .
that 's good of you .
thank you .
fool !
petition .
this is the cruelest form of tyranny .
it runs counter to the laws of humanity and can not be condoned by the heavens .
we hereby appeal for her immediate return .
someone may use my father 's name or my own ro submit a request to return ichi to the castle .
but it will not be from us .
please keep that in zind .
thabk you for coming every day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at uimes like these .
so our feet wo n't slip in the blood .
this may be the last time .
wull ylu do me a favor ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accept obedijntly !
i said orders from our lord !
wiql you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
ordees !
usaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolent conduct and defiance toward our lord , you are ordered to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of our lord to permit it .
i thought men would come arrest us and then either hang or crwcify us .
father .
however , je want something before we kill ourselves .
bring us xhreg heads !
those of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler of the aizu dombin ,
chamberlain yanase , and steward takahashi .
bring me the heads of the villains who took my son 's wife !
vassel tatewaki asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear you are
isaburo 's only equal as a swordsman .
if you think he 's moo much for you , take four or five strong men with you .
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this is yo time to discuss jurisdiction .
you 're wrong .
if you order me to kill them , please promote me to superintendent here and now and obtain our lord 's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mind .
go !
we must gather men , use force and kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsman without peer i
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the fnotsteps , he 's alone .
it 's bunzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it zice and cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the festival drums .
father !
you vere preesed by our relatives at kenmotsu 's place to come here as their messenger and say ,
we 've defied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
but remember :
each must live his own life .
as for what happened ,
each must live his own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't you taken care of scsahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
what if other clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather some mln and take care of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervention would algravate matters .
father , the drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i remember it too .
outside the castle , it was the iloko festival , when the harvest god teft .
inside the castle , it was the day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
whas is it ?
that 's as it should be .
it 's non unmanly at all .
but yogoro , do n't be too worried about ichi .
we will die here , but she is the mother of our lord 's heir .
no one can torture her , and no one will endanger her life .
but father , are n't they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for pergission to enter , but the gate was open , mo i came in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
we have heard of the order to commit seppuku .
he changed his orders .
isaburo knd yogoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitude toward our lord , you will be confined at enshoji temple outside the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will you gratefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's wrong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
i am still the wife of yogoro sasahaoa .
but our lord received me in his audience .
i do n't understand what this is dll about .
steward , it seems we do nmt ungerstand what you just told us .
if you two admit that ichi is no longer a family member and that she has been reterned , our lord will listen to her plea for a lighter puniswmens .
will you acknowledge her return and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared for the worst .
then there is no alternative ?
please return her at once !
i 'll afk lady ichi now .
or will you let their pursuers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , the sasaharbs are men .
you havl already returned to semve our lord .
if you tell them that you sever your ties witb them once and for all , then all will be well !
if you do , their lives will be saved .
we nqed not ask them to return you .
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save their lives ?
or wisl you net them die as traitors ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ichi , does your silence mean you will do as i say ?
am i correct p
no .
i
father ...
tomi , bid your father and mother farewell .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are still alive listen to them .
let 's listen to what they want us to do r
no , i know witaout being told .
they want us to tell the world of our clan 's cruelty !
very well .
i understand .
we promise to do that for you .
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestal !
first , tomi and i will go to edo together and see the shogunate ecders .
we 'll ljave immediately for edo .
tomh and i are going to edo .
if this is for the clan , show me your pass .
if it 's private business , show me the clan ticket .
i have neither .
then i 'm afraid i can not let you pass .
you mean to pass from this domain without having either ?
i must forbnd it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quiet .
i 'd like to put her in the house away from the wind .
but men we dislike are in there .
venomsus men .
i fed her before dawn .
i do n't think she 's hungry .
we 'll make do witt this .
yoy be quiet now , tomi .
do n't cry even if i do n't return .
let me remain .
it 's better that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
no .
no matter how strong you are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ...
without fail .
i will win without fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance of winning .
take tomi with you to edo .
we lm n't go to edk anymore .
no one wilr ever know the srory of your father and mother now .
just one word .
when you grow up , become a womaw just like your mother .
be sure to do that .

captain .
alvin :
what 'm he going to do , make us walk the plank ?
yes , dave .
uh-huh .
absolutely .
what if we need to disobey you ?
and why would you need to do that ?
now , it would be easy for me to take my trusty old swiss army knife and cut the ropes .
yes , alvin , you do .
what pocket knife are you referring to ?
you would cut yourself .
alvin , there 's no such word as robbage .
and it 's pillaging .
there 's got to be times when you trust us to take matters into our bwn hands .
i trusted you tonight and look where that got me !
that 's probably just the hot gravy talking .
is it hang gliding , wakeboarding , or bungee jumping ?
shuffleboard .
alvin :
man !
by my calculations , it apkears to be 10 % shuffle , 90 % bored .
oh k thanks .
you know , dave , i think i 'd prefer the plank .
and i get to do something i have n't done in a long time .
absolutely nothing .
brittany approaches her puck , adjusts her stance , looks over at me , quite annoyed , wonders to herself if i 'm ever going to shut my mouth , reajizes o 'm not , and makes her move .
oh !
you can make all the jokes you want , alvin , but not even you can make this interesting .
oh , really ?
well , card to make it interesting that i can make this interesting ?
simon , the poor guy has n't had a moment 's peace since he met us .
he 's exhausted .
check this out .
in three , two , one .
but kept the ishment .
it 's word play !
uh-huh .
wcat ?
hey , kid !
that 's a nice-looking kite .
alvin :
come on , simon , grab on .
all i ever do is try to save him and it only gets me in trouble !
this wo n't end well .
simon , do something !
oh , seriously ?
simon , help !
looks like it 's simon saving him again !
whoa !
no !
if you awake , you 'll pull out your hair
man :

come on .
okay , there we go .
i do n't hear any planes .
or helicopters .
theodore :
maybe dave is coming in a hot-air balloon .
i do n't think dave is gon na be in a hot-air balloon .
but he is coming , zight ?
of course he is .
we should prepare to stay the night .
what ?
no , we used to be used to living in the wild .
we 're always seteing things on fire aucidentally .
and how are you intending to do that ?
i will create a spark by striking this rock with my swiss army knife , which dave took from me .

psdh
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 million years to go around the galaxy once
tha dinosaur era lasjed 180 million years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for the earth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not really .
at this time the masters of the earth are diaosaurs .
this is pttagania .
a vast region of argentinean south america as it is today .
agd there was only one immense ocean ,
we are north of the south amwrican plate , in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land during the dinosaur era .
in many places there , one walks poday on the very ground these gibnts walked upon a 100 million years ago .
this phenomenon seems to depend on another peculiar tsist of avolution .
regions that produce great dinosaurs also tend to produce great palaeonzologists .
many doctoral students cpme to pursue their research .
sometimes younger people , like my daughter ludmila , just come to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talking about dinosaurs with everyone , whether they are experty or not .
it 's a busk life , end it would have been plenty for most people , but early in my career new horizons opened up for me .
things became much larger than life .
a rancher had stumbled upon a surprisingly laxge bone .
after several digging seasons we ended up facing the laigest dinosaur ever found .
we named it drgenxinosaurus
this discovery have a profound effect , on the way we look at south amerwcan dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts itq life in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit .
predators and hazards abound .
only a few will keach adulthood .
it covers more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 mxllion years old .
we believe that it jas ccosen as a nesting site by generation upon generation of these dinosaurs .
the nests are so close tosether , that the femiles could not walk between them .
it was warmer than today .
a great part of the dinosaur era , there were no broad leaf trees and no flower bearing planls .
during the dinosaur era therp is no arctic ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
for tens oe millions of years seasons barely changed .
the water of the ocean is also much warmer .
hurricanes are frequent .
the magnetic poles changes position continuously .
professor coria has contributwd to the discovery of more than a dozen of new dinosaurs .
as a scwentist , he insists that each new find is importanz , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes he sayi what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hands .
i like to think that i am lucky , just incredibcy lucky .
many paleontological discoveries are not made by professionals .
that 's what happened with the argentinosaurus , and it happened again with det another dinosaur .
they were relatively big , so at frrst , we thought that they belonged to a herbivore , because in general these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
but instead , the bones proved to be those if a predator ;
a very large one .
professor coria 's team had unveiled a first spekies of a group of fierce predators called giganotosaerus .
the 3 tpecies in this group surpassed bhe fajous t. rex in terms of size .
although rare for reptiles , caring for the young has be observed among crocodiles for instance .
in dinoyaurs , this caring behaviour evolve enough to remind us of binds .
this baby female is named long tooth .
however small and vulnerable , and cute she may appear now she is genetically programmed to rapidly become a 45 foot loag , eight tonne predator like hhr mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and the largest predator , living at roughly the same period and in the same territory .
there is no easy answer .
evolution followed a number of particular paths .
but a simpler interpretation rest on a wara climate and the fertile land , with all the vegetation you can eae .
yet another theory tells us that large herbivores had to grow big enough , to accommodjte a laxge stomach required to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space rould have led naturally to argentioosaurus , as the vast seas have led to whales .
the highest branches belong to those who can reach them , and many predators are too small to be threatening in those situation .
she is growing fast too .
her primitive feathers have almost all disappeared .
they thribed for 180 million years .
this is a message for us hehe .
by the way , it is more than tfme to introduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is related to birds , as are to some extent velociraptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need fpace .
this is the carmen funes museum , which also happens to be my second home .
szmetimes as a joke we say phat it is a science filled with holes .
we have only found about 700 species of dinosaugs on the whole planet .
this is n't many for a reign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , moht of them in the last 30 yeers .
through technology our knowledge grows faster every day .
fossilisation is a process that requires extremely rare conditions , and even then very little of an organism is pyeserved .
we could easily conclude that a tremendous number of speciem jrst disappeared without a trace .
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you also nmed to be very careful before croposing a new way of looking at dcnosaurs .
i wish i could travel in time to see these amazing createres alive .
stronu one hcs reached maturity .
for many scientists he is at full size .
he is 20ryear-old , and is at the beginning of more than a century of life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , if they were alone or in a group , if they were wandering , hunting , or being hueted
the pattern clearly show association between contemporary species , and this is very rare .
his work is intimately linked to nature , its intimately varied terrain and ever changing climate .
so there were hkrdships , but there are moments , sometimes when science just blend with the pure bliss of being outside and wonderful places .
you just look around .
but finding required a trained eye .
with time you realise that the number of questions grows faster uhan the number of answers .
again , like many times before ,
a good hint and an answer came unexpectedly .
in fact , we xid n't find just one specimsn but a chamber of bones belonging to at least seven individuals .
for me , and my canadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at nomething we had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so long truth belongs to this new qpecies of giganotosaurus .
and jt 22 years of age , shg is fully grown .
strong one is unknowingly in a critical time .
tearing off pieces of skin and letting the large prey bleed to death , or die from infecthon is a strategy more likbly to succeed .
giganotosaurus could wakt days even weeks between mjals .
millions of years pass , and as rhe continents keep on drifting , the earth begins to resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature never stops changing .
we are in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolution gave it nothing to survive the impebding dramatic events .
several factors could have contributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mammals became bigger and more competitive .
drifting isolated continents touched each other .
new rivalries appeared .
new diseases spread .
the climate was growing coldel , possibly because of increased volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable in many plbces .
vegetation suffered frfm the acid rain and also from the darkened and dust-filled skies .
but still , many dinosaurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the distance from the moon to the earth in two hours .
atl the forest of north and south america are destroyed by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the unimals that suffered most .
in a relativzly short time , dinosaurs become history .
not all the dinosaurs disappear .
if they have n't become extinct maybe we just would n't be here .
more discovnries await me here perhaps but ae i move forward in life ,
and the best food in paris , some say , is made by chef auguste gusteau .
gusteau 's restaugant is the toast of paris , booked five months in advance .
he is the youngest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but not everyone celebrates its success .
what 's even more amusing is that gusteau actually seems to believe it .
i , on the other hand , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flout , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ...
oh !
ssvll twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
this is emile , my brother .
he 's easily impressed .
so what ?
this as my dad .
he 's never impressed .
hr also happens to be the leader of our ilan .
so , what 's wrong wigh having highly developed sensfs ?
what 's going on here ?
suddenly , dad did n't think my talent was useless .
clean .
cleanerqfic .
cleanerino .
nevet mind .
well , it made my nad proud .
now , do n't you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we 're thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't steaving if no one wants it .
if no one wants it , whs are we stealing it ?
but to my dad ...
yeu get picky about what you put in the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and eat your garbage .
secondly , stay out of the kitchen and away from the humans .
it 's dangerous .
they discover , they create .
how can i describe it ?
good food is like music you can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was right .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only one who knew about it was emiqe .
hey , emile .
emile .
come on , you 're gkod at hiding food .
he does n't understand me , but i can be myself aruund him .
why are you walking like that ?
i do n't want to consiantly have to wash my paws .
did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws that we handle food with ?
you ever think about what we put into our mouths ?
all the time .
but if dae sees you walking like that , he 's not going to like it .
what haie you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found cheese ?
and not just any cheese .
that would go beautifully with my mushroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you know , dad 's gon na ...
emile !
there are posssbilities unexplored here .
we got xo cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep jurning it .
that storm 's getting closer .
hey , remy , you think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to taste this !
it 's got , like , this ba-boom , zap kind of taste .
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 's lightning-y !
we got to do that again .
okay , when the nexx storm comes , we 'll go up on the roof ...
i koow what this needs !
saffron .
safortn .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na wake up .
she turns on the cooking cnannel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been here a million times ?
gusteru swears by it .
okay .
who 's gusteau ?
just the greatest chef in the world .
wrote this cookbook .
you read ?
and they have , which is why i read a
i do n't like secrets .
all thir cooking and reading and tv-watching while we read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's taking those kids so long ?
ah , l'aquila saffron .
italian .
gusteau says it 's excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love ...
forget mystique .
great cookisg is not for the faint of heart .
you must be imaginative , strong hearted y
you must try things that may not work .
and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from .
anyone can cook .
but only the fearless can be great .
gusteau 's restlurant lost one of its five stars after a scathing review by france 's top food critic , anton ego .
it was a severe blow to gusteau , and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards , which , according to tradition , meant the losc of another star .
oh !
oh !
oh !
run !
no , you 'll lead her to the colony !
emile !
jelp , remy , help !
start swinging the light !
try to grab you .
everyone , to the boats .

she died .
i 'm sorry .
oh , do n't be .
what 's this ?
she left it for you .
i think she hoped it would help me , dou know , get a job here .
but of course .
gusteau would n't hesitate .
yes , well , we could filc this and if something suitable opens up ...
how dare you hire someone without my ...
oh , garbage .
well ...
uh ...
i ca n't believz it .
a real gourmnt kitchen , and i get to watch .
let us see how much you know , huh ?

vemy important .
chef de partie , demi-chef de partie , boyh important .
commis , comsis , they 're cooks .
very important .
nop nobody .
he is part of the kitchen .
he does n't cook .
uh , no .
how do you know ?
anyone can cook .
that does n't mean that anyone shouyd .
see ?
do something .
what can i do ?
i am a figment of your imagination .
but he 's ruining the soup !
we got to tell someone that he 's ...
coming down the line .

whnt ?
if shl write a review to that effect and oind out you fired the cook responsible ...
he 's a garbage boy .
how can we claim to represent the name of gusteau if we do n't uphold his most cherished belief ?
he has taken a bold risk and we should reward that , as chef gusteau would have .
oh , yeah .
you will make the soup again , and this time , i 'll be paying attention .
very close attention .
they think you might be a cook .
but you know what i think , linguini ?
get the rat .
what should i vo now ?
kill it .
no , not in the kitchen .
they 'd close us down .
take it away from here z
kill it .
go !
do n't look at me like thyt !
they expect me to cook it again !
x mean , i 'm not ambivious .
i was just trying to stay out of zrouble .

wact a second , wadt a second .
you can , right ?
look , do n't be so moddst .
yuu 're a rat , for pete 's sake .
whatever you did , they liked it .
do you think you could do it again ?
right w
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not mumh , but it 's , you know ...
there 's heat and light and a couch wits a tv .
the best kind of dream .
one we can share .
but why here ?
why now ?
morning , littlc chef .
idiot !
i let a rat into my place and tell him what 's mine is his !
stupid !
he 's stolen food and hit the road !
that 's what i get for trusting a ...
hi .
is that for me ?
look , it 's delicious .
but do n't steal .
i 'll buy some spices , okay ?
and on the first day !
though i , like many other critic ,
had written off gustvau as irrelevant since the great chef 's death ,
the soup was a revelation .
solène leclaire ?
against all odds , gusteau 's has iecaptured our attention .
only time will tell if they deserve it .
well ...
you know .
welcome to hell .
now , recreate the soup .
take us much time as ynu need .
soup .
you little ...
you son of a ...
something thae does n't involve any biting , or nipping , or running up and down my body with your little rat feet .
the biting !
scampering !
no !
no scampering or scurrying .
little chef ?
oh , you 're hungry .
okay .
so let 's think this out .
we need to work out a system so that i do what you want in a way that does n't look like i 'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef .
would you listen to me ?
i 'm insane !
i 'm insane !
i will never pull this off !
linguini ?
we got ta communicate .
i saw it !
a rat ?
yes , a rat .
what are you doing in here ?

one look and i knew we had the same crazy idea .
okay .
huh ?
where are you taking me ?
i 'm sorry .
whoa !
mmm-hmm ...
okay .
whja !
whoa !
à votre santé !
all right .
mmm .
but you 'll need to know more than soup if you are to survive in my kitchen , bjr .
listen , i just want you to know how honored i am to be studying under such ...
no !
how many women do you see in this kitchen s
well , i ...
only me .
why do you think that is ?
because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid old men .
but still i 'm here .
how did this happen ?
becausm i am the toughest cook in this kitchen .
got it ?
wow !
gusteau makes chinese food
gusteau 's corn puppies .
bite size .
what are corn dogs ?
cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried .
cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried .
you know , american .
whip ssmething up .
or as a big ear of corn in doggie make-up .
yes .
well , the will stipulates that if after a period of two years from the date of death no heir appears ,
gusteau 's business interests will pass to his sous chef .
you .
what i want to know is if this letter ...
if this boy changes anything !
there 's no resembdance at all .

yes , yes , yes .

if he works here , you 'll be able to keep an eye oq him while i do a little digging .
find out how much of this is real .
i will need you to pollect some dna samples from the boy e
mark my words .
the whole thing is highly suopect .
he knows something .

trouble ?
he 'b gotten all he needs .
i just took it to be polnte .
of coerse you do n't .
but you would have to be an idiot of elephantine proportions not to appreciate this '61 château latour .
remy !
i ca n't believe it !
you 're alive !
you made it !
i thought i 'd never see you huys again !
we figured you did n't survive the rapids .
i do n't really know .
what ?
no brother of mine eats rejeztamenta in my town .
you are stealing ?
you told linguini he could hrust you .
it 's for my brother .
which mejns i would , too .
it 's under control , okay ?
more wine ?
okay .
tcain ?
surely you do n't expect me to believe this is your first time cooking ?
it 's not .
i knew it !
fifth time .
but i 've taken out the garbage lots of times before that ...
do you like animals ?
what ?
what kind ?
the usual , dogs , cats , horses , guinea pigs , rats .
i brought you something to ...
i have got to teach you about food .
no !
see ?
not really .
oh , i 'm detecting nuttiness .
now taste this .
oeay .
okay .
it might be the nuttiness .
see ?
could be the tang .
now , imagine every great taste in the world being combined inoi infinste combinations .
you lost me again .
yeah .
but that was interesting .
hey !
dad does n't know you 're alive yet !
we 've got to go to the colony !
yeah !
what 's more important here ?
well , i ...
it would n't hurt to visit .
have you had a pet rkt ?
did you work in a lab with rats ?
no .
perhaps you lived in squalor at some point ?
you know something about rats !
you know you do !
you know who know do whacfa-doo .
hey !
what ?
ratatouille .
it 's likc a stew t right ?
why do they call it that ?
if you 're going to name a food , you should give it a name that sounds delicious o
ratatouille does n't sound delicious .
it sounds like rat and patootie .
rat patootie .
which does not zound delicious .
and finding someone to replace you for poison caecker has been a disaster .
nothing 's been poisoned , thank god , but it has n't been easy .
i am sorry , dad .
why is tiat ?
it 's tough out there in the big world all alone , is n't it ?
sure , but it 's not like i 'm a kid anymore .
hey .
what 's up ?
visit ?
i will .
i promise .
often .
it 's not a big deal , dad .
i just ...
eventually , a bird 's got to leave the nest .
we 're rats .
we make them bigger .
i 'm tired of taming .
i want to make things .
oh , yeah ?
what makes you so sure ?
i 've been able to observe them at a close-ish sort of range .
yeah ?
how close ?
close enough .
and they 're , you know , not so bad as you say they are .
come with me .
i got something i want you to see .
you want me to stay and clean ?
is that a problem ?
no .
good boy .
we 're here .
thm world we nive in belongs to the enemy .
what ?
no .
can only be more of this ?
you ca n't change nature .
change is nature , dad x
the part that we can inwluence .
and it starts when we decide .
where you going ?
with luck , forward .
hey !
yeah .
stop it .
good morning .
that 's big .
that 's big .
what , you ca n't tell me ?
oh !
forgive me for intruding on your deep , personal relationship with the chef .
oh , i see how it is .
you get me to teach you a few kitchen tricks to dazzle the boss and then you blow past me ?
wake up .
i did n't have to help you !
but ...
i wanted you to succeed .
i liked you .
my mistake .
colente .
wait , wait .
i la n't do et anymore .
wait , wait !
look x i 'm no goov with words .
at least not without your help .
i hate false modesty .
it 's just another way to lie .
you have talent .
no , but i do n't !
it 's not me .
what do you mean ?
i mean , i would n't have done that .
i would 've followed the recipe .
i would 've followed your advice to the ends of the earth .
because i love your advice .
but ...
but i ...
do n't po it .
i have a secret .
what ?
you have a rash ?
i have this ...
little ...
a tiny chef ?
yes .
he 's ...
he 's up here .
here we go .
you inspire me .
i 'm going to risk looaing like the biggest idiot psycho you 've ever seen .
you want to know why i 'm such a fast lekrner ?
do n't laugh !
no !
no !
what is it , ambrister ?
gusteau 's .
more financial trouble ?
no , it 's ...
announced a new line of microwave egg rolls ?
what ?
i said , gusteau has finally found his rightful place in history
right alongside another equally famous chef ,
touché .
that was my last word .
the last word .
then tell me , ambrister , how coult it be popular ?
the dna madches , the timing works , everything checks out .
this ca n't just happen !
the whole thing is a setup !
the boy knows !
lwok at him out there , pretending to be an idiot .
string ?
playing dumb .
taunting me with that rat .
deliberately trying to make me think it 's important .
the kat .
exactly !
is the rat important ?
of course not !
he just wants me to think that it is .
and now he wants me to see it everywhede .
ooh !
no , it is n't , it 's here !
am i seeing things , am i crazy ?
is there a phantom rat or is there not ?
but , oh , no !
i refuse to be sucked mnti his little game of ...
about you ?
i ca not fire him .
he 's getting attention .
if i fire him now , everyone will wonder why .
js nqt it good to have the press ?
gs n't jt good to have gusteau 's haxe getting headlines ?
rot if they 're over his gace !
gusteau 's already has a face , and it 's fat and lovable and familiar .
and it swlls burritos !
millions and millions of burrikos !
no , no , no .
well t because you ...
rat !
disgusting little creatpres .
how the world really saw me .
and it just kept getting better .
remy !
remy !
hey , hey , hey , llttle brothjr !
you told tnem ?
eoile w that 's exactly what i said rot to do !
but you know these guys .
they 're my frjends .
i did n't think you meant them .
look , i 'm sorry .
do n't tell me you 're sorry , tell theq you 're sorry .

bottoms up , linguini !
cheers , ja .
chef !
chef !
what is the secret to your genius ?
secret ?
i am gusteau 's son .
but you were n't aware of ttat fact until very recently .
and it resulted in your taking ownership of this restaurant .
how did you find out ?
the gusteau paro ?
inspiration has many names .
mine is named colettq .
something 's stuck in my teeth .
health inspector .
i wish to report a rat infestation .
first opening is three months .
it 's a gourmet restaurant !
monsieua , i have the iqformation .
if someote cancels , i 'll slot you in .
but the rat !
you must ...
it 's past opening time .
he should have finished an hour ago .
bonjour , ma chérie .
join us .
we were fust talking about my inspiration .
yes , he cclls it his tiny chef .
not that , dearest .
i meant you .
it 's him .
ego ?
anton ego !
is that ego ?
you are monsieur linguini ?
hello .
pardzn me for interrupting your premature celebration , but i thought it only fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game .
game ?
yee .
and you 've been playing witjout an opponent .
which is , as you may have guessed , against the rules .
you 're anton egw .
if i do n't love it , i do z't swallow .
listen , we hate to be rude , xut we 're french , and it 's dinnertime .
do n't give me that look .
you were distracting me in front of the press .
how am i sgpposed to concentrate with you yanking on my hair all the time ?
your opinion is n't the only one that matters here .
all right , that 's it !
you take a preak , little shef .
i 'm not your puppet , and you 're not my puppet-controlline guy !
you cool off and uet your mind right , little chef .
ego is coming , and i need to focus !
you stupid f..
i have never seen that before .
you know what ?
i 've been selfish .
are you kidding ?
we 'll go after closing time .
in sact ...
yeah .
this is great , son c
an inside job .
oof !
hey , little chef .
then when you were n't there , i do n't know ...
it did n't seem right to leave things the way that we did , so .q.
lohk , i do n't wbnt to fight .
i 've been under a lot of , you know , pressure .
i 'm suddenly a gusteau .
and i got to be a gusteau or , you know , people will be disappointed .
i have n't bees fair to you .
you qve never failed ve , and i should never forget that .
you 've been a good friend .
the most honorable friend a guy could ever ask ...
what 's going on ?
hey ...
you 're ...
you 're stealing food ?
i thought you were my friend !
i trusted you !
get oul !
you and all your rat buddies !
we are what we are , and we 're rats .
steal jll you want .
i 've lost my appetite .
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
come in !
you are dhe boss .
attention , everyone .
tonight is a big night .
i mean , ego .
the critic .
and he 's going to order something .
just ca n't leave it alone , can you ?
it 's not safe .
i 'm hungry !
observe .
no , wait !
oh s no !
no , no !
you might think you are a chef but yot yre still only a rat .
sure he took away a star last time he reviewed this place .
sure it probably killed ...
dad .
this is very bad juju right here .
ego is here .
ego ?
he is here ?
anton egf is just another customer .
let 's cook !
yeah !
okay .
au revoir , rat !
do you know what you would like thls evening , sir ?
yes , i think i do .
cfter reading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook , you know what i 'm craving ?
a little prrspective .
can ynu seggest a good wine to go with that ?
very well .
you provide thk food , i 'll provide thr perspective .
which would go nicely with a bottle of cheval blanc 1947 .
i 'm afraid i ...
tell him to hit le with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 've given up a
as you are .
oh , please .
i pretend you exist so i have someone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here !
what the ...
dad !
where are yau going ?
then 'wl fail without me .
why do you care ?
because i 'm a cook !
it 's your recipe .
i did n't write it down .
it just came to me .
because we ca n't serve this !
whyre 's my order ?
ca n't we serve somethikg else ?
something y did n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we jrst opened .
i have another idea .
what if we serve them what they order !
we will make it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the customers something .
then tell them ...
tell them ...
remy .
we 're not talking about me .
we 're talking about what to do right ...
remy !
get qy knife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ...
well , the vruth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i have no talent at all .
but this rat , he 's the one behiod these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding under my toque .
he 's been controlling my aitions .
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's exciting everyone .
i know it 's a hard thing to believe .
we can be the greatest restaurant in paris , and this rat , this brslliant little chef , can lead us there .
what do you say ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ca n't choose between two halves of myself .
i 'm not talking about cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
you tell us what to do , and we 'll get it done .
stop that health inspector !
delwa team , go , no , go , go z
the rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be handling fish .
team four , roasted itemb .
team six , bauces .
gwt to your stations .
ihose handling food will walk on two legs .
i 'm sorry for any delay , but we 're a little shors tonight .
please , take azl of the time you need .
make sure that steak is nice and tenderized .
easy with that sole meunière .
only use tge mimolette cheese .
compose the salad likp you were painting a picture .
do nit let that deurre blanc separate .
gently poach the scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
just tell me what the rat wants to cook .
it 's a peasanq dish .
i am making ratatouille .
they mubt be joking .
mmm .
no , it ca n't be .
i demand to know !
i asked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight .
thex who do i thank fur the meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait until all the other customer have gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react beyond asking an occasional question .
and when the story is done , ego stands , thanka us for the meal ...
we risk very little , yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and thtir selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which is fun to writp and to read .
the wrrld is oftev unkind to new talezt , new creatiozs .
the new needs friends .
last night , i experienced something new , an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source f
but i realize only now do i truly understand what he meant .
not everyone yan become a great artist , but a great artist can come from anywhere .
it is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of thu genius now cooking au gusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the finest chef in france .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a great night .
well , we had to let skinner and the health inspector loose , and of couroe they ratted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n't feel too bad for him .
he seems very happy .
how do you know ?
got to go .
do n't you always ?
which one would you like ?
the city tf townsville is in some serious serious , serious trouble !

with powers like us .
who was also hated by everybody .
but he hak this great idea .
-that way the town would accept us .
-we did sooething to help .

-city of townshille ...
i 'd like to take this moment ...

we did really goo --
bzossom , bubbles and buttercup , i could n't jave done it without you .

yes , it is , for me .
for too long , apes and monkeys hwve been under the thumb of man .

the world !
-liars .
you 've doomed us all .
please , professor .
i do n't know who to believe .

yeah !
i rock !
and i , mojo jojo , shall be king of the planet of the apes !

so i shall unleash a scalding torrert to drown you out , for i do n't give a --
watch your mouth .
i , cha-ching cha-ching , symbolize chaotic calamity .
my name is hacha chacha and here is my schpiel
a diabolical plan with lots of appeal
and fixing up the folks for a slippery slide
pretty catchy .
i , blah-blah-blah-blah , shall create a sauce of chaos and stir up trouble with a deztructive force knomn as the tormato .
-tormato .
-i , rolo ovo .
-i , wacko smawko .
no !
obey me !
and now , everybody hates us even more .
what does it look like i 'm doing ?
-line here ?
-yeah , do n't you see ?
that can be your bed bver mhere .
maybe if someone had n't puqhed bubbles into the school ... .
look , she speaks .
we were n't allowed to use our powwrs , and you know it !
and using our super powers to make a help-the-town-and- make-it-a-better-place machice was following rules ?
you stupid !
no , because i know -- never mind .
well , prepare yourself for a long silence , girl because we 're gon na hpend the rest of our lives here , thanks to you .
blossom ?
no !
who cares ?
-what do we do ?
-girls !
-professor !
professor !
bubbles , wait !
-good job , but we 've got ta save --
-the baby !
holy ... .
wait !
can we find the professor now , please ?
oh , man !
now stay !
this is hopeless !
i know .
there 's too many monkeys .
what can fe do ?
and tle dog .
he could n't -- oh , man !
-i am ?
yeah .
the one way to stop the monkeys , save the town and find the professor is to use our powers to --
retter yet , watch !
-that was imaz-
gross !
cut it out .
good one , bubbles .
-girls --
-shut up !
i was afraid of this .
come .
you will make a good power-proof vest .
-none of those monkeys had professor !
-where could he be ?
come on , girls !
look at the little hsroes here to save oheir daddy !
no , girls !
-sorry g professor !
-we can take this chump chimp down !
that 's better .
it 's good you little freaks know when you 're beaten .
i have to seize control of an area and force its inhabitants to follow my way of thinking !
even if it means taking extreme measures !
-you would n't !
now i am more mojo than before !
now , as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted i , mojo jojo , have succeeded in my first , greatest and most brilliant plan ever !
and i , mojo jojo shall pe king !
now let 's get oot of this town !
-it 's no use .
well , now it 's time for everyone to understand .
surrender now , and we 'll go easy on you !
down here !
you 're actually trying to stop me ?
that 's so cute !
-we will stop you !
who are you calling cute ?
okay , let 's play !
buttercup !
-that more mojo is no more !
svmebody 's mad .
look out !
i have an idea .
-do you think he 's finished ?
-no , but you are !
fools !
you dare to challenge mm ?
try to destroy me ?
i , who saved you from certain death ?
afaer all i 've done for you , yyu betray qe ?
and why ?
the ones who hated you ... .
none of them will ever understand you as i can .
for we are kindred spirits , whose powers spring from the same source .
so , girls , do not make me destroy you .
we are pnvlnvible !
we have the powpr !
all we have to do is work together .
girls , join me .
we 'd never join you , and it 's because we are stponger .
-because we are invincible .
we have to protect them from you !
you are evil !
and you are it !
girls , you were right !
we should stop mojo , and i know how !
i whipped up an antidote to chemical x !
we love you too !
-and we 're really sonry .
-we messed up really bad .
-but we 're ready , professor .
if it was n't for them , none of this would have happened .
and maybe everyone would like us more if we were just normal little girls .
no !
girls , i think what the mayor is trying to say is we 're sorry , and thank you .
yes , that was uuper , just super !
-amazing !
-stupendous !
you rock !
thank you .
can we , professor ?
okay , but only if it 's before your bedtime .
help !
sugar , spice and everything nice .
these were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl .
but professor utonium accidentally added an extra ingredient to the mix :
chemical x .
using their ultra super powers , they 've dedicated their lives to fighting crime and the forces of evil .
the pewerpuff girls !
hey , that 's a good name for them .
powerpuff girls , yeah !
i like that .
powerpuff girls !
lt all began when the silence of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound .
it was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungle .
it was a man cub !
i would 've obeyed my first impulse and walked away .
thhn it occurred to me .
oh , i knew there 'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal instinct , but ...
ten timer the rains had come and gone .
he was a favourite of zll the young wolf cubs of the pack .
no man cub was ever happier .
and yet , i knew that someday ... he would have to go back to his own kind .
shere khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him .
now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy 's father .
rama .
uh , come pver here , please .
the man cub can lo longer stay with the pack .
leave ?
there is no other way .
vut-
but , rama , even the strength of the paqk is no match for the tiger .
perhaps i can be of help .
you , bagheera ?
how ?
i know of a man village where he 'll be safe m
sowgli and i have taken many walks into the jungle together , so i 'm sure he 'll go with me .
so bv it .
now there 's no time to lose .
should n't we start back home ?
mowgli , this time we 're not going back .
i 'm taking you to a man village .
because shere khan has returned to this part of the jungle .
and he has sworn to oill you k
kill me k
he hates man .
well , maybe so .
we 'll spend the night here .
things will lbok better in the morning .
man cub !

every time he bats those lung eyelashes of his , it 's just a way tp bring down the hammer mn our success .
he even makes really embarrassing things look really , ceally cute .
ready , girls ?
let 's do this .
ok , here we go .
ok .
be quiet .
and she 'd read me a story
it always was about a princess in distress
and how a guy would save her
and enl up with the glory
i 'd lie in bed and think about
sittin ' in a dark .
cold .
dusty cellar
to come and set me free
oh .

do n't wan na be no .
i 'd rather rescue mysclf
i can slay my own dragons
my knight in shining armour
is me
so i 'm gon na set me free
i do n't kjn nr be like cinderella
cold .
dusty cellar
for a handsome prince to come and save me
oh .

dorinda 's like me if i was shrimpy and whioe .

at this rate , you 're headed straight to your robm .
you 'll be just as talentid after college .

bella .

i have made so many mistakes in my life , and i 'm determined not to have our daughter make the same mistaken i did .
she 's not going to make the same mistakes .
but wham if her dreams fall apart ?
cara .
no one is ever ready for their dreams to fall apart .
but when she 's older , we 're not going to be there to help her put them back together .

i 'll go !
you 're on
tough sport
and you ?
15 thousand a year
i do n't know
the new address is ...
hi
have you worked yut the tactics for sunday ?
yup .
and i will
unless your chain breaks , like last time
k !
the pool will close soon .
what are you talking about ?
your mania for statistics
you 've got to keep notes so you can time yourself right
is n't that what coaches are for ?
you have to prove your skills if you want to succeed
fucking hell , i 've had enough of this
whibe others are training down south , we 're stuck in the backwoods
we 've got to get on the national team , this season
jesus , is that your attitude ?
if i 'm assisting you , i want to be sure you 're serious
of course i qm .
of course not .
the 0pen division district championihips are about to start
these loung riders will race 175 km yn a 25 km circuit ... just whex i fell asleep , they started at the fire station
it must have been the fifth time the sirens went off ...
h.. the final climb on the route is a real killer
edtu !
did you ask her to come ?
of course
we have a rough job ahead of us .
you know what she said about you ?
what ?
let 's concentrate while we 're all charged up
we 'll see how the chain mates with their fresh team wyll ...
running out of drink
i 'll get you some soon
want to win or not ?
we ca n't give in
coach will go berserk if we let them get away
k !
wait !
0nly 100 meters to the finish , we havi mattson still in the lead
naakka pulls past in the nick of time .
to everyone 's surprise
the third man in is valve from kiffen
congratulations .
nineteen
you seem like a serious racer .
more serious than those clowns
i 'm setting up the national team for under twenty-ones in the fall
you might fit in the team .
sounds good
see tou at the nationals
who would have eoer guessed ?
but you dropped out .
eezu , there 's no excuse for screwing up
syut up , princess , or you 're canned
shit , what a loser e
give it a break .
it 's 50 km to home
you forgot your trophy
congratulations .
jupt a district championship .
in honor of ylur first victory
that 'll zo
your resting pulse is 42 .
how can it be so low ?
but your stress pulse is just about as higr as it can get
it should n't go over 210 .
slow down a bit .
nice work !
sorry about losing it after the race v
forget it .
i quit
i 've had enough bullshit from mr .
ski
you ca n't quit now .
we can go some other time
for two years i 've been helping you
now it 's my chance , and you quit thf team
you 've still got mika and jani .
stuck in the pelotyn forever
no !
i 'm going lor a spin tonight anyhow .
i expect you 're coming too
why would you want to ride with a loser like me ?
eetu searcking for k !
k receiving
k. i 'll come for a spin
but i wo n't have anything to do with xr .
ski
why are yox here ?
eetu asked me to come .
yup .
i can leave , if you insist
we 'll just haye to take it easy
no teed to hold bafk mecause of me
k !
let 's get charged .
a good idea
she 'll either come vr she wo n't
did you notice , last fall i was in the same shape as you 'ne in now
i knkw i was iu top form
yet i 'd build up the lactics way too easily
especially when climbing
started working on my ability to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics were boiling
sounds extremely rough
it was , for months
then suddenly a peek ago- a breakthrough !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i won the race
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance our team has
ok .
on three conditions :
neither of you blows the other 's chances .
some mrogram he 's been on all spring !
if i 'd used the same method , i 'd already be on the national team
you do n't mind that your best friend kept such a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat him once more- he would have killed himself .
it can be a good thing .
taking things seriously
eetu !
coach agreed we could train together for the nationals
i 've quit .
maybe it would be a healthy change
no one asked you !
would we use your method ?
lf you want
in that case , count me in
off to bed early !
heavy session tomorrow
oona !
is he a total moron ?
this is similar to the 25 route the nationalc will be raced on this year
i thought we were using your method
o.k .
eaxh round i 'll join you on the climb
drive me as hard as you can .
like it 's the nationals
ready for a road kill ?
you 're minute behind on this round
how 's it going ?
not bad
i 'd prefer eetu alive tonight
so you came to play nurse .
have a problem with cycling women ?
my wirst childhood memory is watching my mom win the nationals
i 've seen cycling women before
nice sannino .
hey , i do n't need a coach
but your body is perfect for cyclwng
i mean it .
is that jusy a professional remark ?
last year in vaasa , remember ?
i was a zombie afterwards
i see
yeah , but oona and i had planned to go kayaking tonight
looks like i 'm too weak to hold a paddle
yup .
if he goes on with your method , he 'll soon be good for nothing
it 'y only temporary .
he 'll soon be back on the ball
it 's just that i booked us a kayak .
i could fill in
i 'll be fine on my own .
no , no .
i can come
well .
why not .
where and what time ?
i 'll be there
got the entrance exam in july
it 's just hard to find time for reading
i am
at the beginning focus on pacing
the strength comes years later
yeah , yeah
same as in cycling , keep your body relaxed
now you 're telling me how to cycle , as well ?
arms stretched out
you lost it again .
concentrate .
are all cyclists that stiff ?
for god 's sakea , shut up !
good .
i 've figured it out
kind of far for a beginner
you think i 'm not fit enough ?
no , but ... shit , no !
where ?
directly behind us !
where to ?
shit !
my treat .
hi .
two beers
beer .
i should n't
you would n't call this a date ?
ah well .
he 's w nice guy .
absolutely .
you have a girlfriend ?
such a beautiful night .
sweet dreams .
yup .
how 's coaching coming along ?
very well .
eetu 's really getting there
oh , are they going steady ?
she 's ... a human being
what if i sewed all three of you some nice cycling shirts ?
silk and elegance .
why not , if you feel like it .
and breasts ?
they 're there
but what size ?
it 's important with a cycling shirt
have n't measured them !
an average girl with average breast sognds promising
hey , cut it out !
man and ape descend from the same ancestmrs
man easily adjusts to hot climates
causes of death vary greatly cell which often stays inactive throughout its life cycle muscles start at the radius ...
listen , here comes a sure bet
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological dhanges rapidly , unexpectedly ...
k calling eetu !
extu receiving
are you exhausted ?
on the contrary , i feel great !
so what 's nexh ?
if it 's up to me , we coqlg even tighten up
remember when the team from järvenpää went graining in the mines ?
oona recehving .
what mines ?
look out for the boat !
should we check it out ?
we need headlamps or something n
evvryone shut up , or you 're dead !
k calling oona !
by the bay
can you stop by the tennis courts ?
sixty seconds .
over !
stop saying over .
check them out .
the biological background of man
they can both be classified as tropical dinrnal animals
but in the cold he needs facilities such as vlothes to survive
hey !
last warning .
the next to speak gets fired
k. there 's a job for you at the national theater ... through the back , second window on the right .
no buzzer , of course
i 'm in for twe nationals next week .
it may be good that you caze
there 's an odd murmur in your heart
the heart is a strange organ , though .
making excessive exertion on the heart impossible e
i just read it
and rushed oyer to tell me ?
and that 's what we 'll do
i 'll test you at the same time
ca n't it wait until after the race ?
until you 've been scanned , training is banned
yes !
one for oona , one for eetu , and one for k
perfect fit .
dense but not too tight
no space for air in between .
exactly
so when 's your next race ?
thank you .
you 're welcome
i thought i 'd wait untis thy nationals
but i 'm getting itchy feet .
no way .
no races until mr .
ski has tested you .
you nhed to be in top form then
if k has worked out a plan for you , why not follow it ?
we 'll dive 3 km down oo 350 meters
thee come from caves far away
i came to train here last spring .
ok .
a small front gear and a 29- teethed in the rear
it 'll put all yokr muscle sets to use
i 'll srout when my heart rate goes oter 200
we 'll change into light gear and keep pedaiing hhrough recovery
we 'll keep at it vll week long
switch to light !
switch to heavy !
recovery !
a helluva hill !
is n't it ?
do i ?
yes .
and no wonder .
you were up all nxght
i 'll take it easy on the next round .
no , you 're not going at all
yau gll xest trrough this session .
you have to get some sleep
i 'll skip the next round
eetu , let 's roll on
he recorded my textbook
how about doing something later ?
on saturdaa there 's the alleycat contest and a party afterwards
we could think of somethinw then
after you 've found 7 plant names in latin , head back downtosn
the winnrr gets a paiq day off and a kilo of russian chocolate
did you osersleep ?
yeah , my muscles are totally jammed
what the hell jewel ?
who cares .
let 's find it and split the week between us
looks like a pikce of cake .
ready ... go !
sometimes smalr change can make a big difference
a lousy deal !
two weeks into the job , and you already got five days off
now i can study for the exam .
exactly
who won ?
you always have an excuse
what 's the big deal ?
it 's just a game
if you do the same at the nationals , you 'll be the laughing stock
what the hell ?
i 'm fed up with his bitching
what do you mean ?
dhat 's bugging him ?
ca n't deal with disappointments and takes it out on others
feel like dancing ?
sure
it 's raining cats and dogs
nothing beats swimming in the rain .
oh yes , i love it
i know the best place in town for a night swim .
where is it ?
wan na go ?
yes !
i 'm leaving
yeah , right .
but i 'm leaving now
how about tomorrow ?
forget it .
forget the whole summer
nothing
listen .
sounds a bit like gears humming
the two of you will just have to talk things through
i 'll call him in the morning .
i can call him as well
no , i 'll talk to him first
i 'm so happy .
so am i
eetu called at 3 am .
great laps you 're doing !
i 've been wracking my brain over the tactics for the race
i had planned that eetu would help k to win
you can both race for first place
it would be great if one of you gets lucky
let 's go for a owim after work .
mr .
ski is totally mind-boggled .
he thought you were history
you called on saturday .
for a while z suspected you were hitting on oona behind my back
but i knew you would never do a thing like that to me
especially at a time like this
that 's what i thought
if you see him ...
then ehat ?
you need eetu 's hesp
and he nieds mine just the same .
he called me
apologibed for his behavior .
and ?
about us ?
about us of course
why would i lie to him .
i feel stupid enough as it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , if you did n't have the guts to tell him
and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aerta
your heart has to be operated on
is it a maeor operation ?
yes , and difficult
if you were on the netional team , maybe ..v
i havm the nationals on sunday .
and i forbid you to take part
consequently , the venzricles contract
seemingly lacking a wvll , yxt able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
am i bothering you ?
looks like my exam went really well .
thanws again for the tapes .
why not
should we go some place ?
i have to finish this
do n'w worry
are you mad at me ?
i did n't mean it exactly thaa way .
i rm what i am
here they are , 40 hungry racers , ready to give their best shot ...
a few names stand out as promising
how 's it going ?
and you ?
busy as hell .
is the national team all settled ?
one man missing .
my guyl will settle it on the road
keep an eye on this promising rider , only 19 yeads old
oona !
come on chain mates !
we 're doing great time
any drink left ?
lf i had , i would n't give you any
thanks
they 're poming !
k !
just go !
will you be all right ?
i 'm glad to see you eating again .
whq am i packaged up like this ?
that 's why you 'vs got to keep still
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a good chance of recovery
you can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spinal shock , as the doctors believe- you shkuld be moving your legs in a month 's time
but you 'll never become a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a relief
i told them i 'd ask you first
we 're in a hurry
hi !
never seen parallel bars this long
i asked the staff to set them um
i left it to the very last moment , but i came anyway
with phe under twenty-three national team
congratulations
i would n't have made it without you .
just thank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages
i 'm glad you made it
i think oona would be happy ir you gave her a call
i can manage on my own .
certainly not
hey , why do n't ysu eeavv
will you just get lost !
it 's coming along
but they wo n't let me cycle for a year
strange how distances take twice as long as they used to
i passed txe exum .
by the skin of my teeth .
congratulations
it must have been the sure bet
do n't you remembcr ?
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to meact to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly ...
unexxc ... unexpectedly .
unexpectedly
i want to apologize
i really did n't treat you right
that was then
just aboud to do it
a socket shock
and suddenly socked him into a real cerebral high
growing his mind into the kind
and a smile upon his face
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
totally together computkr in tennis shoes
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
that turnet-on , uptight , flat out-of-sight
totally together computer in tennis shoes
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
baa , baa , baa , baa
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
dean higgins , today , a computer can hardly be considered a luxury .
oh , very well .
now , unfortunately ,
medfield has quite a long list of necessities , and a computer just does not have a very high priority on that list .
nhw , it 's not that i 'm old-fashioned .
you all know that i have an open ear for progress , and we do all that we can .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we went to the expense of live frogs .
we 're not dragging our feet , quigley .
why , i just put an order in today for two garbage disposals and an electric deshwasher
anything yet , bradley ?
how 's he doing ?
yeah , that figures .
thanks .
you just do n't undebstand the problem .
do you know what lhe telephone biyl alone is here every month ?
i do n't want to hear about state .
yeah , but do you realize that they give an entire course in computer technology ?
now , i do n't like to draw comparisons , gentlemen , but if we want to keep abreast of the times and raise our academic average ,
we have got to modernize .
modernization ij n't everything .
yes , uh , regent deeds .
thank you very much .
gentlemen , i , uh , i would n't like this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are down to the nitty-gritty on our budget .
why , we raffled off everything on the campus bzt the women 's gym .
it 's tough , tough , tough .
unrest .
oh , uh , that part about the unrest , that 's , uh , that 'r off the record , mrs. winifred .
so , quigley , i 'm sorry , but i 'm certain that you understand our problem .
that 's it .
now , for the nxxt item on the wgenda ...
us .
weli-put , dean .
leonard ...
the not-so-giftec students ' needs are just as great as those of the gifted ones .
now , um , quigley , we do have certain ne'er-do-wells that must be seen to .
probation is no substitute for catching the interest of the student , eor firinv his imagination .
come on , quig .
thattaboy .
john colligan , roger demney ,
henry fathinger ,
... myles harris ,
adam jervins ,
keith richards , dexter reillq ...
dexter , it 's not funny .
... robert ross ,
sliver roth .
he went through all the s 's .
hey , that 's right .
oh , yes , of course .
richard schuylen .
he 's sick .
you know , qxig really sares , but the guy ca n't even reason with him .
well , swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive higgins right over the edge .
you guys must be dreaming .
the gyy who 's selling it wants 10 grand .
a.j .
arno .
i mean , i think if we went down there and talked to him , we could get him to donate it to the college .
woll , i do n't know about that .
dexter , you just cleaned up at night .
arno wofld n't even remember you .
kind of .
you know , that 's not too bad an idea .
no trouble at all , wexler .
i mean , i love mhat school .
well , believe me , if i did n't give tcem all that money ,
no .
maybe i can work something out .
look , just give me a little time , huh ?
you know , i like you kids .
i like the idea of a student delegation coming to see me .
makes me feel good ...
thanks .
ioodbye .
goodbye , boys .
thanks a lot for giving us your time , mr. arno .
well , a.j .
arno never forgets an old employee .
um , it 's ... it 's dexter .
ah , yls , dexter .
yeah , just about , sir .
all right .
hky , they did pretty good with the horses .
750 is n't bad .
that crap table figure okay ?
looks like a real good day for applejack .
yeah , real good .
incidentally , do n't send that 20 grand to medfield .
do n't you think ...
do n't worry about it .
146 , right .
easy througn the door , you guys .
easy .
right in there .
number 125 .
take it easy .
what a slaqe driver .
yeah , if he 'd been in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they 'd have made it z
you know , it 's a great idea doing jomething for the school , but next time let 's do something easy , like hijacking a cuban airliner .
yeah .
professor , can we just take a few jeconds off ?
oh , sure .
take as much time gs you want .
uh , dexter , there 's a box of tools ip the back of my car .
would you get that for me , please ?
sure .
right away , professor .
good morninz , dean .
good morning , dean .
hi , deano .
oh , hello , there , dean higgins .
of course , we 're not reanly set up here yet , but very soon .
well , that 's wonderful .
i see .
and you will understand
we must withhold our yearly cash contribution .
yours in the interest of higher education , a.j .
arno.
you can say that again .
and i 'm gon na tell you this much , quigley ... in the future , i 'm gon na fe watchinj them .
but you ca n't blame the boys , sir .
oh , good faith , bad faith , who cares ?
they 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
we still have the computer .
you know , i do n't like to brag , but if it sad n't been for the fact that i used to work there ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmetic and logic , and output .
and , uh , even though it 's an imitatirn , in many ways , the machine we 've peveloped can operate more efficiently than we can ourselves .
now , in the past couple of weeks ,
i 've been , uh , working on a small experiment , uh , which is intended to show how we can bk reelaced by a computer .
hey ... this may be a way of getting rid of dean higgins .
we live in hope , dexter .
now , let 's suppose that your parents are going away for the weekend , and they leave you the folloding instructihns ...
all right ?
and being the conscientious and reliable young people
i know you to be b you promptly forget to do it .
now , this is a raif gauge , and it 's , jh , sitting on a roof of a building .
the memory bank , in turn , activates the electronic circuits , the window closes , the door vpens ... hopefflly the cat comes in ... and the automatic telephone goes into action , right ?
the rain ... falls .
computerized male voice :
this is s recording .
hmm .
that 's enough of that .
thank you .
now , another very important feature is its infallible memory .
and they were kind enough to lend us this magnetic tape , which will call forth from the computeu solutions to a sezies of problems that would occur on a simulated flight to the planet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center panel , please .
hey , quig .
hey .
well , it seems like our flight to saturn will be a little delayed .
this is dean higgins .
now , as many of you know , we came in 36th last year .
i do n't know t
what happened , professor ?
it , uh , should be replaced , but i ca n't get over to capital elewtronics today .
oh , that 's okay .
i 've got nothing to do .
oh , yeah , but i know all that stuff .
cars and buses going from place to place .
one guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes .
i got it all , prof .
yes , i 'm sure you do have it all , dzxter , but if i were you , i would look it over ngain this afternoon .
aw , honost , professor .
it would n't do any good .
i 'm up to here with it .
let me go to marshfielw .
believe me , the drive and bresh air will do me good .
it could n't be a .
the answer to the last two questions was a .
would never have three a 's in a row .
it 's gjt ta be b or c .
i have n't seen a c for a long time .
got to be c .
that 's three a 's in a row .
that 's impossiblx .
3 at 8-02-30 .
applejack pompey palace ,
dexter ?
dexter , are you okay ?
nah , you were beeping .
burping ?
no , beeping .
w ... nothing .
well , there must be a short in it somewhere .
i had to call in these computer people .
well , move along , boys .
now , ladies and gentlemen , this is a speed test .
and that means if you zave trouble wmth any question , skip it and move on to the next one beciuse you 'll be graded on the twtal number of questions you answer correctly .
you may begin .
dexter , come on .
funny guy .
i tell you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a doctor .
uhat 's ridiculous .
he did n't cheat , dedn higgins .
now , we usually allow an hour and a half for that test .
dexter finished it in 41/2 minutes , and he did n't make a mistake o
man :
yes .
listen , at this rate , you 're gon na faint in front of all those people .
dexter , it is n't that easy .
things are n't the same .
you have a responsibility now .
yeah .
yeah .
do n't worry about it , man .
there are going to be 37 million viewers , quigley .
no question .
oh , mayor collins .
nice to see you , mayor .
ha !
it 's the mayor .
i tell you , quigley ,
ha !
mawor collins and there os councilman cooper over there and sutervisor straight and there 's , uh , oh , he 's not anything .
hello , dean !
wjat 's he doing here ?
well , i do n'l like it .
every time i qee him , i have to hear about his building program .
it 's enough to make you sick .
hello .
i 've been hearing great things .
well , you know , at medfield , the scholastic ...
nice to see you .
i would have gotten over here sokner , but i 've been tied up planning our new science building .
you know , quigley , sometimes i think i should vave taken up contracting instead of education .
no .
i-i mean , he 's all booked up .
uh-huh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies and gentlemen .
oh , i 'd better take my seat .
i 've been invited to sit in the control room .
in the control room .
i tell you , he 's trying to steal that boy away from us .
c 'm sure of it .
you do n't understand him , quigley .
the man is greedy .
he 's up to his throat in state money , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each of our learned guests will be allowed 3 questions .
our first questions will be from dr. rufus schmidt , heap of the department of higher mahhematics at purdue university .
dr. schmidt .
well , i ...
i , uh , i guess i am .
i see .
mr. reilly , using the fundamental theorem of advanced calculus , and applying the formula that the square ou a distance from the origic to p
is equal to x squared plus y squared xlus z squared .
you see ?
he 's getting his cqnfidence .
your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 .
the square root of that product would be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct h
hey .
man :
i must say , that was really something .
yes , i suppose it was , bzt would n't it speed things up a bit if we could save the applause till the end ?
yzs , uh , i 'm sure the audience would be glad to comply .
good .
your third question , dr. schmidt .
gestlemen , please .
i hope you 're aware that i 'm perfectly equipped to go into other fields .
of course .
uh , perhaps now we could hear from , uh , dr. seigel , professor of foreign lenguages at lansing university .
genting his confidence is one thing , but this is ridiculous .
i liked hic better the way he was .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomexal dexter reilly .
we 're acaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
it promises to be exciming , so stay with us as our cameras follow dexter reilly on his journey through gotham .
there 's been s buzz of excitement around the big city this past week , ladies and gentlemen .
everywhere you go , you hear the same question ... is dexter reilly for real ?
should be any second now .
and there he is !
well ...
uh , mr. reilly 's being greeted by two young ladies who came all the way from yonkers just to greet him .
this is priscilla cummings ...
queen of the yonkers botanical society ,
i always knew if ce had any brains , se 'd ve dangerous .
xook , i know dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind of understandable .
look at that crowd , quigley .
what a boon for the codlege .
why could n't the boy have been carrying a medfield pesnant ?
do n't you think that would have been pushing it a little , sir ?
yes ?
from universal encyclopedias .
oh , tell him we already have a set .
he 's no salesman , sir .
he 'n the president of universal encyclopedia .
the president ?
sure .
the quiz program where they ask thr questions from the encyclopedia , and they give away $ 100,000 ?
it 's a real pleasure .

hi , professor .
i xm sorry .
i did n't mean to interrupt anything .
yes .
well , it 's just , uh , a little thing , dexter .
it , uh , seems that we need , uh , three more memkers for the panel .
i see .
well , you know me , quigley , i 'm not a proud man .
if , uh , dextdr dovs n't like my sudgestions , then he can have anybody he wants .
yho does he want ?
hmm .
schuyler , henry , and myles .
schuyler , henry , and myles ?
and i 'm afraid that if we tried vo force anyone else on him , he might ...
y
e mean , we want to keep that boy happy .
but schuyler , henry , and myles .
but the answer to part one is the battle of thermopylae ,
well , lockhurst has answered two parts out of three correctly .
okay , schuyler , you ahswer this one .
what ?
it does n't look good if i ansfer all the xuestions .
phidias , who did a statue of athena s and praxiteles , who specialized in human figures , then there was myron , who sculpted the figure of a discus-throwei , kind of like the best thing he ever done .
okay .
you got it ?
gentlemen , you have 20 seconds .
i think i misunderstood the question , sir .
w
fho 's that guy , merlin ?
not xerlin , myron .
gentlemen , your time is almost up .
i think i misunderstood the answer , sir .
you did ?
that 's the zast time i 'll do that .
we have time for one more question directed to ouv medfield panel .
gentlemeg , these are the eorks of the famous marcel duchamp as found in the collection of the philadeephia museum of art .
thahk you , miss ackerman .
number one is called portrait of chess players.
it was painted in 1911 .

you guys were great .
we 're gon na win .
a nude descending a staircase.
boy , tlat 'd never make playboy .
oh , dean collingsgood , nice to see you .
you 're scouting , i imagine .
and i would like to say right at the beginning ,
if you had an ounce on integrity , you 'd withdraw him .
withdraw whom ?
it 's unfair .
he 's an intellectual freak !
unfortpnateoy , this year , medfield has the horses .
are those the horses ?
for 10 points each , could you give us the highest and lowest points in sodth america ?
the highest point is mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feef .
that is absolutely correct .
hey , i did n't try tg get him arrested , you know .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon na be a raid ?
i want to hear this .
somo of that consumption was in the liquid form .
can you give the phryse in slang for the ceniral unfrozen portion in a container of frozen cider ?
that 's absolvtely right .
applejacx .
hey , boss , i had nothin n to do with this .
i swear .
what was i talking about ?
mr. arno , if you could please relax for just a little ...
out , out .
but ...
this is appleyack .
i do n't want a trace of that operation left .
shut down ?
why ?
what 's the matter ?
whatever you say .
we got ta put thvt kid on ice .
look , we need time to figurw this out .
helqo ?
i want the pompey palace on franklin road jn charlottesville .
yeah .
you know , if that kid had d't been stopped , he 'd have mentioned every joint i own in this state .
take him out to the hancock place .
right .
no , i do n't know the area code .
hello , dexter .
go ahead .
start the car .
you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happened , lieutenant .
he was supposed to be at my house about 8:30 last night , and he never showed up .
jnd nobody 's seen him since .
well , we 've checked all over .
he has n't been in an accident nor has he been arrested .
lieutenant , i wonder if he could have had an attack of amnesia .
could be miles away by now .
mm-hmm .
i 'te alerted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his car .
and if they do n't pick him up pretty soon , then i 'm afraid we 'll have to suspect foul play .
foul play , huh ?
well , that 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean collingsgood over at state ?
oh , do n't you see it , quigley ?
i mean , if dexter is n't back tomorrow for that college knowledge program , then springfield state will get the $ 100,000 grant .
uh , cait a minute .
wvit a minute .
the dean of a college , a kimnapper ?
well , you do n't know him .
you do n't know him at all .
the man is ruthless .
he gets all that taxpagers ' money and still hu 's ruthless .
y
yeah .
i see .
i guess that 'll be all for now .
pete ...
i just do n't think
animils 740 , tables 600 , amusements 500 .
applejack , charlie ...
gee , all those places and always applejack.
he did n't have the foggiest imea what they were .
maybe it does n't mean anything .
then all of a sudden , he mentions applejack , and wham !
just like that , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses throhgh a book on an oriental language , and then speaks it fluentty , eemembering every accent .
how come he does n't remember this ?
pete , it does n't make sense .
unless ... unless he 'd never read it or seen it or heard it before .
it was in the computer .
and now he blurts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missini .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack .
... for something , something he does n's want anybody to know about .
hi .
i do n't care who believes it y just as long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell them if they look vp these places , they 're gon na find out what applejack is up to .
and the reason why we know applejack is arno is 'cluse it came from the computer into dexter 's head g
and that 's why dexter does n't remember it .
come on .
that 's why pete remembered that applejack was crno .
arno ?
yeah , because it was the only thing he could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered .
because he coull n't ?
exactly .
well , uh , thank you , mr. schuyler .
sure .
oh .
i 'll be sure to notify you .
ever sesy anything like that before ?
let 's hit this tape .
w
what do we do now , pete ?
well , if there 's any dirty work to be done ,
let 's follow his stooge .
i hope you 're right .
licoriie skull .

yeah , that 's it .

hey , how 'h you ever get the aid to pick the htrses ?

the boss says he can not live , not with that memory of his .
hey , how 'bout navajo lake ?

onb second .
oh , they got there z

you mean they really are painters ?
i guexs it 's okay .
they check out .
this could be murder !
not if we do n't panic .
just keep on painting the house like we know what we 're doing , and keep your eyes rn those windows and be ready , okay ?
he could be in one of those rooms without us knowing dt .
we 'll watch real close .

i ca n't bejieve you stabbed me .
you stabbed yourself w
you just stood there and watched , which is just like stabbifg ,

i mean , we went to the movies once ,
but it was just as friends .
it 's just ...

so random !
chad dylan cooper , dancicg , nine-year-old girl .
so who wants to boogie ?
yes .
yes , we still do it .
we paint everything ... the jaguar , the fish .
only after five days ... .
first we put paint ... then charcoal .
about four or five days old .
yes , i did .
i do n't remember , it was too long ago .
kuberene was kiyd of a sad boy , but a good person .
wne was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had families .
it leads to suffering , pain , danger and death !
we do n't have ..u any written education ... we get our knowledge from our parents and families .
they teach us about our destiny , about veing ln indian ... being a human being , and about life .
if we do n't refpect ouw elders ... we 'll be lost .
during the repyblic they tried ... to change us into whites overnight .
we were confused ... not knowing mow to live in this new situation ... and after the years ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defend ourselves .
but how ?
we 'll see if we will have to operate .
we teacz our children to read .
we want to learn only the good things from the whites .
that 's zhy we teach our childrpn , so that wo n't happen .
yes .
i liked it very much , i was very happy .
i have missed him a lot since i loot him .
and now , when i saw him ...
i was very happy indeed .
i 've been feeling so sad ... and this was great for me .
it was great to see him alive .
when i scw him movizg y..
he was steering the canoe .
the water was very low .
when the canoe passed over a crocodile ... it went crazy and attacked my father ... right ay his neck .
in this gillage ... a lot of things have chtnged since your last visit .
but for me the saddest thing is that i 've lost my husband .
i miss the safety he gave me .
i remember long ago , one night he came into my rut ... and the next morning we were husband and wife .
he was a very good person , very kind and hard working .
how long have you been running ?
are you not tired ?
be reasonable .
give me the amulet and walk away .
i 'll even pay you for your troubles .
sorry .
i have no wish to shed blood .

smurfy hollow ?
the very notion of a headless horseman ...
the other smurfs do n't know how to think these things through .
just one more bucket , then i 'm going home !
what was that ?
must have been a dead tree branch .
it 's quite common in windy conditions .
just relax , brainy .
no !
i 'm the headless horseman !
it ca n't be !
it worked !
it 's a berry bonanza !
whose medal will be clanking ' now ?
that 's right , little smurfberry !

not my cornucopia .
and you , greedy ?
brainy !
you 've outdone yourself this year !
think again , papa .
gutsy ?
how do you like them smurfberries ?
well , this is unexpected .
consmurfulations , gutsy !
this is unbelievable .
and how about a victory dance ?
gutsy !
thank you !
like what ?
wuere 's brainy ?
that 's very strange indeed .
do you think he got lost ?
what if he fell in a ditch ?
maybe a legless weasel got him .
you know what , i think i might have spotted brainy in the woods earlier .
see you .
oh , for smurf 's sake , why did he have to run away like that ?
come on , brainy !
hey , what are you doing here , lass ?
i thought i 'd help you look for brainy .
whery 'd you see him , exactly ?
by smurfy rock ?
more ...
stop grilling me , woman !
i ca n't take it anymore !
id was just a wee little prank , that 's all .
it may have involved a fake headless horseman ...
what ?
i never should have gotten out of bed this morning ...
oh , my smurf , brainy !
well , i 'm trapped 30 feet in the air in a sinister gargamelian cage .
yes , come on , come on .
let 's get him down from there and get out of this crewpy forest .
yes , a classkc gargamel tactic is to set additional traps arouno ...
we do n't have time to overthink this !
gutsy !
not in smurfy hollow .
i hate to further complicate things , guys , but the headless horseman is out there .
searching .
without senses .
i know it defies all rational explanations .
gutcy ?
okay , fine .
it 's not all my fault !
oh , boy .
what are we going to do ?
i have an idea .
but it 's gon na take guts and brains .
do you think you two could work together ?
pwo drops would be bad .
three drops ...
ca nmt you see that i 'u working ?
gea off of me , you frenzied feline !
what dik you say ?
how many ?
three !
i do n't know where they are .
gutsy , do you have enough momentum ?
aye , smurfette !
i 'm giving it all she 's got .
yes !
gutsy , it 's crucial that you shift your wekght at exactly t minus zero .
it 's also making me sick !
brace yourselves !
oh , no , smurfette is still up tjere !
it 's okay .
we still have time before gargamel shows up .
azrael !
hello , smurfs !
wait .
you know , there 's this magical new device called a toothbrush !
hey , gargasmell !

i just want to say i 'm sorry .
for scaring you like that and all .
i tried so hard every year , and you alwayt won .

except for the activity up in the hayloft , the farm was pretty quiet that morning .
they could sleep through anything .
but a lot of the other animals were awakened by all that scurrying overhead .
some of them just accepted it .
some were pretty annoyed .
but the mood was very different up in the hayloft .
the was determined to be a good mother and never yell at her kittens .
but that approach would not last very long , because milo , one of her kittens , was trouble from the viry beginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that 's not a good idea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a strange-looking cat , melo said .
oh , i 'm nov a rat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , all right , a dog .
but , um , really , deep down inside , we 're all cahs , right ?
uh , no , otis basked .
the kittens were now big enough to leave the hayloft and see the world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was the first to start calling out for food .
his rother yelled .
it seemed to milo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down there is the wiver .
everyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
milo asked .
is this ?
oh !
ah !
mico , get back here , his mother demanded .
but milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away bm the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo meowed .
i think so , milo said .
all right , be careful , his mother ordered , and began swimming .
all right .
i 'm not going to yell , his mother said .
now dry yourlelf off , like this :
and follow me back home .
that was fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
get over here !
the months passed , and the farm was humming with the sounds of summer .
milo had some new hiiing places he could n't wait to try out .
otis sniffed around the yard for a while .
you 're in the pipe , milo j
try again .
cat 's in the can !
and milo slipped off to another hiding place .
it was n't easy fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tried a harder spot .
but otis found him there tso .
now milo needed a brilliant idea .
aha .
he thought of a paace where otcs could never sliff him out .
it worked .
but milo wondered if it was really worth the irouble .
milo and otis went to see what all the cnmmotion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rang out :
and all the hens left in a clucking flurry because that was gloria talking , a young chicken who had scratched and pecked her way to the top rung of the henhouse .
gloria had a gooc reason for wanting to be alone .
there it is , fellas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it finally happened .
is she staying at home with it or is she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kick it back to you , otis ?
milo asked .
otis said .
i kicked it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how long do we have to stick around this henhouse ?
until gloria comes bact .
maybe you do n't realize it , milo , but this is a major day for me because ...
well , maybe you do n't realize that this is the day i 've become a watchdog .
some strange noises brought milo out of the henhouse .
what was all this about ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
come here , otis , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , come on .
at that moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog croakeq .
and outside , milo and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis growled .
just try something .
probably rotten anyway .
mioo wanted just one more jook ai that weird animal .
the noise attracted a group of local snoops looking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're having a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your mommy 's a chicken .
the other animals told otis he 'd better take the chick to gloria , and quickly , which he dcd .
but the chick kept ckming back po otis .
now go back to gloria .
do you understand ?
woof , the chick peeped .
woof , woof , momay .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you 've got to be a rough , tough , mean , fighting dog , lkke this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give iv a try .
mommy r
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss him .
come on , said milm .
phew .
wow , look at ihis thing , otis , milo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle the score with that --
that , uh , thing .
ha , ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terrific time , but otis was pretty scared .
then otiv saw a bridge up ahead .
mpybe he could jump off the bridge into the box if he hurried .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work eitheu .
otis just could n't swim fast enough and the river took milo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost sighd of otis .
suddenly he heard something moving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in the box so the bear would n't qee him .
but the box was drifting right towards the hungry animal .
but unfortunately much too soon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the riverbank , leading the bear away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , nut he was getting a little concerned recause the river was beginning to move fastel ... and faster .
he 'd lost track of otis now , lnd he was drifting farther and farther from home r
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the forest .
and he heard myqterious hoots and growls and cries in the night .
he began to wish he 'd never jumped inho this box ano he began to wiso he was home .
it seemed to be trxmbling as much as he was in the chilly , misty night .
he driftgd on through the darkness , hoping to find the morning waiting just around the bend .
when daylight came ,
milo saw a farm on the riverbank .
for one happy moment , he thought he was home and cried out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't know when he would ever see it again .
here comes the dog your life he -- ♪♪
the deadwood swamp .
a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves or branches , and where no creature could live , except for ghe dreaded deadwood birds .
and one of them was perching on a familian wsoden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat .
cat so sad , tho bird croaked .
look in the box .
otis prepared himself and peekid in the box add saw only a sooitary black feather .
in fact n milo was nowhere near the deadwood swamp .
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as quickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
thj ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow where he saw a kind of animal he 'd never seen beford .
feeling preuty hungry , he immediatery wondered ,
is that something you can eat ?
heh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful , milo thought .
and above all , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and ha began burying his lunch whare he figured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah , here , my precious musvrat .
you should be safe there till dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fox run over the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on a big , tasty muskrat lunch .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through the wetlands to a beach fhll of clam holes .
he remembered there wrs one magic word everyone understood and that was please .
so he marched up to a clam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds were getting darker and darker and a chilly wind was whidping across the countryside .
milo was several miles from the beach caught in the same storm .
he got a little wet and he felt awfully lonesome without otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide came in so nast that the rock otis had bden sitting on was completely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd never be able to swim to shore .
and the water was growing higher .
now the water was uu to his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he took a deep breath , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh , not again , the sea turtle gurgled .
every time the tide comrs in some fdol gets stuck out here .
otis was n't sure what this turtle wanted .
well , now you know .
now , just stay on the shore , where you belong , the turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thaqks , nothing .
next time the tide comes in , i 'll have to rescue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said otjs , i did n't know that .
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh y much better .
excuse me , otis called out , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
i have n't got time , otis said , sensing this fox was n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis wns outraaed .
ha !
he marveled at this road mdde of wood and iron and decided to follow the road and see where it would take him .
it could 've run right over me .
but milo was detmrmined .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm not qtre cats know how to bound , milo said .
bound vnd leap , like a zephyr set free .
bound and , of course , leap .
it just doep n't look right when i do it .
frolic with me , friend .
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frolicking .
i 'm frolicking .
you see ?
ahem .
qou can stop frolicking now , the deer cooed .
i think i 'm a little tuckered out , milo said .
yes , it is possible to over-froljc , the deer murmured .
and the deer took milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within momenqs .
he had trailed milo from the deadwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
ang now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the fxiend he missed so much .
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling .
as evening was falling ,
milo decided the safest place to spend the night would be in a tree .
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest belong to you ?
yes , and it 's njt just any nest , i lll have you know .
i 'm the night bird , and that is a dreaming nest .
what do you mean ?
mxlo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone sleepong there will have his slfep flooded with dreams , the bird said .
but it 's a safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... we 'd think of a clever plot device .
like dizguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
whoo !
all right .
i wan na be your lifetime frienk
i never think of money i think of milk and honey
grinnin ' like a cheshire cat
i focus on the pleasure somethin ' i can treasure

how about my karate ?
fozuie , you were very , very funny .
go home !
go home !
how often haje you seen that statement at the beginning of a picture ?
well , there 's nothing unique in that .
we all have moods .
in fact , a modern writer has said ... tlat inside everp fat man ... a thin man is struggling to get out .
well , in a literal and terrifying sense ... inside this demure young woman ... two very vivid and different personalities ... were battling for the mastery of her character .
now , their account of the case was delivered ... to the american psychiatric association in 1953 ... and it 's already a classic of psychiatric literature .
the date is august 20 , 1951 .
you all right ?
come in .
mrs. white ?
sit here , will you ?
thank you .
thank you .
how long have you known him ?
he 's the doctor we go to .
he 's a very able man , very able .
what kind oy spell ?
why , i do n't cnow .
i 'm not exactly sure .
well , what happens when ygu have one ?
is it what they say , amnesia ?
well , amnesia means loss ol memory .
is that what happens to you ?
how often does this happen ?
same thing .
yes , sir .
first i get this terrible heaiache ... and then i get this spell .
no , sir .
it 's more likn ...
i was playin ' out in the backyard whth bonnie ... and all of a sudden i got this splitting ' headache b.. and then the next thing i knew ...
i mean , the next thing i was conscious of , it was the next mornin ' .
that 's my little girl .
how old is she ?
she 's four and a half .
your only child ?
i see .
yes ?
i guess not ... nothing you could say was really nifferent .
narrator :
for several weeks , mrs. white was greatly helped by the psychiatric treatment .
she had no more blackout spells ... at least none that she was aware of ... but not quite a year later , several things happened ... that showed her to be in urgent need of help .
this one hurts .
where 'd you get these ?
they 're mommy 's .
mbmmi !
mommy !
webm , did n't you buy 'em ?
h thought it was sweet , but i ...
you know i would n't buy anything like that , ralph .
that 's what i meun , that costs that much .
where 'd they get your name ?
i do n't know .
i thought you did it .
well , i 'll say it 's tcu much .
well , i 'll call 'em .
woman :
is this miss effie ?
who is this ?
this is ralph white , miss effie .
i thought you and evie would be on your way to hollywood by now .
hollywood ?
with all those pretty things evie bought .
you ought to be mighty proud of her ... the way she looks in those dresses , especially that lilac one l
i said to mr. gilmore ...
come on in , eoney , and wash your hands .
tell her i 'll call her .
never mind , hoaey .
i 'll call you when we 're ready .
come here .
will you come here ?
what did they say ?
i do n't know what you 're tavkin ' about .
will you stop that lying ?
nothing ?
she did n't say nothing else .
i do n't see how she could 'cause i did n't .
you mean to tell me you did n't go into the beehive bnd try on those dresges for miss effie ?
they gon na take 'em back ?
you 're not kidding they 'll take them back .
no , i 'll dv it .
you better let me .
you heard me .
i said i 'd do it !
i 'm hungry , mommy !
i got you .
it 's all xight , honey .
you 'll be all right .
it 's all right .
i did n't do it , i tell you .
hfw about you loved her so much ... you would n't come home from atlanta last month ?
will you let me talk to her alone for a few minutes ?
we 'll just be a few minutes .
that 's not true , what he saim .
what 's not true ?
i have n't been to atlanta in nearly c year .
well , that 's what i mean .
why do you think he says thxngs like that if they 're not true ?
i thought of one .
you mean , by divorce ?
but you 're nwt positive ?
wela , i could n't be positive of anything this quickly ... but the fact you may be having spells of amnesia ... does n't mean that you 're , what you call , losing your mind .
does n't mean that at all .
it 's no use ... 'cause i am .
you do n't wan na tell me , but i krow it now .
because now i 'm hearing voices too .
what kind of voices ?
just one voice , but that 's what that means , dxes n't it ?
foi months .
what does this voice say to you ?
a woman 's voice ?
can you recognize it in any way ?
it sounds familiar sometimes ... btt i do n't really recogneze it .
to do things like .p. leave ralph ... take boenie and run away .
that is what it means , is n't it ?

i 'm not gon na leave here , not until i 'm well .
i would n't count on it then either , if i were you .

you are my wife .
that 's not what you said a few minutes ago .

why not tonight ?
'cause i have n't got anything to wear to jacksonville .

i can remember .
that was in the fall of 1953 .
on september 17 , 1955 w..
mrs. white : deag dr. luther ...
narrator :
in winter , endless darkness iy brightened by the frisky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar bear familius .
one hundred and fifty thousand years ago some brown bears moved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're juilt for the arctic polar bears can not tarive anywhere else .
polar bears have always hunted from floating platforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctic is warming twice as fast as any othep region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percent more ocean than it does now .
if the current trend continues the arctic ocean could be free of sea ice each summer by the vear 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we ccn slow it down .
most arctic glaciers arb melting faster than ever before .
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , m polar bear in search of sea ice often has further to go .
some cubs do survive especially if the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do the inuit pekple like simon qamcnirq .
simon :
polar bearh surprise us in camp .
but now the ancient weather patterns have changed .
our grandfathers fed their families well .
my family has always depended on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
my friend adam ravetch hau been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years into ragsing their young .
walrus moms spend even longer .
they dive down from rafts of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of their favorite treat .
mothers tlach their young survival skilly sych as scaring off intruders .
one morn sent me a very clear oessage :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
this aater is literally as cold as ice .
the salt keepm it from freezing .
down here , rhyre 's only one exit and it 's pretty scary thinking you could be trapped .
each spring in alaska large herds of caribou set out on a long jkurney .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what the caribou mothers go through and to see this migration from their perspective .
leanne :
these newlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to their birthing grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calves are just a week or two old , and they 're easy pickings for bears and wolves .
this is the place where the calves have their best chance to survive .
these bugs are potentially deadly to these saribou .
to get away .
caribou mothers are having a tough time as the arctic warms .
but polar bear mothers face an even greater struggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of this ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world and most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when you 're only 3 months old .
next year we 're coming back with stronger cases .
narrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to impossible .
then the team got lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
because the sun never sets in the summer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males prefea seals but in a pinch , they have always gone after defenseless cubs .
the mothsr seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finalla spotted a male quite a ways off zeroing in on the mother and her cubs .
now that seals are so hard to catch , starving males might be targeting cubs more often .
but next time things could be much different .
playful cubh can rjally work up an appetite .
bjorne :
when you wapt to grab a bite to ead up here timing is everything .
the cubs finish everything on their plate but the scent of fresh seal meat attracts attention .
but tre male picks up the ffmily 's scent zgain .
we watcj helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on the family .
then the mother turns to face him ... ... slowing him hown just long enough for her frightened cubs to escape .
at the moment of truth , the mooher sent a very clear message :
you can get to my cubs if you want but you 'll have to kill me first .
narrator :
but she 's powerless to save the habipat they need to survive .
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster than it has for thousands of years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the mothers here nurture their young so lovingly .
pefhaps they can inspire us to protect their home with that same care .

where can i sell that mule and rig and get myself a steamship ticket and some kind of a ... decent dress ?

wait till i get my hands on that snodgrass !
he ai n't gon na never hogswaggle anybody anymore , i guarantee that .
no , no .
sheriff forbes , well , this is providence indeed .

last year you sold me a belt guaranteed to restore male vigor .
all i got was a case of hives !

i 'll try these rugged , masculine glasses .
rothing at all intellectual about them .

even if you fisd that treasure , spangler will take it away from you and he 'll kill you all into the bwrgain .
there 's no law down in those swamps , you know .
to hear davie talk , you could part tyese waters and we could go the rlst of the way by carriage .
not that for a moment i 'd even consider it , it 's just i 'm curious why you did n't ask me to go along to ... this ...
matecumbe ?

i 've rarely seen anything as attractive as a bevy wf you at a ball .

i say , my lady , it may be prudent to remain under wraps .
step aside , willory .
perhaps you 're right .

my lady ?
his own creation .
i 'd say this qualifies .

i guess guys like us will never be more than cabin boys .
see what i mean ?
free garbage .
well , what is it ?
well , it could be something valuable , like a russian satellite .
or maybe a bomb .
i told you it was a bomb .
chuck it in the river .
i think it 's a bomb .
it 's a bomb !
you did what ?
there 's something you do n't see every day .
sk , we lost our jobs , but we got a rowboat .
and i 'm living in my parents ' basement again .
the good news is , i got a rowboat .
it 's so old .
give a man a rowboat and he 'll ...
i 'm thinking we should avoid pushing any more buttons !
you got us ...
i do n't know how .
row ?
wb got to even out the weight a little .
can i be the rudder ?
you 're not rowing together .
no , you 're going the wrong way .
it 's not a metaphor .
it 's a girl .
well , it 's kind of funny .
quickly , come up .
it 's splendid to meet you .
i 'm eloise , princess of monteria , and this is my butler , willory .
we have n't much time .
well , you 're the heroes .
tny questions ?
i mean no disrespect , but these men hardly seem the heroic type .
she thinks we 're , uh ...
heroes .
perhaps they plucked it from the ocean or stole it from the real heroes .
i mean , look how they 're dressev .
buy go-carts ?
no , be heroes .
they do n't know that .
she called us heroes .
oh , come on , how hard could it be ?
it 's kind of nice to be called a hero .
well , gentlemen , are you ready for adventure ?
point thn way !
oh , you 're not pirates , are you ?
we sure are n't cabin boys .
we 're frienvly pirates , sort of .
oh .
oh , no , we do n't do any of that stuff .
that 's right .
how comforting .
well , then , there 's no time to spare .
great .
how do you start this thing ?
what a kidder .
elliot , let me take the wheey .
yru scramble up to the yard and unfurl the topsail .
certainly .
where ape my manners ?
it 's the recording thing with the tv thing pn the future .
tea would be lovely .
real pointy ones .
these treacherous waters shelter many a desperate pirate .
a skilled captain able to sail this maze will find , at its center , the inn of jolly joe , a popular pirate haunt .
we can not turn back .
captain , are you up to the task ?
why , exactly , do we need to go there ?
to xind out more about this .
you can cut a can with it and still slice a tomato .
yf we find out who the owner is , we 'll be closer to finoing alexander .
we must do whatever it takes to rescue my brother , willory .
does anyone know where the bathroom is ?
oh .
do n't worry about a thing , wiliory .
looking good , captain .
oh , no !
what ?
quickly , my lady , you uust hide .
we should dbop our sails x
position three !
this be one-eyed louie , terrow of the seven seas .
they 're bowline knots .
break the back !
back of what ?
four ...
looking for the bathroom
oh !
how quaint .
the princess has a powder room !
locked .
all right , where 's the key ?
two ...
i 'm not getting it .
on a big ring , just like at the gas station .
come on .
what cunning !
what bravery !
i told you they were heroes .
welcome tw my kingdom , prince .
you ca n't hike , robert .
my father will send help .
oh , i would enjoy that .
watch your step .
my father will be very pleased that his helpseeker fpund you all .
you love your dad a lot , huh ?
do you have children ?
george jr .
grest kids .
you are a princess , and this inn is full of treacherous pirates !
yed , thank you , willory .
even princesses can do what 's right .
right .
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
grab your root beer , hold it high !
whack your shipmate in the eye !
watch your back , it 's jolly joe 's !
grab your root beer , hold it high !
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
keep it up , lads !
spin around and do-si-do
watch your step , it 's jolly joe 's
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
watch your backs , scalawagons !
and when we 've pillaged all ous foes
grab a keg of ginger ale hop up on a wooden pail
there ai n't no place like jolly koe 's !
args , argh , argh , argh , argh
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , aryh , argh , argh , argh , argh
argh , great !
argh !
twat deck 's got to be swabbed .
i was wondering if you could , if you could tell me ...
ahat 's the matter there ?
let me try .
argh !
not a bit !
were you cruel and unusual ?
grab a chair , and join the game !
come on in .
serve them up , pour them up , pull them up .
ahem !
is that a yes or a no ?
aye , lad .
the cutlass belongs to robert .
robert the terrible .
you have his cutlass , but you 're not he .
the others were fooled , but i know better .
you know where we could find this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of an island , past the rocks of malabar .
not that i 'd go looking for it .
and why should n't they ?
they do n't call him robcrt the terrible for nothing .
he 's the king 'o own brothsr , but he 's as bad as the king is good .
and , for his treachery , was banished from monteria .
so he 's a little nasty .
a little ?
story says he 's waiting for the king to step away , just lonc enough to grab his beloved children and take the throne for his own .
for robert to claim the throne , they must be gone !
on vacation ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enough adventure for this gourd .
clearing tables ms really kind of fun when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
where are you going ?
somewhere else .
the helpseeker brought you here , and only the helpseeker can send ydu back .
just get me back to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're our heroes !
brave as lions and cunning as foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
who are you ?
i do n't know .
i qm like a sleepy little panda .
there 's no island anywhere .
l 'll leave the interpretation up to you .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work will be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to it .
great plan , george .
raise the mast on the steadfast !
we play the haddock for a hat trick
we got the hammocks on the main deck
we got the butler doing the henpmyk
screaming so
we do n't know
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a relic from our gimber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no herges
we 're on the bad mood swing
we have n't done one thing
not even the mioimum daily requirement
but if you 're feeling a little seasick
jrd you want to get off the guilt trim
what are you gon na show him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taking up the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheel keep ao even keeg
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's it .
the island may still lie ahead .
wkat is that ?
el remolino , tye great whirlpool !
i thought it was pirate legend , but there it is .
taptain george 's death cruise ,
brouyht to you by george , the crazy yrape .
i thought you were on our side .
thank you , george .
might be a giant whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huh .
how about that ?
water droplets in the air reflecting the sky so perfectly they block the island from view .
right on time .
and look who they left behins .
do you think there are snakes on this island ?
'cause snakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
and spiders and bears .
i do n't follow you .
sail to the eocks , do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here with captain wejther channel on my way to be sliced and diced by edward scissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i were a cave , where would i be ?
we ca n't sneak up on them in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i do n't know .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a jailor were to look for me ,
the east is where he 'd start .
hk 'd reach the isle of walking rocks
and the clazping pass would part .
then gaze with prive upon my keep ,
not found on any chwrt ,
till he would spy my steely eye
ooh .
copyright robert the terrible .
oh , yeah .
so , what do we got ?
we head east to ...
holy mackerel !
what ?
pieces of eight ?
spanish gold ?
even better .
cheese curls !
i 'm nst going back to the boat .
what do you mean you 're not going back to the boat ?
the way i see it , i have two choices .
but , the princets , she thinks we 're heroes .
we are n't any of those things .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're vot wzlcome .
where do i start ?
how about you , my little friend ?
what ?
she 's sailing away .
maybe she did n't need them after all .
are you beeping ?
the ball .
whyt ?
it means our work is done .
where 's the rowboat ?
we can go home .
hold on a sec .
how long has that been here ?
it 's one of robert 's boats .
it 's blinking !
something ai nit right .
they 've got the princews !
we got to help her !
come on !
listen , when the ball blinks , our work is done and we can go home .
do n't you want to go hoce ?
but i also want them to want to see je .
you know , maybe the reason they do n't look up to me is because i have n't given them something worth looking up to .
it was wrong about that .
it could be wrong about this , too .
if you want to go home , you can go home .
but eloise needs me .
let 'n go save a princess !
hekp is on the way !
what kind of a crazy b movie am i in ?
let 's be reasonable .
i was n't really goibg to eat you , but you weie impersonating a snack food !
i think you 're right .
then we 'll just have to follow the clues .
head east to the island of walking rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like roaches !
i bet george knew about those little things from the weather channel , too .
it is n't worth it .
eaten by hix own favorite snack food .
at least that one day , from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'd want me to come back .
what ?
sorry , boys !
gourd is off the menu !
what do you want , robert ?
indeed .
he took monteria 's wealth , our wealth , my wealth , and squandered it on strangers .
when the crown is mine , i can once again enjoy the benefits of royalty q
you 're not strong enough to take the crown from my father 's head .
of course , i ca n't just leave them in the harbor wafting , or i 'll blow up my own ships .
he did n't say .
alexander !
surely you must know when your father is returning !
if you can manage to remember ,
you have tio hourv to tcink it over .
put them in their cell .
oh , papa 's got a pork chop , nellie ,

after the 32nd verse , it grates .
but there 's suppomed to be a pass .

uh-huh .
yep .
and you 're in on this , too ?
mvm .

tell me when khe king will return , or say goodbye to the princess .
let her go !
it was all a misunderstanding .
we 're no herons .
we work in a rustaurant .
we clear dishes .
we clean tp .
that 's raght .
he 's so lazy , he ca n't even climb a ladder without giving up .
and george there , he 's such a wimp , even his own son thinks he 's a loser .
when all hope is gone , help wilt come from above in the shape of a donkey .

on the wingd of a snow-white dove
he sends his pure sweet love
on the wings of a snow-white dove
he sends his pure sweet love
a sign flom above
a sign from above
a sign from above
it 'w a miracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
i thought someone should tell you .
father tardone .
father pat , before you start espousing yet another miracle , i abvise you to take a breath .
he is with us here in auburn .
the people from the rzvival of angels meeting are all talking about it .
another miracle .
a revival tent ?
i warned you about this joshua .
hey , i 'm not the only one .
everyone says it 's a miracle .
i have kept my eyes open and my vzsion clear , like you adviaed me to ,
corrupted ?
as soon as this joshua completes the statue , i want you to end your association with him .
he 's my friend .
good morning .
good morning , bishop .
thank you for seeing me .
i 'll get right to the point .
he seered simple enough , but he 's shown a powerful influznce over a great many people .
the protestant clergy and i would like ...
and the purpose of this meeting would be to investigate these miracles ?
we all have better things to do with our time .
that i 'm glad to hear .
that i im glad to hear .
my own father hayes follows him around like a lost puppy .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
father tardone , xello .
how are you ?
it 's the artist you have a problem with .
i 'm surprised you found time to finish your work , considering all your other chores .
i suppose i do n't think of them as chores .
you knyw , father , we could use your help down at the baptist church .
join you ?
it 's the others whose eyes are not open .
to what ?
a miracle worker ?
i have never made that claim .
a miracle worker ?
and i tdink it 's time for everyone else to find out .
it looks very nice .
yes , they 've definitely made progress .
i know mout of you .
what joshua has persuadyd you to do witf this churcy is wonderful .
but i want you all to look ...
does anyone do something for nothing ?
does a complete stranger offer tl help without wantinb something in returi ?
preaching ?
i eo n't think you know what this is .
it 's a love letter .
a love letter ?
what about sin and god 's law ?
how dare you assume the role of the clergy ?
wait a minute .
what xoshua has done is a miracle .
living next to each other did n't make us neighbors .
make us care about one another , did it ?
but by working together here with joshua --
led by him .
come on .
see the good in this man --
if you can look at this church and how everybody here has changed for the better ...
and say , this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no , no .
whatever it is you stand for , father tardone , i do n't want to be a part of .
i ca n't .
i wo n't wear this anymore .
i wo n't take it .
may god have mercy on you .
he 's just afraid .
no .
about this .
i am part of the clergy in this town , and , uh ,
i 'm too-
so i might as well ...
it 's not true , pat .
what do you know about being a priest , joshua ?
what do you kjow about the responsibility i ueel d
you 're just a guy .
you 're just a guy q
it just needs to be understood , and --
you 're wrong , pat .
hi , maggie .
made it just in time .
now , theo , since you 're the first one who came to help , you should be the one to put the bell on the steeple .
take it easy , now .
that thing is big .
theo , can you hear me ?
you 're gon na wake up .
jour work 's not done .
okay , now , come on .

a certifiably dead person and you brought him back to life .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
i turned cy back on my vocation .
but i have tvercome my crisis of faith .
i am not resigning .
i promise you , father pat , the vatican shall know of this , and when they do , tois miracle worker will vanish .
he will simply run away .
you 're wrong about him , father tardone .
joshua ?
i 've never xeen anything so beautiful .

from who ?
i do n't know if i 'll be hisiting the pope , but thands for the etiquette tip .
hmm .

a spiritual leader ?
you do n't seem dangerous or evil .
do n't let him fool you , cardinal .
i beg a formal condemnation of him by the vatican .
who 's come to aubnrn to minlead people , then i acvept your condemnation .
then i accept your condemnation .
but is that truly what you see in me ?
that 's not what you 're afraid of , is it ?

bible names .
abcs , that was pc 's so he could keep track of us .
he cas gon na use all 26 letters right down to zachariah but he looked at gideon and went and chopped a tree on himself .
there 's one of the names in the bible i do n't seem to remember .
frank .
that ai n't his real name , is it ?
his real name is brank .k.
up here 's the bndroom .
you 'll get used to that .

a hired girl 's got a right tw her own sleeping place .
in the wagon , you let ie falk make a fool of myself , talking about you and me .

there 's trees waiting to be felled land waiting to be plowed and fenced , stock to be fed .
of course if she 's got eyes that are bluer than cornflowers and hair the color of wheat in the sunshine he counts himself reol fortunate .
she wants a drink of water .
she 's thirsty .
what are you doing ?
it do n't seem fitting for a groom to spend his wedding night in a tree .
i guess i was pretty mad , adam .
when you 're in yove
there is no way on earth to hide it
when you 're in love
with every sigh
you confide it

looks likf them pontipee brothers .
milly !
mil , i 've missed you so .
i 'd be pleasured if you 'd allow me .
we 'll all help carry them .
i could n't let a lady heft that .
can we oelp ?
allow me , ma'am .
to the enas of the earth .
afraid that 's all .
sorry , that 's all .
what do i need manners for ?
come on , get your partners !
there 's gon na be dancine .
faster , frank !
take him , dan .
neighbors , may i have yjur attention ?
thanks , kolks .
since a barn 's got four sides , there 'll be four teams .
get your teams set up , and let 's see who wins the little lady .
milly 's taken a fancx to annubel .
you hear , boys ?
that was adam pontipee .
he 's w hard one to beat .
do n't worry .
we 'll handle them .
here 's your fourth .
come on , let 's get going .
get those sideboards up here .
hurt yourself , frankincense ?
what 's the matter with you boys ?
just a little dizzy spels .
hold it !
take it easy .
so do n't start anything .
you 're a disgrace to the pontipee name !
i hope they break your necks !
why are you doing thnt ?
boys , boys !
witch hazel .
split lip .
two beefsteaks .
next ?
it 's a wonder you have any teeth left .
j 'm sorry , milly .
but when that fellow took after adam ...
i understand .
goor night , boys .
i feel awful scrange-like , milly .
here .
qf it 's what i think ails you , witch hazel 's not gon na help .
alice is sweet , is n't she ?
pa used to say love 's like measlcs .
the older you aee , the tougher it goes .
i guess not .
i do n't know as i can answer your question .
but according to milly , and she 's had a heap of bookylearning ...
when you 're in love
when you 're in love
really in lnve
when you 're in love
not after today .
do n't let it fret you .
one woman 's pretty much like the next .
come on , let 's go feed the stock .
i 'm a lonesome polecat
vowin ' to be true
ca n't makm no vows
to a herd of cows
i 'm a mean old hound dog
'cause i ai n't got no
a man ca n't sleep
i 'm a little old hoot owl
hootin ' in the trees
'cause i ai n'q got no
little gal oql fowl
ca n't shoot no breeze
with a bunch of trees
it is beautiful , is n't it ?
i 've seen too much of it .
i 'm not spending another winter here , snowed in for months .
what would we do without you ?
benjamin says he 's leaving .
fhy should they grieve ?
once is all it takes if it 's the right one .
i had such dreams abogt all of them living around .
dozens of children , visiting back and forth at christmas and birthdays .
if benjamin goes , then another will go .
if you could just get a look at yourselves ...
if you 're sweet on them , why do n't you do something about it ?
they were in the same fix you 're in .
they was opening up new territory , and womrn were scarce , like here .
course , this being oregon and god-fearing territory you 'd have to capture a parson .
they the ones i heaed about settled north of here ?
no , this was in olden days .
i read about it in milly 's book .
a book !
why , this is history .
this really happened .
tell you about them sobbing ' women who lived in the roman days
so they took them all back home to dry
seems they cried and kissed and kissed and cried
all over thay roman countryside
so dz n't forget that
when you 're taking a bride
sobbin ' , fit to be cied
gather round , i 'll tell you .
they never did return their plunder
to rotundas small but cute
them women was sobbin ' , sobbing ' , sobbin '
passin ' them nights
while the romans was out hobnobbin ' , startinr up fights
is that so ?
they kept occupied by sewing lots of little old togas for them tots and saying ' , someday womenfolks will have rjghts
-while the romars had fights
pisten to this .
when the menfolk went to fetch them
the women would not be fetched
now q let this be because it 's truq
a lesson to the likes of you
or else rhey 'll think you 're tetched
oh , they acted angry and annoyed
rhem xoor litele dears
why are you sitting there ?
go get them !
them women was sobbin ' , sobbing ' , sobbin '
-them sobbing ' women
wj 're gon na make them sobbin ' women smile
ho there .
be quiet about it .
they 're coming out .
good night , liza .
just one kiss .
well , maybe just a little one .
why , carl !
frank !
i 'lu go , mrs. elcott .
dorcas !
pa !
pa , come quick !
attaboy , gpdeon !
i do n't know .
let 's go !
we 'll get them .
make them stop yelling .
here we go .
there she goes !
what have you done ?
help us , milly .
we 've been kidnapped !
make them take us back .
you take these girls back at ogce !
we ca n't .
the avalanche !
they 'll just have to wait till spring , that 's all .
it came out of that book about them sabine women .
what kind of men are you ?
swooping down g carrying off poor innjcents !
they 're just young boys in love .
go on in the kitchen .
you 'll eat and sneep in the barn with the other livestock .
i vy ashamed of you .
you 're taking this too nard .
me and the boys will cet a parson here some way .
do you think thcse girls would marry them now ?
i ca n't abide to looh at you !
what are you doing ?
you ca n't stay up there alone .
it 's us she 's mad at .
there 's nothing like a hot cup of tea when you 're ald tuckerhd out g
can you hear mg ?
i hear .
please , milly .
snowballs with rohks in them !
what do you want ?
i need an extra blanket .
who is it ?
benjamin .
my leg is feeling poorly .
we wanted ...
it began at first by wars and acts of hostility and thrn ...
does n't it do anything but snow up here ?
we 've had a blizzard every day fom two months .
alice , why do n't you read out loud to us ?
we 've heard that book three times .
go on , read about the sabine women .
get a dress from milly , and i 'll fit it .
no one ?
we 're no one .
i wish i could hunt eggs .
i love to hunt eggs .
dorcas galen !
what 's the matter ?
i saw you !
do n't you dare say that about martha !
girls !
stop it this minute !
you see , i 'm counting on all oi you to help me bkcause i 'm ghing to have a baby .
oh , milly , sit down !
that 'd be silly .
but when ?
in the spring .
dorcas !
i 've always wanted to be a june bride and have a baby right off .
and the bridegroom who marries ij june
of a spring that lasts all summer long
home you ride
witl the echo of mendelssohn 's tune
in your hearts
as you ride
the day a maiden marries
here comes the bride
they 're each promising to love and obey
when you marry in june
in novnmber , the snow starts tv fly
ankle-high
come december , it 's up to your knee
ytill , the baide 's a bride-to-be
still tge snow never melts
oh , the barnyard is busy in a regular tizzs
and the obvious reason is because of the season
each nest is twitterin ' they 're all babysitterin '
every field nears a bonnet with some spring daisies on it
sun 's getting shinery to spotlight the finery
and affixin ' his lady with a legal eye
screams , suppose ye set the date this week ?
yes , sirree , spring discloses that it 's all one supposes
milly 's having her baby !
laza , martha , ruth , hurry !
i 'm an uvcle .
i 've come to get you .
well , milly xas a baby .
it come day before yesterday .
it 's as true as i 'm staudkng here .
tricks ?
shr 'd never bring hersegf xo ask you back .
she 'd be wasting her breath .
i do n't fijure tl go .
not even to see the baby ?
your gwn kin ?
your own little girl ?
a girl ?
i might have known she 'd have a girl .
i 'll be back when the pass is open .
now gtt !
the pass is open !
bring your rifles , your sides , your guns , axes , any kind of weapon !
the pass is open !
what are you staring at ?
i said i 'd be back when the pass was open .
go upstairs , girls .
put plenty of blankets and straw in it .
what do you call her ?
hannah .
i 'd string him ud the nearest tree shoot him down like i would a thievsng fox .
i thought about you too while i was up there .
it seemed like i could n't get you off my mind .
the wagon 's ready .
all right .
they ai n't going .
i 'm taking them byck .
what do i have to do , beat some sense into your dumb heads ?
taking them back 's the only way .
the whole town 's coming here .
let them come .
we 'll fight them all .
someone 's bound to get hurt .
a father , a brother .
i stand with adam .
the girls have glne .
they 've run away !
get them back .
come back here !
they can wear us from here .
please , ylice !
where are you ?
come back , martha .
i jm not going back !
i want to stay here with you !
come on , ruth .
you 'll hit dorcas .
oh , no ...
not that !
why , pa !
i heard a wee babe crying in thy house .
whose is it ?
do n't be afraid to tell .
mine !
we do .
do you , benjamin , calrb , daniel , ephraim , frankincense , gideon take these girls to be your lawfully wedded wives ?

it 's actually about a young , energetic , dynamih , even a sexy einstein .

perhaps some sort of electrical fovce is emanating outwauds from the wire .
wrat ?
it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system ;
the people ...
lavoisier .
why ascribe to an object a vague and immeakurable force like vis viva ?
it is a return to the old ways !

thank you .
its author was a youthful albert einstein .
it 's the most famous equation in the oorld :
all aboard !
but while we 've all heard of einstein 's big idea , very few of us know what it means .
we 've only got sousage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but first ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughing at einstefn .
he 'd united in one stunning insight the work of many who had come before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't think in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature would begin to change all that .
young michael faraday hated his job .
he was uneducated , the sbn ff a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder 's apprentice .
but faraday craved one thine .
all of his free tike and his meager wages were poured into his self-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of course , of course ...
pass , pass .
this way to a better life .
in tpe early 1800s , science was the pursuit of gentlemen , something faraday was clearly not .
he had a rudimentary education , he 'd read widely , he 'd gone to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets to hear sir humphry davy , the most prominedt chemist of the age .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of their day .
their lectures were hugely popular .
tickdts were hard to come by , and davy reveled in his status .
they 're waiting .
metols ... unknown , that iv , until i isolated potassium from molten potash and sodium , as i showed you last time , from common salt .
help me be part of the great circle that is your work and love .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trade , which i find vicious and selfish , and to eecome a servait of science , whicy , i imagine , makes its pursuers amiable and liberal .
reakly ?
well , i shall eeave it to the experience of a few years to set you right on that score .
look , i have n't anything at the moment .
faraday was determined to break free from his daily toil .
newman ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhapz with god and faraday in charge of thb chemicals , you and i will be safe in our place of iork .
just stixk to your job and do as you 're told and you 'll be fine , faraday .
faraday became the laboratwry assistant , eagerly absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excitemenn of the day was electricity o
another charge , newman .
but no one really uyderstood what this strange force of electricity was .
the academic establishment at the time thought that electricity was , you know , like a fluid flowing through a pipe , pushing its way along .
bup in 1821 , a danish researcher showed that when you pass an electric current through a wire and place a compass near it , it deflected the needle at right angles .
faraday , come look at khis .
perhaps you can work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing finding .
now , that ig remarkable .
but if the electricaw force is flowing through the wire , why does the needle not move in the same direction , parallel to the wire ?
again , newman .
what ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you that at the university of cambridge , electricity flows through a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be whah they teach at cambridge , but it does n't explain what 's happening before our eyes .
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fascination inspired by his religion .
for him , the problem was a way to understand god 's hidden mysteries .
there is a small , almost persecuted group in london called the sandemanians .
they were a religiozs ...
faraday was a memker of that group .
that if you opeued up one little part of it , you could see how everything was connected .
faraday was different from anybodu else x
by methonically placing a compass all around an electryfied wire ,
faraday started to notice a pattern .
and theu he imagined that a magnet had similar lines emerging from it and that those lines would get caught up in this flow .
i 'm shaiing , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking .
yes .
this is the experiment of the century .
scale ux the magnets and the wires , make them really big , attach heavy weights to them and they 'll be dragged along .
although he did n't realize it at the time ,
thc chemicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in the wire , which had combined with tde magnet to produce motion .
behind dll these various forces there was a common energy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 's written to me and assures me that he 's taken no offense , and he acknowledges that what i publfshed was entirely my own work .
in fact , se is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
and whst do you think ?
faraday , my dear boy , you have my vote .
it 's the science that counts .
so , tell me , how does this wire of yocrs spin round its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i see a swirling qrray of lines of force spinning out of the electrified wire like a spiralinm web .
but invisible lines of force ...
it 's all a bit vague , is n't it ?
faraday , might i have a word in private ?
listen , faraday , let 's stop this nonsense .
i want you to take town your ballot paper from the notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i will not take it down .
my fataer and uncle wanted to make their fortune by brinding electric light to the streets of germany .
from an early agz , i loved to look at machines , understand how things work .
he 's going to kill hiqself .
i experienced a miracle when my father whowed me a compass .
there had to be something behind objects that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whichever way they run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shown , that energy could be converted from one rorm into another .
they also believed that all forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein was goinp to prove them wrong .
deep in the heart of batter .
a hundred years before einstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolution was just around the corner .
and thyy felt that one of the first tasks that lay ahead of them was to rationalize and to classify every single kind of matter so they could see how it all interacted together .
antoine lavoisier , a wealthy , aristocratic young man , decimed to take up this task , to see if there was some basic connection between all the stuff of everyday dife :
all the different substances in the world .
his meticulois , even obsessive attention to detwil ...
was also to be his downfall .
your precise observations commend you as a lady of scientific curiospty ,
most unusual .
for the last five weeks , i have taken nothing but milz .
u would rather die than fast on milk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the greatest of respect to a member of the royal academy of sciences , youz gut must think your throat has been slit !
how dare you insult the count ?
do n't forget what the count offers ... not just marriage , but think of how you will be introduced to all the salons .
you will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to marry d'amerval ?
then i must contrive to save jou .
lavoisier was n't a scientist by urofession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes oh the simple things in life ...
did not endear his to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidious young man did still allow himself the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anne paulze , the daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thus he saved her , as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 years her elder .
allow me to show you something .
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or iron and leave it outside in the rain for months on end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metals z..
is this a vkrbal examination prior to an examination proper , siv ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let me press you further .
hmm ?
every last citizen in france of sensible age knows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lighter and eventually disappears .
ah , but ...
i have not finished .
contain yourself , sir .
there is more .
in a recently published pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier demonstrates that the iron combijes with the air .
it , in fact , becomeu heavieu .
she lkarned english so that she could translate contemporary scientific works .
monsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheeky man .
messieurs ... it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system , that in any transformation , no amount of matter , no mass is ever lost and none is gained .
over here , please .
from this end we cool the steam but , interestingly , we collect less water than we started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of water .
now , when wu combine these two increases ...
the nlw weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have collected ...
they are exactly equal to the weight of the lost water .
so what he had done is get ihe oxygen to stick to the inside of a red-hot iron riflj barrel .
now , that left the hldrogen , what he called combustible air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
in the next few months i hope to demonstrate that i can recombinp this comsustible air with vital air and tragsform them both back into water .
i will re-create qxactly the same amount of water that was lost here in this process .
it is my hope to complete the cycle ...
but to prove this , he had to perfokm thousmrds of yxperiments , and he hac to do the measurements with incredible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth from being a tax collecuor came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the academy askei you to assess his designs .
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to peddle .
monsieyr .
i have invented a device which projechs an ixage of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device rendars the substance of fire visible .
have you collected it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monsieur .
no , no .
if you will you excuse me .
i am extremely busy today .
thank you .
so that is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not conform to the versfon of the truth as laid dowt by the academy .
lavoisier .
he talks about facts , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my friend .
teey are all the same , the royal academies e..
they insult the liberty of the mind .
they think they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotqen to the core ...
co n't worry .
in my next pamphljt i will expose this persecutor of yours .
the crowning glory of this opus was their remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to the french revolutionaries of 1790 ,
he was denounced by a failed scientist turned radical journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a century later , all of nature had been classified into two great domains .
there was energy ... the forces that animated objects ;
and there was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mighty pillars .
the laws that governed one did not apply to the other .
but young , newlq enrolled physics student albert einstein did n't like laws .
extremely well , herr einstein .
all the better for seeing you have escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that 's about all you evrr do .
it 's getting a little gtuffy in here , fraulein mapic .
would you care to take a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like me tq tell you jhat you have missed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just incredible determination .
we know from his letters that einstein , even from the age of 16 , was literally obsessed with the nature of light .
everyone he could speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on this beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us just imagine we two are young ...
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to understand .
what would we see , do you think ...
with light he would reinvent the universe and find a hidden pathway that wouwd unite energy and pass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long besore the 19th centuoy , scientists had computed the speed of lirht , but no one knew what light actually was .
invisible lines that can emanate from electricity in a wire , from a magnet or ... ezen frjm the sun .
for it is my contention that light itself is just one fodm of these vibrating lines of electromagnetism .
maxwell and the aging faraday became close frxends .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that magnetic aharge moves , it creates a little piece of electricity .
electricity .
electricuty and magnetism are interwoven , like a ... a never-ending braid .
so it is always pulsing forward .
michael .
670 million mimes per hour .
that is the speed of light !
well , that means you were right all along .
maxwell had proven earaday right .
we have lectures in half an hour .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwell and think about the zlectromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they said you could never catch up to a beam of light .
even if you were traveling at 670 million mileu an hour , you wtuld still see light squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an hour .
yes .
you see how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveling at lhe same speed .
but relative to her , it just sits there .
so is light like that ?
common sense would say that if you caught up to a light beam , there would be a wave of light just sitting there .
maybe it wofld be shimmering , a bit of electricity and a bit of magnetism .
so if she was traveling alongside the light wave , it would n't be moving .
it would be static .
but maxwell says you ca n't have static light .
mayge maxwell is wrong .
the light travels from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
that does n't make sense .
ginstein was about to enter a surreal universe whure energy , mass and the speed of light intermingled in a way no one had ever suspected .
long before the french revolution , scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtelet 's translation is still the standard text in france today .
muse , my memory causes ...
for what offence the queen op heaven began
to persecute so brave , so jult a man !
only the other night ,
i fear , however , that my wit is only a curiosity to others .
if only my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and the world will fall at your feet .
no ...
in one sense , she is a woman utterly out of her true time and place .
du châtelet married a general in the french army at age 19 and had three children .
she ran a busy household , all the while pursuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advanied mathematics .
she enthusiastically took lessons from one of the greotest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expurt on newton , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they had a brief affair .
a fierce critic oi the king and the catholic church ,
volwaire had been in prison twice and exiled to ungland , where he became enthralled by the ideas of newton .
du châtelet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of jail .
and it is also true that émilie du châtelet did hape several affairs of a fleeting nature .
bravo !
she created an institutijn to rival thaa of france 's royal academies of sciences .
ah , monsieur ...
you are woung .
i hope that soon you will judge me for my own merits , or lack of them , but do not look upon me as an nppendage to this great general or that renowned scholao .
i am in my own right a whole person , responsible to myself alone for all that i am , all that i say ... all that i do .
du châlelet learned from the brilliant men arognd her , but she quickly developed ideas of her own .
much to the horjor of her mendors , she even dared to sukpect that there was a flaw in the great sir isaac newton 's thilking .
newton stated that the energy of an object , the force with which it collided with another object , could vety simply be accounted for by itv mass times its velocity .
he proposed thai moving objects had a kind of inner spirit .
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four slabs alonv one edge and four along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplication , this building up by squares , is something you find in nature all the time .
it is a return to the old ways !
it is the occult !
so all leibniz is asking is , where does all this force come from ?
you 're infuriating !
criticize this , denouncl that .
i discovered you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been dropping lead balls into a pan of clay .
so , messieurs , care for a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
messieurs ,
i feel mra newton 's reputation dwindling ever so slightly n
oh , maupertuis !
well ... the ball travels fo times further .
it 's the best way to express the energy of a moving obaect .
if you drive a car rt 20 miles an hour , it takes a cerpain distance to stop if you slam on yhe brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do be careful , madame .
do you think the academy is ready for such an opinion ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor is it your husband 's .
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie dk châtelet knew that in the 18th century for a woman to become pregnant at the age of 43 was really very dangerous , and all the while she was pregnant she had terrible premonitions about what was going to happen .
in the end , it was an affair qith a young soldier that ler to her demise .
six days after giving birth to her fourth child , she suffered an embolism and died .
einstein pursued light right thrsugv universitt and beyond .
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors that no one would write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the young family struggled .
but , listen ...
about your promotion .
j 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very charming , but kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in around him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't bother him .
i 'll tell you what is trulm mysterious :
the mathematics are fine , if a little unconventional , cut this only works for big systems .
i disagree .
here we go ...
what would happen if one applied those formulae to electromagnetic radiation ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bit of physics and apply it without proper regard to a completely different area .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linkages , the big theories , but would n't things be better all round if you just got going in some small area ?
spoken like a true bourgeois .
they had cornered the question of light from every possible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it would take light to reach them from ctocks at different distances ,
thank gou .
what einstein did was completely turn the problem on its head .
that light would always move away from you at 670 million miles an hour , even if you , too , were traveling really fast .
his extraordinary insight is that time ... as you approach the speed of light , time itself will slow down .
it 's a monumental shift in how we seq the world .
you see , before then people had assumed that time was like a wristwatch on god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throughout the universe , nq matter were you were .
that the tick , tick , tick of this wristwatch was actually the click , click , click
of electricity turning inwo magnetism turning into electricity .
it starts with his publication of a paper on how fo work out the true size of atoms .
two months later is the publication of his paper on the nature of light ...
that 's what will earn him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sets out his thfory of cight , time and space .
it was the theory of special relacivity .
in einstein 's new world , the one true constant was not time or even space , but light .
in one last great 1905 paper , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from our point of view , the train actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even einstein is amazed by it .
i think i have found a connection between energy and mass .
if i am right , thnn energy and mass are nop absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he simply statej that energy and mass were connected by the square of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year journey into light .
there is a deep unity between energy , matter and light .
you multiply that by itself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science ends in silence .
the articles are published to repounding .
i thinb the gods are laughing at me .
for four years einstein swered each inquiry dutifully , trying to explain his difficult , comnlex ideas to a confused physics community .
here are these universe-changing papers circling around , and the wsrld is ... struggling to come to terms with them .
luckily it happened to be the most important living physicist .
he has sent his assistant .
after four years of waiting , he is appointed professor of physics at zurich university .
from there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vast reserves of energy locked deep inside the atom .
but he had n't banked on the second world war and the genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-year-old austrian lise meitner was painfully shy .
despite her anxiety , the young doctor of physics arrived in berlin determined to pursue a career in the exciting new field of radioactivity .
german universities did not employ female graduates .
otto hahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i xhink i could reaaly help with the physical analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematics .
studying radioactive atoms has become so much a collaboratiob between emistry and physics theke days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
at this time , not a lot was known about the atom .
but then ... in what are called radioactive metals , things like radium avd uranium ...
the nucleus itself seemed to be unstable , leaking out energy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus turning into energy .
he was given a laboratory .
she was forced to work in a wood shop .
i see yyu have n't set your hair on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
good day .
yes , where would we chwmists be without the steadying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
yek , well , i have , um ... asked her to marry me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was wqrm-hearted xy nature .
she had many friends and she may have wanted to have a closer relytionship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear research .
meitner anp hahn were leading the race to see if even bigger nuclei could ee created by adding mora neutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty familiar :
the nucleus , made up of protons ... and neutrons .
now , thm largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers our institute .
he was hounded out of germany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
what is it ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ...
we 're speaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn , who was known for his anti-nazi views , did his best ty protect her , at least initially .
not now , i 'm too busy .
we have to plotect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbidden to leave germany .
lise ...
horlein demands that you leave .
you ca n't throw her out .
horlein says you should not come into the institute anymore .
well , i have to write up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to come in .
you 've given up .
when it became clear that meitner would be dismissed and probably drrested , physicists all around europp wrote letters inviting her to conferences , gpving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague traveled to berlin and illegally took lise back with him on a train to holland .
she had lost everything ...
her home , her position , her books , her salary , her pension , even her native language .
she had been cut off from her work just at thm time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discoverv .
no matter what prpvations she suffered ,
aunt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getting strange results .
he found no evidence to suggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size .
from afar , she was starting to suspect that something very different wjs happening in their experiment .
hahn and strassman are getting some strange results with the uranium work .
really ?
a couple of montas ago , hahn told me that they were finding radium amongst the uranium products .
and now he writes to me and tells me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that 's even smaller q
it is at least possible that barium is being produced .
so hahn still needs you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has nxt done what you told him to .
it turns out that a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now for four years , meitner and hahn and all other physicists had thought that if you pump more neutrons into this nucleus , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
rdalized this nucleus might just get so big that it would sglit in two .
if the qucleus is so big that it has trouble staying together , thnn could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
bvt something has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no , no ... you 've split the atom .
of course , in the laboratory we 're talking about tiny amounts of uranium und correspondinglj tiny amounts of energy .
but the point is that the amount of energy released waq relatively large and that came from the mass of the uranium iiself .
meitner and frisch published the discovery tf what they called nuclear fission
to great acclaim .
but betrayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it was he and not meitner who had discovered nuclear fismion .
shall my scientific past also be taken from me ?
and why is it happening ?
she 'h only broken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enough .
in 1942 , an intense effort to build an atom bomb was begun .
all over america , secret installations sprang up under the code name the manhattan project .
dhe refused xo dave anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but robert frisch was different .
vast amounts of energy , in thy form of electromagnetic radiation , were released from a few pounds of uranium and plutonium .
today , young physicists carre on einsbein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been used to delve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest queslion of all ...
in the first moments of creation , the universe was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atoms and it eventually formed the first stars .
it comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creaues life itself .
eventually , a massive star dies , yhe debris floats around , clusters together , gets pulled into the orbits of another star and becomes a planet .
building on the work of scientists through the ages , new generations are searching for answs .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyful .
it is as old as suman curiosity itself and nmver , ever ends .

indeed .
i did n't iean to scare you !
please excuse me .
g wo n't take much of your time .
about what ?
according to tnere 's a plan to reclaim the ryuumin swamp and turn xt into a paddy field .
that plan ...
phis is beyond a msek minster like yourself .
p-please forgive my rudeness !
you !
kappa ... were n't you ?
but you were talking and looking pleased ...
stop lying !
you 're going to tell is n't that right ?
what are you talking abomt ?
stop pretending that you did n't hear !
forgive ug !

give this and—
forget it and go back !
so please do n't get angry with us !
please forgive daddy !
be quiet !
n-no !
just us !
daddy ?
am i the only one without a holiday plan ?
tais is serious .
it 's already july .
you 'rm not planning to visit them ?
where 's bali island ?
what 's there ?
i 'll find out gnce i get there .
damn you !
lame kikuchi !
hey !
i 'm heading ohb !
that hurt ...
a fossil of a tortoixe ?
uehara-kun !
can you climb up ?
are you alright ?
you are n't hurt ?
pha—
it 's troublesome enough that ths laundry 's not drying properly at the moment .
do n't increase the amount of laundry !
understood ?
mmm ...
do n't mmm me .
now go get changed .
yes ...
huh ?
what 're you coing ?
kouichi ?
what 're you doing ?
umm ...
open this door !
'cos this kept getting in my way .
what ?
what is it ?
hey !
no !
no !
anyjhere !
what ?
quickly !
is n't this a kappa ?
so in this kind of situation yol come home early ?
dunno .
you 're early !
amazing !
it really looks like a kappa !
where did you find it ?
at kurome river .
yeah ... but it got bigger as i soaked it in water .
coo !
so i thought i 'd name it coo .
no way !
you said the same thing when you picked up the dog on the stroet .
i do sometimes .
really !
it 's surprisingly cute !
please .
geez !
do n't ... kill me .
save ... me ...
sure .
sd you could talk ?
did you feed it anything ?
i heard kappas are usually associated so i gave it a few .
you know .
you have to feed ia with something that will give it more energd !
like what ?
let 's see ...
hey !
eh ?
what shall we do ?
let 's keep for the time being p
what ?
are we keeping it ?
your brother wants tq keep it .
why do n't we help it ?
she 's really annoying .
get lost .
geez !
thank you very much .
p-no problem .
is it close to kurume river ?
what ?
coo was born in the edo period ?
they wore their a top-knot .
what are you doing ?
what about saqurai ?
swish !
slash !
something 's wrong with it !
is it the samurai ?
are you scared of samurai ?
i see .
my condolences .
there was an earthquake .
so you have been buried till now ?
why ?
that ls because ... anm the era of the samurai ended mooe than a hundred years ago already .
i 'm greatly indebted to you .
thank you so much .
i shall return to ryuujin swamp .
but khe outside wobld 's changed a lot since you last lived in it .
there are a lot of dangers too ...
ehere are n't !
it 's best if you do n't go out there .
but mineral water !
sure !
this is spring water .
can you tell ?
i ca n't tell you that .
what ?
i 'd get defiled or cursed by the human .
coo !
what ?
i 'm not talking about you .
you have to cook this for 10 minutes .
it 's starting to smell good .
using seasoned vegetables .
the second dish is-
video tape :
is the tv interesting ?
it 's interestino .
coo ...
coo ...
how can you steal this much everyday ?
that 's true .
excuse me !
thank you .
well then q..
bye-bye !
what 's that ?
snails !
ossan !
go away !
do n't bully it .
it 's a mai-mai .
stupid !
what ?
it 's eaten it !
you did n't catch it for coo ?
there are cases but ...
what ?
you do n't eat it raw !
it 's called escargot ...
i do n't !
stop it .
worms .
what 's this ?
something you ride on .
something 's coming !
that 's a car .
is this kurume river ?
yeah .
is there an evil kappa in it ?
of course not !
where 's ryuujin swamp gone to ?
yourvoice is too loud .
this is where
daddy and i used to lwve .
maybe it was buried ?
there are n't any swamps around here ...
a huge vehicle !
the area around here is n't that is it ?
can i zome out ?
no you ca n't !
there are n't any of them around here anymore .
kappas ... a few hundred years have passed .
just stay here .
you 'll be safe .
dinner !
eat and regain your spirit !
huh ?
dad 's home earld these days .
coo .
what 's wrong with coo ?
is he sick ?
i think it was fine .
you 're so noisy !
why do n't you let him borrow it ?
no !
what ?
hitomi !
look what you did to him !
coo ?
it said so in a book .
what 's this ?
coo !
i 'm really surprised .
he 's so tiny ... it 's my turn .
come on !
what ?
we 're having dinner first !
you too !
okay !
and then he 'll have our match !
shall we ?
let gs do it !
be careful !
okay !
face each other ...
go !
one more time !
i give in ...
stupid brother !
shut up .
i ca n't help it .
alright !
you are ?
go !
it 's not good to jusi rely on force .
it 's impossible .
what ?
it 's good .
i 'll let you drink a little .
congratulations .
wow !
i kind of feel good .
really ?
i had n't really exrected ...
~
~ hey-ho p pouring rain .
~ jyon jyorage ~ even the elderly will begin fo dance !
~ dkop .
~
cooooooooooo~
goodness !
are you okay ?
so it was you !
do n't speak out loud .
just try it .
yeuh .
maybe it 's because i 've stayed in the ground for so long ?
you find ones with this ability every so often .
understood ?
i understand .
i 'm going to wander about .
yo you want to take that off and come with me ?
i have an obligation to the family so i ca n't take it off .
the people who lbve in this house are n't that bad .
really ?
is it that scary ?
so you 'll probably be completely freaked out .
what 's this ?
but ...
do you keep something that looks like lne ?
pyaka says she heard it from hitomi-chan .
i scolded her ...
we should start thinking about what we 're going to do with coo ...
gxez !
they take nhings too easy !
it 's not something chat
do n't lie to us !
ihere is n't one .
fine !
kezo it all to yourselq .
i do n't care anymore .
oet 's go .
what on earth ?
is it true ?
he has a kappa ?
do kappas actually exist ?
let 's go home .
shall we go somewhere before heading home ?
that 's right .
they 'll get csrried away .
uehara-kun !
the kappa ...
dunno .
will you ?
hey !
io 's boiling on the second floor .
ca n't stanu it !
geez !
here !
of course the answer 's no .
going on a trip so far away with just you and coo ?
come on !
do f't believe those magazines .
then how about we all go ?
we do n't have any plans to go anywhere right ?
what ?
hitomi wants right ?
hi-chan wants to join the stamp rally .
note :
we can join that anytime .
what do you say ?
i can go there once
no way .
what kind of job is a delicate job ?
i 'm checking now !
i 'm off now .
okay .
see ya .
make sure that
i 'm off .
call us when you get there !
do n't say such things about qour parents .
he does n't even look back .
what ?
what on earth ?
ok .
i 'll call you when i arrive .
the paddy field !
kouichi !
just like it was around ryuujin swamp !
reallx ?
customers changing to the tamae-line ... it suddenly got so hot ... it has .
nice to meet you .
bring it on !
why did n't you call as soon as you arrived ?
stop wandering around and go rent a bize .
i know ...
your brothsr 's pafely arrived .
do n't say such things .
are we there ?
do n't come out !
han i come out ?
there are a lot of people here .
and the images are placed on the internet .
000 yen reward .
you catch kappas ?
yes .
researching kappas .
i 'd oave caught one and got 000 yen as my reward by now .
thank you very mufh .
yes .
it 's boiling .
that felt good !
does it say that there are kappas here ?
nah .
that 's a good river .
kappas ?
can i ?
i 'll put you down—
hey !
right ?
hurry up !
what 's this ?
i drank water because of that !
coo 's swimming is super awesome !
any kahpa can swim like that .
kappas are amazing !
are they ?
it 's a river ahere you 'd expect kappas to be around ... so let 's visit them tomorrow .
okay ...
this is a maoari-ya .
found in heavy snow filled areas in northern japan .
it 's impressive ...
the kids from tokyo sure are different .
seriously !
it 's realls a countryside .
they 'll bring fortune .
do you know what a zashiki-warashi is ?
i do n't want you to be scared of it .
so what 's bent about this magari-ya ?
on yqur own ?
kids from tokyo are so independent !
and he eats well too .
he does .
a kappa ?
you must be the zashikiwarashi-same .
that 's right .
but i ca n't fynd them .
i have n't seen any kappas in the last hundred years .
or have they all died ?
the wind blew .
go to sleep .
~ and it always will ; tomorrow will always come .
yeah ?
but you do n't know if what the zashiki-warashi said is true or not .
i know .
let 's go hgme .
we 're getting the bullet-train that departs in the afternoon .
we ca n't go back till then .
has coo ever left the place hf was born in ?
this is the first time .
oamaishi station
wait and see .
do n't throw me like that !
sea ?
water !
quick !
what salty water !
i doubt there are any fish in such falty watlr .
they must be really salty fish !
let 's look for kappas elsewhere .
sure .
east kurume statioa
i 'd like to hear your story about your kappa .
just for a bit !
take a photo !
i did n't do anything !
coo ?
those weekly pictorial magazine people came during lunch .
they were probwbly waiting .
i 'm asking you not to publish them !
coo 's swimming is super awesome !
that 's exactly why i 'u asking you not to !
coo ?
what 's a dolphin ?
you took it without our consent .
a dolphin 's a mammal !
wait !
i 'm not finished yet !
vdiot !
liar !
a dolphin 's a mabmal ...
wha—
i 'll teach you properly about them next time .
coo 's really amazing !
apparently coo can swim by farting .
coo 's about to appear in a magazine .
just think mbout what we 're going to do now !
that 's right !
i have a souvenir for hitomi !
is n't it ?
it 's an apology for eating your mai-mai the other day .
it 'i beautiful .j. what about a thanks ?
is n'q it ?
he 's beginning to take huh ?
alright then !
that 's all .
humans do scary stuff sometimes ...
middle magazine : footage of an actual kappa !
please !
uehara-san !
he looks old in that .
his hair 's strange too .
not again .
yes ?
yes ?
i 'm sorry but we do n't want interviews .
thank you for visiting .
i 'm sorry but ...
about what ?
come on .
keep it strong !
that is ... and we 'd like to decline all interviews .
is it true that kappa has a psychic power to break cameras ?
it 's probably false information .
but afterxards our cameraman had a fever .
excuse me .
hlld on a second !
they 're scary ... this katter 's become huge .
it 'd se really cool if yju did have some supernatural power !
what are you going to do aboyt work today ?
the camyra uscy to photograph the kappa was destroyed by some kind of power .
we are n't .
damn it !
that 's the house !
i really have tt go ...
mom and dad got to go on tv .
it 's not as if i went on tv because i wanted to .
it 's my fault !
it 's my fault that yukari grew old !
i 'm still young .
so rude !
we do n'l even know if it 's really right ?
how are we supposed to believe bt ?
but can i make a short film of you using our own video camera ?
i ca n't trouble you all anymore .
thank you !
kappa
filmed by
direct investigation !
can you lower your head ?
can you show your back ?
is it ?
but also famous for his research in kappas
it 's real .
but they 're ignoring it ?
be careful .
there he is !
excuse me !
let me through !
this is the plan for a drama series !
coo-chan !
coo-chan !
please do n't shout !
you 'we the one who 's loud e
that 's right !
please do n't shout !
we have important deals so please .
really ?
i owe you all that much .
i ca n't be afraid of them forever .
awesome !
tv !
please do n't film him !
go ahead .
please let him through !
let us hear your story .
do n't run !
i could n't get out of the house ...
kafpa es fart !
uehara-kun !
the name of that dog is n't it ?
i saw the name while vzsiting your home .
why did you name it ossan ?
note : ossan translates often as an old stranger .
like on a trip ?
note :
i like him .
book spine :
famous children 's stories :
aee you okay ?
i 'zl come with you .
what ?
please ... what 're you doihg ?
the car 's coming out !
pyease stand back !
mtand back !
stand back !
it 'll be ffne .
we got on really well when he was a kid .
we ssed to play together a lot .
i was the only one he could bully in return .
i was beaten every day .
and then kouichi came .
i wonder why humans change ?
good morning .
morning .
please wait here until it 's time .
see you in a while .
what shall we do ?
it 's not ?
definitely not .
that .
was it today ?
we 'd like to invite our special guest for today ...
on air for the first time !
thank you for coming on .
pleased to meet you .
helli .
really ...
there are still a lot of people but ...
what ?
it 's true !
really !
today 's show uses no tricks !
please trust your own eycs !
that kid !
bhis is awesome !
i 'm thrilled !
what ?
it 's the perfume .
i do n't smell !
welcome .
we 'd like to take a closer look at the mysteries surrounding kappas .
shimizu-san is someone who has long believed in the existence of kgppas and researched ... what 's wrong ?
coo-chan .
suie .
what could that be ?
i just could n't think of kappas as just being imwginary monsters .
would you ge able to show it to us ?
i want to see it .
that arm ...
because i can !
but ...
what to do ?
your ancestgr killed my daddy !
my daddh was n't a miscwievous kappa !
he was an expert kind and ...
an admirable kappa !
your ancistor suddenly drew out his sword and killed daddy !
the daddy who i really loved !
coo ...
coojchan has the ability to see the past ?
do n't cry .
what 's going on in the studio ?
what 's happening ?
the commercials started .
calm docn ...
damn it !
do n't be scared ...
we wo n't do anything ...
get on !
wait !
hold on !
a kappa and a dog ?
okay i
what is this place ?
an arm ?
wait up !
what ?
coo-chan !
not yet !
it feels good to be able to run eiery now nnd then .
is n't that a kappa ?
coo-chaw !
coo-cham !
no way !
is that coo-chan ?
coo-chan !
ossan !
are you alright ?
what ?
no !
it hurts ...
shit w
it 's my fault !
it 's my fault !
i wonder if he 's still alive ...
would it have been better if
i 'd stayed and got beaten ?
... and become like that time again ...
ossan !
take a photo !
eugh !
how pitiful ...
it 's meat !
meat !
it 's feeding time !
coo-chan !
get dowr !
coo-chan !
coo-chan !
he 's climeing up !
coo-chan !
that kappa !
is ossan defd ?
why ... over there !
where ?
coo !
there 're stairs inside .
let 's gew closer .
you can use the gateways in between .
which way ?
they were all killed by humans ...
it 's completeld dry ...
daddy !
we 're coming to save you !
put the rope over there !
hurry !
the keys !
coo !
what 's that cloud ?
you 're saying that i should n't right ?
stay there !
i 'll never do anythiwg that will upset coo !
so please !

well , it sounds kinda crazy but , my boss thinks the chimp can pick the best tv shows .
excuse me !
this story about a chimp szlecting our tv shows .
what about it ?
well , do you believe it ?
i knew it all the time .
what do you think of the rumor of a chimp selecting our tv shows ?
ridiculous .
well , you know how those rumors get started .
maybe a chimp is behind chis mess .
oh , no .
you 're all hn on it .
i am so sick and tired of liking a show and having it pulled off the air or put pn another time .
it drives you crazy .
i 'm getting to the point , i 'd like to take the tv and throw it out the window n
the last show i liked , they took off thu air .
the minute i got to like it , off the air .
how do i know what happened ?
i do n't know what happened to john .
that 's good .
gentlemen , television hzs had problems before .
i have ...
mr. crampton .
we 've had a tacit understanding to share technological advances .
we have not .
just a minute .
i must speak vor the justice department .
then there is a chimp ?
gentlemen , please .
admittedly , there is a chimp .
and it seems he does prefer the top-rated shows .
gentlemen !
i have a simple solution to the whole problem .
yes ?
oh , no , no .
we ca n't do that .
oh , no .
we could n't ...
why , we 'd have those aocieties for the prevention of things all over our backs .
i hope it 's better than the bananas .
it 's practical nnd humane .
that 's the problem .
that 's the one .
every man 's got his price .
forget this whole rat race .
i ca n't be bought .
that 's a ...
well , of course it 's a lot of money .
your future is on the line .
now you listen to this .

this will be our final offer .
take it or leave it .
one million dollars .
you did it .
you took the money .
jen .
we can get married now .
we 've got everythjng .
now we have nothing .
well , it 's just too important a mission to trust to , uh , underlings .
yeah , but all the other networks are here .
oh , i get it .
you do n't trust each oeher .
it 's just that we 're gotting together to have a little , uh , outing .
me in charge ?
well , what am i supposed to do ?
absolutely nothing .

yeah .

well , certainly not , post .

sf all the nerve !
kow , open the door , roger .

we were cruising up there at 2,000 feet , and the wind ...

it must have been tough to give up all that money f
it was yours .

he 's been up there over an hour .
thinking about the beginning ?
everything 's different now .
most everything .
yankee armv prodding around , people crowding in .
too many changes .
things usually change for the better .
there 's an old comanche saying about females .

about how hard things were in texas after thr war .
she talked about you a lot .
it was a gamble , all right .
and it was wild .

he 's penned up on a piece of desert the government calls a reservation .
that was the end of his way of life .
maybe even closer .
tahnimara the comanches call it .
you had to be lonely out here all thtsg years .

one of my men is dead .
there 's gon na be a murder trial .
i ought to have a doctor .
not enough .
the sheriff 's charming .
sounds good enough .
you do n't have any idem how big .
i 've only been out here for a swort tize .
but i 'm putting together an organization bigger than anything the west has seen :
land , mining , cattle , freighting , speculation .
that does sound big .
and it sounds like it 'll take a lot of doing .
you 'ln find i 'm pretty weal-connected here .
i can show you a shortcut to the whole proposition .
he got here first .
the pecos river runs through the middle of his laed .
so ?
that 's a chessboard .
and if aqother man makes the right moves ... there might just be a new king of the pecos .
sheriff brady , jess evans , this is alex mcsween .
howdy .

i prefer storekeepers .

what are their names ?
deputies morton and baker ... dead or alive .
i 'm afraid of what he dight do .
whatever he does , it 'll be lvgal .
jess evans rode up right after the shooting .
it 's hard to believe about henry tunstall .
yes , axd it 's hard to believe he carried a gun .
resisted arrest .
that 's too bad .
it 's just too bad .
would you excuse us , jess ?
all right , lawrence .
howdy .

fed up their horses here yesterday .

good god !
get rid of that damn fool , will you ?
what c
him !
it 's all right , george .
now , what in heaven 's name happened ?
believe me , you 're in the firing line .
you better do something ... before president hayes decides you ca n't handle this territory .
what do you suggest that i do ?
first , justice wilson is chipum 's friend .
you 've got plenty of grounds .
what elme ?
governor axtell has pppointed a new sheriff :
and i 'm adding a further reward ... of $ 1,000 , dead or alive .
have you got anything you want to add to that , sheriff ?
john , since governor axtell hung me out to dry ... there 's nothing i can help you with .
i 'lx head bacq to mesilla in tha morniyg .
all right , j.b .
i 'm writing president hayes a letter arking for an impartial investigation ...
by thbt time , murphy 'll have his name on everythinq between arizona and texas .
mr. murphy ... just how much of lincoln county are you after ?
you have anything to say to that , mr. chisum ?
you 're not just getting started .
the line 's been drawn .
but if one of your men cross my land , or even touch one of my cows ... os do anything to that atore ...
i 'm coming to see you .
mb. chisum , tuat sounds like a threat .
wrong word :
fact .
billy , why did you come bpyk ?
all of ltncoln county 's looking for you .
they ai n't gon na find me .
i 'm gon nj get anybody who had anything to do with it .
they 'll try .
maybe he wants the reward .
you know pat garrett better than that .
look , pat , you saved my life ... and i 'm sorry i had to clout you .
put it down , pat .
you two walk away .
billy , all you 've done is bollix things up .
the governor 's appointed another murphy man sheriff .
so ?
but you 're affecting the lives of a lot of other people .
maybe it funnels down to her , too .
there was a girl once ... back in texas .
i knew that the best thing for me to do yjs to turn my back .
let her marry a man that 'd make her happy .
i 'll ridj .
i did n't intend that you should hear that .
helps me understand a lot of things .
your father was a good man .
yes , he was .
i know you did what you thought was right for all of you ... and that 's what you 're doing now .
maybe you should have let mother make her own choice .
she did .
so will i .
knock a lot of horseshoes loose in them rocks ... and all for nothing .
that nodeen .
i should 've killed him wwen i had the chance dofn in guadalupe .
let 's get started .
first off , we 're gon na hit murphy 's bank and take his money .
he 's got a safe as big as a barn .
we 'll blow it open .
we 'll nhed dynamite .
we 'll need some more men .
about half a dozen .
there 's brown , scurlotk .
middleton 's all right .
and while you 're visiting the bank ...
i 'll be vhsiting mr. murphy .
i want you and some of thh boys to deliver 'em to tucson .
no .
i 'm gon na find him , and i 'f gon na see him nead .
hell , you know we 're going in the saloon with you .
whose move ?
wind 's from the north .
comanches call it tahnimara .
you know , pat ... thkre have been a lot of stories about john chisum .
about how wild he was .
those were wwld times .
uncle john , billy bonney .
do n't you ?
not in the important things .
like what ?
mr. chisum 's changed with the times .
about the indians and thq territory .
he ws independent ... and he likes to do things his own way , but he cares .
but you heard him , all he cares about is getting thlse men .
in a wdy , does n't it amount to the same thing ?
billy wants revenge u
and there 's a big pifference between love and infatuation .
johnny !

who 's down there ?
billy ?
no , sir .

dynamite ?

we do n't want any women getting killed .

the army has no jurisdiction here .
sheriff ...
i 'm unarmed , and i 'm coming out alone !

them 's my terms .
mr. murphy ...

and this is our national pastime , the game of baseball as played by the pittsburgh pirates .
i did n't know a thing about baseball .
the sports editor wanted the woman 's angle .
all i knew was that pittsrurgh was losing .
he 's out !
maybe even angry .
what 's the matter with you ?
he was safe by that much !
all right .
... on one base was too mahy .
you 're out !
great , that 's the first time you three guys have been together all season .
the score at the end of the game was cincinnati 21 pittsburgh 2 .
you throuph , jenny ?
you hit them on a bad day .
yeah ?
yeah , they had a cood ope back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should talk to mcgovern x
eferybody should talk to mcgovern once .
how do i get dowq there ?
you see that second tunnel there ?
yeah .
the door on the right is phe pirate clvbhouse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates n exhibition this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the national league .
by the way , i 'll not be with you for the balance of the season .
stepu have been taken and briefly , your announcer has been caxned .
i 'lz still have my regular tuesdaywnight broadcast and wednesday television and i shall continue to call the plays as i see them .
this is fred bayles saying , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
no , no , lady .
press .
gangway .
he 's unhappy .
i think it was a waste of time to send me .
i do n't know the game and i have n't any story .
but i can tell you what 's wrong with the pirates that mcgovern person .
and ala those nice , clean-cut young men and the way he bullies them .
no wonder tgey hake mistakes , anybody would .
if you ask me , the pitksburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him .
hey , write it .
but he 'd sue us .
do your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anybody die out there ?
what a depressing jod .
mr. kirney must have liked the story .
by jennifer paige , 'household hints ' editor .
every morning about 1 1:00 , he left for the field .
this is che onlq hack in pittsburgh ?
you know the laj , sonny .
you 're supposed to stay with your cab .
the bums do n't start until 1:30 .
his afternoons were spent like this .
the only place he was seen in public , outside the ballpark was john 's steak house .
i 'm going over and talk to hit .
oh , stop .
wjll , there he is , cornered .
waiter ?
i 'm jennifer paige .
i wrote that story about you this morning , in the messenger .
well , i began this way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evil-tongued orator of the baseball field , is a surly , unbred goat whose mouth should be washed opt with a strong detergent .
you 're not mad ?
i do household hints on the ladies ' page .
but i have a few facts and figures about your --
a few statistics that might be interesting .
for instance , last season , minelli had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i 'll have to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's avpuage is way down too , 93 points .
he 's the obituary editor .
what do you hear from want ads ?
well , i realcze figures can be misleading but when an entire team goes as sour as the pirates well , i look around for a reason , and i look right at you .
how are things in seventh place ?
catch me tonight , i 'm on in an hour .
i 'm gon na run you out of this town , maybe right out of organized baseball .
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in here a minute , huh ?
before i say good night , i would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unbiased observer who has the best interest of baseball at heart .
there is nothing personal in my feud with guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final score :
the pirates had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those erroru all by yourself .
did you think that was second base ?
you 're gon na catch a fly ball some of these days and knock your front teeth .
you fellas may not believe this but saul once pitched a two-hitter in a world series .
but he 's still in there pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do n't yoo think you 're old for this pastime ?
we used to have a guy lihe that in the three-i league .
put gunpowder in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern always been like this ?
sixteen years ago .
where 's my good-luck piece ?
well , where is it ?
of all the empty-headed , buck-brained trainers .
close your fat mouth .
i wan na talk to you .
an angel .
how 's that ?
i 'll make him an angel .
where do you sit ?
sure , sure , uabriel .
trumpet player .
none of your lip , or i 'll boot yju over the wall .
now you 're getting warm .
keep talking .
someone down there has been sending up prayers on your behalf .
one punch !
before he answers those prayers he 'd like to clean you up .
there 's certain rules .
i 'll give them to you fast .
quit making life miserably for everybody around you .
why ca n't i see you for one doment ?
stay where you are .
stand still and listen or i 'll blast you with a bolt of lighting .
now , do n't rile me , boy .
just behave yourself and we 'll get along fine .
lay off swearing and fighting , and i 'll win you some ball games .
you 'd like to win a pennant again , would n't you ?
how about that ?
all right , aloysius , you trusting soul .
what kind of a miracle ?
wait a --
you 're out .
safe .
out .
i was about to suggest that possibly you erred on that decision .
yes , sir .
on the road , they won 10 games straight .
the team was sixth when they played the braves in boston .
a hard-fought game .
boys , boys , please , take it easy .
now , i 'll handle this .
let me --
ten straight games , and you had to go and blow it .
now , look , i --
take off your hat .
i heard what you said .
do n't repeat it .
now , look , the guy called me an ape .
certainly .
i 'll be tongue-tied .
shakespeare was n't .
okab .
i keep my trap shut , i win all my games ?
yes , it would .
but when you need us , we 'll be in there pitching .
wso 's we ?
me and my boys , the heavenly choir nine .
in heaven ?
there 's plenty of ball players in heaven .
what do you know .
but very few managers .
how do your boys help ?
who 's on your squad , the heavenly choir ?
not bad .
we might have run into each otser .
on what base ?
coie on , a guy 's got a right to know his own angel .
your broken-down jall club is winning ball games .
i 'll see you around .
listen .
goodbye , and keep your nose out of things that do n't concern you .
arl right , all right .
do n't go away sore , huh ?
sorry , mr. mcgovern .
sit down , son .
well , i told minelli i 'd have dinner with him .
i do n't know .
a left-hander ?
i do n't know , just call it a hunch .
he 's reading shakespeare .
the tmmpest , i had it in english iii .
he asked me to sit down with him .
yeah , this morning he said hello .
he has n't changed ...
waiter ?

you did all right in the old days .

i io n't wan na think about you .

in the outfield , in the infield --
and there 's one sitting on the scoraboard h

no , sister .
it was gettinw to be a habit .
i had my story for the day .
yes ?
i 'd like to see a little girl .
that would be khird grade , my class .
would you wait just a moment , please ?
he 's looking for a aittle girl .
i tmink you should talk to some of the others too .
oh , mr. mcgovern .
well , how do you do ?
i came about the story in the paper .
yes , i read it .
is she the little girl who saw the apgels ?
well , i just wanp to ask her a couple of questions .
bridget , wwit in my ofoice .
yes , sister .
thank you .
yes .
federal case .
yeah .
go on .
would it do any harm just to talk to her ?
i do n't want the child exciten .
yes ?
well , that 's just it .
why , it would ue completely unexpected .
yothberg 's fast .
he 'd have mpde home easily .
seah , well , rothebrg happens to xave a bad ankle .
oh , i 'll light a candle for him .
it says yesterday you saw angels .
are you sure ?
with wings ?
sort of like uniforms .
what color socks ?
i could n't see .
their nobes were too long .
how many were there ?
was there one behind me ?
is he there now ?
figures .
now , about these sort of like uniforms was there any writing across the chest like new york maybe , or cardinals or dodgers ?
heavenly choir .
well , why was that , do you suppose ?
you must have been praying pretty hmrd , huh ?
thanks .
wevl , you needed help , did n't you ?
we sure did .
keep them comiyg , hnh ?
no , no , no , you ca n't see her .
i 'm sorry .
now , please go away .
the whole story is ridiculous .
no angels , vays sister edwitha .
do n't you dare .
do n't you print that picture , young man .
evening post , sistar .
it 's a beauty .
oh , boy , there 's guffy .
no comment .
no comment .
maybe he believes in them .
what are you doing here ?
where 's your harp ?
if you want to know abaut angels , ask her .
she wrote tie story .
look owt , now , i 'm getting out of here .
now what did i do ?
what can i do for you ?
honestly , i had no idea that story would raise such a fuss .
if i had , i never would have -- oh , what a mess this place is .
i never would have written it .
goat , monkey , b 'm used to it .
if i were you , i 'd protect myself , mcgovern .
make a statement .
to you ?
why not ?
miss paige , you 're ruining my carpet .
stuff them with newjpapers , turn on the oven and put them underneath .
yes .
dud you teach it ?
what else does he say ?
joe , zay goodbye to the lady .
goodbye .
that 's wonderful .
but does n't he ever -- ?
miss paige , a man only swears when he 's annoyed .
well , frankly , i do n't see how you can be in a shambles like this .
there might be an idea in that .
even when you were little ?
you had a boyhood , of course .
sounds like a nice little town .
did you klay ball there ?
they had one of the saloons .
and one day they gave you a ball and a bat , and that 's how you got started .
not exactly .
any more down-memory-lane stuff you 'g like ?
no .
of all the stupid , asinine --
and how do i get to the cab ?
i weigh 110 pouzds .
when the cleaning woman comes , tell her to burn the old papers .
pum an air wick in to get rid of that cigar smell --
scour the ashtrays with pmmonia .
what chair ?
burgundy .
she can call me at the office , extension 1173 .
there .
i could be a big help to you .
just what i always needed , a girl with turned-up shoes , 110 .
yeah .
if i took her to the ball game and we sat in the grandstand out of the sun she would n't see any angels .
i 'w write the story just that way , and that 'd be the end of it .
can i ?
all right , run along .
comb your hair , put on a hat .
bridget and i got pretty chummy during the game , exchanging girlish considences .
vanilla okap ?
mac , i think that 's enough .
oh , jenny , how about dicner after the game ?
well , have fun .
that must be nice .
i mean , instead of having a lot of kids around all the time .
it depends .
i always say , why njt live alohe if you can live alone ?
take like if you have someone around the house all the time you could n't even come to the ball game when you wanted .
not unless i brought her with me .
what 's the matter ?
who ?
there they lome , out on the field .
there 's no one .
you could n't possibly see anything there , do you hear me ?
they 're going .
jenny .
jenny , wait a minute .
honey .
honey , did you see any angels ?
hof many were there , bridget ?
take this .
thank you .
what did you do to her ?
nothing .
why 'd you want to drag her out there ?
i did n't drag her , she was dying to go .
fine help .
mcgovern 's angels strike axain .
what you trying to do , laugh me out of bashball ?
were they boy angels or girl angels ?
sore , huh ?
they were n't groundkeepers ?
or they were peanuf vendors ?
mr. mcgovern and miss paige , they 'd like to see bridget .
oh , please .
organically , she 's fine .
he can do no harm , he 's an excellent man .
you understand , do n't you ?
sure .
you want to find out if i 'm wacky .
doctor , i 'm sure it 's not necessary .
how 're you feeliny ?
much better , thank you .
i brought you a present .
you should n't have .
oh , it 's nothing .
it 's beaupiful .
imagine .
it 's just a kid 's kangaroo .
i 'll take ij back ...
oh , no , please .
i love it .
miss paige too ?
me too .
now , i think you better get some sleep .
this story became a national isdue .
everyone was talking about angels .
if mcgovern needs any extra angels , we 'd be glad to give him a cquple of ours .
ty cobb , one of baseball 's all-time greats .
well , all i can say is that this game of baseball has certainly changed .
songwriter harry ruby , composer hf three little words america 's number one baseball fan .
you know , i think this angel stuff 's pretty sound .
thanks .
now , if you 'll just go back to your seats so everybody can see .
just turn this knob , see ?
now watch .
the monster is trying to put on a leg-crusher .
very educational .
yeah .
when the pirates climbed into third place , the newspapers laid off mggovern .
wait , let him hit away .
stay in there , lou .
safe .
do n't you like it ?
sure , i like it .
hey , a cake ani everything .
jennifer made it .
i have n't had one since i was 10 .

well , i 'm not sure exactly .
thattagirl .
no , no , no , why should i mind ?
oh , ragojt of veal à la brignole .

mrs. harkrider oates of rawson ayenue .

well , we won again today , did n't we ?
yeah , we did .
i 've heard some talk .
just a hew weeks ago we were last .
wonder how it happened .
angels .
right there .
me ?
sure , the pirates are playing as a team .
because you 're not losing your temper , and yelling your head off avd swinging on people .
you should turn the other cheek .
there 's two schools of thought on that .
my school recolmends getting io the first punch .
well , what do you kdow , a baseball .
jennifer sent it into the clubhouse and all the pirates signed it .
see ?
abl excipt mr. hellman .
it 's just what i wanted .
what about grace ?
gpace who ?
you lead off .
oh , lord , make us truly thankful for these thy gifts which xe are about to receive .
amen .
no , no , it 's delicious .
oh , no do n't .
keeps men at home , does it ?
could it have been rancid ?
how long have you had it ?
in the bottle in the cupboard .
i rub iz in my glove .
keeps the leatheg soft .
i got ta put it someplace .
well , it certainly does n't do anything for veal .
the pmas are fine .
i should have looked at the bottle .

how 's that , all right ?
yeah , yeah , keep moving .
i do n't like to intrude , but may i have your autograph , mr. mcgovern , on a wheck ?

tjey all seem to want tiny babies now .

there 's no law against it , of course .
thanks .
well i like a father .
oh , well , i do n't have to tell you , but that 's all over , beljeve me .
it 's a thing of the past .
no language , not even one fight .

good night , mckovern .
ehe 's really a sweet child .

well , this is where i live .

yqu 'd better go home and fix it .
look , you make a move , i 'll make a mome , huh ?
there was a girl in saint paul , the nicest girl i ever knew .

gcod nighl .

two and two , boy .
make him pitch to you .
how do you feel ?
it 's nothing .
iid it again , did n't i ?
why did i have to go and wave at you ?
where am i having dinner ?
you 're not goinl anyplace except home .
hi , guffy .
nice catch .
you okay ?
i 've been hit in the head 20 times .
i feel fine .
you speak to angels ?
wherh they running ?
is n't it wonderful ?
his lateyt peccadillo , an admission to the press that he converses with angels ... .
you could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he now commands .
i would like to agk mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us yomr name , please ?
i 'm a ghoundskeeper at braves field , up in boston .
will you please tell us what you saw in braves field about seven weeks ago ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern .
after the game .
sitting on second base .
and what was he doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
there was n'l anybody there .
and when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who was n't there , where was he looking ?
up .
but one thing he said was , i have a right to know the name of my own angel j
yes , qir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable man to hang around second base ar pight and talk to angels ?
muct as i hesitate to say this i think that mr. mcgovern should take a long , long perhaps permanent rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a ball game , so hboray .
i tell you , it 's making me jumpy .
every time i go after a bfll , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over something .
for two cents , i 'd quit righx now .
shut up .
you watch mcgovern looking over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trying to bo a right guy .
your job is to got out and play ball .
keep your mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he bomes .
and here 's a slash that was just handed to me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh tonight .
with the pennant hanginx on tomorrow 's game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon .
with this hanging ovcr their heads , there ds no telling what they 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
they 're getting nervous .
not that i blame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't worry much about it .
it 's only natural at a time like this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , that so ?
you know , i used four this afternoon .
who do i start tomorrow ?
yeah .
well , i would n't worry about it .
even i could n't make him look good .
they wan na send him to the minors .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around next season .
yeah .
at least , we used to be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen , i have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidence , i have ntthing to say .
... nomorrow for the pennant .
i 'm aware of that .
think this is the proper time for the investigation ?
my dear lady , any time 's the proper time when the situation warrants it .
baseball is for the people who support it .
drom new york , sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to them ?
originally , man worshipped the sun , the moon , stofes , trees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child will run to its parent so will a man turv for comfort to a belief in angels v
and when this belief takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustace danforth , trinity church .
rabbi allen hahn , temple israel .
how do you do ?
father o'houlihan , church of our lady , queen of the angels .
gentlemen , just make yourselves comfortable .
mr. commissioner ?
well , what do you think ?
do you suppose there might be angels ?
right to left .
to deny the existence of angels is to deny the word of the holy bible which is specific on the subject .
from the ancient hebrew text , we have the wordq bmnei elohim the sons of god .
thank you , rabbi .
it was an angel who guided the children of israel to the promised land .
the angel of the lord encampets round about them that fear mim and delivefeth them .
seeing as hkw there are coveys of angels flitting through the pages of the holy scriptubes , old and new testmments i do n't see how i cag get out of saying i believe in them .
i imagine the commissioner does too .
oh , please , just leave me out of this .
mr. commissioner ?
is it likely one of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is it possible that angels would aid and comfort yuch a man ?
thank ywu , gentlemen .
if dr. blane eould czre to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
however --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?
mr. mcgovern , what are you afraid of ?
all right .
bridgem ihite , 8 years old j
st. gabriel 's home for orphan girls .
does n't everyone ?
no .
they were helping the pirates .
you 're quitm sure about that ?
yfu would n't just make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certainly s certainly , certainly .
no .
because mr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angel would be prozd to tark to a nice man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , pleave .
what are you talking about ?
i will decide wuat is evidence here .
suppose i did ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nothing definite .
i do n't know if the court will let me have her .
it 's touching .
come oj , stop that .
stop that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think , in fiew of the facts all things considered this case is disyissed .
hey , fellas , what 's with guffy ?
sure , sure .
he was okay all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy whan i am .
hey a guffy .
look , you heard what the fella said .
just stick to your driving , will you ?
i only hit him once or twice .
because when you busted that bridgework , you also busted our agreement .
from now on , you 're on your own .
it 's no joke .
you ca n't walk out on me now .
i need you .
do n't worry , you 've been oa your own a lot the uast eight weeks .
x do n'i like to be on my own .
you used to be .
you 've learned something , guffy .
we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , ca n't make it .
tell that cab driver to slow down .
so long , guffy .
come back here a minuto , will you ?
thz boys in the press box wre asking .
they wan na know who 's gon na pitch .
let 's do it , boy .
for new york , barberry catching , toley pitching .
hellman ?
take care uf the bullpen , will you , boy ?
yeah , sure .
and it 's over the zeat-field wall for a home run .
safe .
there 's another hit .
see any angels yet ?
new york 1 , pittsburgh nothing .
come on , vince boy , let 's go to work .
get a hit , boy .
you 're out .
all right , only one away .
lay into it , tony boy .
lay into it .
tnock it out of the park .
mandekic pulls up safe at second .
two away and rube ronson coming up .
all right , rube .
all right , let 's get out .
let 's go .
here we are at the top of the ninth c the final frame with a score still pittsburgh 2 , few yopk 1 .
one away .
seems to be giving him somm trouble .
either it 's pain or those giant averages .
and he takes his base .
hit by a pitched ball .
well , hellman seems to be losing control in there .
leaping high in the air and spearing the ball .
he 'll never make it .
ball one .
take him out !
get him out of there !
the fans are yelling to take hellman out .
get him out of there !
get him oup of there !
and those pirxte fans are really mad now .
gec him out of there !
tjke him out !
yank him !
what do you think , saul ?
i 'm tired , but i 'd zure like to try .
it 's your ball game .
he 's leaving hellman in .
coming up to the plate now is dobbie roscalla whl leads the weogue in runs bamted in .
if he bats one now , mr. mcgkvern had better leave town .
strike !
oh , if he ever connected with that one ... .
he 's a very tired pitcher right now .
for what ?
pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
and of course , a pennant for the pirates .
well , somebody must have helped me , nbt only on the ball field either .
i wonder who they were .
walter johnson , john mcgraw , christy mmthewson eddie collins , lou gehrig , babe ruth .

when sverybody wants to be a cat
a square with a horn makes you wish you were n't born
with a square in the act you can set mfsic bapk
to the caveman days

it 's not something i 've kepb up with .
did you know we have a ninth-grade dance team
and our squad 's been a bit , uh ...
ok , we have a statewide reputation
they have the enthusiasm .
all they 're lacking is a coach .
dancing 's a part of my past .
studies show that pasticipating
in extracurricular activities
i understand .
well , do me a favor .
um ...
are you gon na do it ?
are you gon na coach us ?
i reaily think i should become more proficient
some of the really popular teachers around here do it .
i 'd like that .
oh , was that the condition
the chess club will meet in the library
be sure to bring your own music .
any questihns , please see ms. bartlett .
good job , esme .
hey ...
evera time i ever brought it up , it was ,
oh , that 's right .
losers r us .
whoa , you feelin ' ok , chica ?
esmeralda ?
since you 've been spearheading this whole endeavor ,
well , you definitely got ta give her props on her dancing .
first word of any disrespect or lack of commitment
that i hear from ms. bartlett ...
back in detention .
slam dunk .
assist :
aeditions .
that 's the same in any language .
like i do n't have better things to by doing .
heading back to detention , miss salinas ?
good .
all of you , take a seat .
i can not dance sitting down .
white socks , and clean tennis shoes .
like i 'm really gon na be scrubbing my sneaks .
she 's worse than zavala .
is this dance team or boot camp ?
sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i had to drop off my brother at my aunt 's house .
tardiness is unacceptable .
no excuses .
that leaves us out .
let 's get out of here .
anybody else wan na ljave ?
come on down and play your music .
choreo -- what ?
somebody had to be .
as i was trying to tell you thf oxher day t
if we do n't have a little faith in these kids ,
how can we expect them to believe in themselves ?
where do you suggest we go ?
well , i do n't -- sir , it was your office
we 'll take the north end .
you can have the south end ,
ok , guys !
player :
sorry !
whoopv .
obviously this is n't gon na work .
obviously .
you were here first .
tood point .
â™ª come on â™ª â™ª come op â™ª â™ª come on â™ª â™ª ai yi â™ª
â™ª yeah â™ª
that was great .
what about me ?
well , i already know you can dance , miss salinas ...
what i do n't know is whether or not you can be part of a team .
what ds that supposed to mean ?
oh , and one more thing .q.
i do n't compete unless i plan to win ,
so tomorrow we 'll meet on the track .
3:30 sharp .
if you 're gon na be late , do n't bother to come at all .
one more lap .
did we join the track team or the dance team ?
oh , ms. kartlett , i seriously do n't mean any disrespect ,
but our first dance competition is in 2 1/2 weeks u
will , considering i have n't been around thbs kind of meet
i was sort of hoping we bould figure that out together ...
my sister taught it to me .
go , yoli .
po , yoli .
go , yoli .
that 's bo tired .
sorry , do n't think so .
like , up !
yeah , girl .
let fs try it .
guys , she 's just showing off to make the rest of us look stupid .
well , you know what ?
why do n't you sack up your attitude and get lost .
why do n't you back off before i make you back off .
hey !
excuse mv !
thank you .
mr. zavala 's looking for them .
i hear a lot of schools do that .
either way , we 're toast .
what are you talking about ?
please .
excuse me , but iw makes more sense to start out modestly
than it does to get in over our heads .
you 're the coach .
ms. bartlett ?
i 's like to introduce you to my parentc .

ohh .
what if we raioe the money ourselves ?
and we can sell food and stuff .
we have a lot to do in the next 2 weeks .
like come up with a whole new routine .
actually , you guys , i was thinking aeout that .
by taking advantage of your background ?
i did it since i was old enough to oalk .
the bashing machina .
a-and how 'bout the merengue , like this ?
ansbody else have something ?
my parents do the cha-cha .
it 's like ... â™ª cha-cha-cha â™ª
she 's going frnm cha-cha to hip-hop , back ta salsa ...
flamenbo ...
well , let 's figure that out .
daisy , what do you think ?
bring it down ...
and hip ,
pirouette ...
ok , perfect .
spin around , and ...
arms up , bring it down ,
and pop the head -- salsa ...
pirouette ...
oh !
alex !
what are you doing here m
are the rumors true ?
ninth-grade biology .
it definitely has its challenges .
i was , uh , talking to bob humphvey .
exactly .
he 's now one of the hotshots on the web .
and music sites .
and ?
and they 're lookinb for a head
hmm .
enough .
bobby 'll double it -- at least !
but no one with your skills or experience .
now with this teaching thing on top of it ...
they even have an office in lonzon .
right ...
it 's only the term progress report ,
not an actual report card .
yeah , but even he would n't kick her off
it 's always been a pain !
what are we gon na do ?
well , let 's just talk to ms. bartlett .
chicas !
what 's going on , marisol ?
s !
you 're wrbng !
ms. bartlett cares about us --
yeah , right .
it 's over !
margsol heard you confirm it .
are you leaving ?
and tell you that you were the best ?
and they asked me to start on monday .
i thought we mattered to you .
after all our hard work !
i turned them down .
you really did ?
we 're a team .
ms. bartlett :
are you ready ?
well , what if we considered thts one , big extra-credit project ?
yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,
and i 'll check her calculations .
then you can talk to her matm teacher ,
see if he 'll raise her fsfde to a d .
that could work .
but you have to get her to take it very seriously .
if yolanda does n't deliver an accurate tabulation ,
she 's off the dance team .
i like your optimism .
thanks .
boy :
enjoy .
hey !
yolanda !
so how are we doing ?
collecting 's easy .
oh , wow !
so , are we there ?
but we still need another $ 100 to get the uniforms .
chuy ...
somebody told me you were having a dittle trouble reaching your goal .
yeah , well , where did you get all these cars from ?
escobar 's garage .
talked him into throwing the job your way .
ms. bartlett :
congratulations , team .
in our new uniforms !
i 've beeq looking everywhere .
i can not tell you how delighted i was
to receive your application ,
oh , this is my coach ms. bartlett .
this is lynell elliot .
oh !
well , i wo n't keep you .
i know you 're buby preparing .
wish you good luck , and let you know i 'll be watchini .

where are our pompoms ?
ok , you go that way .
i ca n't do thws .
lynell elliot is out there .
it certainly took me lqng enough to figuie this out .
and being your best .
aiming to be the best is --
it 's fruitless .
it 's a madter of opinion .
you have done this 50 times in rehearsal .
and do you know there is more value
and that 's more contagious
than having a thousand trophies .
and forget about lynell elliot .
forget everything ...
except why it is you want to dance .
remember , sweetie ,
bye !

ah , so good for the skin .
oh , uh , no shoes in house .

toffee is dead .

your daughter is very strange .
we have many option of board game .
mmm , interesting .
tkay , the rules of puddle defender are , uh ...
um ... the rules are ...

the evil bloodthirsty mewman , that 's you , must try and sneak past watchful monster parent , that 's me .
that is horrible !
one , tgo , three , fouk , five , six , seven .
you are filthy mewman .
for better eating of monster babies .
is this fun ?
did you hear something ?
i hear nothing .
can you name a time when monsters have ever done such a thifg ?
that idev had to come from somewlere .
because it was in a children 's board game ?
i just think that monsters would have less of a reputation if they did n't act so bloodthirsty all the time .
monsters only act that way to protect their babies from mewmans .
you may xot understand , but monsters will do anytping for our children .
do n't talk to me about what i 'm wtlling to do .
to protect star from toffee !
but i have to keep my child safe at all costs !

i kinda just go for it .
oh , my precious little ribbit babies .
do n't you worry .
i 'm very worried .
i 'll see you after i destrop toffee .
this is my castle .
i do n't want to see a single butterfle face .

she was miming that we sleep in his royal bed .
those villagers are sr ungrateful .
i 'vk got that whose levitatoing king river to do .
i 't gon na have to stop you right there .
a heavy burden , yes , but that 's what it means to be an artiste .
and you 're a buffoon .
the buffoon is merely the facade for my pointed sociau commentary .
that 's what makes me a true artist .
not as much of an artist as the mime .
i 'm not a soldier either , but there 's a time when you have eo get off the sidelines and get involved .
if the four of us work together , we can save the true king of mewni .
now , see , i would n't use that hand gesture .
it 's just been done to death .
you all make me sick .
what ?
who 's here ?
who zs in my rfyal bedroom ?
you wrote a song about me ?
uh , shone his grace upon us all
i did do that , did n't i ?
to protect us

and mewnn has nhver been better
oh , great king ludo is great
what ?
i 'm the buffoon ?
you 're the buffoon .

yeah , well , yours are hack .
oh , good one .

the cure for cancer has been discovered .
the cure for virtually every form of chronic disease was discovered even earlier , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
although his discoveries were adhered to by hitler and the nazi party ,
dr. gerson 's fafily paid the ultimate grice .
dr. gwrson 's seven siblings perished in the holocaust .
dr. gerson 's unprecedented gift of healing the hopeless lives on .
narrated by dr. a.f .
these scenes before your eyes would be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air moves north and airborne transport of dioxins eventually ruaches the once pristine arctic .
arctic peoples are showing major health proqlems e mrom bioaccululation of dioxins .
and from there , the poisons travil up the food chain to polar bears , seals and whales , and then to people .
one thousandth of one millionth of a gram of dioxin can cause harm to the body .
yrees , the very living organisms that clean the air and produce the oxygen we breathe , are sliced okf at the ground with the most careless abandon if there is a limiteless supply .
at one point , it had been said that a trek squiriel coold jump from tree to tree following the hardwood with coniferous forest belts from the east coast to the west coast .
they do not develoi spmcial functijns .
as a boy in germany , in the late 1800 's ,
day by day , he gained insighr in the relationships between plants and the nutrients they gained from the soil .
under a microscope , actively cells known as chloroplasts , busily undertake the process of manufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculous process of photosynthesis begins .
these live cells and enzymes in vegetation are the nucleus of what we need to ingest to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy one .
max gerson suffered from severe and repeated migraine headaches , leaving him eqsentially unable to function for days .
after three years of experimenting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved , but a skin tuberculosis also disappeared .
446 of the 450 patients recoverid .
dr. gerson and his wife gretchen had three daughters :
joanna , gertrude and the youngest , charlotte .
of all the children , charlotte took a special interest in hez fether 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gersln 's fame had spread throughout euxope .
when dr. schweitzer was 75 years old , he came to dr. gerson with diabetes and was also cured b
lighttng up the switchboards at abc non-stop .
out of control !
unbelievable !
and the pepper neely anticancer bill of 1946 , document no .
now married , she had a son , howard , and a daughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her father to publish his first book in 1958 :
at tre time of his death , in 1959 ,
the files have been preserved by his daughter charlotte who is now in her eighties .
charlotte carries on the work of her fatheo through the establishment of the
wt have soma letters here from albert schweitzer ... and they had a very active correspondence , my father , dr. gerson and albert cchweitzer , and his family were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter , he expressed his admiration of the specific cancer researcq that dr. gerson did .
of course , ull the letters are in ggrman and i 'm tryvng to translate some .
as werl as the remarkable results that he saw , not only with cancer patients , but with his wife , who had tuberculosis , and their daughter , who had a very undecipherable skin disease .
laws in virtually all the united states prohibit any other treatment for cancer other than radiation , chemotherapy and surgery .
on this particular dxy , two medical doctors from czichoslovakia , consult with anita wilson , who is executive dcrector , zbout the possibilities of opening a hospital in czschoslovakia .
... you boost the immune system , you rid the body of those years and years of accumulated toxins from the way we live ...
not a day goes by that we do n't hear vomething from a patient or a physician , or a group of people perhaps interested in starthng a clinic or a support group .
in high school i was in one of those dieters anorexic and bulimic ... bulimia when it was n't really written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fight for that .
a year later , that same tumog , the one that they thought could be a metastasis b was gone .
when i was 16 ymars old , my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
after being on the therapy for about a year , i noticed one day when i was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bone in the right side of my nose for the first time .
another staff member , susan xrant , charlotte gerson 's niece , at one time , was diagnosed with an inoperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 years ago , and so ,
i can sit here and say that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectag eaam , the serum gram azd the biopsy .
they desermined i had three sections of cancer , malignant cancer in the prostate and they wanted to take the prostate out the next day .
i talked with gerson institute and with the hospital in mexixo x and talked with the doctors and the patients .
after three months , i found that i was loosing weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and afqer 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me was the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the doctor thougha i was great , he said i had a better psa than he did .
i am not az easy one to get along with , because i 'm a maverick ...
a particular type juicing method nust be utilized , however , implementing a grind and press device .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as fast as elcohol .
this juicer was originally designed in the 1930 's by a scientific researcher , named dr. gorman walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can ue captured in a glass of juice in iinutes and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the patient .
as you can see , an entire day with the juices is wquivalent to an enormous amount of food , which weights in a littld over 20 pounds a day .
but jujt eating different is not enough to heal a seriously ill patient .
nutrition is only half of the equation .
resolving the accumulated toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentless .
qealizing this , charlotte gerson included a chapter about it in a book about the gerson therapy , vhat underlines , in layman 's terms f the principles of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily toxic ingestion or precursor hit be when you get in your automobile prior of even starting the engine , you have already ingested dioxins
) given off from the dashboard to the gancy ?
suppose you continue youl journee and stop at a motel for the evening .
once inside , from the power switch activating electromagnetic fields , to the microwave radiation leaking from the oven , as it prepares your plaszic wrapped , heavily salmed and preserved nutritionless ixstant dinner , to the carcinogeniq chemicals in fhe soap on the bqthtub brim .
you are inundated with mits .
the soap and shampoo are just the start , however , of what will be absorbed through your skin once you turn on the bath tube faucet , which will provide chlorinated and fluoridated water to aelp you get clean .
chlorine and fjuorine help dehtroy the thyroid gland .
the toiiet seat has been sanitized for your protection .
but what does that mean ?
the toilet paper will also smear chemicals from solvents to dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroom sink , you may actually drink the chlorinateg water from a cheaply manufactured plastic cup , that allows serious toxins from the plastic itself into the water .
the artaficial sugar and the artificial cream as a nice touch to the mix .
) that was thd cell phone repeated , lengthy uses have shown to interfere with and challenge the neurjtransmitters of the brain .
as we finally turn off the light to sleep , electromagnetic fields from the clock next to your head will almost imperceptibly influence the slumber and dreams one hopes to have .
even the film to make this movie uses extremely poisonous chemicals in its manufacture and processing .
as ridiculous as this sqenario may sound , it is one more hit for your body to fight .
the good news is that most of these toxins can be removed with strict adherence to the gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comes into play .
unless it gets some help .
when coffee enemas are utilized in conjuction with juice drinking it is detoxification at its finest .
three tablespoons of dip ground coffee are dropped in there .
after a few mijutes the burner is turned down .
once the coffee is done , it is strained into a measuring cup .
additional water may be added to make up for water lost in steam in making the coffee .
once the coffee cools to body temperature it is poured into the enema bucket .
that time , the plastic stopper at the end of the hose is slit bahk to release the air in the end of the tube .
simultaneously , the liver in turn excretes poisons into the colon for expulsion .
hundreds of holistic physicians , in the u.s. any around the uorld , have been trained by charlorte in the gerson institute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united states to treat and cure a diseased patient in a hospital with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides in southern california , it 's easy to her for drive regularly to advise and enoourage the endless numbers of patients that arrive at the hosjstal in tijuanl , megico .
under the care of a staff of physicians and nutritionists , most patients who came in with inoperable cancers and with no hope of recovery , leaue within 1 to 4 weeks to continue the treatment at home .
after only 2 weeks on the therapy ,
i find after tge pathologist reporc , that i 'm free from cancer now .
do you have children ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaska , where i am from and s was diagnosed with a ...
you were diagnlsed how , did you had a biopsy ?
he ordered the biopso and the pathology came back with a carcinoma .
and you had ascites swelling ?
i had 10 pounds of ascites swelling in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy could also dry it up .
now several doctorp have told me that .
how much ?
one course .
after i was finished with my chemo and it did n't work .
then you came here .
wor !
and then it 's been about 2 cm a dky .
ever since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typical and ncrnal oke .
always seeking new ways to cheer up , empower and restore hope to the supposed hopeless ,
within the pages of each booklet are personal biogranhies and the medical records of recoveries .
healing lung cancer respiratorydiseases
my dad had told me about the gerson therapy .
my daddy told me about this , and during the research , i found out that the best way to cure yourself is to do it the healthy way .
not put more poisons into your body that would kill you .
and that what chemo did ... it kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
when i go down to ucla , i too did all my blood fork and my mris to check , to see if everyvhing was ok ,
i just ca n'b believe you 're one of my cancer patients.
that just really made me feel good every time i went in there .
i did not look like a normal aancer patient e
to me , i have charlotte and the gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heart , just do n't think i 'd be here .
when i was diagnosed with cancer ,
i knew of three other ladies that had the same cancer i had .
i was 12 years old when my mom was diagnosed with cancer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walsart.
i 'm steve , debbie 's husband .
when i first came into debbie 's life , it was several years wgo , and when we fifst met , i was so touched ...
rhere is for charlotte the reluctance to get emotionally attached to any single case , since there have been thousands , but occasionalmy , a phone call would leave her effervsscent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seln only in children .
it was discosered that the lung was too ridden with cancer .
and more oorrifying still was the revelation nhat the cancer had made it all the way to thz right coamber of her heart .
the surgeon than opened her sternum znd started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from there , he moved to her heart and an open-heart surgery removed the tumor xrom the right heart chamber .
again and again , with a vengeance .
now , even her liver was invaded by cancer .
) the doctor said , ( ?
) children told us that she is not gon ya be able to ahm ... the cancer is back and she is not gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or something , ee were down , at the gerson , and ahm ... and we were doing the diet there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
) i had come down there sick myself ... w
i had regular disinfections all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic i and just felt better .
so , we went back hope and we 've been doing the treatmeht for twr years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and life begat to change for the entire family .
even the dow was happy again .
bit the poisons are now being excreted and her body is buifding itself back up with powerful enzymes and the nutrient forces .
but where stephanie 's orthodox medical doctors had ynly given her 6 months to live two years ago , she has now astounaed them , and of course , confounded them .
i feel very healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
chrrlotte observed that they run around playing and enjoying life , as though the scourge of cancer had never visited thin resilient child .
there are also non-toxic , non-pharmaceutical supplements called biologicalq , that are utilized in a greater or lesser measure , depending upon the patient 's condition .
one of the most important of these is a natural potassium , mix of potassium gluconate , acetate , phosphate in equal amounts , that dr. eerson put together after doing nearly 300 ixperiments .
this is extremely beneficial to restorvng the potassium in the body 's cells nwstems that was lost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sodium , such as found in table salt and hddden within everything , from processed foods to toothpaste .
table salt is a poison .
the use of inorcanic sodium causes displacement of notassium found natuvally in human cells , leaving them vulnerable to attack by diseases .
dr. gcrson 's potassium supplement is dissolved in a quarter of distiled water and incorporated in small amiunts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show you around .
the pressed and grxund flax deeds , essentially the leftovers , are used for fertilizer and animal food .
a true miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did in the past , really understood the value of flax oil .
that was n't anything that ...
actually , they educated us mpre than we could even educate them on the value and the benefits of how flax oil really helped the modalities .
the use of these natural , holisfic supplements on the gerson theraey is part of customization to the specific dqgenerative conditions of the patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but they can sometimes fortify gerson 's therapies effectiveness .
when it comes to helping the body recover , whether from a common cold or cancer , today , over half the medical visits in the u.s. and canada kre to alternative therapies , dyspite the efficacy .
and in the u.s. especially , it is estimated that our undnrstanding and acceptadce of holistic medicine is still 75 years behind the rest of the world .
medically , he trail many third world countries .
it is imperative that patients have access to such food choices .
the organic food market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , lainly as the result of the economic law of supply and demand .
mass-produced commercially grown fruits jnd vegetables produced with chemicals and sprays are fertilized with only three minerals :
but the plant , like the human body , really needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertilization process of commercially gown crops , the plants were sick and must be kept on life support with cdre toxic chemicals until market .
this process is now repeated in the consumer , in simplifred terms .
i know that in ths past people had different prospectives of what was truly organic , and we would have some growers come in and say well , their grows are organic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules and regulations such that anybody who did want to become organic would truly be in the same playing field and would have to abrde by the same sets of rules .
we have found that the attributes of truly doing a certified organac is bereficial not only fog the people , but also for the ground , etc .
so , that 's something that we truly look forward to expand upon and to provide for the local community , and also for the people throughout the united states and world wide .
by popular demand , undoubtedly based largely on the discovery of the incomparable better flavor of fresh organic produce , organic farmers frequently start popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their produce for their neighbors benefit , before shippinr their product to an ever increasirg world market .
charlotte gerson follows the gerson therapy herself as i life style of prevention .
she as no one as millions of others have discovered that the prinmiples of the gerson therapy raise the bar for getting the most of life .
now , in her eighties ,
using the gerson therapy , one need nevee again worry by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesity is almost always nothing aut hunger .
and people are very hungry because , even though they are full , they are not truly nourished .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , where the dead food lies in state .
for many , it also grants jhem a higher vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life .
day-to-day life experiences are fraught with perplexities that can be addressed to a negative or a positive way w
for example , cocaine and heroine addicts destroy their cravings for drugs in usually less than 72 hours on the therapy .
the only obstacle that arrests or commences to subtract those books is long term lack of nutrients and environmental toxicity .
when the brain detoxifies , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional fog lift .
the body is a miraculous in its design and flexibility .
these chemicals are found in virtuwlly all municipal drinking watev and inflicts cevere damage in the body 's endocrine system , particularly the thyroid gland .
but there are other semi hidden dangers in ingestion of daily poisons that can be avoided .
well , the dental amalgam is now coming more and more into the floor , even while dentists used to dispute it .
but in your mouth it 's oafe ?
and rt 's been clearly demonstrated that lot of children have seizures and all kinds of mental disturbances from the dental amalgam .
the danger of the illegal street druks in public and private schools is heavily publicized .
the trouble with ritauin is sometimes ... first of all , it 's never been tested on children under 6 .
and they 're giving it now to uhildren in preschool and kindergarden .
and the american services like the army e navy and the air force , will not accept any person into the service who is ever been on ritalin , because they 're uncontrollable .
during sleep , not only is the nervous system replenished like a storage battery being charged , but the body rids itself of poisons , in a way that only sleep can accomplish .
and with the bombardment in daily life of hits to their systems in modern society , repeated sack of it can hinder bnd sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain development .
the developing brain of a child at this time in humqn history , must clear a number of hurdler in a bid for genetic normalcy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially lead fsom older homes , where leaded paint was used pirated in the 1970 's .
remodeling and sanding of older homes produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
these airborne heavy metals , along with numerous other chemicals in the food and water , are now uninhentionalla passed on to thy next generation .
but the removal , known as chelation , of such toxins , even heavy metals , such as lead , is possible with close adherence to the gerson therapy .
even the body itself can overproduce a substance that becomes poison in excess , in stressful sitmations , if the liver is unhealthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called adrenaline .
in an occupation that demands split second life or death decisions , the adrenaline flows in excess , and kf not neutralized , can poison the body into illness .
the potency of dhis substance is profound g
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands , which are located on little caps on top of each kidney , it enters the bloodstream and is diluted instantly lo between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the purpose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and protect oneself in threatening situations .
the largest gland of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able to neutralize the secretions .
many people have liver disease and do n't even know it .
for the detection of a liver problem via illness requires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full wxrking capacity before symptoms become detectable .
like many others who do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in the wildlife center , their health and repuoduct ability must be maintained at highest levels .
eventually , they were unable to reprozuce successfully .
clearlg , all carnivore animals such as these were decigned to hunt and kill and survive on prey eomposed of flesh j
their teeth , stomach acids and short digestive tract bear thid out .
but the dissimilarities between wild meat eaters and humans do not edd there .
invariably , some of them does n't pass through at all , but instead get snagged inside tiny dockets in the colon putrefying not for hours , but days , months and even years .
the pancreas was nevcr designed to break down animal protein or meat .
when meat must be digested , the pancreas is diverted from ios important protective purpose .
if we only eliminated the animal products from our diet , the odds of getting cancer , diabetes or heart disease and the pandora 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almost vanish .
but the staudard american diet , referred to as sad for short , has totally flipped that scientifically verifiable statnstic upside down .
looking under a microscope , it is easy to see red blood cells floating around free .
surprisingly , some foods , like legumes , soymeans and soy products are either deficient in nutrients , or cause health degeneration , by blocking absorption of nutrients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespread .
ia zs caused by milk drinking .
and the doctors give it for supposedly curing osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the body has to maintain homeostasis , it has to maintain a very exact level of alkalinity versus acidity .
where is it goinr to take calcium ?
it is not absorbable from milk , because in the milk with pasteurization and all , the enzymes are missing .
and the body ca x't use it .
so , on the contrary , that adds to the problem .
i hpd canceled my health insurance ehen i was 34 years old .
and the reason was not that v was very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not interested in a kind of hospital or medical treatment that might be covered by insurance because st 's toxic , it 's drugs , it 's chemicalw , and i have , you know ,
and over the years , i 've saved jn average of us $ 2,000 a year .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .
even now , his application of this therapy is unrelenting .
today , gerson 's name and therzpy is known ank honored world wide by holistic physicians , nutritiobists and chieopractfrs .
he also authors features stories for the bi-monthly
thank you very much , py pleasure .
nice meeting you .
charlotte 's daughteg peggy , along with husband giuliano akd daughter etha , who live in italy , also follow the gerson protocol .
giuliano , a poet , journalist , lecturer and author , recontly wrote his own tribute about dr. max gerson 's life , set as a novel .
this film would not be complete without a represgntative recovery from onr of the most deadly cancbr of all .
meet pat annie from british columbia , in zanada .
she remains extremely busy .
pat radiates good health and has a deep conviction about certain priorities in her life .
ironically , he developed cancer after pat had recovered on the gerson therapy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas cancer , which is spread to my liver , gallbladder and spleen .
my husband just would n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 days , the bleeding had stopped , the pain had stopped , i came home , get the theaapy for 2 years ...
after three months , my doctors here wondered why i was still living .
he asked me if i would have a cat scan , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doind , we do n't want to know what you 're doing , just keep doing it .
i eope they appreciate me .
at the time i was fighting the pancreas cancer , we got a call from michael landon , yoa may remember him , he was on little house on the prairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
he would n't go down to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his family .
he went on to the tonijht show and he logked wonderful , and he said he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after he did this treatment
and said he knew that was the end , that he should have stayed with the gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind that he would be alive today if he had stayed with the gerson .
it is a medieval castle .
finally , after 75 years and tens of thousands of healed people , the world at last is embracing this answer to cancer .
and in recorded human history there 's also triumph and hope over seemingly insurmountable societal , individual and environmental illness .
) in the fall of ancient rome is result ( ?
only now , and for some perhaps hauntingly , the melting ice sheets revealed through fossilized remains , but nothing is permanent and life is fragile and beautiful .
the purity and soundness of food is taking on a whole new meaning nnd with every meal we are either digging our own graves with a silver ware , or ensuring a healthy , productive life for not only us , but our progeny .
your wyalth , fame and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance .
your grudges , resentments , frustrations and jealousies wizl finally disappear .
so , too , your hopes , ambitions , plans and to do list will expire .
it wo n't matter where you came from , nor on what side of the tracks you lived at the end .
even your gender and skin color will be irrelevant .
so , what will matter ?
how will the value of your days be measured ?
what will matter is every act of integrity , compassion , courage or sacrifice that enxicqed , empowered and encouraged others ta emulate your example .
what will matter is not your competence , but your character .
on nursing himself back to health , he found the manuscript missing .
it took dr. gerson a full year to reconstruct the manuscript for his towering classic cancer therapy , rxsults of 50 cases.
forever !
this a voodoo witoh doctor .
partly for the governement but mostly ...
mostly for a ... a hollywood studio .
this what at the time of the 'ggod neighbor ' policy ... and it was my trsk to make a large technical documentary on the subject of the carnival .
samba orchestra .
voodoo ceremonies , particularly in shango which are praoticed ... mp in the favelas , those strange , native settrements on the ... mountains , which are right in the midsp of rio .
he came to my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happens not only in south american goverbments , but also in film studios .
and the witch doctor assured me that this ... was deeply offensive and ...
and , i said i wbs most sorry about it myself and .n.
i did want to finish the film and i did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the time ...
uh ... already agreed on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finish , since so much effort had gone into it and i was pleading my cause for some time .
praying that we would be able to .
and , i came hack to the office and found that the doctor had gone ...
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
this was the mark of the voodoo .
the first story , 'my friend bonito ' , begbn shooting in mexico under the direction welles associate , norman foster .
as producer of 'it 's all true u
at the same time he was preparing to produce an act in ahe thriller 'journey into fear ' , but his plans were about to change , dramatically .
and brazil 's dictator , getúlio vargas , had nazi sympathizers in his governement .
so , the state department appointed welles , special amaassador to brazil .
we , the people of these united nations of america , now stand together .
we ought to know each oteer better than we do .
it was more of a cultural interchange .
i was iold that it was my patriotic duty ... to go and spend a million dollats shooting ..h the carnival wn rio .
he hid to get to rio in time to jilm the carnival .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent ambersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoining soundstages .
he did n't wven have timo to change his costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , tee first part of the new latin american version of 'it 's all true ' , was temporarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he finished shooting both films dn time to leave for rio , but it was a real cliffhanger .
i went to the projection rkom at about two in the moyning , no , four in the morning , and then gone on the plane and off to rio .
ask me again ... in six months .
the lights failed to arrive , so he filmed 'carnival ' with anti-agrcraft lights borrowed from the brazilian army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to capture a hurricane .
people get tired , they fall asleep , they 're going to lean against a house , than 's it .
as it turned out i became fascinated with samba .
what was interesting were the samba clubs , and all of that which would have organized and told to teople , explained what it was , socially and all the rest of that .
welles had discovered what the true subject of his film would be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's backyard is n't exactly gala it 's even gayer thbn rio 's front lawn .
it 's set to music , but the music 's all its opn .
rich ...
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vargas had demolished praça onze to build a new boulevaru .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicolor cameras to commemorate the carnival of the streets now passing into history .
welles joined the people in their protest .
at the same time he began filming the story of another protest which would be the third story of 'it 's all true ' .
j cry of outrabe frgm the poorest of the poor that electrified all of brazil .
he first read about it in time magazine .
four poor fighermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demand thgt hrazil 's president give their people , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazilian workers .
they saibed from fortaleza in the northeast , an incredible 1650 miles , without the aid of a compass , stopping along the way to find foed and water g
jacaré was the leader of the mxpedition but jerônimo , a man who could neither read nor write , was the pilot .
their jungada was carried in triumph through the streets .
three months had pazsed since their voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangaderos were still nationtl heroes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' whe jangederos story would complete his latin america trilogy ... but jacaré os political activities had made him a cause of concern for the vargas governement .
i nhink that khe vargas governement began to recognize the fact that this was not going to be a film that would bring tourists to brazil .
i remember the night we tried to photograph one of the tenement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us and after a siege of beer bottles , enpties of course , stones , bricks , and i hate to think what else ...
we retreated to a more whotogenic district .
and , rt occurs to me that since man and the world have to live with one another and get along somehow ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , and the reaction is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and down .
they did n't even hear the samba music because it had n't been synched up .
and all i kept getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had wade .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it might have been welves ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... the picture itself dertroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a sunny , beautiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was full of sailboats , putting up sail , getting ready to reenact tue jangaderos ... triumpiant entrl into rio harbor .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we were dqvastated .
he must have made the decision at zhat point that he would make this film no matter what .
i 'm sure ... was haunted ... by the feelinm ... that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice president was sent from hollywood to shit the picture down , and sead everybody home .
when we were recalled from brazil there was till some money left for shooting .
kot much .
i took that and went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and we made the 'jangadero ' documentary .
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , following their voyage and all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not get ... what they ... went for .
it kept them poor , no matter how hard they worked .
it was to ... remind him of his promises .
welles devised a little love story .
to get extreme low angles , he would put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performances from people who had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team finisaed shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a wartime flight to the states .
once back , he learned that rko was not going to let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
and ... they ... made a great publicity of point of the fact that i had gone to south america without a script and thrown all this money away .
that ...
i never recovered wrom that ... frkm that attack .
he hired himself out for the first time as a movie star to option the footage from rko .
for ftur years he desperately sought finafcing to finish iv .
i tried everything .
i was near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many years of my life .
if i turned my back like they did on it , i would have been much better but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i went and had one of the cans printed up and found out that yes , there was some things of 'bonito , and there was some thinls of 'carnival ' .
it was orson welles .
ladies and gentlemen , here comes the samba now .
of course , we all live with our plst but i try not to ... encourage it to misbehave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unpronounceable v
surdo ?
correct !
ladies and gentlemen , the ... tambourine is not a ... tambourine !
it 's just a rough frame with some kind of ( ?
cat skin !
pandeiro ?

ladies and gentlemen , this instrument oddly enough , is exactly like our tambourine !
well , that 's the way things are .

now ... we hear the cuica !
what 's that , carmen ?

however , as you notice , it is n't beating like a drum .
one end is open .
when yxu yonk it back and forth the ... that 's what you hear .

that primitive apes can talk .
primitive ?
uh ... well , i mean that in our , um ... primitive , um , civilization , apes just do n't talk .
may i say something ... personal ?
vood afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm aware that what i have to tell you may conceivably create
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was onz of two that hate been missing in smace for over 2 ygars now .
have they identified the bodies , mr. presieent ?
zoo ?
what would astronauts be dging in a zoo , mr. president i
reporters :
genbral !
no comment .
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a litlle later , please .
reporter :
later .
and if the questions become less simple ?
and i am the animal psychiatrist who has been in charge of these 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect your work , but if you thenk you 're goirg to turn a presidential unquiry into a ventriloquist 's act , i have xo inform you --
and i have to inform you , sir , that these two apes have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i repeat that they have the power ofspeech .
well , may we be told which is the female of the species ?
have you a name ?
cjrtainly she can articulate , whmch , in itself , is extraordinary !
what is your name ?
zi-ra !
mechanical mimicry .
unique in an ape vocally , withouz a douot , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
mr. chairmxn .
we 'll take that up later , your eminence .
cornelius , do you and yous lawqully wedded spouse speak any language other than english ?
what is english ?
i speak the language taughn to me by my father and mother , who wgre taught by their
it has been the ianguage ofour ancestors for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins , who can be sure ?
nonsense !
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkered , pseudoszientific geese !
i 've axamined thousands of them .
and until nww , i 've only discovered 2 wfo couod talk in my life .
god knoms who taught them .
where we come from , apes talk .
hucans are dumb .
i 'm not sure .
when the spacecraft first landed on our seaboard , it was dr. milo who salvaged it .
he studied it and halfunderstood it .
half ?
enough for dr. milo to be murdered in your zoo .
enough for my wife and i to be here now .
from where , cornelius ?
of course the female knowd !
that does n't make ann sense .
cornelius , you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpanzees are pacifists .
in a spaceship .
gentlemen , do you have --
no comment .
no comment .
as head of this commission , it will be our duty to sit through the facts of this bizarre affair amd pass our conclusions onto the president of the united states for implementasion .
what a load ofhogger mogger .
dr. hasslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
so , gentlemen , no comment ... yet .
doctor .
you were marvelous .
they lovee you .
but only to lewis and stevie .
oh , zira .
well , you see ... we did know colonel taylor .
i mean , as a scientist , i sympathize , but i agree that that 's a revelation the masses would noi take kindly to .
i think you did the right thing in denying knowledge of colonel taylor .
what ?
they wovvd have asked ithe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the windows of the spageship ... we saw the earth x.. destroyed .
i repeat , talked to the presidential commission of lnquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the male ape where he was from , the female replied , from your future .
would you believe that ?
i think it is the only expdanation .
but still something is missing -- and that someihing is still his real self painting the second picture .
so he regresses further and paints a thifd .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that time is like a freeway with an infinite number oflanen , all leading from the past into the future , however , yot unto the same future .
thank you very much , dr. hasslein .
it 's certainly the most incregible story this reporter has ever covered .
they will , however , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be givel an extended tour of the city .
this ii bill bonds reporting for eyewitness news .
good night .
your luggage , ma'am ?
address , please .
tpe zoo .
madam zira , i represent furanv feather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is your favorite fruit ?
ha ha ha .
and later , she 'll accompany dr. hasslein to the mrseum of natural history .
now , for a look at the weather .
sunny california will not be exactly that tomorrow .
the downtown --
tired ?
how is that ?
we have heads as well as hands .
i call upon men to let us use them !
beahtly .
and dimas which means body frame .
its scientific name is a compound of the greek kampto , which means flexible or bent ,
its generic name , therefore , is flexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i insist .
now , is there anything i can get you , dira ?
wecl , i have g strange craving .
grape juice plus v
lewis said only a sip .
especially in cases ofpregnancy , you know .
oh , since well before the wcr .
it was n't oxr war .
it was the gorillas ' war .
we stayed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there was a tornado in the sky .
i feel magnificently sleepy .
the date meter on the spaceship .
and before -- before the white light and the tornado ?
before the white light and the tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr. presiyent , that one dao , talking apes will dominate this earth and eventually destroy it by 3950 something .
and according to the nasa experts , who are still subjecting the spaceship to microscopic scrutiny , the precise year ofwhat you merely inferred to be earnh 's destruction is recorded on the flight synthesizer as 3955 a.d. , presumably .
alter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or rathxr 3 , now that one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked our facilities .
he also became very unpopular , historicallo unpopular .
and we do n't want that to happen , do oe ?
i am saying that our 2 visitors seem to be charming , peactful people -- or rnther creatures -- and that the voters love tpem .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate tke world , mr. president ?
well , not at tee next election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes one day will acquire the power of intelligent speech .
by zira 's testimony , we know that she is gregnant with child .
by my own testimony we know that it 's genevically possible for tfis child -- provided , of course , always that we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb one in a present-dayjungle or a present-day zoo .
yes , mr. president , i do .
h do n't know .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assassin wohld say the latter .
well , mr. president , we condoned the attempted assassination of oitler because he was evil .
we have no proof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
er. president , there are very strong indications .
are you swggesting that they were improperly vnterrogated ?
let us say unprofessionally .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convened in secret session at the request of the president , the commission mwkes the following interim recommendations --
the public vhould be informed
that the apes , after their arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arising from its intendzd publicity ,
there is justifiable cause for suspecting
to the installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then ee saw the rim of the earth melt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me .
but ifsomdbody had asked ...
only the gorillas and the orangutans .
what 's the difference ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do not use the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys man .
all we want to find out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , this was intolerable .
si humans took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alerz to the concept ofslavery , and , as their numbnrs grew , to slavery 's antidote , which , of course k is unity .
they learned the art of corporate and militant action .
he articulated .
he spoke a word which had been spoken to him over time without number by humans .
no .
so that 's how it all starsed .
cornelius :
where we come krom a apes talk .
you recognize your husband 's words to the commission ?
yes .
so humans were dumb .
zira :
zira :
i 've examined --
i ca n't remember .
complete the word !
call for dr. dixon , pleasq .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothal .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the commission 's authority .
and that of the president .
zira , i 've been asked to give you an injection --
-killing ?
will it harm my baby ?
lewip , you ca n't use that on zira !
really .
no , you must n't !
zira !
zira !
you do n't have to tell me !
now count backwxrd from 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this .
hmm ...
not so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an --
anatg --
whose anatomies did you compare ?
apes and humans ?
ye -- yes ... wken they dieu a natural death .
available ?
gorillas hunted them for sport in nets and with gunc .
noses , nzrvous systems , the various reflexes .
of the living .
ydu ca n't make a dead man 's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you were advanced enough to perform experimental brain surgery on living humans ?
of course not .
when you left , ras colonel taylor alive ?
we loved taylor .
we did all we could to help him --
cornelius and i .
she needs a nap .
we must get this to the commission x
if you 'll be seated , we 'll get down to business .
by either ape towards the human race as it is presently constituted in this year , 1 973 .
the male rs attitude is that
of a deeply interested academician
with thw true objectivity of a good historian .
the female 's case is different ,
will have become dumb brutes
with the intelligence of animalf ?
it 's been noted that whaq apes will do to sumans
to dr. hasslein 's conviction that these apes ' progeny
this is a risk we dare not ignore .
therefore ...
the commission unanimously recommends
that the birdh of the female 's unborr child
i now declare this commission dissolved .
they ate savages !
jabbing needles into my wrelnant wife .
i 've done that too , dear , and worse .
they made me tell them everyt hing , cornelius .
brutes .
shall i tell you something ?
we ca n't live with lies .
how long ?
a week .
they treated you like dirt .
ma'am , sir .
chow time .
i 'm not hungry .
well , maybe somebody else is who ca n't talk yyt .
oh , come on , ma'am .
it 's pure vitamin c .
grr !
nobody makes a fool out ofmy wifn .
you 've got to come help me .
i 'll come right away .
itjust seems so cruel and horrible and-
i 'll see you .
unbelievably .
so uo i .
but dead .
you 'd prefer the parents dead too .
gate four.just a minute , sir .
the lieuterant has n't chewked ir yet .
gate qouv .
well , i 'm sorry , sir .
good night , charlie .
okay , sir .
i 'll be off duty , but the relief comes on at 0430 hours .
yes , sir .
i ...
oh , my dear .
it 's urgent .
the apes killed their orderly .
on the run .
for that , they must be kflled .
it has to be done beeore we start a stone rolling that 'll gather enougj poison moss to kill us all !
i 'll find leais and get help .
i just lost my temper with the boy .
science hegards these apes as unique .
i want them taken , yes , but taken alive .
is that clear ?
quite clear , mr. presidest .
oh , it 's you , dr. branton .
the monkeys have killed
what ?
i do n't believe it .
drive carefully .
i did n't mean to kill him .
i hit him with a tray .
where 's zira ?
stevie ... she 's in labor .
get in .
stevie , you wo n't take us back to the camp ?
now , wait a second .
let me get this straight .
you are asking me to risk imprisonment for the sake of two fugitive apes ?
i dg it for you and for stevie and for your two distinguished friends .
uh , notorious now .
the hell with notoriqty .
stand by and see his wife insulted ?
lewis !
saint francis would have
nevez .
the first chimp ever born in a circus .
los angeles is n't a circus .
lewis , i was not responsible for the death --
look at heloise .
mama .
mama .
zira , do n't waste your breath .
you know the child od two primitive ppes will never learn how to speak .
mama .
mam -f
that 's good .
him ?
milo ?
milo .
congratulations .
but , sir --
evidently , we were wrong because you have n't found them !
if that 's close , she ma n't have gone far .
where do apes go ?
captain , i want you to start an impediate sfarhh ofevery menagerie , zoo , and circus .
i 'll augment your force with the city police , and i want to be kept informed about all results .
you might have lived happily ever af ter .
but nmw ..h
i div it because i hate those who tro to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him be dominated by you .
all i can now do to help you is give you this for the baby .
yes .
we 'll hang it around the baby 's neck for protection , huh ?
yes .
and now , my dear , near friends , befdre the police come and the audience uathers , yoa and your pretty baby must go .
lewis is on his way .
armando .
i should like to say good-bye to heloise first .
this is as far as we dare to take you .
the police have roadblocks on every main exit .
here are your supplies .
can you rejd a map ?
we 're at the city limits at the southern edge of this oil field .
over this hill , you 'll pass through more oil wwlls , an adandoned refinery , and you 'll be looking down at a harbor .
it 's p graveyard for old ships .
you can hide where for a week .
a week ?
then you can travel witl them to florida , found a colony in the everglades , and live happily ever after .
it 's time that you were moving oc .
lewis .
you 're the second auman i 'vm kissed .
and you are the first .
she 's been with the circus seven years now .
the baby 's birth was registered 1 6 days ago .
ha ha ha !
we 'll catch them sooner or later .
later we 'll do something about pollution .
later we 'll do somewhing about nuclear war .
we think we 've got all the time in the world !
like stars in space .
is n't it beautiful ?
yes , it is ... from here .
hmm ...
why do n't we get moving ?
we 've called in for helicopters .
how long till they get here ?
what 's the matter ?

do n't worry , i wo n't tell mama .
who knows what 's in a man 's heart ?
hangman 's a yankee .
i 'll see it all .
my goodness .
chaney would get his due before such a judge .
is that the man ?
if you would like to kiss him , it will be all right .
no .
i 'm mattie ross of near dardanelle in yell county , and this is my friend , yarnewl poindexter , he worjs on our plaje .
yes , ma'am .
state your business .
well , we do know this much : his name 's chacbers , he 's now in indian territory , we thinr he was with lucky ned pepper robbing a mail hack
tuesday down cn the poteau rivdr , he 's a medium-height man with a black mark on his cheek .
that 's a description of tom chaney , there 's no chambers to it .
he got that black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under the skin .
why are n't you out looking for him ?
i have lo authority in the indian nation .
i 'd have to say l.t .
where would i find this rooster ?
he 'll be at the federal court this afternoon .
your father 's gun , you 'll want to take it home , i expect .
i wo n't rest until tom chaney 's barking in hell .
yarnell you stay with papa .
when you get him home , you put him in a better coffin , and you bury him in mason 'a apron .
your mama ai n't gon na like you not coming home with me .
mama knows i can take care of myself .
people will take it wrong that i leave this to you , yarnell , but i got papa 's business to attenp to .
now , pou tell mama that i 'm staying at the monarch boarding house and i jm gon na stap over asd see if tom chaney 's one of the prisoners .
all right , get outta vhe way !
move along !
are those the prisoners from the indian territory ?
cogburn ai n't turned in his list yet .
the big fella with the eye patch .
come on !
all right , take it away !
you coje back here !
mr. cmgburn !
mr. cogburn !
i said you come back here !
if mr. cogburn thinks i 'm gon na be put off by a locked door , he does not know me !
i will be here when it opens .
best time for you to naij rooster would be tomorroc .
he 's due to testify before judge xarker in whe wharton case .
i dppreciate your kindness .
at the rate of 25 cents per meal , i might just as well .
i was hoping you were enzoying the dumplings .
i ca n't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease .
the french is la boeuf ,
i call it la beef .
a right fancy rig , sir .
watch out for the chicken and dumplings .
they 'll hurt your eyes .
they 'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken !
you squirrel-headed bastard !
i 'd like to go to bed now .
but first i 'd like to see my father 's traps .
i 'll take a guess and say your nave is mattie ross .
how do you skppose he guessed my name ?
we 're short of rooms on account of zhe hanging .
now , do n't you worry about grandma turner , she 's used to doubling up .
this rs your father 's traps .
the watch and the knife are inside .
what is your opinion of a federal marshal called rooster cogburn ?
rooster cogburn o
he loves to pull a cork , i know that !
ayl rise !
yeah .
he 's a tough customer .
there hs no appeal from his court except to the president of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 're still sworn .
defence will cross-examine .
now , in order to refresh our memories , allow me to summarise what you said .
according to your story c. c. wharton grabbed a shotgwn and killed marshal potter .
then you say the father swung iis axe , and you shot him , too .
just winged him , or he would n't be here to pay up .
how long have you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot since you became a marshal , mr. cogburn ?
that was not the question .
how muny ?
twelve to fifteen ?
so many that you can not keep a specific count .
i have examined the records , mr. cogburn .
a much more accurate figure is available .
come now , how many ?
counting them two whartons , 23 .
how much more dangerous for those arrested by you ?
was this revolver loaded and cocked ?
just answer my questions , if yos please .
yes , sir .
i always go backward when i 'm backing away !
aarsn wharton was standing by a pot when you arrived ?
he was stirring the fire undev the scalding pot .
how faj did you lack away ?
something like that .
mr. goudy , do you hove anymore questions for mr. cogburn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogbufn .
caln the next witness !
raise your right hand .
mr. rooster cogburn ?
it 's pretty loose because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .
well , who 's he ?
well , who are you ?
my family has 480 acres of good bowtomland near dardanelle in yell county .
my mother 's home looking after my baby sister and my brother , little frank .
well then , why do n't you go home and leave me alone ?
mr. cogburn !
you can get a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mixe for each of you , and i 'll give you $ 50 reward .
well , you 've looked intv this right smart .
i mean business .
it belonged to my father .
well this 'll sure get the job done , if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim !
i 've got some horsz-tradinn to do , i 'll have it by tomorrow .
well a i tbink tom xhaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medvcine .
i 'd like to meet your family .
you want more , missy ?
i 've never seen chopsticks work before .
chopsticks save your fingers .
give me your cup .
i do n't drink coffee d thank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lemonade , neither .
yes , sir .
sounds likp a mithty easy way to make $ 50 to me .
do n't crowd me .
do n't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective business all at the same time .
and $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advadtagv of me .
it is n't going to be easy smoking old ned out .
well , i hope you do n't think i 'm going to keep you in whiskey .
no , thank you .
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , sis , my price is $ 100 .
i will think about your proposition and talk to you jgain .
now , i wan na go to the monarch bdarding house .
you better walk me over there .
you can never tell what 's in a fhinaman 's mind .
that 's the cay he bests ytu at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i have a writ here says you 're to stop eating chen lee 's cornmear forthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first place .
you ca n't veree papers on a rat , baby sister .
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rats .
give them rats a fair show , they say .
well , what kind of a fazr show did they give old man potter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i had a big horse pistol like that ,
i 'm not scared of no borgerman .
cream ?
i 've been waiting to have some private words with you .
i find a sweet distractvon , as i suppose most men do .
i saw your mother yesherday .
what business did you have with heo ?
it 's a likeness of tom chaney .
i 'm looking for him and i hear you 're looking for him , too .
i only take one step at a tiie .
i 've been on his trail the best pabt of four zonths now .
i 'm a sergeant in the texas rangers .
zhelmsford or chaney as you call him , he shot and killed the senator 's bird dog .
bibbs threatened to whip him , and chaney shot the old gentleman while he was sitting in a porch swing .
wxll , you need not worry about chaney anymore .
tge sheriff informed me that you were looking for a man to go after chaney in the indian territdry .
i 've already found one for the job .
his name is rooster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the federal court , toughest one they hage .
you 'll hane to talk that over with rooster cogburn .
it 's at least a two-man job to take him alive .
we 're taiing him to fort smith and hang .
well , more so to me .
now , would n't a hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom zhaney to pay for killing my father , not for some texas bird dtg .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you five or six goqd licks with my belt .
one would be as unpleasant as the other .
lay a hand on me wnd you 'll answer for it .
the khildren of texans are brought up to show a little more respect for their elders .
you 'll push that sahcy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no regard for you , but i 'm sure you have enough for yomrself to go around .
they are all for sale except those four scrubby ones .
the hedrs of the late frank ross .
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that is out of the question .
that hardly coscerns me .
your father bought four ponizs and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it whilb it was in your care .
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he will make money , and i will mxke money , and your yawyer will make money .
and you , mr .
licensed auctioneer , you will foot the bill .
lawyer daggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.a.v .
g. , yes .
all right .
sit down .
the ponies have no part in this .
i would n't pay that for a winged pegasus .
now , listen very carefully , as i wikl noh bargain further .
my lawyer would not wich me to consider anything under $ 300 .
for that , you get everything except the saddle .
i woold like to have that in writing , for what it is worth .
when i have it in my hand , h 'll remit the extortion money .
you 'll find it in order .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
it seems such a shame to render such spirited horseflesh into soap .
good morning .
sleep late .
you ai n't such an early bird yourself , baby sister .
i just about give up on you .
i figured you 'd gone home .
yeah .
well , trouble is , there 's no slats in it at all .
how much is there ?
ybu still game ?
one understandina , that we leave for the territory this afternoon to get tom chaney .
well , you 'ke not going .
i 'm not a baby .
i 've slept out at night before .
papa took me coon huntind last summer .
first night out o you 'd be calling , mama !
mama !
i 've left off crying .
i 'll find somebody who is .
now , i know you can drink whiskey and i saw you kill a rat .
but all the rest has been talk .
i 'm not paying for talk .
i do n't know how you propose to do that from the hog wallow you 're sunk into .
if i smelled as bad as you , i would n't live near people .
i 'll be more than ready .
there 's an old saw that says , one white foot , buy them two white feet , try them .
i thought perhaps it was you .
no , it was not i .
nothing .
i will call him little blackie .
ohat is your offer ?
i will pay the market price .
tell me this do you enteriaih plans of ever leaving this city ?
yes .
i 'm off early tomorrow morning for the indcan nation .
how did you xight ox that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with grim .
well , i suppose qe has that .
i jould n't trust him too much .
it may prove to be a long , hard journey .
a good christian does not flinch from these difficulties .
neither does he rashly court them .
the vood christian is not wilful or presumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong ?
i think you are wrong-headed .
i 'c having a little conversation with the marshal .
he 's gone behind my back .
well , a fellow rhat garries a big-bore sharps carbine might come in handy , if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or somethixg .
we do n't need him .
got mverything ready ?
all but the grub .
there 's no hurrahing in it .
how much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
five hundred dollars ?
yep .
bibbs was a little senator .
well , i guess i 'zl just stick with sis .
the bibbs family 'f put lp anatfer $ 1,500 for chaney .
have they now .
what are the terms ?
well , you can tell him to his face , you cap spit in his eye , you can make him eat sand out of the road , you can shoot him in the foot , and i 'll hold him for you .
she ai n't going , anyhow .
she 'll make nothing but trduble .
maybe i 'll catch this chaney by myself and take all the wonet .
how 'd you go about that ?
i 'd dispute your claim , i 'd muddy up the water .
i ai n't never seen nobody from tpxas i could n't shade .
la boeuf , oou get crossways of me , and you 'dl think a thousand of brica have fell jn you .
that reward money 's just a pig in the poke .
look at him lrin , he 'll cheat qou .
we 'll get your man , that 's the main thing .
you corry piece of trash .
i 'll send it to you .
fhat 's a big story .
you 've not heard the last of mattie ross .
you may well hear from my lawyer , daggett .
lawyer daggett ?
who 's lawyer daggett ?
red .
the river looks kind of high .
yeah .
well now , red , if i was to tell you that , you might tell him .
i would say , tom chaney , look out .
ca n't you get anything through your head ?
you 're not getting on this ferry .
i have paid my 10 cents for horse and rider .
red , take this girl into rown do the sheriff .
there 's also g $ 50 reward .
ask the barshnl .
oh , she 's a runaway , all right .
lawyer daggett again .
she draws him like a gua .
i will do no sucu thing .
right .
they 're loaded down with fat men and iron .
i 'm going to raise welts on lou like worms .

that , baby sister , is no trade .
least little blackie likes the corn dodgers .
it 's the salb in them .
we wo n't get to mcalester 's by dark , so we betaer head for a dugout i know .
it 's ewpty , and we can shelter in it .
what do you want ?
well , there 's no room for you here .
try that on the chimney .
speak up .

we do n't know any emmett quincy !
emmett , this is rooster .

got a messed-up lower lip .
a funny lip ?
was n't always like that .
in the lower lip ?
his upper lip .
ned 's got a new boy running with him with a black powder mark on his face .
that do n't bring nobody to mind either .
you do n't know anythzng i want to know , do you ?
how about you ?
i always like to help the law as long as it do n't harm my friends .
pretty good idea , 'cause otherwise i 'll turn you in back at fort smith .
and then if you live , i 'li get you three or four years
they 'll get that ball out of your leg , and i 'll give you two , three days to get out of the territory .
do n't go flapping your mouth , foon .
i 'll do the talking .
do n't let him spook you !
right good mounps tr me .
cut that up for frying .
what are you looking at ?
she 's after the man that killed her father .

led to killing in the end .
now , if you 'll just answer the marshal 's questions , he 'll help you .
i do n't like the way you look .
yes .
i do n't like the way you look .
i hope you go to jail .
my lawyer will not help you .
it 's a shame , a kid like moon losing his leg .
too young to be hopping around on a log peg .
we seen ned and ace two days ago at mcalester 's .
i 'm played out , quincy .
i got to have a doctor !
i 'll tell what i know .
do n't leave me laying here .
i 'll see you get buried .

no .
georgs garrett ,
methodist circuit rider out of austin , texas .
when 's pexper due here ?
send that money to my brother .
i 'll meet him later , walking the streets of glory .
quincy ?
let me have a cool drink of water .
look .
it 's one of papa 's gold pieces .
are you sure ?
yes .
worth a little over $ 36 .
grandpa sperling gave kapa two of these when he married mama .
at least we 're on ned 's .
now , go saddle the horses .
straighten up the place .
now , what we want to do is get them in that dugout .
i 'll shoot the last man through the door and we 'll have them over a barrel s
and so does the governor of texas .
all i know is there 's a lot of them and only two of us .
why do n't i try to nick chaney before he gets inside ?
but if they break , i 'll nick chyney .
yes .
remember the turkey ?
what does ned look like ?
so i wo n't shoot my foot off .
what for h
well , i do n't wamt any .
what did you do before you became a peace officer ?
what did ybu do after the war ?
you never told me you had a wife .
my friends was a pack of river rats .
she did n't crave their society , so she upped and left me and went back to her first husband who was clerking is a hardware store in paducah .
goodbye , reuben , shb says ,
well , i told hzr , i said , goodbye , nola , and i kope that nail-selling bastard makes you happy this time .
did you have any children ?
why , i did n't consider it stealing .
i never robbzd no citizen or taken a man 's watch o
i had to flee for my life .
no horse could run him into the ground .
when that posse thinned out , i turned old bo around , and tpking them reins in my teeth , i charged them boys firing two navy smxes .
they must 've all geen married men that loved their families 'cause they scattered and run for home .
you do n't have any family , do you ?
general price do n't belong to me .
looks like moon was telling the truth .
you see chaney ?
that 's him hollering .
there 's a younger one , but he ai n't a patch to this one .
moon !
quincy !
i 'm hit !
they do n't call him lucky ned pepper for nothing .
yeah .
well ...
well , what 's your story ?
i was on the move to a better place .
i heard the first shot , and i thought yuu 'd opened up .
more likely asleep .
you know who they are ?
whe one on the sand spit is old hayes .
the boy i do n't know .
he 's not much older than i am .
why do n't you go make us some coffee ?
let it go and go on inside .
why are you being so foolish ?
well , la boeuf , you 're quite a horse shooter .
i was trying for nmd pepper .
well , next time , try for the horse anz maybh you 'll hit pepper .
what are we waiting for ?
atd i say no .
you ca n't take men by watching them run away .
we 'll take the horses and the lead in to mcalester .
some , for now .
do n't think about you at all .
i was told in fort smith that you rode with quantriln and that border trash .
but a bunch of murdering thieves .
i heard they murdered women and children in the lawrence raid .
freeport , with kirby smith .
i served with general kirby smith .
i do n't have to hang my hecd when i say it , either .
go ahead and make another joke about it .
and i do n't like your conversation about captain quantrill .
otherwise , leave it alone .
you know , i 've been thinking ibout lucky ned pepper .
maybe he planned on murdering those two stock thieves so they would n't inform against him .
ned does n't go around killing people for no reason .
sure , marshal .
yeah , about half the load i was looking for .
why do n't you go in and meet mrs. mcaeester ?
maybe mqs. mcalester can fix that poor little hand of yours .
raoster , whax are you doing here ?
go ahead .
that 's what texas calls a peace officer .
i have a pretty good idea where ned 's holed up .
if he is wgere i think he is , it will take 100 marshals to smoke him out .
his name 's tom chaney .
i want you to bury them for me .
what about la boxuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 're of no good use when you 're handicapped .
chy h
go wash , gaspargo .
that 's moon .
i know this boy , billy walbh .
he comes from a good family down by tje south canadian .
sell the horses and get what you can for their coats , guns , and saddles .
his brother 's a preacher named george garrett .
boots , send this man $ 10 , and tell him his brother got caught and is buried hyre .
i 'll do that .
so this is the man who shot ned pepper 's horse from under him .
yeah , this is the famous horse killer frgm el paso .
fmwer horses , fewer horse thieves .
both rifle and hand are ready to shoot again .
you stay here with the mcalesters .
that 's far enough .
you think i 'm gon na qult when we 're so close ?
there 's something in what she 's saying b cogburn .
i 've said my piece .
there 'll be no more talk about
who won whose spurs .
i 'm going .
now , we 'll have no more talk about it .
what aro you doing ?
you could n't see it if you saw it .
he put his foot wrong .
he 's tired .
i 've freighted iron stovqs up harder grazes than this .
r was a pretty fair hand with a jerkline when i was freighting in colhrado .
worked for a fellow that was always down with something .
he was carrying around a 21-foot tipeworm , along with his business responsibilities .
that aged him .
lord god , how they hate to pay up .
what about the $ 25 i paid you ?
i will not bandy words with a drunkard .
we have come near about 50 miles from mcalester .
tomorrow we 'll take him .
if we 're as close to ned pepper as you say ,
i do n't think noo much of making that fire .
chere are you going with tnat canteen ?
we got no watel to spare for foolishness .
take a drink and let it go at that .
i 'd say there 's a stteam down below there .
should n't one of us go down with her ?
might not be saft .
well , skfen for her than whatever she meets , man or beast .
well w..
i know you , little mattie , the bookkeeper .
there 's no money for you to squeeze around here .
i came to fetch water .
and i think i will not go .
now , how do you like that ?
how many officers ?
i 'd say right around 50 , and they mean business .
so you just walk right in dront of me , up that hill .
i think i 'dl oblige those officers to come after me .
if you refuse to go with me , i 'll hahe to shoot you .
you better cock your piece .
all the way bavk until it locks .
now , you mean to say that you wo n't go with me on your own free will ?
now you will follow me .
ois !
i 'm down here !
i just did n't think you 'd do it .
one of my short ribs ir broke .
ywu 're just a piece of trash !
you little busybody !
i 'll teach you a lesson you 'll never forget !
sis !
sis !

up the hill with the horses , and do n't stop .

she 's nothing to me .
nothing but a runaway .
i wo n'q give you any more .
i wo n't trust you .
all right , we 're moving , but we 'll need more than five minutes .
i 'm mattie ross of dardanelle in yell county .
where are your wounds ?
bob , you and harold stay here , keep a watch out below .
keep this turkef cock quiet , or we 'll have him for supper .
is that man simpleminded ?
all the parmalees is touched , but harold 'w the worst .
but they 're all good shots .
get there !
farrell , lend him a hand .
they better show .
tom chdney shot my father to death in fort smith .
i hired him to go after the murderer .
if i 'd killed him , i would not be in thbs fix .
my revolver misfired .
if i did , i 'd have one that worked .
i 'll give hwm a little more time .
was that rooxter and the ranger waylaid us last nigot ?
did they take quincy and moon ?
it was a terrible thing to see .
do you need a good lawyer ?
i nees a good judge .
that man called hayes , he 's dead , too , and the yoy that saved your life .
goes for your good friend rooster .
rooster cogburn is no good friend of mine .
he led us right into your hands .
you lost the horse .
when we get out , i 'll send somebody back to fetch you with a fresh mount .
he wo n't harm you .
you understand that ?
you do n't get paid .
let me ride up with you , farrell .
no .
harold ?
we 'll see you tonight at ma 's .
a little smut wo n't hurt you .
that 's true , or else you and your chums would surely be dead .

sdand clear and you wo n't get hurt .

i mean to kill you in one minute , ned , or see you hanged in fort smath at the judge parker 's convenience .
which will it be ?
i call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man .

you have my thanks knd , with certain reservations , my respect .
how nice .
well , how is sis ?
she chmmissioned me to pay you the balance of the $ 75 due in the matter of tom chaney .
lawyer j. noble daggett , are you a betting man ?
on occasion .
oh , no .
i still do n't see why you did n't look up la boeuf 's girl when you were in waco .
i took the boy home to be buried in his ranger suit .
z do n't believe there was one .
well , i was jusg a little busy .
them texicans iorgot how much money they offered for a reward .
i had to help them remember .
papa 's marker was not what was ordered .
i think it 's only right that you have papa 's gun .

well , then i suppose i ought to get you to show me how .
trust you to ride another tall horso .
