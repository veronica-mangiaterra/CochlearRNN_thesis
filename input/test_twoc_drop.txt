tat poor , poor girl 
daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbed by rumors that you plan to take our campus an costruct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely he would n't .
not even mr. hawk .
but he 's an alumnu .
m dear girl , our esteemed alumnus made an extremely arge loan o the college .
that loan is overdue , and mr. haw has us , if you 'll forgive a pertinent expession , over a barrel .
i 'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would be convenient to you .
i shall make msef available .
psst !
howeve , mr. hawk ...
do n't e angry .
i 'm sorr i missed the wedding again .
look , i could n't hel it .
go .
i hit y head .
i was knocked out .
daggett :
go .
et out .
look , he most wonderful thing happened .
wait till you hear .
look .
flubber .
i shal make myself aailable at any time .
... of the greatest importance .
o , make that of the mot supreme importance .
brainard :
flubber .
flubber 
flubber .
oh .
good morning , sir .
i have the most wonderful thing to tell you .
the mos wonderful hing you can tell me is goodbye .
this way .
just a minute .
anything you say would be superfluous .
daggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasat surprise .
i , too , have been wanting to chat about our loan .
brainar !
yeah , that ' right  pop .
do you know that his man fluned my boy ?
may i remind you it was hawk brains that founded this ton ?
i wish i could show you his examination paper .
not only di he miss every answer , he misspelled the name of the college .
o you mind ?
this means my boy ca n't play in he big game tonight aains rutland .
flunking your star player .
a makeup exam .
but he cou n't be bothered .
so he 's ineligile .
none of your vague promises about lending money is going to change that .
mr. hawk has alreay loaned the moey .
professor , i rejoice in your sese of ethics .
but do you mind terribly if i spea for myef ?
mr. hawk .
hold it .
i 'd like to discuss our loan .
and you might bring some of those principles of yours and see how much they 're wort i cold cash !
come on , bifer .
get me the file on weathy alumni marked emergency .
we have some letters to write .
yes , sir .
then you 'll understand why i missed the edding 
all riht , go ahead .
i 'd like hat .
for once i would really like to undestand .
like most things that seem complicated , it was actually quie simple .
do you kno what that residue was ?
no .
well , it 's been thrilling .
betsy , never in my wildest dream did i hope to find a compound whose configuration is uch that the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a change in te configuration .
ut they at in a direction opposite that of the force which riggeed the change .
yes !
now that i clearly understand what happened to my wedding , will you excuse me ?
president daggett and i have some iportant wok .
it could be worth millions .
do me a persoal favor .
go bounce you ball somewhere ele .
we ll talk it out tonight .
i 'll pick you up or the game .
you 're kidding , are n't you ?
about closing the college and turning the grounds into a housing tract ?
they 're all in the same boat .
te little man is gon na get squashed .
but you graduated from edfiel .
it 's your collee .
so what do you want ?
some total stranger o close it dow ?
is n't there something you could do ?
give them some more time on the loan or something .

thisis an enorously energetic , complex syte , and different agencies have dierent habits and diferent pattern .
but as a species , we 've had conspiracy theories from the very beginning .
oneof themost enduring conspiracy theories tha surround the office of the
president first took root in 1947 , whe the u.s. military reported that an alien spaceship had crash-lande outside
roswell , new mexico .
i mean , you drie on a lon , long dir road , ad there are ground sensors in that road , so that base security know hat you 're coming .
eventually you arrive a just really at a series of signs -- there 's not really een a clearly-defined border -- and that 's the poin that ou do n't want to go beyond .
there are contractor that show up in pickup truc , and they kind of watch ou and surveil you .

i mean , there are people ou there , uh , that really believe that there are these aliens .
and we literally spent soe time looking at this , ut there wa nothing conclusive that came of it .
lichtman :
intruth , though , the reason why there 's o much secrecy about area 51 is , that is where the air force evelos it most secret ad sensitive planes , including its high-fying surveillance planes ad the stealth fighters .
but , hey , there are plenty of people who believe that 's an elaborate cover-up for a storehouse of an alien ship , alien bodies , ad maybe even live aliens .

theproblemwith putting that kind of information together in one journal is that it an be stole , copied , ompromised .
i 'd be very nervous i i were the president and i knew some other people had acess to that .
gingrich 
but we keep lots of ecets .
e keep an amaing number of secrets .
i have my doubts that there is such a book .
presidentsthemselves cerainly keep secrets .
it 's not even power , per se .
it 's information .
and those that do n't have , are n't .
one thing is certain :
i dsaythat there are thigs that george
bush 41 and i know that not too man other people know .
gezora , ganime , kamoeba
the progress of science is endless .
so is the dream of man to expore space .
helios 7 , te new unmanned rocket to explore jupiter .
its mission is to ly 600 million kiometers , gathe data and return in about three and a half years .
earth ores me .
are you dreaming ?
you could nt get an pictures , so you 're trying to cover up .
wait a minute .
wake up , boy .
if you think you are awake , do n't bother me .
fly to brazil again , or no jo 
mae up your mind .
if i ake pictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell tem to another publisher .
to take pictures of you ?
no deal 
i 'm not about taking pictures of women .
no .
island ?
yes .
selgio island .
it 's located between hawaii and te marianas .
only eigty inhabitants .
it ' like it has fallen behind the time .
an island in the sun , surrounded by coral reefs tha 's selgio .
we 've invested a lot of money in it .
once this plan has materialized , the world will be stunned .
you want me to take publicity pictures ?
that 's right .
a single piture can impress people .
i refuse .
but ...
please .
it 's been a lon time .
yeah .
we worked together on the series , mysteries of japa .
i see .
remember ?
monsters ?
yes .
i thought you 'd be happy to go thee .
well , i do n't believe monsters exis unless i see one , but they might ...
doctor , is it here on this map 
yes , selgio island is there .
you 're right .
the spot you marke .
no , this is nt the mark for selgio island .
what ?
selgio island
fishing is prohibited in that area .
that 's why it 's good .
the naties ere would n't like us to violate it .
who would believe that ?
but they 're seriou about it .
every accident that happens at sea , they thik the monster did it .
that means more fish for us .
te folks coming from toyo ...
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's just a current of cold water .
really ?
loo !
yokoyama !
sakura !
ombo !
you were right !
yokoyama , true ?
yes , rico .
gezora is anry .
so , you really beieve the monsters exist ?
yes , i d like to be friends with them .
you could be a good riter .
and it lands in the bacyard of prehistoric monsters .
enjoying yourseves ?
sure .

yes .
i have n't had a chance to talk to you .
makoto oata , anthropologist
let 's e friends .
this is where you are .
there was an accident on the island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
his partne , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it 's interesting .
it 's a beautiful island .
it 's eautiul beause nature is intact here .
i know .
do n't make fun of ezora .
do the natives here speak japanese ?
i see .
fortuately they 're fond of japanese .
mr. yokoyama is suposed to meet us here .
rico , why are n't our people around ?
i 'll find mr. yokoyama .
rico 
all right .
let 's take a rest .
he 'll be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the natives would give me lodging .
the schedule for reseach of selgio island
i think it 'll be difficult to esearch the entire iland in a week 
riht , we have to take pictures of undersea life , too .
over here !
the thought makes me shudder .
do n't give me that .
your firm sent us ere .
no !
it reads our hearts by telepathy .
you saw it killed sakura ?
sop it !
hey !
i 'l drive .
that was some scream .
i thought it was a monster .
the sea water .
look .
hu ?
what 's that ?
the light ?
this is terrible .
thi is a japanee watch .
it s sakura 's .
akura 's watch .
hey !
mr. yokoyama , how about other people ?
i 'm leaving this island !
mr. yokoyama !
leave me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you will die .
shut up !
i 'l go back to japan and warn te people do n't go o selgio island .
it 's hel on earth.
no , no !
shut up !
gezora !
finally we can eat .
where are they ?
gone 
mr. yokoama !
loo .
rico .
he 's alive .
come on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remember .
rico !
wait , he is cared of the light .
would you stop making joke ?
it 's not a joe .
it 's not a scratch or a bruise .
no , it looks like frostbite .
frostbite ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body temperature must be near zero .
you 're all suffering from montephobia like that man .
that 's right , where is mr. yokoyaa ?
plans for the selgio islad underwater hotel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
you forgot me ?
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if we can bring back his memory , we may be able to find out what happeed .
let 's go .

ight .
the island 's shaman , i think .
die , friens of the evil !
let 's go in he hut .
get a first-aid kit .
is he coscious ?
rico , rico 
there 's one good thing .
we re lucky to be able to see a live monster 
let 's dream of it .
o , i wo n't be abe to sleep .
octor , but what if the monster really lives in the sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come on .
i thin this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main character ?
let 's get thi straight .
what di you come here for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
sop !
our lives are more important .
we houldn t have hard feelings .
do n't worry 
you 're as mean as ever .
saki .
rico .
come !
i ca nt believe i 'm alive .
the moster is a squid .
te legendary geora is back to life .

i do n't kno .
m knowledge of biolog is useless .
i suspec he shaman .
wy are you so skeptical ?
he people here are erious .
not me 
ombo .
ombo .
everybody is going to die !
doctor !
you 're all right .
doctor , it 's just a monster squid .
it has the characteristics o a quid .
but ...
ca you all hat a squid ?
when the fire burnt it , the monster was upet .
any gasoline on this island ?
the company bought some , but it 's gone with that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
hat 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guns !
good .
good !
pour out the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire !
great !
gezora is burning !
here .
this will proect us .
i never imagined .
plenty of gasoline .
we 're safe even if it comes ack .
i 'm encouraged .
if i was only a simple giant squid we 'd be afe .
what does he mean ?
doctor !
docto , if it was n't a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say i it 's an incredible creature .
tell me the truh .
you know what the monster really is , do n't you ?
i 'm sorry .
terrific !
i 'll show you .
watch out 
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondered where he went .
he wants to escape .
it 's dangerous .
come back !
the monster ca n't get me !
we shoul evacuate .
go farther .
hurry .
hurry !
we are almost there .
hurr up .
i ca n't .
hury !
say here , okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
mr. kudo , mr. kuo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca n't be sure that we destroyed it completely .
why is it o quiet ?
makoo obata .
you are no longer an ordinar human being .
no use resisting .
abandon human emotions .
i will give you an important job .
you must find our formidable enemies all over the earth and anniilate them all .
sand up , obata .
tere s one here too .
yes ?
i 'll tell you what i tin .
and the giant squid we ought yeserday is alled kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size ha hanged .
all the principles o genetics and biology ca n't explain it .
i can thin of oly one possibility .
this crab is n't ganime .
the space creatures that came with helios 7 made the crab into a monster .
a a weapon o attack us .
you mean the space creature got into helios 7 in outer space some hundred-millions kilometer away from earth ?
if this creatue i highly developed , it may be able to live in a vacuum .
... and it may be able to alter its own ells and pass through the atoms of metal .
i see .
space creature o not we must destroy it .
we must tink of some way to fight 
i will marry rico .
e will have a weding tonight .
wedding ?
congratulations .
ico .
rico .
ico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
sai .
you recognize me ?
rico .
ood !
you had amneia for a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
yes , monster !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
bats ?
yes , bats came .
gezora ran away .
wh 
there were orpoises when we were in the ea ...
i got it !
hat is it ?
the space creaures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes , umans can hear soud waves up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porpoises emit 120000 cycles ultrasound ith which they use to guide themselves .
yes .
i gues space creatures hate it .
if we have bats , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bats live in caves .
yes , but they 'll come back to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bats !
there .
did the monster do this ?
i do n't know how , but nobod else could do it .
i thought we were safe , but ...
eve though they ae space creatures , they a n't ill all the bats on the island .
here too .
all right .
maybe all the bats are dead .
that ca nt be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 're safe now .
we can control some bats 
mr. obata !
of course 
the monster ca n't beat me .
what 's this ?
the monster is scare of bats .
great .
then let me sleep here too .
what are you doing , obata ?
it 's about time for the bas to move .
he went out .
wait !
doctor ...
you .
he 's not obata .
wy did you come to earth ?
we are the wanerers of pace .
we can exist only by livin off other foms of life .
what are you going to do with us ?
you know our weakness .
rico !
now we know enough about earth creatures .
before tey arrive , i must annihilate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see mankind perish like this .
even though you 'e a wretched spy , you 're still a human being .
a huan being !
kamoeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go of it !
et go of it !
i wo n't ...
obata .
do n't come .
do n't come near me !
pray !
that 's all we an do .
even if a man 's cels are take over , he has his soul .
man is more than a stuctue of cells .
every man has a soul .
his soul is fighting the space ceature .
they 've gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck !
i wish i had my camera .
wha happened to the monsters ?
even space ceatures 
mr. obata !
mr. obata !
obata killed the last space creature by killing himself .
r. obata .
tey must have seen the volcano erupt .
the united forces of earth creatures ...
porpoises , ats and en destroyed the invaders .
will the people believe this stoy ?
mmm !
hmm .
huh ?

an sign of chyna de vere ?
not yet .
you know , there 's some food .
you ust should n't see where it comes from .
did you know that pigs are very intelliget animal ?
and certain oliticians .
i do n't see connors ' truck anywhere .
let 's look in the barn .
if this i chyna de vere 's blood , we 're getting warmer .
looks like he ha a hobby stuffed animals .
why 's that ?
csi season07 episode22 leapin  lizards
this is a caeer first .
a little tip for you :
the ne mrsphillips does nt need to hea about this .
are you kidding me ?
come on , pretty girl , getta outta there , come on , girl !
i 'm so glad i 'm a vegetarian .
well , no oe has seen or heard from te victim ' husband , so ...
ome on , sweetie .
i hink the fat one likes you .
they always do .
we went to connors ' ranch ecause a week ago , chyna de vere went missing .
she just separated from her husband , got her own place .
this is a large section of her living room carpet .
well , it 's certainly enough blood to sugget foul play .
connors ' name did n't come up .
ho about the usband 's ?
and he 's still missing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , distinct blood drop , not from the victim , not from the husband .
we also found soi trace , identified as scheelite , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim 's usband .
looks lie armageddon came o a thursday .
i 'm not sure there 's intelligent ie on this planet .
i 'll et started .
i already ent throuh this a week ago .
you know , you 're right .
yeah , not my boyriend , my friend .
she was n't a member of your cub ?
if she was , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , the club 's getting smaller and saller by the minute .
you 're already an acessory to one murder .
if hank connors killed chyna 's husband , too .
o  is that what you tink happened ?
you know , this ca work in your favor with he d.a .
i m not really worried about that .
adam and eve ere not only the first human on the earth , they were bait ...
for intelligent life forms elsewere in the cosmos .
but why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's gre sander .
you 're not touching me .
well  ma'am , this is standard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just going to sab the inside of ..
not !
calm down .
get him away from ...
calm down .
calm down .
no !
that bitch bit e .
i got y saple .
these visitors were highly aanced and did not appear i human for .
people of the serpents ..
of course it did .
it as ot human .
not of this earth .
ufo 's , alien abduction ...
looks ike hannon was a player .
reptiles ..
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patick ad the snakes of ireand .
what is this ?
so connors cut off her head because he though he was a serpent from outer space ?
catherine ..
check this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chillin ' in cabo .
i 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , hello , xena .
oh , bo .
duct tae ?
yeah , he used it o cose up the laceration from a sharp fore perimortem wound .
could that be the fatal wound ?
give me the rest of he body and i can tell you .
almost three inches , smooth-edge blade ...
you know , caterine found ...
why would anybody want o taxidermy a human head ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our guy had to separate the head fro the body .
for that , he used a serrated-edge knife .
heartwarming .
yeah , so then .. he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle .
then he taed the skin to preserve it 
hydrate it with a borax and water solution to eep he bugs off .
popped in two glas eyes , and then ... and he 's got the best-looking wall mount in the neighborhoo .
yeah , i 'll ge it over to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a gu on the fencing eam .
his tighs were incredible .
yes , the , uh , tip has been wiped clean .
gives us a height or a white female of 5 ' 6 .
ow about for a male ?
did you measure the ead of the femur ?
41 points ...
poit five millimeters .
it 's a female .
this little piggy had cyna .
yeah .
hey , greg .
no .
i 'm having a prety ad year .
voilà !
wat could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
good .
come here , take a look a this .
hey , is n't that , uh ..
yeah .
you can see dick cheney , al gore , all nine supreme court justices shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , most members of congress
hey , did shannon turner have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
cats are a natural enemy of reptiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found a shannon turner 's made the tool marks on he skull 
shannon 's prints were all over the handle .
and the partials on the blade , above the hilt ..
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
yeah , but brass interviewed her last week .
she id n't have any visible cuts .
warrik ?
come at me with a sword .
all righ , so i push back hard enough ... bang ou on the nose .
brass would n't have seen that .
but what i do n't understand is if shanno turer and hak connors really believed in a reptilian conspiray and they felt threateed by the political establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
whenever a playe uses a clu card at a table game , the floor man writes don what game you layed , whee you sat , what time you started , time ou quit .
this is the first time shannon use her card 
and the ealer is chyna .
looks like they 're best friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe chyna was her lucky harm .
she never walked away a winner .
i think she was gaining her trust .
talking her .
it 's not a crime o play blackjac .
you 're righ , it 's las vegas .
e found your blood in chyna 's apartment .
hen it was planted 
how should i know ?
look ... you killed chyna ,
and connors killed preston , because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you lied about knoing chyna , you going to lie about tis , too ?
his ells do n't die .
oh , 4,000 .
the new 50 .
preston is a great man .
he has the wisdom of the ages .
beyond your capacity to understand .
ms.turner ... was chyna a reptilian ?
the retilian athena .
is tha chyna de vere ?
tell me about this one .
is that you ?
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill you .
what ?
her husband .
she does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your ring .
i really , really hate you .
that would explain hy we found both ings in the ashes .
i found it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , and then he dome of the liver .
that 's your c.o.d .
yeah , pelvis is feae .
the femur 's he same length as the one the pigs were chomping on .
i 's her .
well , we 'll run this against connors ' gus .
then you better turn it of before they use the oxygen destroyer on him .
i do 't know why i find it so difficult to express my feelings to ou .
i can see you as vividly as if you were here with me .
as shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnet 47 , thyself away art present still with me ;
for thou not farther than my thoughts cans move , and i am still with hem , and they ith hee .
or , if they sleep  thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye 's delight .
you 're supposed o let me get these this on .
i do n't know .
you mean , like me and you , ab ?
jim .
i got a call from a passing motorist .
preston de vere ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a aptive , eld against m will .
from wat the sherif tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skepticism .
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
o , so you were abucted before your wife was mising .
at are you trying to tel me ?
you do n't know you wife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no idea .
come on .
presto .
if she was so sweet , what were you doing chillin ' in abo ith shannon urner ?
well , you go your pictures on the coffee mug .
you better come up wit an alibi on planet earth of where you were he night your wife was killed .
that 's easy .
tere 's a woman , and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are victims ... and no one is istening to us .
we 're powerles against what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has anyone talked o shannon in the last couple of days ?
they 'e got her .
it 's like we 're witnessing some form of mass allucination .
you know , they thin the cops are part of this reptilian conpiracy as wel .
that 's why shannon attacked greg .
let 's try this again .
sory to interrupt .
do n't make eye conta with them .
please , we come in peace .
it 's all rigt .
got a warant to tow in clarissa niles ' car .
blue fluorescence is one of the roperties of scheeite .
which was found in the oil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same area .
have you looked inide yet ?
i as just about to .
preston was found naked , right ?
yeah , it 's a ecurent theme in tales of alien abduction .
so clarisa drove him out thee and he left is suff in her car .
that 's not all he left :
steam leaner .
just what every estranged husband needs to cean up his dead wife 's blood .
this case just came down to earth .
yes ,
we were asleep an suddenly the room turned very cold .
freezing .
i ...
come on , clarissa , you 're a smar woman , i mean , realy .
you ot way too much on the ball to fall for this con man .
he 's a brilliant man .
he saved my life .
it was cancer and he cured i .
he knows how to prevent human cells fro dying .
they 're , they 're radioactive .
it would put them out of business .
let me sow you something .
look at this .
he 's 42 .
he clais he 's a nutritionist .
he 's not .
and look .
they ever heard of him .
he has no plae of busies , no job 
he got shannon turner to kill his wife for him .
got you to give him money .
he never asked for it .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleepin so they can manipulate your thoughts .
you 're not only ancer-free , you 're free of eir control .
how am i ever going to be able to thank you ?
the evidence is all over your car .
he loved me .
if they were trying to clean up all the blood , they did a good job .
steam cleaner tested positive for blood , but there was n't eough for dna .
did you find anything ?
funny you should ask .
found a hair in the bruhes .
it 's on the left .
the one on the rigt i chya de vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleaner was completely wiped down  ould n't find any prints .
ut then i remembered this stoy about a ci down in l.a .
nobody could find any prints on a gas can from an arson , but he realized that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas .
and you kno wha 
he boke the case .
so whose prints are on the steam cleaner ?
i just got an afis hit :
reston de vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector of mankind .
cu off her head , she dies .
no probem .
it wa n't a reptilian conspiracy , ut i was a conspiracy .
men are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a long time for her o die .
you now , eery time i think about leaing this ob , a guy like you comes alog and reminds me why i ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus ad medusa , st.geoge and the dragon 
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
these ae acounts of battles for the survial of the human rae ,
a battle we will lose uless we stop killing one another and focus on the real enemies .
they are among us .

this was mgm 's scenic backdrop building where talented artists created their movie magic , an this is just one section of a huge painting re-creating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was originally 600 feet long and 60 feet high and wrapped aroud the entire inteior of mgm 's stage 15 .

charisse 
gene inspired a whole new generation of stars .
one of the brightest was a oung california girl named debbie reyolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary frances reynolds whe i entered the miss bubank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gowns created by the world-famous designer adrian wee par of the reatment .
as wel as makeup and hair departments that could accomlish any style imaginable .
a star like joan crawfod would sometimes have her look redeigned numerous times until i mathed the exact mood of the role she was to play .
you stepped out of a dream
you are too wonderful to be what you seem
could there be eyes like yours ?
honest and truly ?
you stepped out of a cloud
in 1941 , the glamour age had reached its zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone and apar out of a dream
safe in y heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream sequence to the song a lady loes in the film i ove melvin .
loves a penhouse where she 'll be content to tay
finds little gifts on her breakfast ray
but no and then pack and sail away
for a simple riviera holiday
reynolds :
now , at last , you can see our differing points of view .
she loves her dreams tied up with apron strings
just ittle pots and pan
and he ll be handsome well , more or les
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look nice oh , never mind the price
a lady loves beauoup i'aour
u first of all she loves to be secure
yet there is one vital thouht she will place above
all of the things i make mention of
and what is more a lady loves o live
and what is more a lady lives to love
thanks for the present of the silver-blue mink
thanks for the yacht a for the solid-gold sink
thanks a lot , but no tanks
reynold :
doloes gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of the power of the devastating female over the hapless male from it 's always fair weather .
gray :
thanks for he banks and or the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with oly one valentine
for i am just a faithful lassie
and there 's no gift however classy
by which this lassie can be a
thanks for losin ' your min
thank a lot , but no
no thanks
i do n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to do
reynolds :
in torch song , joan crawford made her final usical film as a fading legend performing in tropical makeup for the song two-faced woman .
the recording was n't a new one at mgm .
it 's been suggested that they may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
i ca n't help being a two-faced woman
a little bi of boldness a little bit of sweetess
a little bit of coldness a little bit of heates
do n't fal in love with a two-faced woan
got another lover under cover
that goes with the breeze
my dispositio
that 's why they call her a two-faced woma
a little bit of day
ad a little bit of bright
a litle bit of heaness
black and white wrong and right
they call me wo-faced woma
reynolds :
in the early 1940s hollywood began a fascination with things tropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported audiences awa from cold climates and the troubled imes of a world war .
many latin artists were recruited to add a authentic sound to these films .
one of te most popular was xavier cugat and his orchestra .
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the latin loer , driving female audiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got the kid of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just like was beatin in mine
bu you make it 109 and there is moe to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reynolds :
like this before
reynolds :
one ofthe performers at m whom i amire the most was the legendary lena horne .
or when
for the first ie
seem to be hapening again
it was a long time ago i stood in this vey spot and recorded that lovely song .
when i first alked onto tis recording stage in 1942 i looked pretty much as it does today .
i reore all of te music for my movies here and it is still considered hollywood 's greatest recording stage .
i never felt like i really belonged in hollywood .
so i usually just came on , sang a song and made a quick exit .
just one of those craz thigs
yeah , i got to sing a great coe porte une in a featured appearance but at i really wanted was to be give an acting role in the movies .
just one of those fabulous flights
if we thougt a bit of the end of it
we 'd have been aware tha our love affair
was too hot not to cool down
here 's hoping e meet now and then
ut it was just
said that gal , du barry
ai n't i the truth ?
in 1943 , i ot to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin in the sky .
love is a ripping ' brook
you got to bait your hook
rise and shine
and cast your line
ai nt it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truth ?
it 's the tuth
te truth
horne :
in 1946 , i played the role of julie in a excerpt from show boat in till the cloud rol by .
i was being considered for e part for the 1951 version of show boat but the production code office had banned interracial omance on the screen .
so the tudio gave the part to my good friend ava gardner .
te studio had ava rehearse singing the role to e recorings that i had made hoping to get the art which annoyed us both .
gardner :
fish got to swim , birds got to ly
ca n't help lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
tough ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did n't get the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but when he comes back
that day is fine
as late as can be
ca n't help
horne :
i was not the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get your gun , betty hutton was a big hit as annie oakey .
judy garland had begun filming the role and completed two numbers when she suffered a beakdown and had to be replaced .
retrieved at last from the mgm film vaults is judy 's version of i 'm an indian too .

a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an idian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an honest injun india
i 'm an idian , too
olks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see , whaever conflicts judy struggled with as a person she alas came through as an entertainer .
garland :
when you re out with a feller in the ale moonlight
you do nt have to look in a book to fin
what he hinks of the moon and what is on his mind
but they cash them jut the same
grandpa ick was alwas sick
he just died at 93

hore :

garland :

judy garlan and i grew up together at mgm and omleted high chool between long days of shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pitures together an even when we worked separately we turned to each oher for friendship and encouragement .
we were the very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her ver much .

rooney :

grownups ignore me

rooney :
the wizard of oz wa to beome the most widely seen motion picture of al time and jud 's wonerful performance in the picture earned her a special academy award which i was lucky enough to present to her .

somewhere over the rainbow

rooney :

i was on the committee that made the ollection .
£5 was subscribed .

i expeded it on this 
a little extra toen i thought ou might fancy .
i saw it during easter week in a little window in glasgow , a cuiosity shop .
buy me for professor lindenbrook .

it 's a scholar 's hoice .
what are you eating tonight 
this being tuesday , i 'm not eating .
i find it very healthy to eat only every oter night .

i 'm entertaining some of the faculty .
i do not think i could .
what 's the matter with you ?
is it those frayed cuffs that worry you ?
eight oclock sharp .
yes , sir oliver .
eight o'clock .
lava .
i swear there 's something inside .
there 's uncle now , kirsty .
i thought i was ucle oliver .
i want it understood that not a single sitch i 'm wearing belongs to me .
i 'm early , but i trust i 'm not too ealy .
where is he ?
e 's never been late like this never .
i do n't ow , but , to return to the subject of my clothes , they 're my classmate 's , the young laird of glendarach .
when i retured , my cothes had been confiscated and these substituted .
you 've explained your agnificence .
here will be one more uest .
what do ou exect wen it takes a command from my uncle to bing you to this house ?
two years more i have to stuy for my master 's degree .
then four years more as a laboratory assistant .
they 're aying for my schooling .
how like a scotsman .
i now one whose purse was not empty  because he did n't even have a purse .
do you kow what he said ?
miss jenny , the time of poety is over 
if this is true , alec mceen , what are you doing with your hand on my knee ?
now you just wait in there .
kirsty , i 'll set the extra place .
is there omething you want ?

there ' a key stuck .
# so deep in ove am i
# that i will love you still , my dear
# till all the seas go dry , my love

# thoug it were ten thouand mile
yes , we were .

no .
it 's just about the limit now , sir oliver .
i gave no permission for visitors .
good lad .
if you do n't come now , the goose will be ...
aye , and without a pause for lunch or tea .
now then , from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged ?
mount etna ?
very close .
the lipari island group off the coast of italy .
that 's exactly what stuped me .
but that would be icelandic peridotite .
recisely .
there 's a iece chiped off .
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
when i saw this , i stopped chipping .
looks like a letter or soe notches .
three notches made by the hand of man .
what ' your conclusion ?
science does not jump to conclusions 
we 're going to melt off the crust of lava .
mr paisey .
not too fat , you know .
i shall write to proessor goetaborg of stockholm about this .
he 's the leading authority on volcanoes .
four hours ?
jenn !
are you al right ?
that was entirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't know how it could have appened .
mr paisley , b your slip you 've rendered an inestimable service to science .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not ony looks like it is a plumb bob .
can you make ou what it sas , professor ?
it 's in some nordic tongue .
erhaps it was a dying hand .
ik ?
posibly .
loo at this side , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ...
arne saknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable  but it must be true .
a man took some tools and ent whee no human being has ever et foot .
into the interior of the earth , alone .
te laughter topped when he disappeared , ever to be heard from .
until tonight .
get out of here , woman 
i did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shouting at me , sir oliver .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you have n't slet !
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncle oliver .
no answer !
whee is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to get here from stockholm ?
anwer the bell .
did it ring ?
callers , calers .
i 'm involve in something important .
more important than our university ?
what does the name arne saknussem mean o you , gentlemen ?
just a second .
his real ame rests on his study of volcanoes .
out of a volcano came this message from him .
it lay unoticed for 100 yea , was probably picked up b some peasant , athered dut in a curiosity shop till it came to me .
whoever decends into the crater of sneffes yocul can reach the enter of the earth .
are saknussem .
the center of the earth ?
an extinct volcano in ieland .
but , oliver , thi is sheer fantasy .
you have n't heard all of it .
at sunrise on the last day of may the mountain scataris will point the path 
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scartaris ?
it 's a mountain peak near the volcano .
but this is a student 's hoax .
let 's not take that tone .
more than anything , you must consult other experts .
and i 've writte to he foremost authority in europe .
more eminent still .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and wha does he say 
unfortunately i 've not yet received his reply .
i suggest e relax on the mater until your famous coresponden sees fit to answer you .
and in the meantime we could do with a cup of tea 
think whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
ust his moment , sir olier .
look .
well , he ' got his letter from stockholm .
did you see the shine in his eyes ?
there 'll never be a better moment to tell him about our feelings for eah other .
he 'll say yes almost inadvertently .
what if he says o advertently ?
you wait and see how firm my voice can be when i speak of you .
blast and damn !
bad news , sir ?
his disappearance follows closely the date my comunication must have reached him .
or too importan .
mcewen , go directly to the harbor .
olive , cam down .
you heard saknusem 's message .
oliver , you 're seriouly ill .
i am seriously well .
hat are you waiting for ?
i old you to hurry .
if you 'll excuse me , i must star pain .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take time for his , sir .
what are you so urgent about ?
this is the most urgent moment of my life .
i have to be in iceland .
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturally .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i go
i wish i could sing loud enough for jenny to hear me .
it is a bit painful to leave her on the firt day of our engagement .
to come back to her as a world-famous scientist is not to be sneezed at .
come here .
i nelected to tell you , sir .
wel , you 'll get over that after the first million fathoms or so .
he 's been surveying here .
your revered colleague from stockholm .
he is n't wasting any time .
do you think he 's already gone don ?
no .
buy all the rope availale .
you think we can prepare it all so quickly ?
what 's that you 're taking 
jenny 's farewell gift .
back to my hotel .
já , professor goetaborg .
no , no , thank you .
nobody carries a soldier 's weapons .
and take your time .
these instruments are delicate .

where are we ?
how did you get here ?
i do n't know .

did you see who did it ?
no .
he 's a criminal .
very likely he 's dreamed of such a project .
hush .
some tapping .
there 's not a soul around .
i is n't sunday .
the fishing fleet is going out for the first summer haul .
you mean the hops are closed ?
but every piece of rope , every lamp , everything we 'd need was sold .
to professor goetaborg .
he 's staying in he very inn where we have our rooms .
a fellow prisoner , do you suppose ?
it ' a code .

perhaps it 's in icelandic .
my esteemed friend , whoever you are , let me introduce myself

early in the morning he went o the mountain .

i did n't realize the sakussem family stil existed .
they saw each other every day .
i suggest that you have an autopsy performed imediately .
neither he nor i could suspect there was a third party wo would stop a nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deepy distressed by your husband 's death , and i fuly undertand your feelings .
however  i ust ask you one question .
how do you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off our hands .
your expeition ?
i have a right to tat equipment and i claim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from me .
tat is a lie .
madam ...
incredile enouter .
a saknussem descendant turns up acts as if he were king of volcaoes .
tries to orce me to surrender his ancestor 's secret .
saknussem called again .
new complication .
must fight hi somehow .
young man , would you come here a moment , please ?
who are those for ?
that 's a begining .
wat about lamps ?
lamps 
put me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in iceland ?
but i ish to apologize to you in plain english .
i went through my husband 's diary , and some of his remarks led me to believe i id you an injustice .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't know .
do n't give it another tought .
i sha n't .
began and tat 's all it has done .
sir oliver , this orning you asked me for these .
if you still want them , they 're yours .
wil you say that again ?
madam .
my husband had these boots made speciall .
i hope they fit you .
i told you man to order some for me immediately .
good , good .
why would you need boots like this ?
o n't say it .
natuall , i 'm coming along .
that 's why i 'm givig you all of this .
it 's a condition .
i thought you understood .
you did n't mention any condiio .
then i do now .
whom di you intend to take along , besides this young man ?
then i 'll be very useful .
he does n't understand a word of english .
we re not contemplating a stroll down piccadil or the champs élysées 
professor lindenbrook , i have just los my husband .
te police require your presence for the investigation into the deat .
but , madam , quite apart from the appalling danger , think of the inconvenience .
the lac of privacy .
in short , you o n't want all of this .
i may be mad on the subject of this journey , but i am not stupid !
to burden myself with a feale is heer tupidity !
i may have been a diturbance to men  never a burden .
you 'll sleep where we sleep , eat what we eat and wash when we ash .
then you acept my proposition .
professor , look 
ow we descend into oblivion or .. we enter the great ook of history .
carla goetaborg .
aexander mcewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
ans and who ?
professor !
professor !
hans is tyin the rope on her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you have told hi that ?
and then there 's always the blessed chance the rope ay break .
are you all rigt , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicious .
if only you could see your face .
you do .
perhap thi is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no other way to continue .
eureka !
thank you .
now then , a general summary .
a :
b :
as my husband 's charts indicated .
onward .
and let 's have some music .
the last news was that they went up mount sneffels with some heaily laden donkeys .
yes ?
ad then the animals came down without their packs .
oliver s lindenbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
wat 's i ?
a woman !
a light tremor , comin from undefied regions .
le us proceed .
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us .
the three notches of arne saknussem .
hat does that mean ?
look .
we might have aken any one of these channels .
but our great colleague maketh a path for our feet .
let us have tea .
with a double ration of raisins .
may i comb my air firt , professor ?
ladies on the lef  gentlemen on the right .
what is it , maam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmare , we 'd have made diffeent sleeping arrangements .
someone is walking up there .
human footstep .
the hearing of al women is extremely acute .
my wife used to hear rats in the atti , usually the nights before i had an important lecture .
alec , go up and find out .
they need rest .
moreover , it was stiulated that i give the orders .
there 's no need to use tat patient voice with me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lidenbrook , i am a member of this expedition , and as such i itend to report any observation i make .
alec .
put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i m right here .
conceal these marks completely .
i 'll give them some new ones .
starting from an estimated deph of 129km , limestone ormation continues .
here are the three notches again .
good .
let 's see .
one heas 220º south-southwest , the other 160º south-southeas .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quite .
wha 's he sayin ?
hans i ondering about the ultimate goal of our expedition .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well , why does man freeze to death trying to reach the north pole ?
once a question has arise in the human brain  the aswer must be found if it takes 100 years .
1000 years .
let 's hea you render that io a few well-choen icelandic words .
why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries ?
are you all right ?
can you unhook yourself ?
grab his and .
neve mind about that .
how is it possible ?
this way was clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure .
this has been here sine the beginning of time .
i as not in a osition to observe it scientiically .
ut where ?
we re supposed to stay together .
tricked into the wrong tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam ... heard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she 's saying it .
we must return .
why ?
you know that .
but if there is a madman loose ...
he 's against all of us .
against the very conep of this journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to where alec fell .
but it 's not on our route .
if we 're to go ahead , we have o time for detour .
then you wait here .
madam , now that he boy has gone and hans does n't understand english ,
i 'm blushing already .
professor !
yes , i thought so .
alec !
i 've got to take a specimen of this back o edinburgh , if it 's the last thing i do .
unique .
here the devil is he ?
it s a blind alley !
keep back !
hans !
good god !
that 's it .
praise the lord 
alec .
professor !
hello !
professor !
professor !
here i am !
sat .
professor .
professor , you ca n't go o this wa .
i 've ept track of te passage of days .
you have n't .
we 'll try the cross-channel over there .
you wo n't find him there .
i 've got to find him .
i 'm responsible .
i can see that this is a recent break .
if you 're down there , give us a sign !
alec , listen carefully .
hen the ecoes stop , you must try to answer .
pick up a pebble and scratch the rock .
just give us a sign .
how can i live with myself ?
you must continue with what you started .
it was his project as much as it was yours .
we will proceed 
down there , food and water .
so you 've lost your friends ?
just as well .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of lace here .
i 'm in a hurry .
o steal the professor 's project ?
you need me as much as i need you .
you found me 
my friends could find me too .
very well .
ou 'll carry it with one arm , not to !
it 's a multiple echo  reverberating through the rock chambers .
the last echo will give us the direction 
alec .
alec .
alec !
profesor .
where was he ?
i did n't think he 'd shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers here .
you are also the murdeer of my husband .
e would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of our great anestor , put down that preposteous gun .
you 're not going o listen to a murderer ?
neer interrut a murdere , madam .
i resent that boureois classification .
you have my word of honor .
give me your had on that .
a bourgeois trick .
so sorry 
we have to hold court .
guilty .
guilty .
then the mandatory sentece is death .
we will follow the route marked by te notches .
o , o , no , no , no .
i can carry something with my le hand .
you can carry yourself for a couple of days .
that ' all we can expect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been loyal to the saknussems for generations and , well , he can not touch the gun .
tis is contemp of court .
no , no , professor ...
i mean , sir oliver .
you mus n't look at me .
oh , no .
you ... you could nt consider for a moment hat i could do it .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weeks you 've been denying your sex , and now you fall bak on it .
i would say the natural exeutioner would e the leade of the expedition .
we 're much too civilized o ...
what do you propose ?
drag him with u ?
stop fidding with those lamps .
the lamps are giving ou .
to save wha we can , i insist that we leave these regions at once .
you insit ?
wha 's the harm ?
the harm is , adam , that he 's asting a lamp .
madam , make a final note , while you 've sill light enough to write by .
et me , madam .
this may be our last entry .
hans and i can cut some rope into some torches 
what puzzles me is that te three notches o old arne saknussem still keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not requie a lamp .
from here on neither do you , si oliver .
yes , just switch it off .
why  it 's miraculous !
look at this .
what is it , sir ?
light without heat .
a cool  chemical ligh .
the same principe is involved here .
256th day .
the phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbook expedition , you 've written mcewen expedition ?
may i remind you that months ago you gave me explicit orders to that effect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to be corrected by you incesantly .
you 're doing it with your looks , the inflection of your voice , the very posture of your body .
your entire presene is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had enough .
well , let me tell you , ou dried-up walnut of a man , if anyone 's had enough , it ' me .
it ' i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla goetaborg !
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ...
well  at least you know i have a teper .
and from now on alec will keep the charts .
alec !
why ca nt he stay around ?
a forest of mushrooms !
tey 're delicious .
to think they grew without sun tis far under the eart !
it ' tougher than leather .
it ' like an oak tree .
mushroom steak , mushroom soup , mushroom hash .
after some months of this , you 'll be smacking your lip at the thought of salt beef .
if we only knew how may more .
there 's no term to the work of a scientist .
but that 's not professor lindenbroo ' feeling .
and what is the name of the girl you ove ?
the girl you love ?
wat 's her name ?
jeny .
but why would you want to know that just now ?
dear alec !
professor ?
here 's some hot ushroom porridge for you , ir oliver .
i slept as i never slet in edinburgh .
i may move here permanently .
i do n't know .
is that madman still giving orders ?
the inute you fell asleep he went off in that direction , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want with all those ?
you 've come to ask me why i did n't take my res period .
i do n't sleep .
i hate those little slices of death .
it 's a sea .
it 's an ocean with waves and currents .
the fissures closed again .
it ' the prerogative of the discoverer .
i congratulae you .
a dimetodon !
if i had my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swim ?
no  thank god .
here .
i wonder if it 's cold where they are .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hand !
m watch !
save the instrumets .
my ing !
my wedding ring .
a fied of force that snatches gold away .
this is it !
this is it !
the junction of magnetic forces fom the north poe and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highess over there .
ater all , we did hit the center of the earth .
he wants to know where we go from here .
tired minds do 't plan wel .
sleep first , plan later .
oliver  te day may come when you 'd very much like to have that porridge .
is i incredible to you that i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , duck .
gertrude ?
gertrude ?
getrude !
gertrude !
hans !
why do you look at me like that ?
hans !
i needed food , so i took it .
stop this fool !
hans !
you ingrates !
what can you do without me ?
this is the sunken city .
after 5,000 years , behold a fragment of the lost atlanti .
all we know about it comes from the greek .
the floor o the sea opened up and wallowed the whole island of atlantis .
this must have been the market square .
eating .
well , we 've earned one thing about the inhabitant of atlantis .
stale bread .
we must speak to the baker .
maam !
madam !
já ?
exactly .
to think hat at a moment like this i 've no ad and pencil to record it all .
turn around  madam .
wha is it ?
look at that tibia .
you wo n't fin anything edible in there .
the chinese eat egs over 400 years old .
gunpowder .
i ' pointing soewhere .
of course !
this is the ay up .
a direct hatchwa to the surface .
and we can limb up .
let him venure 100 meters or so on reconnoiter .
the updraft ca n't carry him away .
now i 'd say let 's rol up our seeves if we had any .
we must ' hope or much .
this light wo nt stay with us .
i 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kaiai !
kai-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be walking in darness .
i wish i had better news .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward , straigher than the one we descended .
there 's an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs he passageway .
hans said only a landslide could ever move it .
if his hope had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , sir ?
the haversack arne saknussem 's haversack .
get it .
i guarantee that this 'll blow up he obsructing rock .
whether te surrounding rock will take the disturance lightly , i can ot guarantee .
let s get what protection we can .
dear god , ruler of heaven and earth ...
do n't set any limit to his real , laddie .
god o the universe , we are in thy meriful hands .
look out !
a moster !
let me go !
it 's an earthquake of unusual magnitude !
more likely it ' a volcanic eruption .
tromboli , italy .
the capsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous explosion .
rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sea .
dammi una mano .
piano .
piano .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrown from the altar stone .. long before we hit the water .
non si reoccupi .
i ' most grateful , ladies , ut my immediate need is not a ladder .
pataloons .
pantaloi .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
fello scots , if these shouts of yous express some pleasure that e 've returned alive , i thank you deely .
however , if they 're meant as praise for a successful scientist 
i must disclaim that honor .
a scientist who can not rove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
i have no records , no shred of evidence .
i will never embarrass this distinguished universit by asking that it take my word .
this , i know :
te spirit of man can not be stopped .
splendid , oliver .
professor , here 's someone who wants to say goodbye .
hans , old friend .
did you get your inuries when the volcano blew up , in he hot lava ?
he was in such a hurry leaving the church , he fell all the way down the steps .
after al that waiting .
it 's been no marriage for you at all .
you unerestimate alec .
i m takig the night train to london and then bak to stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a job to do here in einburgh .
i intend to write my memoir .
what ou eed is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictation .
no , none of that nonsense .
it 's one thig to spen one 's days and nights with a man under the earth , another under one oof in scotland .
what did i say ?
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
frau goetaborg !
yes ...
carla ...

i was talking to a colleague over at northern .
he was telling me about a young man --
who was it that helped ou ?
like i said , some loser in science club .
now , who wants to come up here
and finish charting these points on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
wih a crude cariature
you know ...
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and y stuents ave become openly hostile .
not to mention the dorm food .
well , the only fatherly advice i can give you about the science stuff
is just keep plugging away .
a tuto !
dad , you 're a genius !
genius ?
my first f .
your firs f .
what am i saying ?
but why are you so happy about getting your first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i gues they 'e go na kick e out of school
if i do nt get better grades .
and i would care because ...
you 're pretty ok 
ca n't you find anyone else ?
i mean , well , you were the firs one o my list .
maybe we could work something out .
ten i guess i should start pracicing .
oh , great .
just what i want o do after school ,
more schoo .
take it .
fine .
how nothing lasts forever
well , they 're wrong
yeah
you stood strong
you 've got the key to my heart
'cause i
it seems so long ago
when my world was upside-down
hey , ice ...
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you know , just to ay thanks and all .
tha 's good , is n't that ?
i mean , that 's what we 're supposed to be lisening to , right ?
thank you .
hey , so , what 's with the mueum ?
he 's the hockey coah over at orthern .
hey , dady !
i want you to meet ...
jason ...
i 'm just going to get my things here .
chaz ?
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i would have loved to have seen coach adison 's face .
i m glad he did n't see ine .
i had to smooth things over with claire , too .
that was 20 miles of rough road on the apology turnpike .
hey , do ?
you ever have a girlfriend ?
yeah , sure .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it , chalie .
and still , tere 's no sign of a graviton .
well , mabe if we tae our minds off it ,
you know , if we sit back , relax ,
and , uh , have a little fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
whenever he had a problem that he could n't solve ,
eureka !
come on , dance with me .
oh , no , i do n't think o .
uh , you do n't want to know .
e alarm !
nothing 's any different .
only as a particle up until now .
we can just as easil think of it as a wave .
you said so in your book .
microwave conflict 
how could i miss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
e up a phased harmonic ,
affected the nuclear matrix ,
in other words , groovy little house beat
just unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
e did it , charlie !
his i big !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can we do it later though ?
i 'm kind of late for science lass .
maybe you just had a good tutor .
but you are oing to meet one .
i got to thinking it migt be good for you to meet a kid you age
who 's not asamed o being smart .
he can probably use some one-on-one
with a kid who 's not ashamed to kick his butt .
class :
yes , well , not just you , the etire class .
i 've arranged a field trip today to northern .
do !
doc !
i got to show you something really cool .
oh .
oh , hat ?
what am i going o do ?
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
6 shades of purple ?
thank you very muc .
thank you and welcome .
the youngest particle physicist
a terrible lab accidet has left young r. boyle
temporarily isfigured .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he ha agreed to come out and talk to ou anywa ,
mr. charlie boyle .
charie ?
chalie , i gravely voice :
thank you , fellow eens .
will eventually subside .
since i am in obviou discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let professor krickstein
well , uh ...
psst !
just talk amongst yourselves 
what ?
how do i get the purple stuff off my face ?
it 's starting to burn .
i do n' know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is -- is pretty much like the universe --
i got ta go pay the water bill .
excuse me .
krickstein :
chaz ?
this is a very valuable clue as thymine is changed to uracil .
u , here at the university , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i waned to meet charlie boyle .
from the head o te anthropology --
and schedule another field trip .
i 'm sure i can onvince charlie to coe bak .
what are you doing to me ?
and he has to do that .
or his esophagus .
what are ou doing ?
i-i ' too muh .
ok .
ok .

he ' fine , he 's fine .
really .
you kids do your omework .
bye .
i decided to move my stuff bak in .
i need some elp .
you ...
with what 
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
you have everything .
i could say the same about you .
women , poise ...
women .
losing m scolarship ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bad trade-off .
yeah , right .
oo , i want more than that out of life , charlie .

hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs ad watch the game ?
'cause half the people up tere think i 'm a genius ,
and then the other half think i 'm a punk .
hey , i 'm going o use the particle accelerator while you 're gone .
might as well get some work in ,
as long as i m suck don here .
i particle accelerator es su particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hokey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle acceleator .
and i wanted to say thanks for passing me .
ey , you have nobod to thank but yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's fro me and the guys .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goi ' down .

now cross will usually distract he referee here ,
while stoker and ryder rack our best payer ,
which is me .
we sen soeody else out there with my number ,

his name 's not chalie .
that 's chaz .
he wore your golden goalie ma --
claire , le me explain .
explain ?
just what was all of thi ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a stud of the local culture ?
then i guess you were just having a laugh at my expene .
imagine , me thinking i could teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fat liar .
i also left the particle accelerator on !
get off the ice !
et off the ice 
announcer :
do not venture onto the ice !
get off the ice !
this game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and we were this close .
this close !

formerly known as chaz .
claire :
come on , guys .
what are you reading ?
breakawa .
i love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the agolinks 
this is the one here zoron inds , uh , subatomic partices
and how they 're connected to a mysterious quantum force .
oh , yea .
but you know someting ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists ere able to split a photon ,
and even though the particles are 6 miles apart ,
whatever one does , the other oe does
cool !
and maybe unlock he secret as to how it works .
and then ...
defy gravity .
let 's get to work .
and he output level is 999 .
now his chip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the rubber coating ?
they all act like suerballs .
and when i press this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it mean i can make amends
wel , with what we ust dicovered ,
i figured out a way to help northen beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can keep his job ,
and my friends 'll e happy with me again ,
and maybe ...
claire might like e again , oo .
a little .
you have n't let me down .
you saved me !

i need help .
i figured out a way to help the team tonight ,
keep rumsen from cheating ,
no .
why do n't you just leave us alone ...
i ca n't do it alone .
yeah !
welcome to northern arena !
thi is base ops .
video ?
roger that .
blades 
that i am here under etreme protest ,
and i 'm only doin this so my father does n't wind up
stage managing the ice capades .
skate , rumsen bus should be in target range ...
now .
roger that  ops .
video 's in place , ops .
roger , video .
hey , deion .
how 's it going ?
where 's lades ?
righ here .
let 's just hope this works .

first sign of trouble , i 'm pullin ' you out !
you just try and do that !
for the re-scheduled central conference hampionship
how 's this upposed to work again ?
ho is that possible ?
ike the supe balls i shoed you .
corresponding microchips with other graviton halves
whatever our skates do , thei skates will be forced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c in science .
you sure did a number on this lab .
nah .
besides , i 've arraned his scedule o tha he 'll be gone al day .
and he s never here during hokey games .
almost never 
this has gone wa too far !
i told you i had to do what i had to do .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop riht now .
you know i 'm o your side .
ahead of what ?

the chance to ake up for all the selfish things i id ...
so please ..
chaz !
odie , tigh up .
oar , you 're in !
mike , get off !
we got ta top the rumsen rack .
deion , flip the switch .
take ...
tha !
yeah 
power lay !
number 2 !
i 'm stoker .
ou 're ryder .
let ' go !
whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leaving he box .
he 's out of control !
do something !
he 's heading traight or mike !
i ca n't find it !
i have the othe chip !
aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !
hey .
whoa , we 're too light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reerse the charge of the graitons !
tey 're repelling against the positive charge of the earth !
game announce :
the final sore -- northern 1 , rumsen nothin !
a long , ong time .
yeah .
that 's what i all publicity .
ha ha ha !
i 'm proud of you .
i 'll take smithson .

how 'd you find out ?
ok .
what ?
hey ...
i ca float .
uh .
come on , guys , let 's go !
ca n't we mark it rest in peace ?
not as long as scientists try to prove porpoises have brains rivaling man 's .
even superuman .
and they think tha he might be teaching them ?
that 's right , lieutenant .
but admiral ...
is that a good lieness ?
perfect .
ye .
at least that 's he way he looked before ...

and very healthy .
they may take her .
henry ?
yes , he is .
that 's nice .
tey rejected me .

do n't hang around that pet shop .
do n't be upset , miss barnes .
there 's a fish i the water cooler .
hi , hen old boy !
george , good to see you .
do n't you look important ?
that uniform and all those doodad on your sleeve .
just a couple of hash marks .
do n't apologie .
you look first-class to me , george .
what kind of a machine are you mated to ?
hey , bess !
time to take over .
lover-boy 's ere .
hello , dear .
hello , henry .
i forgive you , casanova .
george has liberty the whole weekend , an he want to spend it with us .

washed out completely , i hear .
you ca n't win them all , george .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks for action , go dancing ?
feel like shaking a leg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
how many times must i tell you , you do not rumba with your eyes !
now  do n't worry .
wy do n't we go to the university for professor hoffmeyer 's lecture ?
you kno , he 's gon na talk about the mating habits of the shellfish .
it ' a little risqué .
sort of for adults only , you know .
i 've got it !
why do n't we run out to coney island tomorrow moning ?
wel , i do n't know ...
i hate to mis that lecture , but i do like the water .
water and fish .
look at him .
alwas drawing into his shell , going off into his fish world !
george  come here .
the what ?
devonian period of the paeooic era .
ou now , it followed the silurian an preceded the carboniferous eras .
i 'e given it a lot of thought .
a lot of thought .
mabe go in or parakeets .
he 's read many books on the subject 
he claims years ago thee as nothing but fish in the wold .
then some of those creatures became aphibians they crawled out on land .
hope for wat , henry ?
with the ar in europe and new eapons being invented what if men were foolish enoug to destroy themselves ?
then the fish would develop into a new race of men and this time they might turn out better .
fish have a better life tan people .
the water !
what a mess !
you are floating yourself out of your home with this hobby !
i 'm gon na run down to the store and get a regulator for the intake hose .
you mean get rid of them ?
but besie !
either those fish go or i do !
which is it to be ?
who looked hurt ?
my fish .
for once .
i left out the most exciting details .
see , i do n't like to brag but  i tell you , that one moning .
it was at night , was n't it ?
rih .
good memory .
we went out with me in the engine room ...
i thought you were on the bridge with the admiral ?
the uss elias j. starbright , is n't it ?
i can tell you this , though .
there are so many nazi subs below the surface you could wak to europe .
the ocean s jumping wit u-oats ready to go if uncle sam gets i the fight .
i do n't wan to start a panic , so you keep all his under your hat , right ?
right , bessie ?
od boy , did i ever tell you about the caribbean ?
what a liberty we had in a port near trinidad !
and miami .
did you ever do the rumba , henry ?
no , i have faulty equilibrium .
yes , sir .
oin the navy and have a whirl !
barbados , kingston , the virgin islands !
lunh is alost ready .
come along , henry !
more than anythig , i wish i could e one of you right now .
i wish i were a fish .
henry !
save him !
what will we do ?
get some help !
call the lifeguards !
get the poice !
police !
help !
come on 
it 's all over .
he oes n't even know how to swim .
he does n't know how to swim !
what 's gon na happen to poor bessie ?
guess he must have lost his glases during the fall .
fish 
oh , no .
there besie , we 'd better get going home no .
all right , folks , back up  please .
let us through .
and i thought it all would be so beautiful .
wish i were home with bessie .
i 've never stayed out all night before .
maybe i should have lisened to bessie .
i got this back from the pet shop .
well , he was so cray about it .
that 's sweet .
here 's the notice 
the body was not recoered .
impet is survived by his widow , bessie limpet .

i do n't wan na figt !
let that be a lesson to you , you confounded  four-eyed ...
say , what are you , anyway ?
you related to the porpoise family ?
no , i ' a limpet .
i 've seen flat fis , but i 've never seen no four-eed flat bush .
listen , flatbush , anything i hate , it 's a smart-aleck fish .
shark !
jumping jellyfish !
just swing about and let tat shark chase you ful speed away from here !
did that come out of e ?
hurricane !
stand by for a blow !
that belch of yours ould capsie me in the backwash .
if you sound off lie that again , i swear i 'll batten your gils and lower the oom on you .
and furthermore ...
crusty ?

do 't worry , it 's not alive .
not alive ?
suffering swordfish !
what kind of sea monster killed a whopper like that ?
a torpedo did it .
oh , they wo n't attack us , they 're just after ships .
hey , do n't go moseying around in this thing 's innards .
no wonder this thing died !
here 's the captain 's logbook .
listen to what it says ?
i did n't hear it say aything .
if only i could help .
come on , let 's shove off .
angwa , ge me out of here !
it 's only a mirror .
it 's me .
well , wab y scuppers .
another flatbush .
i 'm ot a bad-iooking fish at that 
really , a pretty unique secimen .
but maybe i 'm a freak !
if onl there wa another fish like me .
even ust one .
someone who woul understand me

after what you did fo me , i ...
you do n't know what you 're saying .
oh , but i do .
all i can say is :
ow !
the first time i saw you .
remember 
your po brought me fo diner .
on my nose ?
tigma-tism .
well , they help me to see a long way off .
do you see that barracuda coming a us ?
oh , limpet  limpet , we 'll be killed !
ladyfish ... ?
you see , you do n't understand .
married ?
is that like astigmatism ?
oh , that !
i do n't see why it soul .
do you spawn with every tom , dick and fis that comes alog ?
you see , up until now i 've been too young .
now shall we go ?
i 'd sue like ...
well , that is to say ...
do you suppose that we could ust be well , more or less friends ?
fiends ?
goodbye .
gosh , i ca n't .
ladyfish !
ladyfish 
oh , ladyis !
i 've searched everywhere .
sunday , december 7 , 1941 .
sources say the president will ask congress ...
our country at war ?
look , flatbush , if you 're in trouble , you can count on me .
if you ' stay here and look out or ladyfish , i 'd be grateful .
oh , please , it 's important , crusty .
if you do n't need me .
to look after her while i 'm gone 
flatbush , take it easy , huh ?
i will , cruty .
thanks .
tey 're mising the u-boat !
ahoy !
a friend .
ship ahoy !
do n't be alarme .
please do n't !
are you on a raft ?
i 'm a fish !
ahoy there !
what are you doing ?
why did n't you ientify it ?
give the recognition signal !
give the recognition signal !
i fell i the ocean and was drowned .
only i was n't drowned , exactly 
give the recogniion signal !
commence firing !
commence firing !
activate sonar dome .
you missed the sub .
left stanard rudder .
the old man should hear this .
pipe it to the bridge !
all engines ahead full , left standard rudder ?
400 yards straight ahead .
a direct hit .
coud be a nazi trik .
cut that light !
if you 'e friendly , ive the recognition signal !
you could n't find it , could you ?
and then you got it , did n't you ?
we can not see you !
i 'd rather not say at te moment , you would nt believe me .
what the blasted laes is this 
probably a nazi trick , just as you said , sir .
you want to meet wih someboy called pickle ?
not pickle !
stickle !
machinist mae secod class george stickle !
on the uss elias j. starbriht !
i 'll sen a full report of this meeting in but i ca n't guarantee pickle .
good .
i 'll be at this same spot three days from now .
wait till this hits the navy department .
harlock , you 've eiter een drinking or you 've got cobat fatigue !
e have n't time for nonsene .
whatever it is .
it led us to a nazi sub and directed our charges accurately .
all right , harlock .
what 's your eplaation for this henomenon ?
i only know that it 's friendly a cooperatie 
blast it , harock !
e ca n't enlist a oice !
why ?
i 'm not going on record as the admiral who was set away because he believed in voices from the ocean .
there 's nobody else cray enough to take it .
oh , not me , admiral , i ...
stickle .
who is he ?
the voice asked us to bring stickle out to meet with him .
i think we can arrange a leave for you immediately .
think what this means .
it could spot submarines all oer .
witin a year we could break the nazi u-boat threat .

do n't you recognie me , bessie ?
henry , you really are ...
a fish ?
yes , bessie , you can say it .
to think you 're actualy stil alive , and i 'm married to a ..
a fish .
is that so terrible ?
it does n't happen every day .
well , what 's new ?
i mean , how have ou been , bessie ?
i 'm bewilered , henry .
henry , am i he widow of a man or the wie of a fish ?
let 's be logical .
you could n't keep me in a tub , could you ?
i mean , what would the neighbors say ?
i shudder to tink .
why ...
oh , goo heavens .
if you only kew , bessie .
i guess this is goodbye  hery 
if you 'll come up o the steps , i have someting for you .
remember how you catch cold when you get your feet wet .
do n't break up , bessie .
maybe i was meant to be a fish .
maybe nature just corrected her error .
goodbye , bessie 
goodbye , henry .
goodbye , henry , i said .
i thought hat was it .
bessie and i have been happy .
the chief of naval operations ordered it .

isaburo sasahara of the escor group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chamberlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see you wo duel than merely test swords .
there are rumors i our can .
the reason you do nt figt is because it would hurt the family of the loer .
perhas protecting your family name rather than promoting your pride and rank is the isest way to get along in this world .
isaburo , you 're too attenive to your superiors .
i m used to it .
i married into my wife 's family and have been henpecked for 20 years .
would you like to look at the november border record ?
no , not if nothing unusual happened .
making rice cakes in november
but there are no customers
the god who came down in february and brought the rice harvest departs tomorrow until is return net year .
do you really believe that ?
no , i was jus
perhaps you want a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is the problem .
it must be someone she approves of .
someone strog , loing and faithful .
is hat the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about useless things like martial arts again .
to hae the stewad honor u ith a visit has never happened in the sasahara family .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been dismissed from the catle .
it has een deided to have her marry yogoro , your son .
stewad , why was ady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll return for an answer in a few days .
wh sould we acept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone kows tha .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , he wen to a spa to ret .
the daughter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in harge of he castle ardrobe  was serving beside hi .
lady ichi ost her head on seeing this .
she sprag at lady tama , slapped er face , and ragged her by the hair .
how can we accept her ?
i think e should gratefully accept her withou beig difficult .
no matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's an order from our lord .
i 'm araid ...
i do n't feel very entusiastic about it .
neither do i .
but if i refuse , there may be trouble later .
yogoo has said nothing , but he would n't be happy marrying a lord 's mistres who has borne a child .
i do n't wat him to reeat my mistake .
they said you 'd be at the border .
i heard everything .
the steward and chamberlai are good judges .
alert even in time of peace .
ut  iaburo ... as for the marriage an other matters ,
i suggest you keep hings quiet .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief .
so be modest about it or the others will think you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he 's not tinking of you or your famiy .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordplay ?
but at the last moment , you skilfully switch from defese to offense .
yet you never attack .
you wait until your opponent tires .
unworthy ?
yes .
e can no accept our lord 's favored lady .
there 's no need to be o reserved .
it 's happened before , not just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish o deline the honor .
declie ?
sasahara , that will not e allowed .
it is our lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wish .
it 's an orde !
to decline is to defy the order !
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isabuo sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn .
may you enjoy long life together
we 'll all be at your side as long as you live
this is a day of celebration
kee tha in mind .
no .
a woman who was dismised after earing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n't notice your return .
mother took her along for prayer at sonenji temple .
she kindly teaches me dometic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father ?
bu despite that , he has borne everything for 20 years .
ye , right away .
you must n't .
the word never seems to go right .
i wish to retire and have yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sorry .
it ' too early to retire , i think , but his son ha married , so
so isaburo sasahara 's retiring a last ?
i di n't realize it at the time , but it 's a great relief .
i wonder what i 've done all my life , though it 's not like me to do so .
yogoro 's marriage i a very hapy one .
fear ofte exceeds the perceived danger .
so it was in your case .
yogoro 's wife 
she s a fine wife .
suga 's just the same as beore , but ichi is aways pleasant and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like yoursef , i do n't understand it either .
che the weapons in the armory aainst the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appointed days .
i do n't say to always yield to them , but at times  they 're unreasonable .
rice cakes ?
ejoy 
wait , ichi .
i 'm going to retire soon .
yogoro will become the head of our family , and you 're his wife .
you need n't hold back for the old woman .
take over the househol duties 
unerstand ?
even so , she is my mother , ad i will treat her as uch .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understand .
that she 'd grasp her lord by his clothing .
it was hard fo me o believe too , so i asked her the other day .
it was the year before last .
ichi .
accept the honor grateully .
i was more angry tan surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
ou lord does not do thi just to satisfy a whim .
daimyo must have heirs or their houses will be abolished .
the only heir to our lord right now is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ichi , not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one day become our lord 's heir .
she must e beautiful and kind like you .
you are eferring to sannojo kasai , your fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
then i sannojo agrees , you will gratefully agree to serve our lord ?
what do you sa ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gave you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you said ou would serve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly agreed to it .
as sumoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to your wishes 
then i thought
no , it was moe like a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
many , many sons .
then other girls eed never know my misery .
it would end with me .
i was like a prayer .
my thoughts were realy ike a praer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later .
then i went to a spa for ostnatal rest at y lord 's orders .
be friends wit her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i could never have found a beter wife .
beginning tonight ,
what ?
our lord means nothing to me .
i have been so worried about the on i bore .
so worried .
i will orget about him too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've ade me wait nearly two years , ut at last .
a boy would have been better .
and what 's er name 
yogoro ad i racked our poor brains over this and named her tomi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
bu sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has becoe our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birth mother to the heir .
if she remains the wife of a vasal , there would be much talk .
you say this is our lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thig is or ogoro to submit a request to our lord and say he will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been at him since the day efore yesterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
well  i do n't blame him .
but you know very well ... that we ca n't have all our wishes ganted in this world .
group head kotani came over in the afternoo .
but i could n't brin mysel to tel you .
father i calling you .
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , i ust tell you soething .
come into the room .
first , father 's words .
he says he 's retire , so i a the family head , and i am to do what i think is right .
however  he also says you 're too important to us to send away .
that we must take the best possible care of you .
i ust tell her sooner o laer .
do n' worry 
no matter what anyoe says ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a doll .
ye , you 're right .
but you ca n't reason wit a crying child nor with you lord , as they ay .
isaburo , what 's our opinion ?
it 's all up to him .
what is i ?
i 'd like him to come again now and explain in his words hy we mut return her .
when his son 's mother proves inconveniet , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasonable .
e has no understanding of human emotions .
kotani-san , our family did n't accept ichi articularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself know ogoro or te sasahara family .
she was one too happy about it either .
but the reason they are getting along is because they 're kind to each other and care or each other .
what ?
even if the heaves rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i thin this is enough for toay .
i beg you .
would you ive up tomi and return to the castle ?
would you uin our family because you 've lost your ead over a woman ?
in tis case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you were me , would you retur ichi ?
of course i would !
restrain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the head of the family .
right or wrong , i 's all up to him .
if you oe yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy such senseless conventions , however hard it may be 
i believe that , if worst come to worst , ou are a wife worth protecting , even if that means ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this o n't be the end of it .
i gave er the message .
she will be here soon .
over here , sister .
we 've heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you want to stay with yogoro , even if it mean ruining the sasahara family ?
i woul like to stay .
even if you ruin te family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiomi  as asked ou lord that you be sent back o the castle as soon as posible .
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him to send you back .
he 's done this seeral times .
father i father .
i am me .
i would rather die than return .
please tel the chamberlains and teward how i feel in whatee words you think will best help my case .
we ask you again , ichi !
the family does n't mater ?
not only the sasahara famil , but we the relatives will be jeopardized as ell .
it can not be helped .
i see .
there 's no use trying to conince a woman like thi .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's you misortune tha a woman like her has favored you .
return 
retur to the castle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the sasahaa family to you ?
listen to me .
in oher words , i 'm a worthles , good-for-othing man .
so in order to roe myself , for these past 20 years
i have fought to peserve our good name and social standing .
the cruel injustice involved , for one thing .
but your beautiful love for each othe has touched me mot of all .
there 's neve been a shred of love in my married life !
no matter what happens , never leave him !
y husband 's with the chamberlain ?
es , an he 's waiting fo you to come 
i saw him in the atle .
the chambelain wishes to see you both .
he has some questions for you .
you need nt worry .
i will accompany you .
if you lose heart now , what wil it mea for my brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anythin ne a the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happen .
she went out .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo  where 's ichi ?
bunzo , ou tricked her .
no matter how many times i 'm told ,
i 'm goin home .
ihi , take my advice and return to the castle .
if you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain i willing to overlook everything .
but if you insist on returning home , not only will yooro , but also his fater , isaburo , be odered to commit seppuku for ax supervision of their hoe .
honorable lady ichi , please return to the castle .
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamerain s order ?
what orders ?
go home 
but ... if i go home without
say o more !
but
fool 
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool 
yogoro .
but he id request time off due to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife of footma bansaku kariya to come and eed her tice a ay .
a good , solid woman .
then everything 's all over ?
es .
we just took a rounabout pat .
defying the lan gets us nowere .
isaburo , do you really mean tha ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on his matter .
to be honest , the clan 's treatment of our family and your attitude i response have weighed on m mind .
weighed on your mind ?
i 's like your swordplay .
pushed  ou step ack .
but it 's not like you o give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
it was more like force .
in fact , it was more like kidnappig .
if the shogunate offiials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal istake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow them to end here .
you 're aing i must ormally ask te castle to ake her back ?
yet i must ask them to take her back ?
it as wise of you to hold back .
the camberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remember sening her back to the castle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiculous , father !
never !
she suppressed her tears , eft everything behind , and quietly returned to the castle .
now , now , yogoro .
in any case , please go for now .
yogoro will be ard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will eport today and say he wishes to retur he ?
that 's onderful .
now we can look forwar to the suwa shrine fetival tomorrow .
since it would have come to this anyway , how dare they cause all tha fuss !
yogoro was wrong , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he s always henpecked by his wife 
and defying clan orders like that
i must sa he seems like a different man .
is condut has been adirable .
it calls for a slight increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the escort group has arrived !
i 'm glad you 've reported for duty .
yes , completely well .
aking ino consideration m father s wishes , i have decided .
please accept thi .
that 's good of you .
thank you .
fool !
petition .
this is the cruelest form of tranny .
it runs counter to the laws of humanity and can not be condoned by the heavens .
we ereby apeal for her immediate return .
someone may use my father 's name or my own to submit a request to return ichi o the castle .
but it will not be rom us .
pease keep that in mind .
thank you for coming ever day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at times like these .
so our feet wo 't slip in the blood .
this may be the last time .
ill you do e a favor ?
will you cook te ice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fiht on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accept obediently !
i said orders from our lod !
will you not obey ?
let 's hear what he orders are .
orders !
isaburo and yogoro saahara , for your insolent conduct and defiance oward our ord  you are ordeed to commit seppuku .
eppuku ?
it is gracious of our lord o perit it .
i though me would come aest us and then eiher hang or crucify us .
father .
however , we want something before we kill ourselves .
brig us three heads !
those of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler of the aizu domain ,
chamberlain yanase , and steard takaashi .
bring me the heads of the villains who took m son 's ife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear ou are
isaburo 's only equal as a swordman .
if you hink he s too much for you , take four or five strong en wit you .
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this is no time to discuss jurisdiction .
you 're wrong .
if you order me to kill them , please promoe me to superintendent here and now and obtain our lord 's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku  accoring to clan rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mind .
go !
we must gather men , use force and kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsman without eer .
hat ?
cold , is 't it ?
what ime is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should e enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alone 
it 's bunzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
faher !
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the fetial drums .
father !
you were pressed by our relatives at enmotsu 's place to come here as their messenger and say ,
we 've defied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do 't hate us .
but remember :
each must live his own life .
as for what happened ,
each must live his own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
what if other clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather some men and take care of it yourself .
yes , but
the hamberlain s inervention woud aggravate matters .
faher  te drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i reember it too .
outside the castle , it was the inoko festival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that 's as it should be .
it 's not unmanly at all .
but yogoro  do n't be too woried about ichi .
we will die here , but she is the moter of our lord 's heir .
no one an torture her  and no one will endanger her life .
but father , are n't they lae in coming ?
i meant to ask for permission to ente , but the gate was open , so i came in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
we have heard of the order to commit sepuku .
he changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara  for your insoence and attitude toward our lord , you will be confined at enshoji temple outside the castle .
why the sudden change ?
wil you gratefully acept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's wrong !
it was not as the eir 's mother .
i am still the wife of yogoro sasahara 
but our lod reeived me in his audience .
i do n't unerstand what this is all about .
steward , it seems we do n't understad what you just told us .
if you two admit that ichi is no longer a family member and that she has een returned , our lord will listen to her plea for a lighter punihment .
will you acknowledge her return and live , or refuse an fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are repared for the worst 
then there is no altenatie ?
please return her at once !
i 'll ask lady ichi now 
or will you let their pursuers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , he sasaharas are men .
you have already returned to seve our lord .
if you tell them that you sever your ties with them once and for all , then all will be wel !
if you do , teir lives will be saved .
we need not ask them to return you .
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save their lives ?
or will you let them die as traitor ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ichi , does your silence mean you will do a i say ?
am i correct ?
no .
i
father ...
tomi , bid your father and mother arewell .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are still alie listen o them .
let 's liten to what they want us o do .
no , i know wihout being told .
they want us to tell he world of our clan ' cruelty !
vey well .
i understand .
we promise to do that for you .
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestal !
first , tomi and i will go to edo together and see the shogunate elders .
we 'll leave immediately for edo .
omi and i are going to edo .
if this is for the clan  show me your pass .
if it 's private business , show e te clan ticket .
i have neither .
then i 'm afraid i can not let you pass .
you mean to pass fro this domain without having either ?
i must forbid i .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quiet .
i 'd like to put her in the house away from the win .
but men we dislike are in there .
venomous men 
i fed her before dawn 
i do n't think she 's hungry 
we 'll make do with this .
you be quiet now , tomi .
do n't cry even if i do n't reurn .
let me remain .
it 's better that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
no .
o matter how strong you are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ...
without fail .
i will wi without fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance of wining .
take tomi with you to eo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
o one will ever know the stor of your father and mother now .
just one word .
when you grow up , become a woman just like your mother .
be sure to do that .

his is our galaxy , the milky way .
ou sun take 225 million years to go around the galaxy once
the inosaur era laste 180 million years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice ad rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for the earth ... fast .
but this is nt the earth that we know , not reall 
at this time the masters of the earth are inosaurs .
this is patagonia .
a vast region of argentinean south ameica as it is today .
and there was only one immense ocean 
we are nort of the south ameican plate , in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of ife also appeared on land uring the dinosaur era .
in many places there , one walks today on the very ground these giants walked upon a 100 millio years ago .
this phenomenon seems to depend on another peculia twist of evolution .
regions that produce great dinosaurs also tend to produce great paaeontologists .
many doctoral student ome to pursue their research .
sometimes younger people , like my dauhter ludila , just come to satisfy their curioity .
i love alking about dinosaurs with everyone , whether they are experts or not .
it 's a busy life , and it would have been plenty fo most people , but early i my career new horizons opened up for me .
things became much larger than life .
a ranher had stumbled upon a suprisingly large boe .
ater seveal digging seasons we ende up facing the largest dinosaur ever found .
e named it agentinosaurus
this discover have a proound effect , on the way we look at south amerian dinosaurs .
on a peronal level , it took a big place in my ife to ay the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit .
predators and hazards abound .
only a fe will reach adulthood .
it coves more than 15 iles and it is approxiately 80 million year old .
we believe that it was chosen as a nesting site by generation upon generation of these dinosaus .
the nests are so close together , that the females could not wal between them .
it was warmer than today .
a great part of the dinosaur era , here ere no broad lea trees and no flower bearing plants .
during the dinosaur era tere is no artic ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
or tens of millions of years seasons arely changed .
the water of he ocean is also much warmer .
urricanes are frequent .
the magnetic poles changes position continuousl .
professor coria has contibute to the discover of more than a dozen of new dinosaurs .
as a sientist  he insists tat each new find is important , no mater how big or small .
and someimes he says what pla he biggest part i imply not in our hands .
i like to think that i am lucky , just incredibly lucky .
many paleontological discoveries are not made by professionals .
that 's wat hapened with the argentinosaurus , and it haened again wih yet another dinosaur .
they were relatively big , so at firs , we thought that they belonge to a herbivore , because in general these dinosaurs tend to be arger .
but instead , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a vey large one .
professo coria 's team had unveiled a first species of a group o fierce predators caled giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in this group surpassed he famous t. ex in terms of size .
although rare for reptiles , caring for the young has be observed among crocodiles for instance .
in dinosaurs , this caring behaviour evolve enough to emind u of birds .
this baby female is named long tooth .
however all and vuleable , ad cute she may appear now she is geneically programmed to rapidly ecome a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like he mother .
i patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and the larest pedator , living at roughly the same peiod and in the same territory .
there is no easy answer .
evolution folowed a number of particular paths .
but a simpler interpretation rest on a arm climate and the fertile land , with all the vegetation you can ea .
yet another teory tells us that arge herbivores had to grow big enough , to accommodate a large stomach required to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finaly , lare spans of flat space could have led naturally to argentinosaurus , as the vat seas have led to whales .
the hihes branches belong to those who can reach them , and may predators are too small to e theatening i tose situation .
she is groing fast too .
her primitive feathers have almost all disappeared .
they thrived for 180 million years .
this is a message for us here .
by the way , it is more than time to introduce sharp feathers .
he is uenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is related to birds , as are to some extent velocirapors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaus need space .
this is the carme funes museum , which also hapes to be my second hoe .
sometimes as a joke we say that it is a science illed with oles 
we ave only found about 700 secies of dinosaurs on the whole planet .
this is n't any or a reig that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , most of them in the last 30 years .
through technology our knowledge gows faster eve day .
fossilisation is a process that requires extremely rare condition , and even then very little o an organism is presered .
we could easily conclude that a tremendous umber of species just disappeared without a trace .
of course , science iction can be fun , but you also need to be very careful before proposing a new way of ooking a dinosaurs .
i wish i could travel in ime to see thee amazing creatures aive .
strong one has reached maturity .
for man scientists he is at full size .
he is 20-year-old , and i at the beginning of more than a century of life .
they tell us , if the aimal was walking on two legs or four , if they ere alone or in a group , i they were wanderin , hunting , or being hunted
the pattern clearly show association between conteporary species  and this is very rare .
his work is intimately linked to nature  its intimately varied terrain and ever canging limate .
so there wee hardships , but there are moments , sometimes when science jut blend with the pure bliss of being outside and wonderul places .
you just look around .
but finding required a trained eye .
with time you realise that the number of questions grows faster than the number of aswes .
again , like many times before ,
a good hint and an answer came unexpectedly .
in fact , we did n't find just one specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at least seven individuals .
for me , and my anadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at something we had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so long truth belongs to this new species of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , she is fully grown .
strong one is unknowingly in a criial time .
tearing off pieces of skin and letting the large prey bleed to death , or die from infection is a strategy more likely to succeed 
giganotosaurus could wait days even weeks beween meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep on rifing , the earth begins to resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature never stops caging .
we are in north america .
aart from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolution ave it nothing to survive the impending dramatic events .
several factors could have contributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mammals became bigger ad more competitive .
drifting isolated continents touched each other .
new rivalries appeared .
new diseases spread .
the climate was growing colder , possibly because of increased volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable in many places .
vegetation suffered from the acid rain and also from te darkened and dust-filled skies .
but still , many dinosaurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the distance from the moon to the earth in two hours .
all the foest of north and south america ae destroyed by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs are te animals that suffered most .
i a relatively shot time , dinosaurs become hitory .
not all te dinosaurs disappear .
if they have n't become extinct maybe we just would n't e here 
more discoveies await me here perhaps but as i move forward in ife 
and the best food in paris  some say , is made by chef auguste gusteau .
gusteau ' restaurant is te toast of pari , booked five months in advance .
he is the youngest chef ever to ahieve a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
bu not everone celebrates is success .
what 's even more amusing is that guteau actuall seems to believe it .
i , on he other hand , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethink y life a little bit .
what 's my prolem ?
firs of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanila bean ...
oh !
smal twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
tis is emile , my brothe .
he 's easily impressed .
so what ?
this is m dad .
he 's never impressed .
he also happens to be the leader of our clan .
so , what 's wrong with having ighly developed senses ?
what 's going on here ?
suddenly , dad id n't think my talent was useles .
clean .
cleanerific .
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad roud 
now , do n't you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a nole cause .
we re thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , le 's face it , garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no one want it , why are we stealing it ?
but to my da ...
you get picky about what you put i the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and eat your garbage .
secondly , stay out of the kitchen and away from te humans .
it 's dangerous .
they discoer , they create .
how can i decribe it ?
good food is like music you can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be aware o stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was right .
oh , mmm  yeah .
each flavor as toally unique .
so now i had a secre life .
the only one who knew about it was emile .
hey , eile .
emile .
come on , you 're good at hiding food .
he does n't understand me , but i can be mysef around him .
why are you walking like that ?
i do n't want to consantly hae to wash my paws .
did you ever hink about how we walk on the same paws at we handle food with ?
ou ever think about hat we put into our mouths 
all the time .
but if dad sees you walking like that , he 's not going to like it .
what have you got thee ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found cheese ?
and not just any cheese .
that would go beautiully with my mushroom .
and ...
this oseay !
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you know , dad 's gon na ..
emile !
tere are possibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook his .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep turning it .
that storm 's getting closer .
hey , remy , you tink that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to aste this !
i 's got , like , this ba-boom , za kind of tate .
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 's lihtning-y !
we got to do that again .
okay , when the next storm comes , we 'll go up on te oof ...
i kow what this needs !
saffron .
saffro .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na wake up .
she turns on the cooking channel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been here a ilio times ?
gusteau sweas by it .
okay .
wo s gusteau ?
jut the geatest chef in the world .
wrote this cookbook .
you read ?
and hey have , which is why i rea .
i do n't like secets .
all this cooking and reading and tv-watching while we read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's taking those kids so long 
ah , l'aquila saffron .
italian .
gusteau says it s excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love ...
forget mystique .
geat cookig is ot for the faint of heart .
you must be imaginative , strong hearted .
you ust try things that may not work .
and you must not let anyone define your liits because of where you come from .
anyoe can cook .
but only the fearless can be great .
gusteau 's restaurant los one of its five tars after a scathing review by france 's top food citic , anton ego .
it was a severe blow to gusteau , and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwars , whic , according to tradition , meant the loss of another tar .
oh !
oh !
oh !

no , you ' lead her o the colony !

someone is aking about your soup .
what are you playing at ?
am i still fired ?
you ca n't fire im .
what ?
if she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook resposible ...
he 's a garbage boy .
how can we claim to represent the name of gusteau if we do n't uphold his most cherished belief ?
he has taken a bold risk and we should reward that , as chef gusteau would have .
oh , yeah .
you will make the soup again , and this time  i ll be paying attention .
vey close attention .
the hink you might be a cook .
but you know what i think , linuini ?
et he rat .
what should i do no ?
kill it .
no , not in the kitchen .
they 'd close us down .
take it away from here .
kill it .
go !
do n't ook at me like that !
they expect me to cook it again !
i mean , i 'm not ambitious .
i was just trying to stay out of trouble .
you 're the one who was getting fancy with he spices !
what did you throw in here ?
oregano ?
i need this job .
i 've lost so many .
did you nod ?
have you been nodding ?
so i 'm not crazy !
wait a second , wait a second 
you ca , right ?
look , do nt be so modest .
you 're a rat , for pete 's sake .
whatever you did , they liked it .
do you think ou could do it again ?
right ?
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not much , but it 's  you know ...
there 's heat and light and a couch with a tv .
he best kid of dream .
oe we can share .
but wh here ?
why now ?
morning , little chef .
idiot !
i et a rat into my place and tell him what 's mine is his !
stupid 
he 's stolen food and hit the road !
that s what i get for trusting a ...
hi .
i that for me ?
look , it s delicious .
but do n't steal .
i 'll buy some spices , okay ?
and on the fist day !
though i , lie many other critic ,
had ritten off gusteau as irrelevant since the great cef s death ,
the soup was a revelation .
solène leclaire ?
agaist all odds , useau 's has recaptured our attention .
only time will tell if they desere it .
well ...
you know .
welcome to hell .
now , recreate the soup 
take as much time as you need .
soup .
you little ...
ou son of a ...
something that does n't involve any biting , or nipping , or runnin up and down my body with your little rat feet .
the biting !
scampering !
no !
no scampering or scurrying .
little chef ?
oh , ou 're hungry .
okay .
so let 's think this out .
we need to work out a system so that i do what you want in a way that does n't look like i 'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef .
would you listen to me ?
i 'm insane !
i 'm insane !
i will never pull this off !
linguini ?
we got ta communiate .
i saw it !
a at ?
ye , a rat .
what are you doing in here ?
get out .
that was cloe .
whoa !
how did you do that ?
that 's strangely involuntary !
one look and i knew we had the same crazy idea .
okay 
huh ?
where are you taking me ?
i 'm sory .
whoa !
mmm-hmm ...
okay .
whoa !
whoa !
à votre santé !
all right 
mmm .
but you 'll need to know more than soup if you are to survive in my kitchen , boy .
liste , i just wan you to know how honored i am to be stuying under such ...
no !
how many women do you see in this kitchen ?
well , i ...
only me .
why do you think that is ?
because haute cuisine is an antiquated ierarchy buil upon rules written by stupid old men .
but still i 'm here .
how did this happen ?
because i am the toughest cook in this kitcen .
got it ?
wow !
gusteau makes chinese food
gusteau 's corn puppies .
bite size .
what are corn dogs ?
cheap ausages dippe in batter and deep fried .
chea sausages dipped in batter and deep fried .
you know , american .
whip something up .
or as a big ear of corn in dogie make-up .
yes 
well  the will stipulates hat if after a period of two year rom the date o death no heir appeas ,
gusteau ' usines interests will pass to his sous chef .
you .
what i want to know is if this letter ...
if this boy hanes anything !
there 's no reemblance at all .
he is ot gusteau 's son .
gusteau had no children , and what of the timing of all this ?
highly upect !
this is gusteau 's ?
yes , yes , yes .
of course .
she laims she never told him , or usteau , and asks that i not tell .
why ou ?
only a job ?
if he works here , you 'll be able to keep a eye on him while i do a little digging .
find out how muh of this is real .
i will need you to collect some dna samples from te bo .
mark my words .
the whole thing is highly suspect .

i have thi ...
little ...
a iny chef ?
yes .
e 's ...
he 's up here .
here e go .
you inspie me .
i ' going to risk looking like the biggest idiot psycho you 've ever seen .
you want to know why i 'm such a fast learne ?
do n' lau !
no !
no !
wha is it , ambrister ?
gusteau 's .
more financial trouble ?
no , it 's ...
announced a new line of microwave egg rolls ?
what ?
i said , gusteau has finally found his ightful place in history
right alongside another equally famous chef ,
touché .
that was my last word .
the last word .
then tell me  ambrister , how could it be popular ?
the dna matches , te timing works , everything checks out .
this ca n't just happen !
the whoe thing is a setup !
the boy knows !
look at him out there , pretending to be an idiot .
strig ?
playin dumb .
taunting me with that at .
deliberately trying to make me thin it s important .
te rat .

he just wants me to think that it is .
and now he wants me to see it everywhee .
ooh !

if i fire hi now , everyone will wonder why .
is n't it good to have the press ?
is 't it good o have gusteau 's name getting headlines ?

inspiration has any names .

something 's stuk in my teeth .
health inspector .

i meant you .
it 's him .
ego ?
anton ego !
is that ego ?
you are monsieur linguini ?
hello .
pardon me for interrupting your premature celebration , but i thought it only fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game .
game ?
yes .
and you 've been playing witout an opponent .
which is , as you ay have guesed , agaist the rules .
you 're anton eo .
if i do n't love it , i do n't swallow .
listen , we hate to be rude , but we 're fench , and it 's dinnertime .
do n't give me that look .
you were distracting e in front of the press .
how am i supposed to concentrate with you yanking on my hair all the time ?
your opinion is n't the only one that matters here .
all right , that 's it !
you take a break , little chef .
i 'm not your puppet , and you re not y puppet-controlling guy !
you cool off and ge your mind right , little hef .
ego is coming , and i need to focus !
you stupid ...
i have neer seen that before .
you know what ?
i 've been selfish .
are you kidding ?
we 'll go after closing ime .
in fact ...
yeah .
this is reat , son .
an inside job .
oof !
ey , little chef .
then when you were n't there , i do n't know ...
it id n't seem right to leave tings the way that e did , so ...
look , i do n't want to fight .
i 've been under a lot of , you know , pressure .
i 'm sudenly a gusteau .
and i got to be a gusteau or , you know , people will be disappointed .
i have nt been fair to you 
you 've never failed me , and i should eer forget that .
you 'e been a good friend .
the most honorable fiend a guy could ever ask ...
what 's going on ?
hey ...
you 're ...
you 're stealing food ?
i thought you were m friend !
i trusted you !
get out !
you and all your at buddies !

and he 's going to order something .
jut ca n't leave it alone , can you ?
it 's not safe .
i 'm hungry !
obseve .
no , wait !
oh , no !

you might think you are a chef but you are still only a rat .

dad .
this is very bad juju right here .
ego is here .
ego ?
he is here ?
anton ego is just another cusomer .
let 's cook !
yeah !
okay .
au revoir , rat !
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
yes , i think i do .
after reading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook , you kow what i 'm craving ?
a little pespective .
can you suggest a good wine to go with that ?
very well .
you provide te food , i ll provide he perspective .
which would o nicely with a bottle of cheval blanc 1947 .
i 'm araid i ..
tell him to hit me with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 'e given up .
as you ae .
oh , please .
i pretend you exist o i have someone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here !
what the ...
dad !
where are you goin ?
they 'll fail without me .
why do you care ?
because i 'm a cook !
it 's your recipe .
i did n' write it down .
it just came to me .
because we ca n't serve tis !
where 's my order 
ca n't we serve something ese ?
something i did n' invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we just opened .
i have another idea .
what if we serve them what they order !
we will make it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the custoers something .
the tell them ...
tell hem ...
rey .
we 're not talking about me 
we 're talking about what to do right ...
remy !
et my knife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ...
wel , the ruth souds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i have no talent at all .
but this rat , he 's the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real coo .
he 's been hiding uder my toque .
he 's been controling my actios .
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's exciting everyone .
i now it 's a hard hing to believe .
we can be the greatest restaurant in paris , an this rat , this briliant little chef , can lead us tere .
what do you say ?
i was rong about your friend and about you .
i ca 't choose between two halves of myself .
i 'm not talking about cookin .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
you tel us what to do , and we 'll get it one .
stop that healh inspector !
delta team , go , go  go , go !
the rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be handling fish .
team four , roasted items .
team six , sauces .
et o your staions .
those handling food wil alk on two legs .
i 'm sorry for any delay , but we 're a little short toniht .
please , take all of he time you need .
make sure that steak is nice and tenderized .
easy with that oe meunière .
only use the mimolete cheese .
compose the salad like you were painting a picture .
do n't let that beurre blanc separate .
gently poach the callops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
just tell me what the rat wants to cook 
it 's a easant dish .
i am making ratatouille .
they must be joking .
mmm .
no , it ca n' be .
i deand to know !
i asked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight .
then who do i thank for he meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef  you will have to wait until all the other customer have gone .
at first , ego hink it 's a oke .
he does 't react beyond asking an occasioal question .
and when the story is done , ego stands , thanks us for the meal ...
we risk very little , yet enjoy a positio over those who ofer u their work and their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which is fun to wite and to read .
he world is often unkind to new talent , new creations .
the new needs friends .
last night , i experienced something ne , an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected souce .
but i realize only now do i truly understand what he meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a great atis can come from anywhere .
it is difficult to imagine more humble oriins than those of the genius now cooking at gusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the fines ce in frane .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for ore .
i will be returning to guteau 's soon , hungry for moe .
it was a great night .
well , we had to let skinner and the health inspector loose , and of course they ratted us out .
the food di n't matter 
ut do n't fee too bad for him .
he seems ver happy .
how do you know ?
got to o .
do n't you always ?
wich one would you like ?

it was a sound ike one never heard before in this par of the jungle .
it was a man cub !
i would ve obeyed my first impulse and waked away .
then it ocurred to me .
oh , i knew there 'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal instinct , but ...
ten times the rains had come and gone .
he was a favourite of all the youg wolf cubs of the pack .
no ma cub was ever happier .
and yet , i knew that someday .. he would have to go back to his own kind .
shere khan will surely ill the boy an all who try to protect im .
now it is my unpleasant uty to tell the boy 's father .
rama .
uh , come over here , please .
the man cub can no longer stay with the pack .
leave ?
there is no oter way .
but-
but , rama , even the strength of the pack is no ath for the tiger .
perhaps i can be of help .

what was all that nonsense ?
just testing what eetu 's ot in him
he 's in top form .
no need to test him
these ae the tactics for sunday :
everyone will be bunched up on the first few circuits
after 100 km or so , the pace should pick up
the steep climb at the end makes the race really tricky
and you with your famous sprint , break away on the ast stretch
you 'll handle the kylmälä climb , huh ?
what kind of an answer is that ?
i did n't ask you
this is you big break
what if i had a chance too ?
jut think , if we quit , we coud concentrate on training
more or less
jons !
delivery to the cable factory !

more serious than those clowns
i 'm setting up the nationa team for under twenty-ones i the fall
you might fit in the team .
sounds good
see you at the nationals
who would have ever guessed ?
but you dropped out .
eetu , there 's no excuse for screwing up
shut up , princess , or you 're caned
sit , what a lose !
give it a break .
it 's 50 km to home
you forgot your tropy
congratulations .
just a district championship .
in hono of your firt victory
that ll do
your resting pulse is 42 .
how ca it e so low ?
but your stress pulse is just about as high as it can get
it should n't o over 210 .
slow down a bit .
nice work !
sorry about losing it after the race .
forget it .
i quit
i 'e had enough bulshit ro m .
ski
you ca n't quit now .
we an go some other time
for two years i 've been helping you
now it 's my hance , and you quit the team
you ve still got mika and jani .

i 'm going for a sin tonight anyhow .
i expect you 're coming too
why would you wan to rie with a loser lie me ?
eetu searching for k !
k receiing
k. i 'll come for a spin
but i wo n' have anything to do with mr .
ski
why are you here ?
eetu asked me to come .
yu .
i can leave , if you isist
we 'll just have to take it easy
no need to hold back because of me
k !
let 's get charged .
a good idea
she 'll either come or she wo n't
did you notice , ast fall i was in the same shape as you 're in now
i knew i was in top form
yet i 'd build up the lactics way too easily
espeially when climbing
started working on my ability to recover
regularly pushed mself until the lactics were boiling
sounds extremely rough
it was , for months
then suddeny a week ago a breakthrough !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and sap !
that 's why i won the race
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance our team has
ok .
on three onditions :
neither of you lows the other 's chances .
some program he 's been on all spring !
if i ' used the same method , i 'd already be on the national team
you do n't mind that your bet friend kept such a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat im once more- he would have killed himself .
it can be a goo thing .
taking things seriousl
eetu !
coach agreed e could train together for the nationals
i 've quit .
maybe it oul be a healthy change
no one asked you !
would we use your method ?
lf you want
in that case , ount me in
of to bed early !
heavy session tomorrow
oona !
is he a total moron ?
this is similar to the 25 route the nationals will be raced on this year
i thought we ere using your method
o.k 
each round i ll join you on the climb
drive me as ard as you can .
ike it 's the nationals
ready for a road kill ?
you 're minute behind on this round
how 's it going ?
not bad
i 'd prefer eetu alive tonight
so you came to play nurse .
have a problem wit cycling women 
my first childhood memory is watchig my mom win the nationals
i 've een cycling women before
nice sannino .
hey , i do n't need a coac

i had planned tat eetu woud he k to win
you can both race for first place
it would be great if one of you gets lucky
let 's go for a swim after work .
mr .
ski is totally mind-boggled .
he thought you were history
you calle on saturday .
for a wile i suspected you were hitting on oona behind y back
but i knew you woud never do a thing like that to me
especially at a time like thi
that 's what i thought
if you see him ...
then what ?
you need eetu 's help
and e needs mine just the same .
he called me
aologized for his behavior .
and ?
about us ?
about us of course
why would i lie o him .
i feel stupid enough as it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , i you did n't have the guts to tell im
and you had nothing o do with i ?
that ' not what i meant
the aorta
your heart has to be operated on
is it a major operation 
yes  and difficult
i you wee on the national team , maybe ...
i have the nationals on unday .
and i forbid you to take part
consequently , the ventricles contract
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to rea to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
am i bothering you ?
looks ike my exam went really well .
thanks agai fo the tapes .
why not
should we go some lace ?
i have to finish this
do n't worry
are you mad at me ?
i did n't mean it exacty that wa .
i am what i am
here they are , 40 hungry raers , reay to ive their best shot ...
a few names stand out as promising
how 's it going ?
and you ?
busy as hell .
is the national team all settled ?
one man mising .
my guys will settle it on the road
keep a eye o this promising rider , only 19 years old
oona !

lf i had , i would n't give you any
thanks
they 're coming !
k !
just go !
will you be all right ?
i 'm glad to see you eating again .
why am i packaged up like this ?
that 's why you 've got to keep still
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a good chance of recovery
ou can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spial shock , as the doctos believe- you should be moving your leg in a month 's time
but you 'll never become a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a elief
i told them i 'd ask you first
we re in a hurry
hi !
never seen parallel bars this long
i asked the staff to set them up
i left it to the very ast moment , but i came anyway
with the under twenty-three national team
congratulations
i would n't have made it without you .
just thank yourself
no  i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages
i 'm glad you made it
i think oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can manage on my own .
certainly not
hey , wh o n't you leave
will you just get ost !
it 's coming along
but they wo n't let me cycle for a year
strange how distance take twice as log as they used to
i passed the exam .
by the skin of my teeth .
congratulations
it must have been the sure bet
do n' you remember ?
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react o- somatic and psychological changes rapidly ...
unexxc ... unexpectedly .
unexpectely
i want to apologize
i really did n't treat you right
that was then
just about to do it

dean higgins , today , a computer an hardly be considered a luxury .
oh , very ell .
now , unfortunately 
medfield ha quite a long list of necessities , and a computer just does not have a very hig priority o that list .
now , it 's not tat i 'm old-fashioned .
you all know that i have an open ea for progress , and we do all that we can .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live fros for er biology lab , we went to the expene of live frogs .
we 're not dragging our feet , quigley .
why , i just put an order in today or two garbage disposals ad an electric dishwasher
anything yet , bradley ?
how 's he oing ?
yeah , that figures .
thaks .
you ust do n't understand the problem .
do you no what the telepoe bill alone is here every month ?
i do n't want to hear about state .
yeah , but do you realize that they give an entire course in computer technology ?
now , i do n't like to draw comparisons , gentlemen , but if we want to keep abreast of the times ad aise our academic average ,
we have got to modernize .
modernization is 't everything .
yes , uh , reget deeds .
thank ou very muc .
gentlemen , i , u , i would n't like this to get any further tha this room , but frakly , we are down to the nitty-gritty on our budget .
wy , we raffled off everything on he campus but the woen 's gym .
it 's tough , tough , tough .
unrest .
oh , u , that part about the unrest , that 's , uh , that 's off the record , mrs. winifred .
so  quigley , i 'm sorry , but i 'm certain that you understand our problem .
that 's it .
now , for the next item on the agenda ...
us .
well-put , dean .
leonard ...
the not-so-gifted students  needs are just as great as those of the gifted oes .
now , um , quigley , we do have certai neer-o-wells that must be seen to .
probation is no substitute for catching the interest of the student , for firing his imagination .
come on , quig .
thattaboy .
john colligan , roger demne ,
henry fatinger ,
.. myles harris 
adam jervins 
keith ricards , dexter reilly ...
dexter , it 's not funny .
... robert ross ,
sliver roth .
he went through all he s 's .
hey , that 's right .
oh , yes , of course .
richard scuyler .
he 's sik .
you know , quig really cares , but the guy ca n't even reason with him 
well , swing what 
the computer .
it 'd drive higgins right over the edge .
you guys must be dreaming .
the guy who 's seling it wants 10 gand .
a.j .
arno .
i mean  i think if we went down there and talked to him , we could get him to donate it to the ollege .
well , i do n't know about that .
dexter , you just cleaned up at night .
arno would n't even remember you .
kind of .
you know , tat s not too bad an idea .
no trouble at all , wexler .
i mean , i love that school 
ell , believe me , if i did n't give tem all that money ,
no .
maybe i can ork something out .
look , just give me a litte time  huh 
ou know , i like you kids .
i like the idea of a student delegation coming to see me .
makes me fee good ...
thanks .
goodbye .
goodbye  boys .
thanks a lot for giving us your time , mr. arno .
well , a.j .
arno never fogets an ol employee .
um , it 's ... it 's dexter .
ah , yes , dexter .
yeah , just about , si .
all right 
hey , tey did pretty good with the horses .
750 is n't bad .
that crap table figure okay ?
looks like a rea good day for applejac .
yeah , real good .
incidentally , o n't send tha 20 grand to medfield .
do n't you think ...
do n't worry about it .
146 , right .
easy through the door , you guys .
easy .
right in there .
number 125 .
take it easy .
what a slave driver .
yeah , if he ' been in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they 'd have mae it .
you know , it 's a great idea doing somehing fo the school , but next time let 's do something easy , like hijacking a cuban airliner .
yeah .
professor , ca we just take a few seconds off ?
oh , sure 
take as much time as you wan .
uh , dexter , there 's a box of tools in the back of my car .
would you get that for me , please ?

good morning , dean .
good morning , dean .
hi , deano .
oh , hello , here , dean higins .
of course , we 're not really set up here et , ut very soon .
well , tat 's wonderful .

yours in the interest of higher education  a.j .
arno.
you can say that again .
and i 'm go na tel you thi much , quigley ... in the uture , i 'm gon na be watcing them 
but you ca n't blame the boys , sir .
oh , good faith , bad faith , who cares ?
they 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
we still have the computer 
you know , i do n't like to bra , but if it had n't been for the fact that i used to work there ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , aithmetic and logic , and output .
and , uh , even though it 's an imiation , in many ays , the machine we 've developed can operate more efficiently than we can ourselves .
now , in the past couple of weeks ,
i 've been , u , working on a small experient , uh , which is intended to show how we ca be replaced by a computer .
hey ... this may be a wa of etting rid of dean higins .
we live in hope , deter .
ow , let 's suppose that your parents ae going away for the weekend , and they leave you the following instructions ...
all right ?
and being the conscientious and reiable young people
i know you to be , you promptly forge to do it .
now , this is a rain gauge , and it 's , uh , siting on a roof of a building .
the memory bank  in turn , activaes the electronic circuits , the window loses , the door opens ... hopefully the cat comes in ... an the automatic elephone goes into action , rigt ?
the ain ... falls .
computerized male voice :
this is s recoding .
hmm 
that 's enough of that .
thank you .
now , another very important feature is its infallile memory .
and the were kind enough to send us thi magnetic tape , which will call forh from the computer olutions to a series of problems that would occur on a simulated flight to the planet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center panel , please .
hey , quig .
hey .
well , it seems like our flight to saturn will be a little delayed .
tis is dean higgins .
now , as many of you know , we came in 36th last year .
i do n't know .
what happened , professor ?
it  uh , should be replaced , but i ca n't get over to capital electronic today .
oh , that 's okay .
i 've ot nothing to do .
oh , yeah , but i know all that stuff .
cars and buses going from place to place .
one guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes .
i ot it all , prof .
yes , i ' sure you do have it all , exter , but if i were you  i would look it over again this afternoon 
aw , honest , professor .
it would n't do any good .
i 'm up to ere with it .
let me go to marshfield .
believe me , the drive and fresh air wil do me good .
it could n't e a .
the answer to the last two questions was a .
would never hae three a 's in a row .
it 's got ta be b or c .
i have n' seen a c for a long time .
got to be c .
that 's three a s in a row .
that 's impossible .

you may begin .
dexter  come on .
funny guy .
i tel you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a doctor .
that 's ridiculous .
he di n't cheat , dean higgins .
now , we usualy alow an hour and a half for that tes 
dexter finished it in 41/2 minutes , and he did n't make a mistake .
man :
yes .
listen , at this rate , you 'e gon na faint in front of all those people .
dexter , it is n' that easy .
things ae n't the same .
you have a resposibility now .

mayor collis and there ' councilman cooper over there and supervisor straight an there 's , uh , oh , he 's not anything .
hello , dean !
what 's he doing here ?
well , i do n't like it .
evey time i ee him , i have to hear about his buiding ogram 
it 's enough to make you sick .
hello .
i 've been hearig great thing .
well , you know , at medfield , the scholastic ...
nice to see you .
i would have gotten over here sooner , bu i 've been ied up planning our new science building .

no .
i-i mean , he 's al booked up .
uh-huh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies and gentlemen .
oh , i 'd better take my seat .
i 've been invited to sit in the conrol room .
in the control room .
i tell you , he 's trying to steal that boy away fro us .
i 'm sure of it .
you do nt understand him , quigley .
the man is gree .
he 's up to his throat in state money , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each of our learned guests will be allowed 3 questions .
our first questions will be from dr. rufus schmidt , head of the departmet of higher mathematics at pudue university .
dr. schmidt .
well , i ...
i  u , i guess i am .
i see .
mr. reily , using the fundamental theorem of advanced calulus , and applying the formula that the square of a distance from the origin to p
is equal to  squared plus y squared plus z squared .
you see ?
he 's getting his confidence .
your next question , dr. scmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 .
the square root of that roduct would be ... 102,978 .
i ' afraid that 's quite correct .
ey .
man :
i must say , that was really something .
yes , i suppoe it was , but ould n't it speed things up a bit if we could save the applause till the end ?
yes , uh , i 'm sure the audience would be glad to comply .
good .
our third question , dr. schmidt .
gentlemen , please .
i hope you 're aware hat i 'm perfectly equipped to go ino other fields .
of course .
uh , perhaps now we could hear from , uh  dr. seigel , professor of foreign languages at lansing university .
getting his confidence is one thing , but this is ridiculous .
i liked him better the wa he was .
we re awaiting he arrival of he phenomenal dexter reilly .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal exter reilly .
it promises to be exciting , so stay with us as our cameras follow dexter reilly on his jourey through gotham .
there 's been s buzz of excitement around te big city this past week , ladies and gentlemen .
everwhere you go , you hear the same question ... is dexter eilly for real ?
sould be any second no 
and there he is !
well ...
uh , mr. reilly 's being greeted by two young ladies who came all the way from yokers just to greet him .
this is priscilla cummings ...
queen of the yonkers botanical society ,
i alwas knew if he had any brains , he 'd be dangerou .
look , i kno dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind o understandable .
look at that crowd , quigley .
what a boon for te colege .
why could n't the oy have been carrying a mefiel pennant ?
do n't ou think that would have been pushing it a little , sir ?
yes ?
from uiversal encyclopedias .
oh , tell him e already have a set .
he 's no salesman , sir .
he 's the president of universal ecyclopedia .
the president ?
sure .
the quiz proram where they ask the questios from the encclopedia , and they give away $ 100,000 
it 's a real pleasure .
thank you .
who are you ?
who am ...
that 's good .
i like that .
who am i ?
and i like that set of encyclopedias of yours .
displaying again his remarkable intellectual prowes ,
dexter eilly was able to converse with each delegate to the u.n. in his own tongue .
they 'e waiting for him in the security council .
earlier today , dr. suzuki of the international school of languages tated hat ith s computer-type brain such as dexter reilly has , he 'll soon be able to master every anguage te world has eve known .
i think he 's given  good indication of that oday 
professor mertis , we need that boy .
he can wrap up that collee knoledge program for us .
of course , but we ca n't take any chances .
parsons ?
uhh , just a minute , quigley .

he 's an intelectual freak !
unfortunately , thi year , medfield as the horses 
are hose the horses ?
fo 10 points each , could you ie us the highest and lowet points in south america ?
te highest point is mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feet .
that is absolutely correct .
hey , i did n't try to get hi arrested , you know .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon na be a raid ?
i want to hear this .
some of that consumption was in the liquid form .
an you give the phrase in slang for the central unfrozen portion in a container of frozen cider ?
that 's absolutely right .
applejack .
hey , boss , i had nothin ' to do with this .
i swear .
what was i talkin abou ?
mr. arno , if you could please relax for just a little ...
out , out .
but ...
this is applejack .
i do n't want a trace of that operation left .
shut down ?
why ?
what 's the matter ?
whatever you say .
we got ta put that kid on ice .
look , we need time to figure this out .
hello ?
i wat the pompey palace on franklin road in charlottesville .
yeah .
you no , if that kid had n't been stopped , he 'd have mentioned every joint i own in this state .
take him out to the hancock place .
right 
no , i do n't know the area code .
hello , dexter .
go ahead .
start the car .
you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happened , lieutenant .
he was supposed to be at my houe about 8:30 las night , and he never showed up .
and nobody 's seen him since .
well , we 've hecked all over .
he has n't been in an accient nor has he been arrested .
lieutenant  i wonder if he could have had an attack of amnesia .
could e miles away by now .
mm-hmm .
i 've alerted the state patro to be on te lookout for his ar .
and if they do n't ik hi up pretty soon , then i 'm afraid we 'll have to suspect foul play .
foul play , huh ?
well , that 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean ollingsgoo over at state ?
oh , do n't you see it , quigley ?
i mean , if exter is n't back tomorrow for that college knowledge program , then spingfield state will get the $ 100,000 grant .
uh , wait a minute 
wait a minute .

well , you do n't know hi .
you do n't know him a all .
the man is ruthless .

i guess that 'll be all for now .
pete ...
i ust do n't think
animals 740 , tables 600 , amuements 500 .
applejack , charlie ...
gee , all tose laces and always appleac.
he did n't have the foggiest idea what they were .
maybe it does n't mean anything .
then all of a sudden , he mention applejack , and wham !
just like that , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses through a book on a oriental language , and then speaks it fluently , remembering every accent .
how come he doe n't remember this ?
pete , it does n't make sense .
unless ... unless he d never rea it or seen it or head it efore .
it was i the computer .
and now he blurts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missing .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack .
... for something , something he does n't want anybody to know about .
hi .
i do n't care who believes it , just as long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell them if they look up these places , they 're gon na fid out what applejack is up to .
and the reason why we know applejack is arno is 'cause it came from the omputer into dexter 's head .
and that 's why dexter does nt remember it .
come on .
that 's why pete remembered that applejack was arno .
arno ?
yeah , because it was he only thing he coud n't remeber .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered .
because he could 't ?
exactly .
well , uh , thank you , mr. schuyler .

except for the activity up in the hayloft , the arm was pretty quiet that morning .
hey could sleep through anything .
bu a lo of the other animals were awakened by all that scurrying overhead .
some of them just accepted it .
some were pretty annoyed .
but he mood was very different up in the hayloft .
she was determined to be a good mother and never yel at her kittens .
but that approach would not last very long , because milo , one of her kittens , was trouble from the very eginning .
milo , dear , his mother sai , tha ' not a good idea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a strange-looking cat , milo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
ilo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , al right , a dog .
but , um , really , deep don inside , we 're all cats , right ?
uh , o , otis barked .
he kittens were now big enough to leave the hayloft and see the world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into ouble .
he was the first to start calling out or food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to milo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down there is the river .
everyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
milo asked .
is this ?
oh !
a !
milo , get back here , his mother demanded .
bu milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by the iver .
right no .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh  milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo meowed .
i think so , milo sai .
al right , be areul , his other ordered , and bega swimming .
all right .
i 'm not going to yell , his mother said .
now dry yourself off , lie this :
and follow me back home .
that was fu .
ha , ha .
milo !
et over here !
the months passed , and the farm was humming with he sound of summer .
milo had some new hiding ace he could n't wait to try out .
oti sniffed around the yard for a whie .
you 're in the pipe , milo .
try again .
cat s in the can !
and milo slipped off to another hidig place .
it was n't easy fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tried a harder spot .
but otis found him there too .
now milo needed a brilliant idea .
aha .
he hought of a place where otis could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but milo wondered if it was really woth te trouble .
milo and otis went to see what all the commotion was about .
suddenl , one chicken 's voice rang out :
and all the hens left in a clucking flury because that was gloria talking , a young chicken who had scratched and pecked her way to the top rung of the henhouse .
gloria had a good reaso fo wanting to be alone .
there it is , felas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it inally happened .
is she stayig at home with it or is she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kick it back to you , ois 
milo asked .
otis said .
i kicked it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how long do we have to stick around this henhouse ?
until gloria comes back .
maybe you do n' realize it , milo , but this is a major day for me because ...
well , maybe you do n't realize that this is the ay i ve become a watchdog 
soe strange noises brought milo out of the enhouse 
what was all this about ?
hey !
your singing tinks .
come here , oti , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your ca buddy .
otis , come on .
at that moment , milo was teasin a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , he frog croaked .
and outside  milo and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis gowled .
just ry somethig 
probably roten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird anima .
the noise atracte a group of local snoops looking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're having a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your mommy ' a chicken .
the other animals tol otis he 'd better take the chick to gloria , an quickly , whih he did .
but the chick kept coming back to ois .
now go back to goria .
do you undestand ?
woof , the chick peepe .
woof , woof , ommy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you 've got to be a rough , tough , mean , fighting dog , like this .
okay , puppy , otis ordere .
give it a try .
momy .
o , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss him .
come on , said milo .
phew .
wow , look at this thing , otis , milo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle the score wit that --
that , uh , thing .
ha , ha .
this 'll be fun !
he , this is great .
hurry up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terrific time , but ois was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bidge up ahead .
maybe he could jup off the bridge into he ox if he hurried .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work either .
otis just coud n't swim fast enough and the river took milo farther downstrea .
ilo was nt really worried until he lost sight of otis .
suddenly he heard somethin movin in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in te box so the bear would n't ee him .
but the box was drifting right towards the hungry animal .
but unfortunately much too soon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my ize .
he ran up on the iverbank , leading the bear away fom milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he was getting a little oncerned because the river was beginnin to moe faster ... and faster .
he 'd lost track of ois now , and he was drifting farther and farther fom home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the forest .
and he heard mysterious hoots and growls and cries in the night .
he began to wish e 'd never jumped into this box and he began to wish he was home .
it seemed to be trebling as much as he was in the chilly , misty night 
he drifted o through the dakness , hoping to fid the morning waiting just around the end .
when daylight came ,
milo saw a farm on the riverbank .
for one happy moent , he thought he was home and cried out for joy .
but he ooked again .
he did n't now when he would ever see it again .
here comes the dog your life he -- ♪
the deadwoo swamp .
a bog where skeleton trees grew withou leaves or branches , and whee no creature could live , except for the dreaded deadwood birds .
and one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat .
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
look in the box .
otis prepared himelf and peeked in the box and saw only a solitary black feather .
in fact , milo was nowhee near the deadwood swamp .
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as quikly as e could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
the ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came o an open meaow where he saw a kind of animal he 'd never seen before .
feeling pretty hungry , he immediately wodered ,
is that something you can eat ?
heh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful , milo tought .
and above all , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and e began burying his lunch where he figured no oe would ever e able to find it .
yeah , here , my precious musrat .
you should be afe there till dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crept slowy own the tree and watched the fox run over the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just ow to get his paws on a big , tasty muskrat lunch .
otis  meanwhile , had traveled through the wetlands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered thee was one magic word everyone uderstood and that was please .
so he marched up o a clam hole and said ,
aw .
the clouds were getting darker and darker and a chilly ind was whipping acros the ountryside .
milo was several miles from te beach augh i the same storm .
he got a little wet and he felt awfully lonesome without otis , but at least he was safe 
the tide came in so fast that the rock otis had een sitting on was completely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd neve be able to swi to shore .
and the waer was growing higher .
now the water was up to his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he took a deep breath , but just when he was ready to dive in ..
oh , not again , the sea turtle gurgled .
every tie the tide comes i some fool gets stuck out here .
otis was n't sure what this turtle wanted .
well , no ou know .
now , just stay on the shore , where you belong , the turtle grumble .
hmph .
thanks , noting .
next time the tide comes in , i 'll have to rescue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said otis , i did n't know that 
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otis called out , i 'm looking for a fried of mine .
i have n't got time , otis said , sensing this fo was n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis was outraged .
ha !
he marveled at thi road made of wood and iron and decided to follow the road and see where it would take him .
it could 've ru right over me .
but milo was determined .
no milo was plenty ired .
you look tied and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm not sure cats know how to boun , milo said .
bound and leap , like a zephyr set fee .
bound and , of couse , leap .
it just does 't look right when i do i .
frolic with me , friend .
come , froic .
frolic .
i m frolicking .
i 'm rolicking .
you see ?
ahem 
you can stop frolicking now , the deer ooed .
i think i 'm a little tuckered out , milo said .
yes , it is posibe to over-frolic , the deer murmured .
and the deer took milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trailed milo from the deadwood samp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , maye he 'd inally fin the friend he missed so much 
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling 
as evening was faling ,
milo decied the safes place to spend the night would be in a tree .
and what are you doing up here ?
iing from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest belog to you ?
yes , and it 's not jut any nest , i 'll have you know .
i 'm te night bird , and that is a dreaing nest .
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone seeping there will have his seep flooded with dreams , the bird said .
but it 's a safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... we 'd think of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
whoo !
all right .

well , in a liteal and terrifying sense .. iside this demure young woman ... two ve vivid and different personalities ... were battling for the mastey of her character .
now , their account of the case was delivered ... to the ameican psychiatric association in 1953 ... and it 's already a classic of psychiatric literature .
the date is august 20 , 1951 .

ell , amneia means loss o memory .
is that what happens to you ?
how often does this happen 
same thing .
yes , sir .
first i get thi terrible headache ... and then i et tis spell .
no , sir .
it 's more like ..
i was playin ' out in the ackyard wit bonnie ... an all of a sudden i got this splitting ' headache ... and then the next thing i knew ...
i mean , the next thing i was conscious of , it was the next morin ' .
that 's my little girl .
how old is she ?
she 's fou and a half 
your only hild ?
i see .
yes ?
i guess not ... nothing you could say was really different .
narrator :
for several weeks , mrs. white was greatly helped by the psychiatric treatment .
e had no more blackout spells ... at least none that she was aware of .. but not quite a year later , several hings happened ... that showed her to be in urent need of help 
this one hurts .
where 'd you get these ?
they 're mommy 's .

woman :

his is ralph white , miss effie .
i thought you and evie would be on your way to hollywood by now .

ith al those prett things evie bouht .
you ought to be mighty proud of her ... the way she looks in those dresses , especially tat lilac one .
i said to mr. gilmore ...

she did n' say nothing else .
i do n't ee how she could 'cause i did n't .
you mean to tell me you did n't go into the beehive and try on those dresses for miss effie ?
they gon na take 'em back ?

that 's not true , what he said .
hat 's not true ?
i have n't been to atanta in nearly a year .
well , that 's what i mean .
why do you think he says things like that if they 're not true ?
i thought of one .
you mean , by divorce ?
but you 're not positive ?
wel , i could n't be positive of anything this quickly ... but the act you may e having spells of amesia ... does 't mean tat you 'e  what you call , losing your mind .
does n't mean that at all .
it 's no use ... 'cause i am .
you do n't wan na tell me , but i know it now .
because now i 'm hearing voices too .
what kind of voices ?
just one voie , but that 's what that means , does n't it ?
for months .
what does this voice say to you ?
a woman 's voice ?
can you recognize it in any way ?
it sounds familiar sometimes ... but i do n't eally recognize it .
to do things like ... leave ralph ... take bonnie and run away .
that is what it means , is n't it ?
you 've been frightened by this voice ... because you recognize it as a symptom of illness .
does 't make any difference .
you jut do n't wan na tell me , but it does .
feeling better no ?
i did n't have no headache .
she had one , but i did n't .

even if i do n't come out  what do you figure to do about it ?
nobody nows too much about this ... because there have n't been too many such cases ... but or a starter ...
i think i 'd like to tell eve white about you .

you are my wife .

all i was doin ' was just dancin ' .

something 's wron somewhere .
with a razor blade .
because if someody did n' top her , i 'd be gone too , you know what i mean ?
go on .
she made one slash , and then i got out , and i made her drop the blade ... and i got it and threw it away .
do you think she meat it ?
i know she meant it .
if it 'd been me , i would n't have meant it .
i understand 
but she was really leveling .
she really was gon na kill herself if i had n't stoppe her .
now i 'm aving blackout spells too .
mrs. white ?
yes , i was .
all right .
completely .
when i count to three .. you 'll be in a deep hypnotic state .
all right , now .
your eyelids are getting heavy ... very heavy .

who are you ?
i have no idea 
certainly .
how 's your heat ?
you 're kidding ?
come on .
how do you do , doctor ?
well , then you must be doctor ..

i should have known .
you mean , you have heard of me ?
yes , through both eve white and eve black .

on september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. white : dear dr. luther ...
narrator :
in winter , endless darkness is brigtened by the frisk dane of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the nor .
it 's lovely weaher for polar bear families .
one hundred and fift thousand years ao some brown bears moved north and graduall adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bear can ot thrive anywhere else .
olar bears have alwas hunted from floating platfors of sea ice .
that 's wy the arctic is warming twice as fast as any other regio .
in 1980 the summer sea ice coveed 25 percent more ocea than it does ow .
if the urrent trend continues the arctic ocean could be free of sea ice each summer by the year 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slow it dow .
most arctic laciers are melting faster than eve before .
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in search of sea ice oen has further to go .
some cubs do survive especially if the mother is a clever scavenge .
so do the inuit peope like simon qaanirq .
simon :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
ut now the ancient weather patterns have changed .
our grandfathers fed their families well .
my family has always depended on snow and ice .
sometime we fall through .
my friend adam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animals .
these dedicated mohers put over two years into raising thei young .
walrus moms spend even loner .
they dive down from rafs of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of their favorite treat .
mothers teach teir young survival skills such as scarin off intruders .
one morn sent me a very clear message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
this water is iterally as cold as ice .
the salt keeps it from freezing .
down here , there s only one exit and it s pretty scary thinking you coud be trapped .
each spring in alaska large herds of caribou set out on a long journe .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see hat the caribou mothers go through and to see this miration from their perspective .
leanne :
these newlyweds il follow the cariou all the way to their birthin grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calves are just a week or wo old , and they 're easy pickings for bears and wolves 
this is the place where te calves have heir best chance to survive .
these bugs are poenially deadly to tese caribou .
to get away .
caribou mothers are having a tough time as the artic arms .
but polar bear mothers face an even greater struggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of tis ship .
narrato :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world and mot of tem are camera-shy .
one bea was especially helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when ou 're only 3 month old .
next year we 're coming back with stronger cases .
narrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filmig them next to impossile .
then e team got lucky 
for fie days , she never eft thei boat .
because the sun never ses in the summer bedtime is anytime .
borne :
hungry males prefer seals but in a pich , they have always gone ater defenseles ubs .
the mother seemed to pick up the cent of a male .
we did 't know why she was agitated .
we finally spotted a male quite a ways off zeroing in on the mother and her cubs .
now that seals are so hard to cach , starvin males might be targeting cubs more often .
but next time things could be much different .
playful cubs can eally work up an appetite .
bjorne :
hen you want to grab a bite to eat up here timing is everything .
the cubs finish everything on their plate but the scent of fresh seal eat attracts attention .
but the male picks up the family 's sent again .
we watch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male kees gaining on the family .
then the mother turns to face him ... ... slowing him down ust long enough for her frightened cubs to escape .
at the moment of truth , the mothe sent a very clear message :
ou can get to my cubs if you want but you 'l have to kill me first .
narrator 
but he 's powerless to save the habitat they need to survive .
there are few truly wild plae left and none so majestic as this .
but te atic is warming faster tan i has for thousands o years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the others here nurture their young so lovingly 
peraps he ca inspire us to protect their home with tha same care .

we can not turn back .
captain , are you up to the task ?
why , exactly , o we need to go there ?
to find out more about this .
you can cut a can with it and still slice a tomato .
if we find out who the owner is , we 'll be cloer to finding alexander .

the others were fooed , but i know beter .
you kow where we could find this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of an island , past the rocks of malabar .
not that i 'd go looking for it .
and why should n't they ?
they do 't call him robert the terrible for nothing .
he 's the king s own brother , but he 's as ba as the king is good .
and , for his reachery , was banished from monteria .
so he 's a litte nasty .
a little ?
story ays he 's waiting for the king to step away , just long enough to grab his beloved children and take the throne for his own .
for robert to claim the throe , they must be gone !
on vaaion ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enough adventure for this gourd .
clearing tables is really kind of fu when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
where are you going ?
somewhere else .
the elpseeker brouht you ere , and only the helpseeker can send you back .
just get me bac to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're our heroes !
brave as lions and cunning a foxes 
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
who are you ?
i do n't know .
i ' like a eepy litle panda .
there 's no ilan anywhere .
i 'll leave the interpretation up to you .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work wil be done .
well , what i the map is wrong ?
that oes have a nice ring to it .
great plan , george .
raise the mast on the steafast !
we lay the haddock for a hat tric
we got te hammocks on the main deck
we go the butler doing the henpeck
screaming so
we do n't kno
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a reli from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're on the bad moo swing
we have n't done one thing
not even the minimum daily requireent
but if you 're feeling a little seasick
and you want to get off the guilt trip
what are you gon na show him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taing up the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up he lack
folowing the king 's map
steady at the wheel keep an even keel
the rocks of malaar !
well , that 's it .
the island may still lie ahead .
what i that ?
el remolino , the great whirpool !
i thought it was irae legen , but there it is .
captain geoge 's death cruise ,
brought to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thought you were o our side .
thank you , george .
might be a giat whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huh .
how about that ?
water droplets in the air reecting the sky so perfectly they block the island from view .
right o time .
and look who they left behind .
do you think there are snakes on this island ?
'cause sakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
an spiders and bears .
i do n't follow ou .
sail to the rocks , do n't find the iland , go home !
insead , i 'm stuc here with captain weather channel on my way to be sliced and diced by edward scissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i were a cave , where would i be ?
we ca n't sneak up on them in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i do n't kow .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailor were to look for me ,
the east is where he 'd start .
e 'd reach the isle of walking rocks
and the clapping pass would pat .
then gaze with pride upon my keep ,
not found on any chart ,
till he would spy my steey eye
ooh .
copyright robert the terrible .
oh , yeah .
so , what do we got ?
we head eas to ...
hoy mackerel !
what 
pieces of eight ?
spanish gold ?
even better .
cheese curs !
i 'm not going back o the boa .
what do you mean you 're not going back to the boat ?
the way i see i , i have two choices 
but , the princes , she thinks we 're heroes .
we are n't any of those hings .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
where do i start ?
how about you , my little friend ?

she 's sailing away .
maybe she did n't need them after all .

it means our wor is done .
here 's the rowboat ?
we can o home .
hold on a sec .
how long has that been here ?

we ot to help her !
come on !
listen , when the ball blinks , our work is done and we can go home .
do n't ou wan to go home ?
but i also want them to want to see me .
you know , maybe the reason hey do n't look up to me is because i have n't given them something worth looking up to .
it was wrong about that .
it could be wrong about this , too .
if ou want to go home , you can go home .
but eloise needs me .
let 's go save a princess !
help is on the way !
what kind of a crazy b movie am i in ?
let 's be reasoable .
i was n't really going to eat you , but you wee impersonating a snack food !
i think you 're right .
then we 'll just have to ollow the clues .
head east to the island of walking rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like roahes 
i bet george knew about those litle things from the eather channel , too .
it is n't worth it .
eaten by his own favorite snack food .
at least tha one day , from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'd ant me to come back .
what ?
sorry , boys !
gourd is off the menu !
what do you want  robert ?
indeed .
he took monteria ' wealth , our wealth , my wealth , and squandered it on stranger .
hen the crown is mine , i can once again enjoy the benefits of royalty .
you 're not stong enough to take te crown fro my father 's head .
of ourse , i ca n't just leave them in the habor waiting , or i 'll blow up my own ships .
he id n' say .
alexande !

if you can anage to remember ,

put them in their cell .
oh , papa 's got a pork chop , nellie ,

after the 32nd verse , i grates .
but there 's supposed to be a pass .
right .
you think that 's the island of walking rocks ?
it 's got rocs , but they do n't appear to be goig anywhere .
look at us , we 're walking rocks
la-lala-la-la

uh-huh .
yep .
and you 're in on this , too ?
mmm .

let her go !
it wa al a misunderstanding .
we 're no heoes .
we work in a restauran .
we lear dishes .
we clean up .
that 's right .
he 's so lay , he a n't even climb a ladder without giving up .
and george there , he 's such a wimp , even his own son thinks he 's a loser .
when all hope is gone , help will come from above in the shape o a donkey .

on the wins of a snowwhite dove
he sends his pure sweet love
on te wings of a now-white ove
he sends is pure sweet love
a sign from above
a sign from above
a sig from above
it 's a iracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
i thought someone should tell you .
father tardone .
fathe pat  before you start espousing yet another miracle , i advise you to take a breath .
he is with us here in auburn .
the people from the revival of angels meetin are all talking about it .
another miracle .
a revival tent ?
i warned you abou this josua .
hey  i 'm not te only one .
everyone says it 's a miracle .
i have kept y eye open and my vision clea , like you advised me to ,
corrupte ?
as soon as this joshua completes the statue , i want you to end you association with him .
he 's my friend .
good morning .
good morning , bihop .
thank you fo seeing me .
i 'll get right to he point .
he seeed simpe enough , but he 's shown a poweful influence over a great many people .
the protetant clergy and i would like ...
and the purpose of this meeting would be to investigate these miracles ?
we all have better things to do with our time .
that i 'm glad o hear .
that i 'm glad to hear .
my own father hayes folows im around like a lost puppy .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
this is a small fire , father ardone .
father ardone , helo .
how are you ?
it 's te artist you have a probem with .
i 'm surprised you ound time to finish our work , considering all your other chores .
i suppose i do n't hink of tem as chores .
you know , father , we could use your help own at the baptist church .
join ou 
it 's the others whose eyes are not open 
to what ?
a miracle worker ?
i have never ade that claim .
a miracle worker ?
and i think it 's time for everyone else to find out .
it looks very ice .
yes , they 've definitely made progress .
i know most of you .
what joshua has persuaded you to o ith this church is wonderful 
bu i want you all to look ...
does anyone do omething for nothing ?
does a complete stranger offer to help without wanti somehing i return ?
preaching ?
i o n't think you know what thi is .
it 's a love leter 
a love letter ?
wat about sin and god s law ?
how dare you assume the role of the clergy ?
wai a minute .
what joshua has done is a miracle .
living next to eac other did n't make us neighbors .
make us care about one another , did it ?
but by working together here with joshua --
led y him .
come on .
see the good in this man -
i you can look at this church and ho everybody here has changed for the better ...
and say , this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no , no .
whatever it is you sand for , ather tardone , i do n't want to be a part of .
i ca n't .
i wo 't wear this anymore .
i wo n't take it .
ay god have mercy on you .
he 's just afraid .
no .
about this .
i am part of the clergy in this own , and , uh ,
i 'm too-
so i might as well ...
it 's not true  pat .
what do you know about being a priest , joshua ?
what do you know about the responsibility i feel ?
you 're just a guy .
you 're just a guy .
it just needs to be understood , an --
you 're wrong  pat .
i , maggie .
made it just in time .
now , theo , since you 're the first one who came to help , you shoud be the one to put the bell on the teeple .
take it eay , now .
that thing is big .
theo , can you hear me ?
you 're gon a wake up .
our work 's not done .

a cetifiably ead person and you brought him back to life .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
i turned my back on my vocation .
but i have overcome my crisis of faith .
i am not resigning .
i promise you , fater pat , the vatican shall know of this , and when they do , this miracle worker will vanish .
he will imply ru awa .

once is all it takes if it 's the right one .
i ha such dreas about all of them living around .
dozens of cildren , visitig back and forth at christmas and birthdays .
if benjamin goes , then another will go .
i you could just get a look at yourselves ..
if you 're sweet on them , why do n't you do something about it ?
they were in the same fix you 're in .
they was opening up new territory , and women were scarce , like here 
course  this being oregon and go-feaing territory ou 'd have to capture a parson .
they the ones i heard about settled north of here ?
no , this was in olden day .
i read about it in milly s book .
a book !
why , this is history .
this really happened .
tell you about them sobbing ' women who live in the oman days
so they too them all back home to dry
seems they cried and kissed and kisse and cried
all over that roman countryside
so do n't forget that
when you 're taking a bride

gather roun , i ll tell you .
they never did return their plunder
o rotundas small but cute
them women was sobin ' , sobbing ' , sobbin '
passin ' them nights
while the romans was out hobnobbin ' , starting up fights
is that so ?
they kept occupied by sewing lots of little old togas fo them tots and aying ' , someday womefolks will have rights
-while the romans had fights
listen to this .
when the menfolk went to fetch them
the women would not be fetched
now  let this be because it 's true
a lesson to the likes of you
or else they 'll think you 're tetched
oh , they acted angry and annoyed
them poor little dears
why are you sitting there ?

it 's actuall about a young , energetic , dynamic , even a sexy einstein .
what would i see if i rode on a beam of light ?
perhaps some sor o electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
what ?
it is my great ambitio to demonstrate that nature is a close system ;
the people ..
laoisier .
why ascribe o an object a vague an immeasurable force like vis viva ?
it is a return to the old ways !
are you capable of discovering somethig of your own 
there is no right time for the truth .

thank you .
its author was a youthful albert einstein .
it 's the most famous equation in the world :
all aboard !
ut wile we 've all heard of einstein 's big idea , very few of us know at it means .
we 've only got sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but first ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughing at einstein .
he 'd united in one stunning insight the work of many who had come before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't think in terms of energy ;
oe lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteie of nature would begin to change all that .
young michael farada hated his job .
he was uneducated , the son of a lacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder 's apprenice .
but faraday craved one thing .
al of his free time and his meager wages were poue into his sel-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of ourse , of course ..
pass , ass .
tis way to a better life .
in the early 1800s , science was the pursui of gentlemen , something faraday was clearly not .
he had a rudimentary education , he 'd read widely , e 'd goe to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets to hear sir humphry davy , the most prominent chemist of the age .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of their day .
their lectures were hugely popular .
tickets were hard to oe y  and davy reveled in his status .
they 're waiting .
metals . unknown , that is , until i isolated potassium from molten otash and sodium , as i showed you last ime , from common salt .
help me be part of the great circle that is your work and love .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trade , which i find vicious and selfish , and to become a servat of sience , which , i imagine , makes is pursuers amiable and liberal .
realy ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of a few years to set you right on that score .
look , i have n't anything at the moment 
faraday was determined to beak free from his daily toil .
newman ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhaps with god an araday in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe in our place of work .
just stick to your job and do as you 're tod and you 'l be fine , faraday .
faraday became the laboratory asistan , eagerly asorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excitement of the day was electricity .
another charge , newman 
but no one realy understood what tis strange force of electricity was .
the academic establishment at the time thought that electricit was  you know , like a fluid floig through a pipe , pushing its way alon .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showed that when you pass a eletric current through a wire and place a comass near it , it deflected he needle at righ angles .
faraday , come look at this .
perhaps you can work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing finding .
now , that is rearkable .
but if the electrical force is flowing through the wire , why does the needle not move in the same direction , parallel to the wire ?
again , newman .
what ?
perhaps some sort o electical force is emanatig outwards fro the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you that at he university of cambridge , elecricity flows through a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridge , but it does n't explain what 's happening before our eyes .
no , no , let 's just get o .
it wa a fascination inspired by his religion .
for him , the problem as a way to understand god 's hidden steries .
there is a small , almost persecuted group in london called the sandemanians .
they wee a religious ...
faraday was a member of that group .
that if you opened up one little par of it , you could see how everything was connected .
faraday was different from anybody else .
b methodically placing a compass all around an electrified wire ,
faraday started to notice a attern .
and then he imagined hat a magnet had similar lines emerging from it and that those lines would get caught up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath  i 'm shaking .
yes .
thi is the experiment of the century .
scale up te magnets and he wires , make the really ig , attach heavy eights to them and they 'll be draged along .
although he di n't realize it at the tie ,
the chemicals in the battery had been transformed into electriity in the wire , whih had combined with the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these various forces there was a common energy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston mae o all this ?
he 's writen to me and assures me that he 's taken no offense , ad he acknowledges that wha i published was etirely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
and what do you think ?
faraday , my dear boy , you have my vote .
it 's the sciene that counts .
so , tell me , how does this wire of yours spin round is magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i see a swirling arra of lies of orce spinning out of the electrified wire like a spiraling web .
but invisible lines of force ...
it 's all a bit vague , is n' it ?
faraday , might i have a word in private ?
listen , faraday , let 's stop this nonsense .
i want you to take down your allot paper from he notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paer up .
i will not take it down .
my father and uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing electic light to the streets of germany .
from an early age , i loved to look at machines , understand how things work .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle when my father showed me a compass .
there had to be something behind objets that lay deeply hiden 
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whichever way they run , herr proessor .
einstein 's teachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shon , that energy could be converted from one form into another .
tey also believed that all forms o energy had already been discovered .
einstein wa going to pove them wrong .
deep in the hear of matter .
a hundred years efore einstein s birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolution was just around the corner .
and they felt that one of the first tasks that lay ahead of them was to rationalize and to classify every single kind of matter o they could see how it all interacted together .
anoine lavoisie , a wealthy , aristocratic young ma , ecided to take up this task , to see if there was some basic connection between all the stuff of everyday life :
all the different substances in the world .
his meticuous , even obsessive attention to detai ...
was also to be hi downfall .
your precise obsevations commend you as a lady of scientific cuiosity ,
most unusual .
for the last five weeks , i hae taken nothing but milk .
i would rather die than fast on milk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the greates of respect to a member of the royal academy of sciences , your gu must think your hroat has been slit 
how dare you insult the count ?
do n't foge what the count offers .. not ust marriage , ut think of ow you will be inroduced to all the salons .
you will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to marry d'amerval ?
then i must contrive to save you .
laoisier was n't a scientist by profession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes on the simple things in life ...
did not endear him to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidious young man did still allow himself the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anne paulze , the daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thus e saved her , as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 years her elder .
allow me to show you something .
what wil happen if i take a bar of opper o iron an leave it outside in the rain for months on end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur avoisier ?
the metals ...
is this a erbal examination prior to an examination proper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let me press you further .
hmm ?
every last citizen in france of sensible age kows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lighter and eventually disappears .
ah , but ..
i have not finished .
contain yourself , sir .
there is more .
in a recently published pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier demonstrates that the iron combines with the air .
it , in fa , becomes heavier .
she learned english so that she could ranslate contemporary cientific works .
monsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheeky man 
messieurs ... it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system , that in an transformation , no amount of matter , no ass is eer ost and none is gained .
over here , please .
from this end we cool the steam but , interestingly , we collect less water than we tarted with .
so clearly we lose a certain amoun of water .
now , when we combine these two increases ...
the new weight o the iron barrel and he gas we have olleced ...
they are exactly equal to the weight of the los water .
so what he had done i get the oxygen to tick o the inside of a red-hot iron rifle barrel .
now  that left the hydrogen , what he caled combustible air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
in te net few months i hope to demonstrate that i can recombine this combustible air with vital air and transform them both back into water .
i will re-create exactl te same amount of water that was los here in thi process .
it is my hope to complete the cycle ...
but to prove this , he had to perform thousands of experiment , ad he had to do the measuements with incredible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth fro being a tax colletor came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
he academy asked you o assess his desins .
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to peddle .
monieur .
i have invented a device which poects an image of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device renders the substance of fire visible .
have you ollected it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monsieur .
no , no .
if you will you exuse me .
i am extremely busy today .
thank you .
so tat is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not conform to te version of the truh as laid down by the acadey .
lavoisier .
he talks about facts , e worships the truth .
liste to me , my friend .
they are all the same , he roal academies ...
the insul the liberty of te mind .
they tin they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core ...
do n't worry .
in my next pamplet i will expose this persecutor of your .
the crowning glory of this opus was their remarkable use of satic electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to te frech revolutionaries of 1790 ,
he was denounced by a failed scientist turned radical journalist ,
lavoisier !
an all the rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a century later , all of nature had been lassified into wo great domains .
there was eergy ... he foces hat animated objects ;
and there was mass ..
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mighty pillars .
the laws that governed one did not apply to the other .
but young , newly enrolled physics student albert einstein did n't like laws .
extremely well , herr einstein .
al the better for seeing you have escaped the physics laboratory with your ife .
that 's about all you ever do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein maric .
would you care to take a walk with e ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell you what you have missed i lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinatios with just incredible determination .
we know from hi letters that einstein , even from the age of 16 , was literaly obsessed with the nature of light .
everyone he could speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on thi beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us just imagine we two are youg ...
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to elp me to uderstand .
what would we see , do you think ...
with light he woud reivent he universe and ind a hidden pathway that would unite energy and mass .
it stands or celeritas ...
long before the 19th century , sientists had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what ligh actualy was .
invisible lies that ca emanate from electricity in a wire , from a magnet or ... even from he sun .
for it is my contetion that ight itself is just one form of these vibrating lines of electromagnetism .
maxwell and the ain faraday became close friends .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that magneic charge moves , it creates a little piece of electricity 
electricity .
electricity and magnetism are interwoen , lie a ... a neverending braid .
so it is always pulsig forward .
michael .
670 million miles per hour .
tha i the speed of light !
well  that means you were rigt all along .
mawell had proven faraday right .
we have lectures in half an hour .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwell and think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they said you could never catch up to a beam of light .
even if you were traveling at 670 million miles an hour , you would still see light squiggle away from you at 670 milion miles an hour 
yes .
you see how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are travelig at the same speed .
but relative to her  it just sits there .
so is light like that ?
common sense would say that if you caught up to a ligt beam , tere would be a wave of light just sitting there .
maybe it would be shimmeing , a bit of electricity and a bit of magnetism .
so if she was traveling alongside the light wae , it woul n't be moving .
it would be static .
but maxwell says you ca n't have static light .
maybe maxwel is wron 
the light travels from my face to the miror and i see my face .
that does n't make sense .
einstein was about to enter a surreal universe where energy , mass and the speed of light intermingled in a way no one had ever suspected .
long before the fench revolution , scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtelet 's translation is still the standard text in france today .
muse , my memory cause ...
for what offence te queen of heaven began
o persecute so brave , so just a man !
only the other night ,
i fear , however , that m wit is only a curiosity to others .
if only my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use the both and the world will fal at your eet .
no ..
in one sense , she is a woman utterly out of her rue time and place .
du châtelet married a general in the french ary at age 19 and had thee children .
she ran a buy household , all the while pursuing he pasion for science 
she was 23 whe she discovere advanced athematics .
she enthusiastically too lessons from one of the greatest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expert on newton , and she was his eager oun student 
it seems they had a brief affair .
a fierce critic of the kig and the catholic church ,
voltaire had been in pison twice and exiled to england  where he ecame enthralled by the ideas o newton .
du châtelet id him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of jail .
and it is also true that émilie du châtele did have several affairs of a fleeting nature .
bravo !
she created an institution to rival that of france 's royal academies of sciences .
a , monsieur ...
you are young .
i hope that soon you will judge me for my own merits , or lack of them , but do not look upon me as an apendage to this great general or that renowned scolar .
i am i my own right a whole perso , responsible to myself alone for all tha i am  all that i say ... all that i do .
du châtelet learned from the brilliant men around her , but she quicly developed ideas of her own .
muc to the horror of er mentors , se even dared to suspect hat there was a flaw in the great sir isaac neton 's thinking .
newton stated hat the energy of an oject , the force with which it collided with another object , could very simpy be accounted for by its mass times its velocity .
he proposed that moving objects had a kind of inner spirit .
if you say a garden i four square , you mean that it might be built up by four sabs along one edge and four along the oter .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplication , this building up b squares , is omething you find in nature all the time .
it is a return to the old ways !
it is the occult !
so al leibniz is askig is , where does all this force come from ?
you 're infuriating !
criticize this , denouce that .
i discovered you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been dopping lead bals into a pan of clay .
so , messieurs , care for a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct  the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
messieurs ,
i feel mr. newto 's reputaion dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis !
well ... the ball travels fo times further .
it 's the best way to express the energy of a moving object .
if you drie a car at 20 miles an hour , it takes a certain distance to stop if you slam on the brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
o e careful , madame .
do you think the academy is ready for such an opinion ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being a woma .
i 'm afraid that ...
or is it your husband 's 
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du châtelet knew that in the 18th century for a woman to becoe pregnant at the age of 43 was really very dangerous , and all the while she was pregnant she ha terible premonitions aout what was going o happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a oung oldier that led to her demise .
six days after giving birth to her fourth child , she suffered an embolism and died .
einstein pursued light right through university and beyond .
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors that no one ould write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the oun famiy struggled .
but , listen ..
about your romotion .
i 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very carming , but kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the worl fits in around him , ta 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't bother him .
i 'll tell you wat is truly mysterious :
the mahematic are fine , if a little unconentional , but this only works for bi systems .
i disagree 
hee we go ...
what would happen if one applied those formulae to electromagnetic radiation ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bit of physics a apply it without proper regard to a completely different area .
why not ?
i kow you like the gand linkages , the ig theoies , but would n't thigs be better all round if you just ot going in some small area ?
spoen like a true bourgeois .
the had cornered the question of light from every possible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it woul take light to reach them from clocks at different distances ,
thank you .
what einstein id was competely turn the problem on its head .
that light would always move away from you at 670 million mies an hour  even if you , too , were traveling really fast .
his extraorinary insight is that ime ... as you approach the peed of light , time iself will slow down .
i 's a monumental shift in how we see the world .
you see , before then people had assumed that time was like a wristwach on god 's hand , that it beat at a seady rate throuhout the universe , no matter were you were .
that the tick , tick , tick of this wristwatch was actually te click , click , click
of electricity turning ino magnetism turning into electricity .
it start with his publication of a paper on how to work out the true size of atoms .
two months later i the publication of his aper on the naure of light ...
that 's what will earn him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sets out his theory of ligt , time and space .
it was the theory of pecial relativity .
in einstein 's ne world , the one true constan was not time or even space , but light .
in one last great 1905 paper , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from our point of view , the rain actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredile idea .
even einstein is amazed by it .
i think i have found a connection between energy and mass .
if i am right , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for pubication .
in three pages he simply stated that energy and mass were connected by the square of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year journey into light .
there is a deep unity between energy , matter and light .
you multipl that by itself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in cience ends in silence .
the artices are published to resounding .
i think the gods are laughing at e .
for four years einsein swered each inquiry dutifully  trying to explain his difficult , complex ideas to a confused physics community .
here are these universe-hanging papers circling around , and the word is . stuggling to coe to ters with them 
lukily it happened to be the most important living physicist .
he has sent his asistant .
after four ears o waiting , he is appointed professor of physics at zurich university .
from there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he ivorced mileva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 beame the holy grail of science 
it held out the promise of vast reserves of energy ocked deep inside the atom .
but he had n't banked on the second wold war and the genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germay .
28-ear-old austrian lise meiner was painully shy .
despite her anxiey , the young doctor of physic arrived in berlin determined to pursue a career in the exciting new field o radioactivity .
german universities did not eploy female graduates .
otto hahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i think i could really help with the physical anaysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematics .
studying radioactive atos has become so uch a collaoratio between emistry and physics hese days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fisher for a laboratoy , hen .
at this tie , not a lot was known about te atom .
but then .. in what are called radioactive metas , things lie radium and uraium ...
the nucleus itself seeme to be unstable , leaking out energy and particles .
the mass o a nucleus turning ino energy .
he was given a laboratory .
she was forced to work in a wood shop .
i see you ave nt set your hair on fire .
good day , herr han .
good day .
yes , where would we chemists be without the steading hand of te physicist ?
oh ?
es , edith .
yes , well , i have , um .. aked her to marry me , an she has accepted .
oh ..
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased or you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was warm-hearted by nature .
she had many friends and she may have wanted to have a coser relationship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear research .
meiter and hahn wee leading the race to see if eve bigger nuclei could be created by adding more neutrons .
so ... te atom , pretty familiar :
the nucleus , made up of protons ... and neutrons 
now , the largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers our institute .
he was hounded out of germany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
what is it ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ...
we 're speaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn , who was known for his anti-nazi views , did his best to protect her , at least initially .
not now , i 'm too bus .
we have to protect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbidde to leave german .
lise ...
horlein demans hat you leave .
you ca n't throw her out .
horlein says you should not come into the institute anymore 
well , i have to write up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to come in .
you 've given up .
when it became clear that meitner would be dismissed and probably arrested , physicists all around europe wrote letters inviting her to conferences  giving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague traveled to berlin and illegall took lise bac with him on a tain to holland .
she had ot everything ...
her home  her posiion , her books , her salary , her penion , een her native language .
she had been cut off from her work just at the time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
no matter what privaion she sufered ,
aunt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getting strange results .
he found o evience to suggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size 
fo aar , she was staring to suspect that omething very diferent was happening in their experiment .
hahn and strassman are gettig oe strange reults with the uranium work .
really ?
a coule of moths ago , hahn old me that they were finding radium amongst the uranium products .
and now he rites to me and tels me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but hat s even smaller .
i is at east possible that barium is being produced .
so hahn still needs you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done what you told hi to .
it turns out that a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now or four years , meitner an hahn and all other physicists had thought that if you pump more neutrons into tis nucleus , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
ealized this nucleus might just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so ig that it has trouble staying together  then could n't just a little , tiny jo from a neutron ...
how much energy 
but something has to supl that energy .
einstein 's e = .c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no , no .. ou 've spli the ato .
of ourse , in the laboratory we re talking about tiy amounts of uranium and correspondingy tin amounts of energy .
but the point is that the amount of energy released was relatively large and that came from the mass of the uranium itself .
eitner and frisc pulished the discoery of what they called nuclear fission
to great accaim .
but betrayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it wa he and not meitner who had discovered nuclear fission .
shall my scientific past also be taken from me ?
and why is it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but hat as enough .
in 1942 , an intense effort to build an atom bomb was begun .
all over america , secret installations sprang up uder the code name the manhattan proec .
she refued to have anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but robert risch was different .
vast amounts of energy , in the form of electromagnetic radiation , were released from a few pounds of uranium and plutonium .
today , young physicist carry on einstein 's quest .
ever since is birth ,
e = m.c2 has been used to delve into the epths of time , to answer the iggest question of all ...
in he first moments of reation , the universe was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated erupion of enegy .
as it rushed apart and expanded  huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atoms and i eventually formed he first stars .
it comes out as energy .
the hole process actually creates life itself .
eventually , a massive star dies , he debris floats around , clusters together , gets pulled into the orbits of another star and becomes a planet .
building o the work of sientists through the ages , new generations are searching for answs .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyful .
it is as old as human curiosity itself and never , ever ends .

no , it 's an expression , stuart .
the thing about being a little is that you can look at any situation no matter how blea  how hopeless and still see the bright side .
so you could find a new friend , too .
meantime , keep your chin up your ack staight ad you heart open .

i did n't know a thing about baseball .
the spors editor wanted the woman 's angle .
all i knew was hat pittsburgh was losing .
he 's out !
maybe even angry .
what 's the matter with you ?
he was safe by that muh !
all right .
... on one base was too many .
you 're out !
great , that 's the first time you three guys have been together all season .
the score at the end of the game was cincinnati 21 pittsburgh 2 .
you through , jenny ?
you hit them on a bad day .
yeah ?
yeah , they had a good one back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should talk to mcgovern .
everybody should talk to mcgoven once .
how do i get down there ?
you see tha secon tunnel there ?
yeah .
the door on the right is the pirate clubhouse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates ' exhibition this afternoon reducing their tanding to seventh pace in the national league .
by the way , i 'll not be ith you for the balance of the season .
steps hae been taken and briely , your annoucer has been canned .
i 'll still have m regular tuesday-ight broadcast and wednesday televisio and i sall continue to call the lays a i see tem .
this is red bayle saying , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
no , no , lady .
press .
gangway .
he 's unhappy .
i think it was a waste of time to send me .
i do n't know the game and i have n't an sory .
bu i can tell you what 's wrong with the pirates that mcgovern person 
and all hose nie , clean-cut young men and the way he bullies them .
no wonder they make mistaes , anybody would 
if you ask me , the pitsburgh pirates would be a ot better off without him .
hey , write it .
but he 'd sue us .
do your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anyody die out there ?
what a depessing job .
mr. kirney must hae liked the story .
by jennifer paige , 'household hints ' editor .
every morning about 1 1:00 , he left for the ield .
this is the only hack i pittsburgh ?
you kno the law , sonny .
you 're supposed to stay with our cab 
the bums do 't start until 1:30 
his afternoons were pent like this .
the only place he was seen in pubic , ouide te ballpark was john 's steak house .
i 'm going over and tak to him .
o  stop .
well , there he is , conered .
waiter ?
i  jennifer paige .
i wrote that story about you this morning , in the messenger .
well , i began this way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evil-ongued orator of the baseball field , is a surly , unbred goat whose mouth should be washed out with a trong detegent .
you 're not ad ?
i do household hints on the ladies ' page .
but i ave a few facts and figures about your --
a few statitics at might be interesting .
for instance , last season , minelli ad a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i 'll have to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's average is way own too , 93 points .
he 's the obiuary eitor .
what do you hear from want ads ?
well , i realize igures can be misleadin but whe an entire team goes as sour as the pirates well , i look around for a reason , and i look right at you .
how are things in seventh place ?
catch me toight , i 'm on in a hou .
i 'm gon na run you out of this town , maybe right out of organized baseball 
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in here a minute , huh ?
beore i say good night , i would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unbiased observer who as te best interest of baseball at heart .
there is nothing personal in my feu with guffy mcgoven .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final score :
the pirates had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all by yourself .
did you think that a second base ?
you 're gon na catch a fl ball ome of these days and nock your front teeth .
you fellas ma not believe this but saul once pitched a two-hitter in a worl serie .
but he 's still in there pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do nt you think you 're old fo this pastime ?
we used to ave a guy like that in the three-i league .
put gunpowder in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern always been like this ?
sixteen yeas ago .
where 's my good-luck piece ?
well , where is it ?
of all he emty-headed , buck-brained trainers .

before he answers those prayers he 'd like to clean you up .
there 's certain rules .
i ll give them to you fast .
quit making life miserable for everyboy around you .
why ca n't i see you for one moment ?

stand still and listen or i 'll blast you with a bolt of lighting .

if i had , i never would have - oh , what a mess this lace is .

goat , monkey , i 'm used to it .
if i were you , i 'd protect myself , mcgovern

that 's wonderful .
but doe n't he ever -- ?
miss paige , a man only sear when he 's annoyed .
well , frankly , i do n't see how you can be in a shambes lie this .
there might be an idea in that .
even when you were little ?
you had a boyhood , of course .
sounds like a nice litle own .
did you play ball there ?
they had one of the saloons .
and one day they gave you a bal and a bat , and that 's how you got started .
not exacy .

put an air wick in to get rid of that cigar smell --
scour te ashtrays with ammonia .

i could be a big help to you .
ust what i always needed , a girl with tuned-up shoes , 110 .
yeah .
if i took her o the ball game and we sat in he grandsand out of the sun se would n't see any anels .
i 'd write the story just tha way  and that 'd be the end of it .

bridget an i got pretty chummy during the game , exchanging girlish confiences .
vanilla okay ?
mac , i think that 's enough .

well , have fun .
hat must be nice .
i mean , instead of having a lot of kids aroud all the time .
it depends .
i aways say , hy not live alone if you ca live alone ?
tae like if you have someone around the house all the time you could n't even come to the ball game when you waned .

you speak to angels ?
where they running ?
is n't it wonderful ?
his latest peccadilo , a admission to the press that he converses with angel ... .
you could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he no comands .
i would lie to ask mr. cgovern a question .
would you tell us your name , please ?
i 'm a grounskeeper at braves field , up in boston .
will you please tell us what you saw in braves field about seven weeks ago ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern .
afte the game .
sitting on seco base .
and what was he doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
here was n't anyody there .
and when he was sitting on secon base talking to somebody who was n't there  where was he looking ?
up .
but one thing he aid was , i have a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir 
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable man to ag around second base at night and talk to angels ?
much as i hesitate to say this i think that mr. mcgovern should take a long , long perhaps pemanent rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a ball ame , so ooray .
i tell you , it 's making me jumpy .
every time i go after a ball , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over something .
for two cents , i 'd quit right ow .
shut up .
you watch mcgovern looking over his houlder every two econds ?
i o n't care , he 's trying to be a right gu .
your job is to got out and play ball .
keep your mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he comes .
ad here 's a flash that was just handed to me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baeball , will arrive in pittsburgh tonight .
with the pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgover are in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this aftenoon .
with this hanging over heir heads , there 's no teling what they 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
they 're geting nervous .
not that i blame them  but i it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't worry much about it .
it s only natura at a time like this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleep nights , i do n't ea 
oh , that o ?
you know , i used four this afternoon .
who do i start tomorow ?
yeah .
wel , i woul n't worry about it .
even i could n't make him look good 
they wan na send hi o he minors .
that wo n't make any differene , he wo n't be aroud next season .
eah .
at least , we use to be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
his way , commissioner .
gentlemen  i have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidence , i have noting to say .
.. tomorrow for the penant .
i 'm aware of that .
think this is the proper time for the investigation ?
my dear lady , any time 's the proper time when the situation warrants it .
aseball is for the people who support it .
from new york , sir ?
and two , is it ossible to talk to them ?
originally , man worshipped the sun , the moo , stones , trees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child will u to its parent so will a ma turn for comort to a belief in angels .
and whe this belief takes he form of actual conversation with angels what is your profesional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
ye ?
yes , yes , of couse .
dr. eustae anforth , trinity church .
rabbi allen han , temple iael .
how do you do ?
father o'houlihan , hurch of ou lady , queen of the agel .
gentlemen , just make yourselves comfortable .
mr. commissioner ?
well , what do you think ?
do you suppose there might be agels ?
righ to left .
to deny the exisene of angels is to deny he word of the holy bible which is specific on the subject .
from the ancient hebrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sons of god .
than you , rabbi .
it was an angel who guided the cildren of israel to the promised land .
the angel of he lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them .
seeing as how there are coveys of angel flitting through the page of the holy scriptures , old ad new testaments i do n't see how i can get out of saying i beliee i them 
i imagine the commissioner does too .
oh , please , just leave me out of this .
r. commissioner ?
is i likely one of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like guffy mgovern ?
is it possible that angels would aid and comort such a man 
thank you , entlemen .
i dr. blane would care to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
howeer --
mr. commissioner .
ister , will you please get her out of hee ?
mr. mcgovern , what are you afraid o ?
all right .
bridget white , 8 years old .
st. gabiel 's home for orphan irls .
does nt everyone ?
no .
they were helping the pirates .
you re quite sure about that ?
you would n' just make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certainly , certainly , certainly .
no .
because mr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angel ould be prou to talk o a nice man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , please .
what are you talking about ?
i will decide what is evidence here .
suppose i id ?
hy , r. mcgovern .
nothing definite .
i do n't know if the court will let me have her .
it 's touching 
come on , stop that .
stop that .
order .
gufy , do n't .
getlemen , i think  i view of te facs all things considered this case is dismissed .
hey , felas , wha 's with guffy ?
sure , sure .
he was okay all the time .
he ai n't o more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , you heard hat the fella said .
just stick to your driving , wil you ?
i only hit him once or twice .
because when you busted tha bidgework , you also busted our agreement .
from now on , you 're on your own .
it 's no joke .
you ca n't walk out on me now .
i need you .
do n't worry , you 've been on your own a lot he last eight weeks .
i do n't like to be on my on .
you used to e .
you 've learned something , guff .
we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , ca n't make it .
tell that cab driver to slow dow .
so long , guffy .
come back here a minute , will you ?
the boys in the press box ae asking .
they wan na kno who 's gon na pitch .
let 's do it , boy .
for new york , barberry catching , toley pitching .
hellman ?

eah , sure .
and it 's over the let-field wall for a home run .
safe .
there 's another hi .

let 's go .
here we are at the top of the ninth , the final frame with a score still pittsburg 2 , new york 1 .
one away .
seems to be giing him some trouble 
either it 's pain or those giant averages .
and he takes his base .
hit by a pitched ball .
well , hellman seems to be losing control in there .
leapin high in the air and spearing the ball .
he 'll never mae it .
ball one .

the fans are yelling to take ellman out .
get him out of there !

so e 're here to warn you
that there 's a new criinal mastermind in our midst .
to brainwash .
malcolm , what are we gon na do ?
you were rigt .

whatever evidence there was is compleely fried .
thank you .
yes ?
speaking of fried ,
is that your chicken i smel 
ok , chin up , chin up , chin up .
shoulders back just a little bit more .
shoulders back .
'cause nobody respects a superhero that slouches .
that 's why they kicked him out .
that 's right .
other than watching out for the rees --
and fences !
... is that you have to go fast enough
so nobody can see you .
see ya .
scott , scott .
but you can practice flying at anytime .

spin around , and ...
arms up , bring it down ,
and pop the head -- salsa ...
pirouette ...
oh !
alex !
what are you doing here ?
are the rumors true ?
ninth-grade biology .
it definitely has its challenges .
i was , uh , alking to bob humphrey .
exactly .
he 's now one of the hotshots on the web .
and music sites .
and ?
and they 're looking for a head
hmm .
enough .
bobby 'll doube it - at least !
but no one with your skills or expeience .
now with this teachig thing o top of it ...
they even have an office in ondon .
right ...
it 's only the term progress report ,
not an actual report card .
yea , but even he would n't kick her off
it 's always been a pain !
wat are we gon na do ?
well , let 's just talk o ms. bartlett .
chicas !
hat 's going on  mariol ?
s !
you 're wrong !
ms. bartlett ares about us --
eah , right .

marisol heard ou confirm it .

and tell you that you were the best ?
and they asked me to start on monday .
i thought we mattered to you .
after all our hard work !
i turne them down .
you really did ?
we 're a team .
ms. bartlet :
are you ready ?
well , what if we considered thi one , big extra-credit project ?
yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,
and i 'll check her calculations .
then you can talk to her math teacher ,
see if he 'll raise he grae to a d .
that could work .
but you have to get her to take it very seriousl .
if yolanda does n't deliver an accurate tabulation ,
he 's off the dance team .
i like your optimism .
thanks .
boy 
enjoy .
hey !
olanda !
so ho ae we doing ?

lynell eliot is out there .
it certainly took me long enough to figure this out 
an being your best .
aiming to be the best is --
it 's fruitless .
it 's a matter of opinion .
you have doe this 50 times in ehearsal .
and do you know there is more value
and that 's more contagious
than having a thousand trophies .
and forget about lynell elliot .
forget everything ...

ah , so good for the skin .
oh , uh , no shoes in house .
buffrog , wonderful home .
oh , thank you .

lease take a seat .
oh !
i thouht everyone knew that .
yo , buffro , where them babie at ?
babies , say hello to queen butterfly .
star , i have been so worried about you .
why ?
i 'm good .
well  when ludo took our castle ,
toffee is dead .
toffee not ead .
toffee inside ludo .
papa !
we have o go sae hi .

star , i 'e made my decision .
we stay here .
excuse me .

thank ou .
i 'm sorry .
yeah , we all are 
of course .
you have plan ?
i have plan .
okay .
distract me from what ?
bad choices i past .
uh , we could smah bugs .
great idea , bufrog .
your daughter is very strange .
we have many option of board game .
mmm , interesting .
okay , the rules o uddle defender are , uh ...
um ... the rules are ..
yes ?
the evil bloodthirsty mewman , tat 's you , must try and sneak past watchful monster parent , that 's me .
tat is horrile !
one , to , three , four , five , six , seven .
you are filthy mewman .
for better eating of onster babies .
is this un ?
did you hear somethig ?
i hear nothing .
can you name a time when monsters have ever done such a thing ?
that idea had to come from somewhere .
because it as in a children ' board game ?
i just think that monstes would have less of a reputation if they did n't act so bloodtirsty al the time .
monsters only act that way to rotect their babies from mewmans .
ou may not understand , but monsters ill do anything for our children .
do n't talk to me about what i 'm willing to do .
to protect star from toffee !
but i have to keep my child safe at all costs 
you insult me , queen moon .
my buffbabies , they are my life .

it 's a terrible plan .
i 've got big plans .

i 'm thinking .
i have n't told my dad yet .
there 's something else i have n't told him .
al clear .
wow .
so what 's the big plan ?
the plan for beating toffee ?
i kinda just go for it .
oh , my precious little ribbit baies .
do n't you worry .
i 'm very worried .
i 'll see you after i destroy toffee .
this is my catle .
i do n't want to see a single butterfly face .
what am i looking at here ?
no butterflies .
get that out of here .
is that he lat of it ?
and with that , everything in my kingdom is in oder .
no , no , not again !
okay , a few kinks to work out , but oveall , te citizes of mewni love me .
those esecially .
here , i 'll show you .
greetings , young man .
no , my lord , they just do 't like you .
oh , honey , look at all that great stuff .
wow , we houl load up .
finally , someone with taste .
this will look great in our foer .

and you 'e a buffoon .
the buffoon is merel the facae for my pointed social comentary .
that 's what make me a true artist .
not as much o an artist as the mime .
i 'm not a soldier either , but there 's a time when you have to get off the sidelines and get invoved .
if the four of us work togeher , we can save te true king of mewni .
no , see , i would n't use that hand gesture .
it 's just been done to death .
you all make me sick .

the cure for caner has been discovered .
the cure fo virtually every fom of chronic disease wa discovered even earlier , urel by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson 
although his discoveries were adhered to by hitler and the nazi party ,
dr. gerson 's family paid the ultimate price .
dr. gerson 's seven siblings perished in the holocaust .
dr. gerson 's unprecedented gift o healing the hopeless lives on .
narrated by dr. a.f .
these scees before your eyes would be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air moves north and airborne tranport of dioxins eventually reaches the once pristie artic .
arctic peoples are showing major health probles , from bioaccumulation of dioxins .
and from there , the oisons travel up the food chain to polar bears , seals and whales , and then to people .
one thousandth of one millionth of a gram of dioxin can cause arm to the boy .
trees , the very living organisms that clean the air and prouce the oxygen we reathe , are sliced off at the ground with the most careless abandon if there i a limiteless supply .
at one point , it had bee said hat a tee squirrel could ump from tree to tree following the hardwood with coniferous forest belt from the east coast to the west coast .
they do not develop special fuctions .
as a boy in germany , in the late 1800 ' ,
day by day , he gaine insight in the relationships between plants and the nutrients they gained from the soil .
under a microscope , actively cells known as chloroplasts , busily undertake the process of manufaturing chlorophyll and the miraculous proess of photosynthesis begin .
these live cells and enzymes in egetation are the nucleus of what we need to ingest to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy one .
max gerson suered from severe and repeated miraine headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days .
after three years of experimenting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved , but a sin tuberculosis also disappeared .
446 of the 450 patiets reovered .
dr. gerson and his wife retchen ha thee daughters :
joanna  gertrude and the youngest , charlote .
of all the children  charlotte took a pecial interest in her father 's work .
y the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had spread throuhout europe .
when dr. schweitzer was 75 ears old , he came to dr. gerson with diabetes and was also cured .
lighting up the switchboards at ac non-stop .
out of control !
unbelievable !
an the pepper neely anticancer bill of 1946 , documen no .
now married , she had a so , howard  and a daughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her father to ublish his first book in 1958 :
at the time of his death , in 1959 ,
the files have been preserved by his daughter charlotte who is now in her eighties .
charlotte carries on the work of he father through the establishment of the
we have some letters here from albert schweitzer ... and they had a very ative corespondence , my father , dr. gerson and albert schweitzer , an hi family were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter , he expressed his admiatio of the specific cancer esearch that dr. gerson did .
of course , all the letters are in german and i 'm trying to tanslate some .
as well as the remarkabe reults tha he saw , ot only ith cancer patients , but wit his wife , who had tuberculoi , ad their daugter , who had a very undecipherable skin disease .
laws in virtually all the unied states prohibit any other treatment for cancer other than radiation , chemotherapy and surgery .
on this partiular day , two meical octors from czechoslovakia , cosult with ania wilson , who is executive directo , about the possibilities of openig a hospital in czechoslovakia .
... you boost the immune system , you rid the body of those years and years of accumulated toxin from the way we live ...
ot a day goes by tha we do n't hear something from a patient or a physician , or a group of people peraps intereted in sarting a clinic or a support group .
i high school i wa in one of those dieters anorexic and bulimic ... bulimia when it was n't really writen about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fiht for that .
a year later , that same tumor , the one that tey thouht could be a meastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 yeas old , y face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
afte being on te therapy for about a year , i notice oe day when i was rubbing my nose , that i could eel the bone in the right side of my nose for the first time .
another staff memer , susan brant , chalote gerson 's niece , at oe time , was diagnosed with an inopeable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 years ago , and so ,
i can i here ad say that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostae cancer in 1990 , trough the rectal exam , the serum gram and the biopsy .
they determined i had three sections of cancer , malignant cancer in the prostate and they waned to take the postate out the next day .
i talked ith gerson institute and with the hospital in mexico , and talked wit the doctors and the patients .
after three months , i found that i was loosig weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 moths my psa showed 0.06 , hich to me was the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the doctor thought i was great , he said i had a beter psa than he did .
i am not an easy one to get along with , because i 'm a maverick ...
a particular type juicing method ust be utilized , however , implementing a rind and press device .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as fast as alcohol .
this juicer was originally designe in the 1930 's by a scientific researcher , named dr. norma walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be captured in a glass of juice in minutes and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the atiet .
as you can see , an entire day with the juices is equivalent to an enormous amount of food , which weights in a little over 20 pounds a day .
but just eating different is not enough o heal a seriousl ill patient .
utrition is only half of the equation .
resolving te accumulated toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentless .
realizing this , charlote gerson included a chapter about it in a book about the gerson therapy , that underlines , in layman 's terms , the principles of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily toxic ingesion or precursor hi be when you get in your automobile prior of even starting the enine , you hae already igested dioxins

suppose you continue your journey and sto at a motel for te evening .
once inside , from the poer switch ativatig electromagnetic ieds , to the mirowave radiation eaking from the oven , as it prepares your plastic wrapped , heavily salted and preserved utritionless instant dinne , to the carcinogenic chemicals in the soap on the bathtub brim .
ou ae inundated with hits .
the soap and shapoo are just the start , however , of what wil be asorbed through your skin once you turn on the bath tue faucet , which will provide chlorinated and fluoridated water to hep you get clean .
clorine and fluorine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toilet seat has been sanitized for you protection .
but hat does that mean ?
the oilet paper wil also smear cemicals from sovents to dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroom sink , you may actuall drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply anufactured plastic cup , that allows serious toxins from the pastic itself ito the water .
the artiicial sugar and the artificial cream as a nice touch to the mix .
) that was the cell phone repeated , lengthy uses ave shown to interfere with and challenge the neurotransmiters of the brain .
as we finally tur off the light to seep , electromagnetic fields rom the clock next to you head will almost imperceptibly influence the slumer and dreams one hopes to have .
even te ilm to make this movie uses extremely poisonous chemicals in its manufacture and processing .
as ridiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one moe hit for your body to figt .
the good news is that most of these toxins can be removed wih strict adherence to te gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comes ino play .
unless it gets some help .
when coffee enemas are utilized in conjuction with juice dinking it is eoxification at its finest .
three tablespoons of dip groud coffee are dropped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is turned down .
once the coffee is one , it is straine into a measuring cup .
additional water ay be added to make up for water lost in steam in making the cofee .
once the coffee coos to body temperature it is poured into the enema bucket .
that time , the plastic stopper at the end of te hose is slit back to release the air in the end o the tube .
simultaneously , the iver in turn excretes poisons into the colon for expulsion 
hundred of holistic physicians , in the u.s. an around the world , have been trained by charlotte in the gerson institute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united states to trea and cure a diseased patient i a hospital with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides in southen california , it ' easy to her for drie regularly to advie and encourage the edless numbers of patiets that arrive at the hospial in tijuana , mexico .
under the care of a staff of physicians and nuritionists , most patients who came in ith inoperale cancers and with no hope of recovery , leave withi 1 to 4 wees to continue the treatment at home .
after only 2 weeks on the theapy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer now .
do you have children ?
it has aved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaska , where i am from and i was diagnosed with a ...
you were diagnosed how , did ou had a biopsy ?
he ordered te biopsy and the pathoogy came back with a carcinoma .
and you had ascites swellig ?
i ha 10 pounds o acites sweling in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy could also dry it up .
now several doctors have told me that .
how much ?
one course .
after i was finished with my chemo and it did n't wok .
then you came here .
wow !
and then it 's been about 2 cm a day .
ever ince ...
to charlotte , this day was a typical and normal one .
always seeking new ways to cheer up , empower an restore hope to the supposed hopeless ,
within the pages of each booklet ae personal iographies ad the medical records of recoveries .

my da had told me about the gerson therapy .
my daddy told me about this , and during the research , i found out that the bet way to cure yourself is to do it the ealthy way .
not put more poisos into your body that would kil you .
and hat what chemo did ... it kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
when i go down to ucla , i too did all my blood work and my mris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ca n't believe you 're one of my cancer patients.
that just eally made e feel good every time i went in there .
i did ot loo like a noral cancer patient .
to me , i have harlotte and the gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heart , just do n't think i 'd be hee .
when i was diagnosed with cancer ,
i kew of three other ladie that had the same caner i had .
i was 12 years old when my mom was diagnosed with cancer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'm steve , debbie 's husband .
when i first came into debbie 's life , it was several years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ...
there is for harlotte the reluctance to get emotionally attached to any sigle case , since there have been thousands , but ocasionally , a phone call ould leave her effervescent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seen only i children .
it as discovered that the ung was too ridden with cancer .
and more horrifying still was the revelation tha the cancer had made it all the ay to the right chambe of her heart .
the surgeon than opened her sternum an started with removig the tumors from er lungs .
from there  he moved to er heart and an open-heart surgery removed the tumor o the riht heart chamber .
again and again , with a vengeance .
no , even her liver was invaded by caner .
) he doctor said , ( ?
) children told us that she is no gon na be able to ahm ... the cancer is back an she is ot gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or something , we were down , at the gerson , and ahm ... and e were doing the diet there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
) i had come down there sick mysef ... ?
i had reular diinfections all the time .
after having a hyogycemic , and just felt better .
so , we wet back home an we 've been doing the treatment for two years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and life bega to change for the entire family .
even the dog wa happy again .
but the poisons are now beig excreted and er body is building itself back up with powerful enzyes and the nutrient forces .
but where stephanie 's orthodox medical doctors had oly given her 6 months to live two years ago , she has now astounded the , ad of course , confounded them .
i fee ery healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
carlotte obsered that they run around playing and ejoying life  as though the scourge of cancer had neer visited this resilient child .
there are also nonoxic , non-pharmaceutical supplements called biologicals , that are utilized in a greater or lesser measure , depending upon the patient 's condition .
one of the most important of thee is a natural potassium , mix of otassium gluconate , acetate , phosphate in equa amouns , that dr. gerson put together after doing nearly 300 experiments .
this is extremely beneficial to restorig the potassium in the body 's cells systems that was lost in most peole on relenting use of inoranic sodium , such as found in tale salt and hidden within everything , from processed foods to tootpaste .
table salt is a poison .
the use of inorganic sodium causes displacement of potassium found naturally in uman cells  leaving them vulnerable to attac by diseases .
dr. gerson 's potasium supplement is dissolved in a quarter of distiled water and inorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , essentially the leftoves , are used for fertilizer and animal food .
a rue miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all o the good wok tha max gerson did in the past , really understood the value of fla oil .
that was n't anything that ...
actuall , they educated us more than we could even educate hem on the value and the benefits of how flax oil really helped the modalities .
the use of thee natural , holistic supplements on the gerson therapy is part of cutomization to the specific degeneative conditions of the patiet .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a caner , but they can sometimes fortify gerson 's terapies effectivenes .
when it comes to helping the body recover , whether from a common cold o cancer , today , over half the medial visits in the u.s. and canada are to alternative therapies , despite the eficacy .
and in the u.s. especially , it is estiated that our understandig and aceptance of hoistic medicine is still 75 years behind the est of the world .
medically , we trail many third world countries .
it is imperative that patients have access to such food choices .
he organic food market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , mainly as the result of the economic law of supply and demand .
mass-produced commercially grown fruits and vegetables produced with chemicals and sprays are fertilized with ony three minerals :
but the plat , like te huma body , really needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertilization process of commercially gow crops , the plants were sick and mut be ept on life support with more toxic chemicas until market 
this process is now epeated in the consumer , in simplified terms .
i know tat in the past people had different prospectives of what was truly organic , and we woul have some growers come in and say well , their grows are oranic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules and regulations suh that anybody who did want to become organic would truly be in the same playing field and would have to abide by the same sets of rules .
we have found that the attributes of truly doin a cerified organic is beneicial not only fo the people  but also for the ground , etc .
so , that 's something that we truly look forward to expand upon and to provide for the local community , and also for the people throughout the united states and world wie .
by popular deman , undoubtely based largely on he discovery of the incomparable etter flavor of fresh organic produce , organic farmers frequently sart popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their produce for their neighors benefit , before shipping their product to an ever inreasing world market 
charlotte gerson follows the geron therapy hersel as a life style of prevention .
she as no one as million of others have discovered that the principles of the gerson therapy raise the bar for getting the most of life .
now , in her eighties ,
using the erson therapy , one need never again wory by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesit is almost alays nothing but hunger .
and people are very hungry because , even though they are ull , they ae not tuly nourished .
it has been said , that upermarkets are like mausoleums , here the dead food lies in state .
for many , it also grants them a higher vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith an walk of life .
day-to-day life experiences are raught with perplexities that can be addressed to a negative or a positive way .
for example , cocaine and heroine addicts destroy their cravings for drugs in usually less than 72 hours on te theray .
the only obstacle that arret or commences to subract those books is long term lack of nutrients and environmenta toxicity .
when te brain detoxifies , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional og lift .
the body is a miraculous in its design and flexibility .
these chemicals are found in virtuall all municial drinking water and inflicts severe damage in the ody 's endocrine system , particularly the thyroid gland .
but there are oher semi hidden dangers in ingestio of daily poisos that can be avoided .
well , the denta amalgam is now coming more and moe ino the floo , even while dentists used to dispute it .
but in your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clealy demonstrated that lot of children have seizures and all kinds of mena disubances fom the dental amalam .
te danger of te illegal street drugs in public and private schools is heavily publicized .
the trouble with ritalin is sometime ... first of all , it 's never been tesed on children under 6 .
and they 're giving it now to children in preschool and kindergarden .
and the american services like he army , navy and the air force , will ot accept any person into the sevice who is ever been on italin , because they 're uncontrollable .
during sleep , not only is the nervous system repleished ike a storage battery being harged , but the body rids itself o poisons , in a way that only sleep can accompish .
and with the bombardment in daily life of hits to their systems in modern society , repeated lack of it can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain development .
the developing brain of a child at hi time in human history , must clear a number o hurdles in a bid for genetic normacy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially lead from older homes , where leaded paint as used pirate in the 1970 's 
remodeling and sanding of older homes produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in 
tese airborne eavy metals , along with numerous other hemicals in the food and water , are now unintentionally passed on to the next generation .
but the removal , known as chelation , of such toxins , even heavy metals , such as lead , is possible with close adherence to the gerson therapy .
even the body itself can overproduce a substance that becomes poison in excess , in stressful situations , if the liver is unheaty and unable to neutralize it .
i 's called adrenaline .
in an occupation tat demans split econd life or death ecisions , the adrenaline flows in excess , and if no neutraized , can oison the body into ilness .
the potency of this substance is profound .
when a dop of adrenaline is secreted by the arenal glands , which are located on little cas on top of each kidney , it enters the bloodstream and is diluted instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of is oiginal strength .
the pupose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and protect oneself in threatening situations .
the largest gand of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able to neutralize the secretions .
may people have liver disease and do n't even know it .
for the detection of a liver probem via ilness requires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity before symptoms ecome detectable 
like many othes wo do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of he animals are carnivores , in the wildlife center , their health and reproduct abilit must be mainained at highest levels .
eventuall , they were unable to reproduce successfuly .
clearly , al carnivoe animals such as these were deigne to hunt and kill and survive on prey composed of flesh .
their teeth , stomach acids and short digestive tract bea this out .
but the dissimilarities between wild meat eaters and humans do not end there .
invariabl , some of them does n't pass through at all , ut instead get snagged inside tiny pockets in the colon putrefying not for ours , but days , months and even years .
the pancreas was never designed to break down animal protein or meat .
when meat must be diested , the panreas is diverted from its imporant protective urpose .
if we only eliminated the animal products from our diet , the odd of getting cancer  diabetes or heart disease an the pandoa 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american diet , refered to as sad for short , has totally flipped that scientificaly verifiable statistic upside down .
looking under a microscope , it is easy to see red blood cells floating around free .
surprisingly , some foods , like legumes , oybeans and soy poducts are either deficient in nutrients , or cause health degeneration , b blocking absorption of nurients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very idespread .
it 's caused by mik dinking .
an the doctors give it for supposedly curing osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the body has to mainain homeostasis , it has to maitain a very exact leve of alkalinity versus aciity .
where is it going to take calcium ?
it is not absorbable from mil , because in the milk with pasteurization and all , the enzymes are missing .
and the bod ca n't use it .
so , on the contrary , that adds to the problem .
i had canceled y health insurance when i was 34 years old .
and te reason was not that i was very healty only , ut the reason was tha i 'm not interested in a kind of ospital or meical treatment that might be covered by insurane ecause it 's toxic , it 's drugs , it 's hemicals , and i have , you now ,
and over the years , i 've saved an average of us $ 2,000 a year .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .
even now , his appliation of this therap is unrelenting .
today , gerson 's name and therapy is known and honored world wide by holistic physicias , nutriionists and chiropracors .
he also authors features stories for the bi-onthly

meet pat annie from british columbia  in canada .
she remains extremely busy .
pat radiates good health and has a deep conviction about certain priorities in her life .
ironicaly , he developed cancer after pat had recovered on the gerson therapy .
in 1986 , i was iagnoed with panreas cancer , which is spread to my liver , gallbladder and spleen .
my husband just would n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 days , the leeding had stoppe , the pain had stopped , i came home , get the terapy for 2 years ...
after three months , my doctors here wodered why i wa still living .
he aske e if i ould have a cat scan , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't want to know what you 're doing , just keep doing it .
i hope they appreciate me .
at the time i wa fighting the pancreas cancer  we got a call from michael landon , you ay remember him , he was o little house on the pairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
he would n't go dow to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his family .
he went on to the tonight show and he looked wonderfu , and he said he felt wonderful 
he phone us after he did this treatmen
and said he knew that was he en , that he hould have staye with the gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind tha he would be alive today if he had stayed wit the geron .
it is a medieval castle .
finally , after 75 years and tens of thousands of healed people , the world at last is embracing this answer to cancer .
and in recorded human history there 's also triumph and hope over seeminly insurmountable societal , individual and environental illness .

your grudges  resentments , frustrations and jealousies will finally disappear .
so , too , your hopes , ambitions , plans and to do list will expire .

this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly fo the governement but motly ...
mostly for a ... a hollywoo sudio .
this what a the time of the 'ood neighbor ' polic ... and it was my task o make a large technical documentary on the subject of the carnival .
samba orchestra .
voodoo ceremonies , particularly in shango which are practice ... up in the favelas , those strange , native ettlements on the ... mountain , which are right in the midst of rio .
he came to my ofice . . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happens not only in south american governments , but also in film studios .
and the witch door assured me that this ... was deeply ofensive and ...
and , i said i was most sorr about it myself and ..
i did want to finish the fim and i did ope he undestood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
cetainly not in the tie ...
uh ... already agreed on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finish , since so much effort had gone into it ad i was pleadig my cause for some time .
praying that we woul be able to .
and , i came back to the office an found that the doctor had gone ...
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
this was the mark of the voodoo .
the first tor  'my friend bonito ' , began sooting in mexico under the direction welles associate , norman foster .
as producer of 'it 's al true '
at the same time he was prearing to produce a act in the thriler 'journey into fear ' , but his plan were about to change , dramatically .
and brazil 's dictator , getúlio vargas , had nazi sympathizers in his governemet .
so  the sate department appointed welles , special ambasador to brazil .
we , the people of these united nations of america , now stand together .
we ought to know each other better han we do .
it was more of a cultural intecange .
i was told that it was my patriotic duty ... to go and spend a milion dollars shooing ... the carnival in rio .
e had to get to rio in time to film the carnival .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent ambersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adoining soundstages .
he did 't even have time to cage his costume .
filmin of 'bonito ' , the first par of the new atin american version of 'it 's all true ' , was teorarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he finishe shooting both films in time to leave for rio , ut i was a real cliffhanger .
i went to he projection room at about two in the morning , no , four in the morning , and then gone on the plane and off to rio .
ask me again ... in six months .
the light failed to arrive , so he filmed 'carnival ' with anti-aircraft lights borrowed fro the brazilian army .
i hotograped .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to capture a hurricane .
people get ired , they fall asleep , they re goig to lean against a house , that 's it .
as it tured out i became fascinated with samba .
what was ineresing were the samba clubs , and all of that which would ave organized and told o people , eplained what it was , socially and all the rest of that .
welles had discovere what the true subject of his film would be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's backyard is n't exactly gala it 's eve gayer than rio s front lawn .
it 's set to music , but the music 's all its own .
rich ...
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the sreets .
samba .
vargas had demolished paça onze to build a new boulevard .
so  welles rebuilt in a studio for hi technicoor cameras to commemorate the carnial of te streets now passing into history .
welles joined the people in their protest .
at the ame time he began filming the story of another protest which ould be the third story of 'it s all true ' 
a cry of outrage from te poorest of the poor that electrified all of razil .
he first read about it in time magaine .
four poor fishermen riske their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demad that brazil 's president give their people , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazilian workers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the northeast , an incredible 1650 miles , without the ai of a compass , stopping alon the way o find food and water .
jacaré was the leader of the expedition but jerônimo , a man who could neither read nor write , was he pilot .
their jungada was carried in riumph through the streets .
three month had passed since their voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangaderos were still national heroes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnial ' the jangederos story woul complete his latin america riogy ... but jacaré 's political activities had ade him a cause of concern for the vargas governemet .
i think that the vargas governemet began to recognize the fact that his was not going to be a film that would bring tourists to brazil .
i remember the nigt we tied to photograph one of the teement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us and after a siege of beer bottles , emptie of course , tones , bricks , and i hate to think what else ...
we reeated to a more photogenic distict .
and , it ocurs to me that sine man and the wold have to live with one another and get along somehow ...
an they see a lot of people , black people , and the reaction is :
he 's just shooting a lo of jigaboos , jumpig up and down .
they did n't even hear te samba music because it had n't been snched up .
and all i kept getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending 
it might have been weles ' greatest film .
they detroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... the picture isef desroyed me .
i was ..
wel , i rememer i was a sunny , eauiful da ... and i was a nightmare .
the harbor wa full of sailboats , putting up sail , getting ready o reenact the jangaderos ... triumphant entry into rio haro .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ..
we were devatated .
he must have mae the decision at that point that e would make this film o matter what .
i 'm sure .. was haunted ... by the feeling ... that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice president was sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and send everybody home .
when we ere recalled fom razil there was till some money left for shooing .
not much .
i took that and went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and e made the jangadero ' documentary .
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , folowing their voyae and all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not get ... wha they .. went for .
it kept them oor , o matter how hard they worked .
it was to ... remind him of hi promises .
welles devised a little love story .
to get extreme low anges , he would put people on platforms , and bury i caeraman deep in the san .
he drew moving performanes rom people wo had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team finished shooting 'four men on a rat ' just in time to atch a wartime fligh to the state .
once back , he learned that rko was not going to let him finish 'i 's al true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
an ... they ... mae a reat publicity of point of the fac tat i had gone to south america withou a script and thrown all this money away .
tha ...
i ever recoered fom that ... from that atack .
he hired himself out for the first time as a movie star to option the footage from rko .
for four years he desperatel sought financing to finish it .
i tried everything .
i was near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many year of m life .
if i turned my back like they did on it , i would have been much better but
what i discoveed were 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i went an had one of the cans printe up and foun out that yes , tere was some things of 'bonito , and thee was some tings of 'carnival ' .
it was orson welles .
ladies and gentlemen , here comes the samba now .
of course , we all live with our pat but i try not to ... encourage it to mibehave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unpronounceable .
surdo 
correct !
ladies and gentlemen , the ... tambourine is not a ... ambourine !
it 's just a rough frame with some kind of ( ?
at skin !
pandeiro ?
-yes , something wrong , senor welles ?
oh , no ...
it 's al right now .
ladies and gentlemen , this instrument odly enough , is exactly like our tambourine !
well , that 's the way things are .
i ...
why ?
why 
-wel , because of the sound it 's making .
that 's a ...
yeah 
ganá .
the gentleman here handles it with all the flare of a bartender shaking a cocktail shaker .
now ... we hear the uica !
what 's that , carmen ?
cuica !
the cuica .
-cuica .
however , as you notice , it is n't beating like a drum .
one end is open .
when you yank it back and forth the ... that 's hat you hear .
there you have it !
the rhythm of the samba .
brazilian babies can beat out samba rhythm before they can talk !
radio :
we 've spotted wha appears to be a spacecraft just outside the surline .
alert rescue and advise to remain on station for 45 minutes .
and we 'll squa 7700 for a radar fix .

base radar will vector .
come on !
let 's go !
ha !
a !
yes , sir !
all right , open her up .
open it up !
welcome , gentlemen , to the united sta --
did you call te zoo ?
yes , sir , we 're in luck 
the ape will be hidden from the public .
tey 'll be quaantined .
they need meical attention , it 's available riht on the spot .
they are dressing up !
suitcase ?
uh ...
wy did he do that ?
here you are , old fella .
have a banana .
zira !
i 'm yours .
i think they 're trying to e kind .
this cage stinks of gorilla 
cornelius , here are we ?
what 's happened ?
i know where we are .
i know what has happened .
in some fashion -- and i lack the intelect to know precisely how - we have taveled from earth 's future to earth 's past .
but we saw the earth estroyed .
only since seeing it , we have passed through a backward disturbane in time .
did you notice the date meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship ?
we hae returned to earth nearly 2,000 years before its destruction .
apes , at this instant in ime  can not et talk .
oh , the drie gave me this eport from the air base .
yeah , it 's the usual imitative behavior .
mimicking salutes , handshaking , itting on chairs , eating offplates with knives .
there was sort of
hi , dr. dixon .
the female 's a bit uppity , sir .
o ?
i see you 've preared the wisconsin ultiphasi .
we 'll begin with that .
all igh , we 'l take the female first .
arhur , would you set up a cha --
not a bite .
just as you ordeed .
we 'll offer the banana .
well , why does n't she take it ?
because i loathe bananas !
arthur , i think dr. branton needs some air .
zira , are you mad ?
i did not cal her mad .
i hate deceit !
and how in the name ofgod are we to know that unless e ommunicate ?
and we can liten !
and we can wath .
primitive ?
could n't test the intelligence of a newt !
i am calm !
zira !
zira !
we 'll eed a full autopsy .
let us know when the report comes in 
we ill not hurt you .
poor dr. milo .
doctor .
you kiled him !
no , i did n't .
he did .
one of your own kind 
he 's a gorilla !
well , look , there ' nothing to be araid of .
do you understand tat ?
humans ?
i ' a psychiatrist .
my name is cornelius .
lewis dixon .
nobody 's goin to believe this .
believe what ?
that primitive apes can talk .
primitive ?
uh .. ell , i mean that in our , um ... primitie , um , civilization , apes just do n't talk .
may i sa something ... personal ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm aware tat what i have to tell you may conceivably create
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was one of two tha have been missing in space for over 2 years now .
have they identified the bodies , mr. president 
zoo ?
wat would astronauts be doing in a zoo , mr. president ?
reporters :
general !
no comment .
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a little later , please .
reporter :
later .
and if the question become less simple ?
and i am the animal sychiatrist who as been in charge of these 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
ha ha ha !
a ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect you work , but if you think you 're going to turn a presidential inquiry into a ventriloquist 's act , i have to inform you --
ad i have to inform you , sir , that these two apes have acquired the power ofseech .
yes  sir , but i repeat that they have the power ofspeech .
well  may we be told whic is the female of the species ?
hae you a name ?
certainly she can articulate , whic , in itself , is extaordinary !
what is your name 
zi-ra !
mechanical mimicry .
unique in a ape vocally , without a doubt , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
m. chairman .
we 'll take hat up later , your eminece .
cornelius , do you and your lawfully wedded spouse speak any language oer than english ?
what i english ?
i speak the language taught to me by my father and mother  who were taught by their
it has been the laguage ofour anestors for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins , wo can be sure ?
nonsense 
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkered , pseudoscientific geese !
i 've examined thousands of hem .
and until now , i 've oly discovered 2 who could talk in my life .
god knows who taugh tem .
where we come from , apes talk .
humans are dum .
i 'm not sure .
when the pacecraft first landed on our seaboard , it was dr. mio who salvaged it .
he studied it and halfunderstood it .
half ?
enough for dr. mio to be murdere in your zoo .
enough for my wife and i to be hee now .
from where , cornelius ?
of couse the female knows !
that does n't make any sense 
cornelius , you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpanzees are pacifists .
in a spaceship .
gentlemen , do you have --
o comment .
no comment .
as head of this commission , it will be our duty to it through the facts of this bizarre affair and pass our conclusions onto the president of the united states for implementation .
what a loa ofhogger mogger .
dr. hasslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
no , gentlemen , no comment ... et .
doctor .
you were marvelous .
they loved you .
but only to lewis and steie .
oh , zira 
well , you see ... we did know colonel taylor .
i mea , as a scientist , i sympathize , but i agree that that 's a revelation the masses would not take kindly to .
i think you did the right thing in denying nowlede of colonel taylor .
what ?
they would ave asked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the windows of te spaceshi ... we saw the earth ... destroyed .
i repeat , taked to the presidentia comission of lnquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the mae ape where he was from , the female replie , from your future .
would you believe that ?
i think it is the only explanation .
but still something is mising -- and that something is still his real self painting the second picture .
so he regresses further and paints a third .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that time is like a feeway with an infinite number oflanes , all leading from the past into the future , however , not unto the same future .
thank you very much , . hasslein .
it s certainly he most incredible story this reporer has ever covered .
they will , however , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be given an extende tour of the city .
this is bill bonds reporting for eyewitness news .
good night .
your lugage , ma'am ?
address , please .
the zoo .
madam zira , i repreet furand feather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is your favorite fuit ?
ha ha ha .
and later , he 'll accompany dr. hasslei to the useum of natural hitory .
now , for a look at the weather .
sunny california will not be exactly that tomorrow .
the downtown -
tire ?
how is that ?
we have heads as well as hands .
i call upon men to let us ue them !
beastly .
and dimas whih means body frame .
its scientific name is a compound of the greek kampo , which means flexibe or bent ,
its generic name , theefoe , is lexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i insist .
now , is there anything i can get you , zira ?
well , i have a strange craving .
grape juice pus ?
lewis said only a sip .
especially in cases ofpregancy , you know .
oh , sine well before the war .
it was n't our war 
it was the gorillas ' war .
we tayed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
when we ere in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there was a tornado in the sky 
i feel magnificently sleepy .
the date meter on the spaceship .
and before -- before the white light and the tornado ?
befoe the white light an the tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr. president , that one day , talking apes will dominate thi earth and eventually destroy it by 3950 something .
and according to the nasa experts , who are still subjecting the spaceship to microscopic scrutiny  the precise year ofwhat you merely inferred to be earth 's destruction is recorded on the flight synthesizer as 3955 a.d. , resumably .
alter wha you believe to e the course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked our facilities .
he also became very unpopular , historically unpopular .
an we o n't want hat to hapen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 visitors seem to be charming , peaceful people -- or rather creatures -- and that he voters love them .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the world , mr. president ?
well , not a the next election , no .
ell , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we kno that apes one day will acquire the poer of intelligent speech .
by zira 's tesimoy , we know that she is regnant ith chil .
by my own testiony we know that it 's genetically possile for this child -- provide , of course , always hat we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a talkin ape by a dumb one in a present-dayjunle o a present-day zoo .
yes , mr president , i do .
i do n't know .
which future as go , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assassin would say the latter .
well , m. president , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because he was evil .
we have no proof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mr. president , there are very strog indications 
are you suggesting tha they were improperly interrogated ?
let us say unprofessionally .
tell tha to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convened in secret session at the request of the president , the commission makes the following interim recommendations --
the public should be informed
that the apes , after thei arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue ariing from its intended publicity ,
there is justifiable cause or suspecting
o the installation known as camp 1 1 .
wen we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of he earth melt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me 
but ifsomebody had asked ...
ony the goillas and the oangutans 
what 's the difference ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do not ue the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
an desroys man .
all we want to find out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , this was intolerable .
so humans took primiive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alert to the concept ofslavery , and , as their numbers grew , to slavey 's antidote , which , of course , is unity .
the learned the art of corporate and ilitan actio .
he articulated .
he spoke a wor which had been spoken to him over time without number by humans .
no .
so that 's ho it all started .
corelius :
where we come fom , ape tak .
you recognize your husband 's words to the commision ?
yes .
so human were dumb .
zira :
zira :
i 've examine --
i ca n't remember .
coplete the word !
call for dr. dixon , pease 
p.a .
:
sodium pentothal .
1/2 gram lv .
ou have the commission s authority .
an that of the president .
zira , i 've been asked to give you an injection --
-killig ?
wil it harm my baby ?
lewis , you ca n't use that on zira !
really .
no , you must n't !
zira !
zira !
you do n't have to tell me !
now count backward from 1 0 .
tank you , dr. dixon .
hm .
you worked in a room like this .
hmm ...
not so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an --
anata --
whose anatomies did you compare ?
apes and humans ?
ye -- yes ... when they ied a natural eath 
available ?
gorillas hunted them for sport in nets and with gun .
noses , nervous systems , te various reflexes .
of the living .
you ca n't mae a dead man 's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you were advanced enough to peform experimental brain surgery on living humans ?
of course not .
wen you left , was colonel taylor alive 
we loved taylor 
we did all we could to elp him --
cornelius and i 
she needs a nap .
we must get this to the commission .
i you 'll be seated , we 'll get down to business .
by eiher ape towards he human race as it is presently constituted in this year  1 973 .
the male 's attitude is that
of a deepy interested academician
with the true objectivity of a good historian .
the female 's case is different ,
will ave becoe dumb brutes
wih the intelligence of animals ?
it 's been noted that what apes will do to humans
to dr. hasslein 's conviction that these aes ' progeny
this is a risk we dare not ignore .
therefore ...
the commision unanimously recommends
that the birth of the female 's unorn child
i now declare this commission dissolved .
they are savages !
abbing needles into my pregnant wife .

tere 's no appeal from his court except to the resident of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 're still sworn .
defence will cross-examine 
now , in order to refresh our memories , allow me to summarise what you said .
according to your stoy c. c. wharton grabed a shotgun and killed marhal potter .
then you say the father swung hi axe  and you shot him , too .
just winged him , o he would n't be here to pay up 
how long have you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot since you became a marshal , mr. cogburn ?
that was ot the question .
how ay ?
twelve to fifteen ?
so many that you can not keep a specific count .
i have examined the records , mr. cogburn .
a much moe accurate figure is available .
come now , ow many ?
couing them two whartons , 23 .
how much more dangerous for those arrested by you ?
was this revolver loaded and cocked ?
just anser my questions , if you please .
yes , sir .
i alays go backwad when i 'm backing away !
aaron wharton was standing by a pot when you arried ?
he as stiring the fire under the scalding pot .
how far did you back away ?
something ike that .
m. goudy , do you have anymore questions for mr. cogburn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogburn .
call the next witness !
raise your right hand .
r. rooser cogburn ?
it s pretty loose because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .
well , who 's he ?
well  wo are you ?
my family has 480 acres of good bottomland near dardanelle in yell couty .
my moter 's ome looking after my bay sister and my brother , little frank .
wel then , why o n't you go home and leave me alone ?
mr. cogburn !
you can get a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile for each of you , and i 'll give you $ 50 reward .
well , you 've looked into this right smart .
i mean business .
it belonged to my ather .
well thi 'll sure get the job done , if you can find a ence post to rest it on while you take aim !
i 've got some horse-trading to do , i 'll have it by tomorrow .
well , i think tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medicine .
i 'd like to meet your family .
you want more , miss ?
i ve never seen chopsticks work before .
chopticks save your fingers .
give me our cup .
i do n't drink cofee , thank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lemonade , neither .
yes , sir .
sounds like a might easy way to make $ 50 to me .
do n't crowd me .
do n't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective business all at the same time .
and  50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advantage of me .
it is n't going to be easy smoking od ned out .
well , i hope you do n't think i 'm going to keep you in whisey .
no , thank you .
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , si , my pice is $ 100 .
i wil think about your proposition and alk to you again .
now , i wan na go to the monarch boarding house .
you beter walk e over there .
you can never tell what 's i a chinaman 's mind .
that s the way he bests you at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i have a writ here says you 're to stop eating chen lee 's cornmeal forthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first place .
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , baby sister .
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rats .
give them ats a fair show , they ay .
well , what kind of a fair show did they give old man potter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i ha a big horse istol like tha ,
i 'm not scared of no boogerman .
cream ?
i 've been waiting to have some private words with you .
i fin a sweet distraction , as i suppose most men do .
i saw your oher yesterday .
what busine did you have with her ?
i 's a likeness of tom chaney .
i 'm looking for him and i hear you 're looking for him , too .
i ony take one step at a time .
i 've been on his trail the best part of four month now .
i 'm a sergeant in the texas rager .
chelsford or chaney as you call him , he shot and killed the senator s bird dog .
bibbs threatened to whip him , and haney sho the old gentleman while he was sittig in a orch wing .
wel , you need not worry about chaney anymore .
the sheriff informed me that you were looking for a man to go after chaney in the idian territory .
i 'e alread found one for the job .
his nae is rooster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal or the federal court , tougest one they have 
you 'll have to talk that oer with rooster cogburn .
it 's at leas a two-man job to take im alive .
we 're taking him to fort smith and hang .
well , more so to me .
now , would n't a hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i wan tom chaney to pay for kiling my father , not for some texas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you fie or six good licks with my bet .
one would be as unpleasant as the oher .
lay a han on me and you ll answer for it .
he children of texans are brought up to show a little more respect for teir elders .
you 'll push that saucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no regard for you , but i 'm sure you have enough for yourself o go around .
they are all for sale except those four scrubby ones .
the heirs of the late frank ross .
i 'm attie ross .
i fear that i out of the question .
that hardly concerns me .
your father bought four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it hile it as in your care .
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he will make money , and i will make money , and your lawyer will make money .
and you , mr .
liensed auctioneer , ou will foot the bill .
lawyer aggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.a.v .
g. , yes .
all right .
sit down .
the ponies have no part in tis .
i would nt pay that for a winged pegasus .
now , lisen very carefully , as i will not bargai further .
my lawyer would not ish me to consider anything under $ 300 .
for that , you et everything except the saddle .
i would like to have tat in writing , for what it is worth .
when i have it in my hand , i 'll remit the extortion money .
you 'll find it i order .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
it seems such a shame to render such spirite horseflesh into soap .
good morning .
seep late .
you ai n't such an early bird youself , baby sister .
i just about give up on you .
i figured ou 'd gone home .
yeah .
well , trouble is , there 's no slats in it at all .
how much is there ?
you still game ?
one unerstanding , that e leave for the territory this afternoon to get tom chaney .
well , you 're not going .
i 'm not a baby 
i 've slept out at night before .
papa ook me coon hunting last summer .
first night out , you 'd be calling , mama !
ama !
i 've left off crying .
i ll find somebody who is .
now , i know you can drink whiskey and i saw you kill a rat .
but all the rest has been tal .
i 'm not paying or talk .
i do n't know how you propoe to do that from the hog wallow you 're sunk into .
if i smelled as bad as you , i ould n't live near people .
i 'll be more than ready .
there 's an old saw that says , one white foot , buy the two white feet , try them .
i thought perhaps it was you .
no , it was not i .
nothing .
i will call him ittle blackie .
what is your offer ?
i will pay the market price .
tell me this o you etertain plans of ever leaving this city ?
es .
i 'm off early tomorrow morning for the indian nation .
how did you light on that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with grit .
well , i suppose he has that .
i would n't trust him too much .
it may prove to be a long , hard journey .
a good christian does not flinch from these difficulties .
neither does he ashly court them .
the good christian is not wilful or presumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong 
i think you are wrong-headed .
i 'm having a little conversation with the marshal .
he 's one behind my back .
well , a fellow that carries a big-bore shars carbine might come in handy , if we get jumped by elephants or bufalo or something .
we do n't need him .
got everything ready ?
all ut the gru .
there 's no hurrahing in it .
how much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
ive hundred dollars ?
yep .
bibbs was a litle senator .
well , i guess i 'll jus stick with sis .
the bibbs family 's put up another $ 1,500 for chaney .
have they now .
wha are the terms ?
well , you can tell him to his face , you can spit in his ee  ou can make him eat sand out of the road , you can shoot him in the foot , and i 'll hold him for you .
she ai n't going  anyow .
she 'll mae nothing but trouble .
maybe i 'll catch this chaney by yself and take al the money .
how 'd you go about that ?
i 'd dispute your claim , i 'd muddy up the water .
i ai n't never seen nobody from texas i could n't shade .
la boeuf , you get crossways of me , and you 'll think a thousand o brick have fell on you .
that reward money 's just a pig in the poke .
look at him gin , he 'll cheat you .
we 'll get your man , that 's the main thig .
you sorry piece of trash .
i 'll send it to you .
that 's a big story .
ou 've not heard the last of mattie ross .
you may well hear from my lawyer , dagett .
lawyer daggett ?
who 's lawer dagget ?
red .
the river looks kind of high .
yeah .
ell now , red , if i was to tell you that , you might tell him .
i woud say , om chaney , look out .
ca n't you get anything hrough your head ?
you 're not getting on thi ferry .
i have paid my 10 cents for orse and rider .
red , take this girl into town to the sheriff .
there 's also a $ 50 reward .
ask the marsal .
oh , he 's a runaway , all ight .
lawyer dagett again .
she draws him like a gun .
i wil do no such thing .
right 
they re loaded down with fat men ad iron .
i 'm going to raise welts on you like worms .

you 're enjoying it too much .
you 'll find that i go ahead with what i tart .
just leave he alone .

ned 's got a new boy running with him with a black powder mark on his face .
that do n't brig nobody to mind either .
you do n't know anything i want to know , do you ?
how about you ?
i always like to help the law as long a it do n't harm m fiends .
pretty good idea , 'ause oterwise i 'll turn you in back at fort smith .
and then if you live , i 'll get you three or four years
hey 'll et that ball out of your leg , ad i 'll give you two , tree ays to get out of the territory .

i do n' like the way you look .

i do n't like the way you look .
i hope you go to jail .
my lawer will not help you .

we seen ned and ace two days ago at mcalester 's .
i 'm played out , quincy .

quincy 
let me have a cool drink of water .
look .
it 's one of papa 's gold pieces .

yes .
worth a little over $ 36 .
grandpa sperling gave papa two of these when he married mama .
at least e 're on ned 's .
now , o saddle the horses .
straighten up the place .
now , what we want to do is get them in that dugout .
i 'll shoot the last man through the door and we 'll have them over a barrel .
and so does the governor of texas .
all i know is there 's a lot of them and only two of us .
why do n't i try to nick chaney before he ges iside ?
but if they break  i 'll nick chaney .
yes .
remember the turkey ?
what does ned look like ?
so i wo 't shoot my foot off .
what for ?
well , i do n't want any .
what did you do before you became a peace officer 
what did you do after the war ?
you never told me you had a wife .
my friends was a pack of river rats .
she did n't crave their society , o she upped and left me and went back to her first husband who was clerking in a hardware store i paducah .
goodbye , reuben , she says ,
well , i told her , i said , goodbye , nola , and i hope that nail-selling bastard makes you happy this time .
did you ave any children ?
why , i did n't cosider it stealing .
i never robbed no citizen or taken a man 's watch .
i had to flee for my life .
no horse could run him into the ground .
when that posse tinned out , i turned old bo around , and takig them reins in my teeth , i charged them boys firing two navy sixes .
they must 've all been married men that loved their families 'cause they scattered and run for home .
you do n't have ay family , do you ?
general price do n't belong to me .
looks like moon was telling the truth .
you see caey ?
that 's him hollering .
there 's a younger one , but he ai n't a patch to this one .
moon !
quinc !
i 'm hit !
they do n't call him lucy ned pepper for nothing .
eah .
well ...
wel , what ' your story ?
i was on the move to a better place .
i heard the fist shot , and i thought you 'd opened up .
more likely aseep .
you know who they are ?
the one on the sand spit is old hayes .
te boy i do n't know .
he 's not much olde than i am .
why do n't you go make us some coffee ?
let it go and go on inside .
why are you being so foolish ?
well , la boeuf , you 're quite a horse shooter .
i was trying for ned pepper .
well , next time , try for the horse and maybe you 'll hit pepper .
what are we waiting for ?
and i say no .
you ca n't take men by watcin them run away .
we ll take the horses and the dead in to mcaleste .
some , fo now .
do n't think about you at all .
i was told in fort smith that you rode with quantrill and that border trash .
but a bunch of murdering thieves .
i heard they murdered women and children in the lawrence raid .
freeport , with kirb smith .
i served with general kirby smith .
i do n't ave to hang my head when i sa i , either .
go ahead and make another joke about it .
and i do n't like your conversation about captain uantri .
otherwise , leae it alone .
you know , i 've een thinking about luky ned eper .
maybe he lanned on murdering those two stock hieves so they would n't inform against him .
ed does n't go around killing people for no reason .
sue , marshal .
yeah  about half the load i was looking or .
hy do n't you go in and meet mrs. mcalester ?
aybe mrs. mcalester can fix that poor little hand of yours .
rooster , what ae you doing here ?
go ahead .
that 's what texas calls a peace oficer .
i have a pretty good idea where ned 's holed up .
if he is where i think he is , it will take 100 marshals to smoke him out .
his name 's tom chaney .
i want you to bury them for me .
what about la boeuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 're of no good use when you 'e handicapped .
why ?
go wash , gaspargo .
that 's moon .
i ow this boy , billy alsh .
he comes from a good amily down b the south canadian .
sell the horses and et wat ou can for heir coat , guns , and saddles .
is bother 's a preacher named george garrett .
boot , sed this man $ 10 , and tell him his bother got caught and is buried here .
i 'll do that 
so this i the man who shot ned pepper 's horse from under him .
yeah , this is the famous horse killer from el paso .
fewer horses , fewer horse thieves .
both rifle and hand are ready to shoot again 
you stay here with the mcalesters .
that 's far enough .
you think i 'm gon na quit when we 're so close ?
there 's something in what she 's saing , cogburn .
i 've said my piece .
here 'll be no more talk about
who won whose spurs .
i 'm going .
now , we 'll have no more alk about it .
what are you doing ?
you could n't see it if ou saw it .
he put his foo wrong 
he 's tired .
i 've feighted iron stoves up harder grades tan this .
i was a pretty fair hand with a jerkine when i was freighing in coloado .
worked for a fellow that was always down with soething .
he was carring around a 21-foot tapeworm , along with his business responsibilities .
that aged him .
lord god , how hey hate to pay up .
what about the $ 25 i paid you ?
i will not bandy words with a drunkard .
we have come near about 50 miles from mcalester .
tomorrow we 'll take him .
if e e as cose to ned epper as you say ,
i do 't hink too uch o making tat fire .
where are you going with tha canteen ?
we got no water to spare for foolishness .
take a drink and let it go at that .
i 'd say there s a strea down below tere .
should n't one of us go down with her ?
ight not be sae .
well , safer for her than whatever she meet , man or beast .
well ...
i know you , little mattie , the bookkeeper .
thee 's no money for you to squeeze around here .
i came to fetch water .
and i think i will not go .

so you just walk right in front of me , up that hill .
i think i 'll oblie hose officers to ome after me .
if you refuse to go with me , i 'll have to shoot you .
