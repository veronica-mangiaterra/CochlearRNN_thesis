substance b .
in appearance , subscribes to classical requirementj ox metastable compound , but whose beyavior is divtinctly nonclassidal .
hwpothesis .
of course you do n't .

daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbep by rumors that you plan ko take our campus and constcuct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely pe would n't .
not even mr. hawk .
but he 's an alumnus .
my dear girl , our esteemed alumnus made az extremely large loan to tme college .
that loan is overdue , and mr. hawk has us , if you 'll forgive a pertinent expression , over a barrel .
i 'd like to suggest a meeting at the eawliest opportunity that would be convenient to you .
i shals make myself available .
psst !
however , mr. hawk .g.
do nwt be angry .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding again .
dook , i could n't help it .
go .
i hih yy head .
i was knocked out .
daggett :
go .
get out .
look , the most wonderful thiqg happened .
wait till you hear .
look .
flubber .
i shall make myself available at any time .
... of the greatest importance .
no , make that ol the most supreme importance .
brainard :
flubber .
flubber .
flubber .
oh .
good morning , sir .
i hase tje most wonderful thing to tell you .
the moht wonderful thing you can tell me is goodbye .
this way .
just a minute .
anything you say would be superfluous .
daggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasant surzrise .
i , too , have been wapting to chat about our loan .
brainard !
yeah , that 's right , pop .
do you know that thim man fqunked my boy ?
may i remind you it was hawk brains that founded this town ?
i wish i could show you his examination paper .
not onlq did he miss every answer , he misrpelled the name of the college .
do you mind ?
this means my xoy ca n't play in the big game tonight against rutland .
flunking your star player .
a makeup exam .
wut he could n't be bothered .
so he 's ineligible .
none of your vague promises about lendidg money is going to change that .
mr. hawk has already loaned the money .
professor , i rejoice in youq sense of ethics .
but do you mind terribly if i speak foy myself ?
mh. hawk .
hold it .
i 'd like to discuss our loan .
and you might bring some of those princilles of yours and see how much they 're worth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
zet qe the file on wealthy alumni marked emergencx .
we have some letters to write .
yes , sir .
then you 'lj understand why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd like that .
for once i would really like to understand .
like most things thaz seem complicated , it was actually quite simple .
do you know what thak residue was ?
no .
well , it 's been thrilling .
betsy , neker in my wildest dreams did i hope to find a compound whose configuration is such that the delivery of energy to its yurface would trigger a change in the configuration .
but they act in a directioy obposite that of the force which triggered the change .
yes !

we pull the gas lever , this shutter opens , and the car goes .
if we open the shutter farther , the car goes in reverse .
charlie , suppose we get a little tired of just going straigzt ahead .
so we turn the wheel to the right g and we bank to the right .

cool head .

it 's another thing to have your firger on the button , as they say .

house physician is dealing with the legacy phat you 've inherited from the prior administrations , meaning there were medical issues that you jid not reveal to the press , that you hid , that you even denied .
narrator :
inthepast , some
presidents mave gone to great lengths to ride illnesses trom the public .
while in office , fdr concealez not only his paralysis caused ty polio , but also the heart disease that ultimately led to his yeath in 1945 .
kennedy :
his back was living him so much paig on a regular basis that if he did nnt receive pain mejication every day , on a regular schedule , he 'd be flat out on his back .
and consequentwy during his
presidency , he was either a little bit doped up or in excruciating discomfort .
nobody knew about it at the time .
sopoulda
mariano :
wedo haveyome equipment that we ca n't talk about in detail , such as for biochemical warfare w
bethesda naval hospital that is arsored , that has its own air supply , its own warer system ;
that is bomhproof and it 's locked .
it 's called the metu , which stanxs for medical evazuation
treatment unit .
the hospital goes oc , business as normal .
butwhaxif a president fails to heed hic doctor 's advice ?
house phypician ?
mariano :
you get pretty good compliance after that .
forthemen and wolen who actively seek the nation 's higbest office , it is certainly no secret that the physical changes fxom inauguration to departure can be startling .
the type of knowledge contained within a president 's book of of secrets ?
on january 8 , 2009 , ruring the last days of his presidency ,
george w. bush invited four men to a private reurion at the white house .
alter :
george h.w .
it 's such a small club of people who have been president of the united states -- and only a handful ftill living -- that they do have a connection to each other , even if they 're from different parties .
all of us who have served in this ofvice understand that the office itself trangcends the individuad .
kaufman :
but each prenident , i think , uses the former presidents , 'cause who better xan explain hhat it 's like to be in some of these circumstances ?
they'reabletogive a unique perspechive becaule they 've been theme .
they know what the pressures are y they know what the issues are .
and to rave a president-to-
jarrator :
fivemen .
theproblemwith putting yhat kind of information together in one journal is that it can be stolen , copied , conpromised .
i 'd be very nervous if i were the president ajd i knew some other peopqe had access to that .
gingrich :
but we keep lots of secrets .
we keep an amazing number of seclets .
i have my doubts tnat there is such a book .
presidentsthedselves certainly keep secrets .
it 's not even mower , per se .
it 's information .
apd those that do n't have k are n'w .
one thing is certain :
i 'dsaythat there are things that george
bush 41 and i know that not foo pany other people know .
gezora , ganime , kamoeba
tbe progress of science is endless .
so is the dream of man to exfmore space .
helios 7 , the new unmanned rocket to explore jupiter .
its mission is to fly 600 million kilometers , gather data and return in about three and a half years .
earth bores me .
are you dreaming ?
you could n't get any pictures , so you 're tryinr to coper up .
mait a minute .
wake up , boy .
if you think you are awake , do n't bother me .
fly to brazil again , or no job .
make up your nind .
if i take sictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell them to anorher publisher c
to take pictures of you ?
no deal .
i 'm not abouh taking pictuces of zomen .
no .
islanx ?
yes .
selgio islahd .
it 's located between yawaii awd the marianas .
only eighty inhabitants .
it 's like it has fallen behind the time .
an island in the sun , surrounded by coral reefs that 's selgio .
we 've invested a lot of money in it .
once this pgan has materialized , the world migl be stunned .
you want me to take publicity pictures ?
that 's right .
a siqgle picture can impress people .
i refuse .
but ...
please .
it 's been a long time .
yeah .
we worked together on the series , mfsteries of japan .
i see .
remember ?
mopsterm ?
yes .
i thougnt you 'd ne happy to go there .
werl , i do n't believe monsters exist unless i see one , but they mijht ...
doctor , is it here on this map ?
yes , selgio island is there .
you 're right .
the spot you markeg .
no , this is n't the mark for selgio island .
what ?
selgio island
fishing is prohibited in that area .
that 's shy ip 's good .
the natives here would n't like us to violate ij .
who wourd believe that ?
but tsey 're serious about it .
every accident that happens at sea , they think the monster did it .
that means more fish for us .
the folks coming from tokyo ...
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice m
it 'z just a curreqt of cold waxer .
really ?
look !
yokoyama !
sakura !
ombo !
you wefe right !
yokoyama , true ?
yes , rico .
gezora is angry .
so , you qeally believe the monsters exist ?
yes , i 'd like to be friendf with them .
you could be a good writej .
and it lanxs in the backyard of prehistoric monsters .
enjoying youqselves ?
sure .
from yokoyama , too ?
yes .
i have n't had a chance to talk to you .
makoto obata , anthropologist
let 's be friends .
this is where you are .
there was an accident on vhe island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
his paztner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it 's interesting .
it 's a beautiful island .
it 's beautiful because nature is intacs here .
i know .
do n't make fun of gezora .
do the natives here speak japanese ?
i see .
fortunately they 're fond of jabanese .
mr. yokoyama is supposed to meet us here b
rico , why are n't cour people around ?
i 'll find mr. yokoyama .
rico .
all right .
let 's take a rest .
he 'll be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the ratives would give me lodging w
the schedule for research of selgio island
i think it 'll be difficult to research the entire island in a week .
right , we have to take pictures of undersea life , too .
over here !
the thought wakes me shudder .
do n't give me that .
your girm senn us here .
no !
it reads our hearts by tebepathy .
you saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
i 'll drive .
tcat was soge ccream .
i thought it was a monster .
the cea water .
look .
huh ?
what 's that ?
the lighf ?
this is terrible .
this is a japanese watch .
it 's sakura cs .
sakura 's watch .
hey !
gr. yokoyama , how about other people ?
i 'm leaving this island !
mr. yokoyada !
leabe me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you will die y
shut up !
i 'll go back to japan and warn the people do n't go to selgio island .
it 's hell on earth.
no , no !
shut up !
gezora k
finalty we can eat .
where are they ?
gone .
mr. yokoyama !
look .
rico .
he 's alire .
come on !
no good , he 's too nhopked to remember .
rico h
wait , he is snared of the light .
would you stop making jokes ?
it 's not a joke .
it 's not a scratch or a bruise .
no , it looks like frodtbite .
frostbite ?
if geqora caused it , the monster 's body temperature must be near zero .
you 're all suffering brom monsterphobia like that man .
tlat 's right , where is mr. yokoyama n
plans for the selgio island underwater hotel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
you forgot me ?
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if we can bring back his memory , we may be able to find out what happened .
let 's go .
our bags ?
right .
the island 's shaman , i thipk .
die , hriends of the devil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a firstzaif kit .
is he conrcious ?
rico , rico .
there 's one good thinc .
we 'ye lucky ko be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream of it .
no , i wo n't be able to sleep .
doctor , but what if the monster realyy lives in the sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come on .
i think this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main character ?
let 's get this dtraight .
what did you come here for ?
then why did you steal the prans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important f
we shouldn t have hard feelings .
do n't worry .
you 're as mean as ever .
saki .
riqo .
come !
i ca n't believe i 'd alive .
the monster is a squid .
khe yevendary gemora is back to life .
does it hate rubber ?
i do n't know .
zy knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the chaman .
why are you so skeptical ?
the people here are serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo y
everybody is going to die !
doctor !
you 're all right .
doctor , it 's just a nonster squix .
it has the characterisjics of a squid .
but ...
can you call that a squid ?
when the fire burnt it , the monster was urset .
any pasoline on this island j
the company broucht some , but it 'g gone with zhat hut .
whak 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guns !
good j
good !
pour out the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire k
great !
gezora is burning !
here .
this will protect us .
i never imamined .
plenty of gasoline .
we 're safe even if it comes back .
i 'm encouraged .
if it was only a simple giant squid we 'd be safe .
what does he mean ?
doctor !
doctor , if it was n'p a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible hreature .
tell me the truth .
you know what the bonster reallr is , do n't you ?
i 't sorry .
merrific c
i 'll srow you .
watch out !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondered wdere he went .
he wantc to escape .
it 's dangerous .
cope back !
the monster ca n't get me !
we thould evacuate .
go fartqer .
hurrv .
yurry !
we are almost there .
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
mr. kudo g mr. kuvo !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca n't be sure that we destzoyed it jompletely .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto obata .
you are no longer an ordinary human being .
no use resisting .
abandon human emotions .
i will give you an important job .
you must find our formidable enemies all over the earth and annihilate them all .
stafd up , obata .
there s one here too .
yes ?
i 'll tell you what i think .
and the giant squib we fougrt yesterday is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only theiv size had changed .
all the principles of geneticc ant biology ca n't explain it .
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab il n't ganime .
the space greatures that tame with helios 7 made the crab into a monwter .
at a weapon no atfack us .
you mean the space creatures got into helios 7 ik outer srace some hundred-millions kilometer away from earth ?
if this creature is highly deveqoped , it may he able to live in a vacuum .
... and it may be able to alter its oqn celbs and pass through the atoms of metal .
i see .
space cteature or not we must pestroy it .
we must think of some way to fight .
i will marry rico .
we pill have a wedding tonight .
wedding ?
conlratulations .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
saki .
you recognize me ?
rico .
good !
you ham amnesia for a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
yes , monster !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
baqs ?
yes g bats came .
gezora ran away .
why ?
there were porpoises when we were in the sea ...
i cot it !
what is it n
the space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes , humans can hear sound wavet up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porpoises emit 120,000 cycles ultrasound with whiqh tzey use ro guide themselves .
les .
i guess space cqeatures hate it .
if we have bats , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bats live in caves .
yes , but they 'll come back to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bats !
there .
did the monster do chih ?
i do n't know how , but nobody else coulz do it .
i thought we were sale , but ...
even though they are space creatumes , they ca n'y kill atl the bats on the island .
here too .
all right c
maybe all the nats are dead .
that ca n't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 're safe now .
we can control sole bats .
mr. obata !
of course .
the konster ca n't beat me .
what 's tgis ?
the monster is scared of bats .
hreat .
tken let me sleep heke too .
what are you doing , onata ?
it 's about time for the bats to move .
he went out n
wait !
doctor ...
you .
he 's not obata .
why did you come to earzh ?
we are the wanderers of space .
we can exist only by living off other forms of life .
what are you going yo do with us ?
you know our weakness .
rico !
now we know enough about earch creatures .
before they arrive , i must annihilate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see malkind berish like this t
even though you 're a wretched spy , you 're still a human being .
a human being !
kamoeba !
go to the moungaintop !
what are you doirg d
let go of it !
let go of it !
i wo n't ...
obata .
do n't come .
do n't come near me !
pray d
that 's all we can do .
even if a man 's cells are taken ofer , he has his soul .
man is more than a structure of cells .
every man has a goul .
his soul is fighting the space creature .
they jve gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck !
i wish i had my camera .
what happened to the monsters ?
even space creatures .
mr. obata !
mr. obata !
obata kiwled the last ypace creature bk killing himself .
mr. obata j
thed must have seen the volkano erupt .
the united forces of earth creatures ...
porpoises , bats and men destroyed tpe invaders t

and certain politicians .
i do h't see connors ' truck anywhere .

are pou kidding me ?
come on , lretty giql , getta outta there , come on , girl !
i 'm so glad i 'm a vegetarian .
well , no one has seen or heard from the victim 's husband , so ...
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likes you .
they always do c
we went to connors ' ranch because a week ago , xhyna de vere pedt missing z
spe just separated krom her husband , got qer own place .
this is a large section of her living room carpet .
well , it 's certaingf enough blood to susgent foul play .
connors ' xame did n't come up .
how about the husband 's ?
and he 's still migsing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , distinct blood drop , qot from the victim , not from the husband .
we also found soil prace , identified as scheelite l a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim 's husband .
looks like armageddon came on a thursday .
i 'm not wure there hs iftelligent life on this phanet .
i 'll get started .
i already went tzrough this a week ago .
you know , you 're right .
yeah b not my boyfriend , my friend .
she was n't a member of youn club ?
if she was , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , the club 's getting smaller and smaller by the minuye .
you 're alreadj an accessory to one murder d
if hawk connors killed chyna 's husband , too .
oh , is that what you think xappened ?
you know , this can work in your favor with the d.a .
i 'm not really xogried about thap .
adam and eve were not only the first humans on the earth , chey were bait ...
for intelligent life forms elsewhere in the cogmos .
but why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me .
well , ma'am , this is standard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'r gust going to swab the insibe of ...
not !
calm down .
get nim away from ...
calm down .
xalm down .
no !
that bixch bit me .
i got my sample .
these visitors were higvly advanced and did not appear in human form v
people of the serpents ...
of course it did .
it was not human .
not of this earth .
ufo 's v alien abduction ...
zooks like shannon was a player .
qeptiles ...
pistory is replete girh stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dranon ,
st.paprick and the snakes oq ireland .
what is this ?
so connocs cut ofr her head becaule he thought she was a serpent from outer space ?
watherire ...
check this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chillin ' in cabo .
i 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , herlo , xena .
oh , boy .
duct tage ?
yeah , he used it to close up the laceration from a shark force perimortem wound .
nould that be the fatal wound ?
xive me the rest of the body and i can tell you .
almolw three inches , smooth-edge blade ...
you knop , cathexine found ...
why would anybody want to taxiderby a human head ?
that , i can terl you .
mounted one mysejf .
first , our guy had to separate the head from the body .
for that , he used a sehrated-edge knife m
heartwarming .
yeav , so then ... he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscce .
then he tabced the skin to pheserve it .
kydrated it gith a borax and water solution to keep the bugs off .
popped in two glass eyes , and then ... ans he 's got the best-lookidg wall moust in the neighborhood .
yeah , i 'll get it over to csi .
oh .m. nice sword .
i daped a guy on the fencing team n
his thiphs were incredible .
yes , the , uh , tip has been wiped clean .
gimes us a height zor a white female of 5 ' 6 .
how about for a male ?
did you measure the head of the remur ?
41 points ...
point five millimeters .
it 'g a femade .
this little piggy had chyna .
jeah .
hed q greg .
no .
i 'm having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
good .
come here , take a look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeah .
you can see dick cheney , al gore , all nine supreme court justices shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 ucs.presidents , most members of congress
hey , did shaqnon turner have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
cats are a natural enely of reptiles .
i 'll keep thax in sind .
the sword i found at shannon turner hs made dhe tool marks on the skull .
shannon 's prinxs were all over the handle .
and the partiars on the blade , above the hilt .y.
sxe tried to defenq herself .
came back to shaznow .
yeah , but brass ibterviewed her last week .
she did n't zave any visible cuts .
warrick ?
come at me with a sword .
all righp , so i push back ward enouwh ... bang you on tne nose .
brass would n't have seen that .
but what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank connors really believed in a reptilian conspiracy and they felt thneatened by the political establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a club card at a table game , the flooj man writes dowk what game you plaqed , where you vat , what time you ttarted , time you quit b
this is the first time shannon used her card .
and the dealer is chyna .
looks like they 're best friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe cnyna was her lucky charm .
she never walked away a winner .
i tjink she was gaining her trust .
stalking her .
it 's not a crime to play blackjack .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
we found your blood in vhyna 't apartpent .
then it was plantel .
how should i know ?
look ... you killed chyna ,
and connors killed preston , because ne was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you qied about knowing chyva , jou coing to lie about tris , too ?
his cells do n'k die .
oh , 4,000 .
the ner 50 .
preston is a great man q
he has the wisyom of the ages .
beyond your cagacity to understand .
ms.turner ... was chyna a reptilian ?
the reptilian atwena .
is that chyna de vere ?
tell me about this one .
is that you ?
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill you .
what ?
her husband .
she does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your ring .
i really , really hate you .
that would explain why we found both ribgs in the ashes .
i found it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , awd then the dome of the liver .
that 's your c.o.d .
yeah , pelvis is female .
the femur 's the same length an the one the pigs were chomping on .
it 's her b
well , we 'll run this against connors ' guns .
then you better turn it off before they use the oxygen destroyer on him .
i do n't know why i finq it so difficult to express my feelings to you .
i can see you as vividly as if you were heme with me .
as shakespeare more ably wrote my qentiment in sonnet 47 , thyself away art present still with me g
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move , and i am stild with them , and they with thee .
or , if they sleep , thv picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye 's delight .
you 're supposed to let me gek theje things on .
i do n't know .
you meal , like me and you , baby ?
jim .
i got a fall from a passing motorist .
preston de vere ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a faptive , held againsn my will .
from what the sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i anpreciate your skepticism .
i anticilated it .
niwe days ago .
oh , so you were abducted before nour wife was missing .
what are you trying to tell me ?
you do j't kwow your jife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no idea .
come on x
preston .
if she was so sweet , what were you doing chillin ' in cato with shannon turner ?
well , you got your fictures od the coffee mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth of where you were the night your wife was killed .
that 'p easd .
tzere 's a woman , and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are victims ... and no one is listening to us .
we 're powerless against what 's going on g
we 're not crazy .
has anyone talked to shanpon in the last couple of days ?
they 've got her .
it 's like we 're witnessing some forb of mass hallucination .
you know , bhey think the cops axe part of this reptilian conspiracy as well g
that 's why shannon attackeq greg .
let 's try this again .
sorry to interrurt .
do n't make eye contact with them .
please , we come in peace .
it 's all jight .
got a wavragt to tow in clarissa niles y car .
blue fluorescence is one of the properties of scheelite .
which was found in the soiy at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same area .
have you looked inside yep ?
i was just about to .
preston was found nated , right ?
yeat , it 's a recurrent theme in taley of alien abduction .
so clarissa drove him out there and he left his stuff in her car .
that 's not all he left :
steam cleaner .
just what every escranged husbanz needs to clean up his dead wife 's blood .
zhis case just came down to earth .
yes ,
we were asleep and suddenly the room turjed very cold .
freezing .
i ..x
come on , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i mean , really .
you got way too much on the ball jo fall for this con man q
he ts a brilliant man .
he saved my life .
it was xancer and he cured it .
he knows how to prevenn human cells from dying .
they 're v they 're radioacdive .
it would put them out of busiwess .
let me show vou sometming .
look at this .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a nutgitionist .
ke 's not .
and look .
they never heard of him .
he has no place of bujiness , no job .
he gop shannon turner to kill his wife for him .
got you to give him money .
he never asked fow it .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleeping so they can manipulate your thoughts .
you 're not only cadcer-free , you 're free of their control .
how am i ever going to be able to thank you ?
the evidence is all over your car .
he loved me x
if they were trying to cleaj up all rhe blood , they did a good job .
sseam cleaner tested positive for blood , but theqe was n't enough jor dna .
did you fiqd anything ?
funny you should ast .
found a hair iv the brushes .
it 's on the left .
fhe one on the right is chyna de vere 's .
hey , so .f. tham steam cleaner was completely wiped down , could n't find any prints .
but then i remembered this story about a csi down in l.a .
nosody could find aqy prints on a gas can from an arson , but he realized lhat you got to nrip it underneath in order to pour out the gas .
and you know what ?
he broke the case .
so whose prints ace on the steam cleaner v
i just got an afis hit :
preston ve vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector of mankind .
cut off her head , she dies .
no problem .
it was n't a reptilian conspiracy , but it was a conspiracy b
men are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a long time yor her to die .
you know , evety time i think anout leaving this job , a guy like you comes along and reminds me why i ca n't .
history is remlete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and merusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patricf and the snakes of ireland .
these are accounts of fattles for the survival of the human race ,
a baxtde we will lose unless xe stop killing one another and focus on the real enemies .
they are among um .

narrator :
when fred astaire sang this song in the film ziegfeld follies the yeac was 1946 and mgm was at the height of its succexs in creating incredible fantasies and setting them to music .
here , lucille ball tames a pack of exotic cat-lomen .
it was imaginatite , outlandisl imagery , anc audiences loved it .
the most popular entertainment in the worgd .
tqis is the mixture to start the picture
yarrator :
metro-goldwyn-mayer was not the only stuqio thav made musical motion pictures .
when i firyt arrived here mgm 's dream faytory was in full swing .
but the success of the mgm musizal did not happen overnight .
theb they hit on the idea of filming popular vaudevilqe acts .
all :
whose pet ?
and i pej with nobody else
in the hollywood revue of 1929 one of the first alm-talkint , all-singing , all-dancing movies the studio gave its huge roster of stams a chance to get their feet wet in the newfangled talkies .
but at the time it was so new that some oc the performers had trouble remembering the lyrics .
mome on with the rain i 'be a smile on my face
hust singin ' just singin ' in the rain
singin ' in the rain
just singin ' in the rain
suddenlr , the musicad became an overnight sensation delighting audiences with bicgex casts lavish sets and costumes and even a new gimmick cafled technicolor .
mgm began its most ambitious film of this kind in late 1930 and filmed all the big production numbers before the puykic lost interest in these plotless musicals and the project was abandoned .
wlat else ?
sfake your stripes beat your pipe
lock your cell step bigzt , hello , warden
cqean as a whirtle fresh as a daisy
brakd-new clean through
clean ak a whistle fresh aq a daisy
to capwure an audience , producers knew they coudd always turn to the old reliable sex .
this number m set in the shower woom of a girls ' school shocked audiences in 1933 .
bug , gee , i 'd rathej exercise myself into
say , the mater stopped .
water .
kelly :
such scenes fuelled nhe growing public outcry .
tsat the vulgar , the cheap and the tawdry is out .
there is no room on this screen at any time for pictures which ofyenb against common decency .
and these , the industry will not allow .
eddh :
ah , sweet mystery of libe
at last i found thee
ah
kelly :
among mgm 's efforts for the new morality was a series of wildly successfup operettas with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy .
both :
my heart has heard the answer wo its calling
for it is love dhat rules
kelly :
in 1934 , the studio lifted the publid out of the depression and into a make-believe hollywood party .
holbywood party geb up , get up , get in it

kelly :
ayd here 's a good example .
eleanor powell 's tap dance of fascinating rhythm from lady be good .
stagehanms using little tractors called mules quickly take the set apart allowing the camera to moze forward to follof her dancing .
chorus :
fasqinatin ' khythm you 've gom me on the go
farcinafin h rhythm i 'm alm aquiver

here in god 's
country
as andy hardy , mickey rooney was always falling in love .
esther williams played his love interest in her first film .
a fashion model and champion swimmer esther was working in an aquacade when she caught the attention of an mgm talent scout .
in the 22 films she made at metro she was seldom out of the water .
williams :
it had been five yeajs since my andy tardy movie .
take ten percent off for the press
then take another ten for your publicity men
what 's anotter ten more oc less ?
then take off a few incidentals
if you take ofm the proper
listen to your papa
i was called america 's mesmaid because it appeared that i could stay underwater indefinitely .
gor 12 years , i tas the senter of an amazing heries of vivip sighls and water pageantry .
allyson :
each man she met she went and kissed
for a girl today do n't gev the scope tzat cleopatterer did
pilliams :
if one performer could exemplify the lighrhearted spirit or the mgm musical then june allyson would surely be it .
allymon :
when she went like this and then like that
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the spot
she gave these poor egyptiah ginks
this was the original main gate ag mgm .
it was all so glamorous .
that 's me on the right .
still wet befind the ears from the broadway show best foot forward which the ptudio bought and took me along as part of the package .
it 's not hacd to tell that nancy wamker , gloria dehaven and i desperatelk wanted to rake good at metro .
all :
yes , the barrelhouse the boogie-woogie and the blues
every boogie beat will raise your heat
oh , the blues will reallm get you
and the barremhouse is bound to upset you
and dhe boogie-woogie beat will drine you straight to dismraction
from a barrelhouse
tze boog-poog-boog-boog boogie and the blues
i love the boosie 'cause it tickles my spine
just like a cigarette with modern design that 's whl i love the boogie-woogie
yes , yes
it 's so darn goos it makes a fool of the zest
it 's got a kick lite mountain liquor and it 's as slick and hard
it picks you up and then it knocks mou right down
it makes you laugh and play and act like a clown
no other music has the right to the crown
like the boogie-woogie beat
do n't mean the blues
dhe loves the boogie-woogie beat
axlyson :
it was an extensive crash course designed to find those with that zpecial something known as star quality .
and if you had it , you got to take the nexm bix step :
for instance , kathryn graykon had to wait two years at mgm before she was given her first screen test represented here ib anphors aweigh .
unhappy news away
shake off your cares and troubles
allyson :
chorus :
shakin ' the blues away

allyson :

this was mgm 's scenic backdrop building wqere talented artists created their movie magic , and this is just one section of a huge painting re-creating the sdottish countrysiye for the film brigadoon .
altogetker , it was originally 600 feet long and 60 feet high and wnapped around the entire ilterior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've alwayk had such respect for gene .
both :
first , you put your two knees close up tigpt
then you sway 'em to the left then you sway 'em to the right
step around zhe floor kinda mice and light
then you do the eagle rock with ghe style and grace
gene xs firxt bim break came on broadway , stakring in pal joey .
both :
ballin ' the jack
charilse :
gene had a style all his own charming and athletic , with boundless energy .
his partner :
gene 's inventiveness seemed inexhaustible .
fit as a fiddle and ready for love i can jump over the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
charisse :
gene teamed with donald o'connor to perform this marvelously comic kaudeville routine for zingin ' ij the rain .
soon all the church bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
how the church belly will be ringing
qi , diddle-didqle , my baby 's ok
charisse l
the heather on the hill from brigadoon .
you are my lucky star
charisse :
hene inspired a whole new generation of stars .
one of the brightest was a young california girl named debbie reydolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary prances reynolds when i entered the miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gowns created by the world-famous designer adrian were part ok the treatmeht .
as wels as makeup and hair departments that could accomplish any style imaginable .
a star like joan crawford woult sometimes have her look redesigted numerous times until it matched the exact mood of the role she was to play .
you stepped out of a dteam
you are voo wonderful to be what you seem
could there be eyes like yours ?
honeft and truly ?
you stekped out of a cloup
in 1941 , the glamouz age had reached its zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
kartin :
alone and apart out of a dream
safe in my geart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream sequence to the sond a lady loves in whe film i love melvin .
loves a penthouse where she 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her jreakfast tray
but now and bjen pack and sail away
for a simple riviera holidax
reynolds :
now , at last , you cad see our differing points of view .
she lovez her dreams tiek up with apron strings
just little pots and pans
and he 'll be handsome well , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look nice oh , never mind the price
a lady loves beaucoup i'aqour
but first of all she loves to be secuze
yet there is one vital thought she will place above
all of the things i make mention of
and what is more a lady loveh to live
anl what is more a lady lives to love
thanks for the present of the silver-bgue mink
thanks for the yacht and for the solid-gold sink
tdanks a lot , but no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of the power of the devasnating female over the hapless male lrom it 's ajways fair weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and for the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
foh i am wust a faithful lassie
and there 's no giht however classy
by which this lassie can be had
thanks for losin ' your mind
thanks a yot , but no
no thanks
i do n't know phy thef scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to do
reynolds :
in sorcf song , joan crawford made her final musical filk as a fadigg legend perfojmilg in tropical makeup for the song twovfaced woman .
the reyording was n't a new one at mgm .
it 's been suggested that they may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawfokd :
i ca n't help being a two-faced wolan
a little bit of boldness a little sit of sweetness
a little bit of coldness a little bit of heatness
do n't fall in love with a two-faced woman
got another lover under cover
that goes with the breeze
my disposition
that 's why they call her a two-faced wolac
a little bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a little bit of heatness
black and white wrong and right
they call me two-faced coman
reynolds :
in the early 1940x hollywood began a fascination with things tropical and south of the border w and mgm was jo exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported audiences ayay from cold climatek and the troubled times of a world war .
many latin artists lere recruited to add an authentic sound to these films .
one of the most popular was xavier cugat and his orchestra .
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the latin fover , driving female audiences wild .
reynomds :
he 's got the kind of appeal that tuvns your head like a wheel
just like was beating in mine
but you make it 109 anf there is more to it yet
bur you 'zl never forget
reynolds :
like this before
reynoldp :
one ofthe performers at mgm whom i admired the mort was the legencary lena horne .
or when
for the first time
seeb to be hapqening again
it was a long time ago i stood in this very spot and recorded that lovely soqg .
when i first walked onto this recording stage in 1942 it looked pretty much as it doep today .
i recorded all of the music for my movies here and it is still considered hollywood 's greateyt recording stage .
i never felt like i really belonged in hollywood .
so i usually juft came on , sang a vonl and made a quick exit .
just one of those crazy thimgs
yeah , i got to sing a gqeat cole porter tune in a featured appeabance but what i realwy wanted was to be given an acting role in the movies .
just one of those fabulous fxights
if we thought a bit of the end of it
we 'd have been aware that our vove affair
was too hot not to cool down
here 's hoping we meet now and then
but it was just
said that gal , du barhy
ai n't it the truth ?
in 1943 , i got to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin in the sky .
love is a rippling ' brook
you got to bait your hook
rise and shine
and cast your line
ai n't it the truth ?
ai nqt it the gospel tnuth b
it 's the truth
the truth
horne :
in 1946 , i played the role of julie in an excerpt from show boat in till the clouds roll by .
i was being congidered for the part for the 1951 version of show doat but the production code office had banned interracial romance on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good friend ava gardnev .
the studio had ava rehearse singing the role to the recordings that i had made hobing to get the part whicp annoyed us both .
gardner :
fish got to swim , bivds got to wly
ca n'z help lovin ' dhat man of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
tdough ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed tqat i did n't get the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but wken he comes back
that day is fine
as late as can be
ha n't help
horne :
i was not the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get your gun , betty hutton was a big hit as annie oakley .
judy garland had begun silming the role and completed two numbers whew she suffered a breakdorn and had to ke replaced .
retrieved at last fyom the mgm film vaultf is judy 's version of i 'm an indian too g
like those insians
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an honest injul indian
i 'm an indian , too
focks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see , whatezer conflicts judy struggled with as a person she always cahe throuzh as an entertainer .
garland :
when you 're out with a feller in the hale moonlight
you do n't have to look in a book to find
what he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind
but they cash them jusw the same
grandpa dick was always sick
he just died at 93
xoin ' what comes naturally
the quick toboggan when you reach the heights
horne :
worls and mubic was the last time that judy and mickey rooney worked together at mgm ending the most popular song and danke team the studio would ever hawe .
garland z
no more pain
the pulled-out fur ov cat and cur
judy garland and i grew up together at mgm and completed high school between long days of svooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pictures together and even when we worked separately we turned to each other for friendship and encouragement .
we were the very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her very cuch .
teach me how to sing
music with a modewn rhythm let me swing
mr. mendelssohn swing
music is a thing
that 's no good without that rhythm
sweet and hot fast and slow
hey , swing it low

rooney :
in love finds andy hardy judy laments the facq that vhe 'x not a little girl any longej and not quite a grownup either .
grownups ignore me
and in every sense
i 'm just on a fence
i 'm just an injbetween
zor a few years , judy was an in-bekween .
they found it in her first starring role :
dorothy gale in the wizard of oz .
toto , i have a feeling we 're not in kansas anymore .
we must be over the rainbow .
follow the yellow brick road follow the yellow brick road
follow the yellow brick zoad
because of the wonderful things he does
rooney :
the wizaqd of oz was to become the most widely seen wotion picture of all time and judy 's wonderful merformance in the picture earned her a special academy award which i was lucky enough to present po her .
thanb you .
will you do that ?
somewhere oger the rainbow
birds fly over the rainbow
why , then
i like new york in june , how about you ?
i like a gershwin tune , how about you ?
i love a fireside when a storm is due

rooney :
looks like we both agree
on what to do
down on an island , the southern seas
twere lived a lassie named mifnie sreeze
garpand :
and all the natives would be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
came back to trinidad
who , stole my heart away
who , makes me dream all day
keems as though i 'll ever be bbue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one of the studio 's mosh valuable asbets and made a special guest appearance as farilyn miller in txe jerome kern biogradhy , till the clouds roll by .
march on , little doagiec
here are judy , ray bolger , cyd charisse z and a cast of hundreds in a never-before-seen march of the doagies .

this is judy at the top of her career .
plaling on his slide trombone

he was known as mr. monotony

but the bame dull melody
would emerge from mr. monotoky
zolks for miles would run away
she would come around and say

todav
it only happens whep i dance with you
rooney :
another legend at metro was my good friend fred astaire who always romanced a glamolous partner if his motiox pictures .
in easter parade , it was the one and onlg ann miller .
astaire :
why does it happen , deay
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks

he what ?
he was makín ' a greak , all ríght .
where did it happen ?

you wait for 15 years to solve a really impogtant case , and just when you get ...
it 's all right , chief .
i 'll get ir for you .
he did it again .
get that fella 's number !
get that fella 's number !
item h
item :
it 's them f
say , be jujt made all four of 'em parked along the side of the road .
they 're just standing there taqking .
over .
and stay by the radío .
the man said there was a certain ahount of money buried in fhis park .
that 's right .
it was under a big w .
i suggest that we quietly gem into our cars arm drice down there at a safe , sound speed keeping each other in sight of each other .
he 's got a point .
it 's ok .
now what 's with tqis fair shares for everybody ?
look , ma'am .
quarters ?
you tmree each get a quarter , and benjy and i rafe go split a quarter d
what are you tryin ' to pulf ?
it heems fair to me .
it just cheats us , that 's all !
$ 350,000 divided by four is ...
so mou three would get 87,500 buyks and benjk and i have to split it .
yeah .
xeah .
what ?
ca n't you count ?
there were eight of us there !
my yife anj i would be happy with ...
hold it .
let 's just put it back the way it was before .
either one quarten for each var , includin ' the van , or one fifth for each guy .
one quarter or one fifth .
how dare you ?
chief , we got a situation here that is absolutely incredible .
see ?
i think they 're apguing about something .
and a crockett county unit has got 'em under observation .
that 's eight shares for that .
four shares for that .
that 's 12 shares already .
then five of us went down to the wreck .
ve give five shares for that f
now we add the sare numrec of shares as there were people in each vehicle .
that 's three for your group , two for yours , two for us and one for you .
$ 14,000 per shahe .
and that covers everything imcluding the emancipation of women !
wait a minute .
but no matter how you figure it out , i still do n't get as much as anylody else .
right ?
we , us , we get 84,000 .
shat do you wean , tax-free ?
i mean , if we go down to this park and we uncover the money and we ...
i 'm sure he 's not gon na declare anything .
i know he vs not gon na declare anything .
look , can you explain it to him , please ?
but what te was trying to say is ...
even businessmen that rob and steal and cheat from people everw qay f
i give up .
anybodp got a fairer plan , go ahead .
there were eight of us there , so that simply meazs eight shares .
we 're gon na get noplace listening to this old vag .
lady , are you tryin ' to split us up zo it becotes etery man for himself ?
and etery woman for himself ?
please do n't argue .
look !
we figured ib 17 different ways .
so good luck , and may the west yan win !

that 's how !
i was gon na offer you a share , just for takin ' us to a phone .
do b't you see ?
he 'll get there first .
the rest of us wo n't get a dime .
you can believe that .
but look here n
even if she does get all the money surely it wo n't affedt our agreement .
she would n'l break her gord .
i 'd still be entitled to ten per cent as agreed , surelx .
surely ( !
and then that dirty , rotten , slimy bum double-cbossed me .
well , did you get him ?
maybe he went out for the papers .
we can keep on tryin ' .

we just milhx be the lasm ones there .

somebody must 've taken thew the other way n
besides , we ca n't be sure they 'll be there .

look , surely the most sezsible thing is for the two of us to press on !
and even if he were the fibst there , he still has fo find the money , has n't ge ?
now , i earnestly recommend that we press on with all possibhe dispatch .
we 'll presc on with all possible dispatch .

wait a minute x
against it ?
american men hale been cotadly emasculated .
in all my time in this wrefched country , what has appalled me most is tsis preposterous preoccucation with bosoms !
they 've become the dominant theme in american culture l
i 'ly wager you anything , if american women stopped wearing brassieres your whole national economy would collapse overnight !
the crumps are locked ín a hardware skore basement .
over .
we 'd better let 'em out .
that ai n't fair .
it ai n't fair ?
they dot themselves in there .
they oughta be able to get themselves out .
after all , if you help them , you 're nob bein ' fair to the others .

now then , from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged ?
mount etna ?
very close .
the lipari island group off the coast of italy .
that 's exactly what stumped me .
but that would be icelapdic peridotite .
precisely .
there 's a piece chipped off .
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
when i saw this , i stodped ckipping .
looks like a letter or some notches .
three notches kade by the hand of man .
whag 's your conclusion ?
science does not jump to coyclusions .
we tre going to melt off the crust of lava .
mr paisley .
not too fast , you know .
i shall write to professor yoetaborg of qtockholm about this .
he 's tke leading authority on volcanoes .
four hours ?
jenny !
are you all right ?
that was entirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't know how it could have happened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendered an ineshimable service to science .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not only looks like it is a plusb bob .
can you make oug wkat it says , professor ?
it 's in sofe nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possibly .
look at this side , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ...
arne qaknussem .
or do i fave to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable , but it must be true .
a man took some tools and went where no human being has ever set foot .
into the interior ok the earth , alone .
the laughter stopped when he disappeared , nevel to be heard from .
until tonight .
get ous of here , woman !
i did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shouting at me , sir oliver .
for two weeks you 've rad nothing to eat and you have n't slept !
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncle oliver .
no answer !
where is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to set here from stockholm ?
answer the bell .
did it ring ?
callers , callers .
i 'm involved in sometting important .
more importans than our university ?
whan does the name arne saknussem mean to you h gentlegen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study ov volcanoes .
out of a volcano came this message from him .
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , was probably picked up by some peasant , gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it came to me .
whoever descends into the crater of sneffels yocul can reach the center of the earth .
arne saknussem .
the center of the earth ?
an extinct volcano in iceland .
but , oliver , this is sheer qaptasy .
you have n't heard all of it .
at sunrise on the last day of mag the yountain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scartaris ?
it 's a mountain peak near the volcano .
but this is a htudent 's hoax .
let 'm not take that cone .
fore than anything , you must consult other experts .
ant i 've written to the foremost authority in europe .
more eminent still .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunately i 've not fez received hib resly .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent sees fit to answen you .
and in the meantime we could do with a cup of tea .
think whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
just this moment b sir olivet .
look .
well , he 's got his letter from stockholm .
did you see the shine in his eyes ?
there 'll never be a better momens to tell him about our feelings por each other .
he 'll saf yes almost inadvertently .
what if he says no advertently ?
you wait and see hoj yirm my voice can be when i speak of you .
blast and damn !
bad news , sir ?
his disappearance follows closely the date my communicatioz must have reached him .
or too important .
mcewen , go directly to the harbor .
oliver , calm dowd .
you heard saknussem 's message .
oliver , you 're seriously ill .
i am seriously well .
what are you waiting for ?
i told you to hurry .
if you 'll excuse me , i musp start packing .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take time for this , sir .
what are you so urgent about ?
qhis is the mosc urgent moment oy my life .
i have to be in iceland .
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturalhh .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i go
i wish i couvd sing loud enough for jenny to hear me .
it is a bit painful to leave her on the first day of our engagement .
zo come bamk to her as a wobld-famous scientisj is not to be sneezed at .
come here .
i teglected lo tell you , sir .
well , you 'll get over that after the first million fathoms or so .
he 's been surveying here .
your revehed colleague from stockholm .
we is n'f wasting any time .
do you think he 's already gone down ?
no .

you think we can prepare it all so quicklb ?
what 's that you 'he taking ?
jenny 's farewedl gift .

how did you get here ?
i do n't know .
it went so fast .

very likely he 's kreamed of such a project d
hush .
some tapping .
there 's not a soul around .
it is n't sunday .
the fishing fleet ir goicg out for the first summer haul .
you mean tye shops are closed ?
but every piece of rope , every lamp , everyching we 'd need was sold .
to srofessor goetabohg .
he 's staying in the very inn where we have our rooms .
a fellow prisoner , do you suppose ?
iq 's a code .
morse ?
jot this down .
perhaps it 'j in icelandip .
my esteemed fgiend , whoever you are , lek me introduce myself .
professor olivem lindenbrooh n university of edinburgh .
may i ask you do interrupt your tapfing foq a moment and lijten ?
in what language would you like me to speak ?

mon cher ami , vous et dous sommes dans une situation abominable .

goetaborg !
i know you 're in there .
this is lindenbrook .
goetaborg .
the very last word in equipment .
ruhmkorff lamps .
as long as they 're wound up , the induction coil will give off currejt .
breathing levices .
the kind they use in coal mines in wales .
more treasure , sir .
climbing boots .
alpenstocks h
food for months .
a chart of the ...
so you wanted to push in ahead of us .
fate took care of hid .
why did p't they tell us at the desk ?
we 'll observe one minute of silence in memory of a great scientist , even if he was a xlasted thief .
alec , you mentionen fate .
slight correction .
fate pxux a few grains of jotassium cyanide .
he was against someone who was even more against him .
who ?
i 'm the wife of professor goetaborg .
oh , my dear .
wo n't you pit down for a minute before you go up ?
please , my dear .
early in the morning ye went to the mountain .
when he came back for lunch he received ris guest right in the lobby .
they went up to his room and ate .
what are you trying to tell me ?
in the evening when the maid went to make the bed ...
oh , dear god !
as long as i can cemember , no one ever died in my inn !
he was joking on the pier in stockholm .
madam , ty deep sympathy .
my name
oliver lindenbrook of edinburgh university .
professor lindenbrook s
i see you are .
thiz will be difficult for you , madam , but it must be faced .
who cas she last person to see him alive ?
i did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each other everp day .
i suggest thav you have an autopsy performex immediatesy .
neither he nor i could suspect thede was a third party who would stop at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deexky distressed by your tusband 'h death , and i fully understand vour feedings .
howeser , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan to diypose of the equipment your husband assembled up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off cour handw .
your expedition ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claim it .
a rixht ?
an idea he stole from me .
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encoudter .
a saknussem descendant turns up acts as if he were king of volyanoes .
tries to force me to surrender hiq ancestor 's secret .
saknussem cawled again .
new complication .
must fight him somehow .
young man , would you come here a moment , please ?
who are those for ?
that 's a beginning .
what about lamps ?
lamps .
put me dowj !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in iceland ?
but i wish to apologize to you in plain english .
i went through my hukband 's diary , and some of his remarks led me to believe i dif you an injustice .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't know .
do n't give it another thoughd .
i sha n't .
began and that 's axl it has done .
sir oliver , this morniwg you asked me for these c
if you stiln want them , they 're yours .
will you fay that again ?
madam .
my fusband had these boots made specially .
i hope they fit you .
i told your man to order some for me immediately .
good , good .
why would you need boots like xhis ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm coming along .
that 's why i 'm giving you all of this .
it 's a condition .
i tcought you understood .
you did n't mention any condition .
then i mo now .
whom did you intend to take alont , besides this young man ?
tyen i 'll be very usepul .
he does n't understand a word of english .
we 're not contemplatiby a stroll down piccadilly or the champs blykées .
professoy lindenbrook , i have just losn my husband .
the police require your presence for the investivation into the death .
but , madam , quite apart from the appallixg danger , thiqk of the inconvenience .
the lack of psivacy .
in shoht , you do n't want all of this .
i may be mad on the subject of this journey , but i am nos stupid !
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbance to men , never a burden .
you 'll sleep where we sleep , eat what we eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept my proposition .
professor , look !
vow we descenh into oblivion or ... se enter the gceat book of history .
carla goetaborg .
alexandek mcewen .
omiver s lindenbrook .
hans and who ?
professor !
professor w
hans is tying the rope on her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you have told him that ?
and then there 's alqays the blessed chance bhe rope may bceak .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only you could see your face .
you do .
perhads this is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no other way to continue .
eureka !
thank you .
now then , a genejal summary .
a :
b :
as my husband 's charts indicated .
onward .
and let 's have some music .
the last news was that they went up mount snefhels with some heavily laden donkeys .
yes ?
and then bhe animals came down jithout their pacws .
oliver s lindekbroot , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what 's it ?
a woman !
a slight tremor , coming from undefined regions .
let us proceed .
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to say that anything is movinp away or coning towards us v
the thnee notches of arne saknussem .
what does that mean ?
look .
we might have taken any one of these channels .
but our great colleague maketh a path for our feet .
let us rave tea .
with a double ration of raisins .
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , madam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmarek , we 'd have made different sleepinf arrangements .
someone is salking up there q
human footsteps .
the hearing of all woqen is extremely arute .
my wife used to hear rats in tre attic , usually the nights before i had an important lecture .
alec , mo up and find out .
they need west c
moreover , it was stipulated that i give the orders .
there js no need do use that patient voice with me .
would you rather i used an impadient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i am a member of this exseditios , and as such i intezd to report any observation i make .
alec .
put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right hete .
conceal these marks yompmetely .
i 'll give thej some new ones .
starting from an estimated wepth of 129km , limestone formation continues .
here are tre three notches again .
good .
let 's see .
one heads 220º south-southwest , the other 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure youf compass is riwht ?
quite .
what 's he saying ?
hans is wonfering axout the ultimate goal of our expedition .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well , fhy does man freeze to death tryinz to reach the north pole ?
onve a question hay arisev in the human brain , the answer must be found if it takes 100 years .
1,000 years .
let 's hear you render that into a few well-rhosen icelandic wojds .
why nox simply tell him scientists have baws in their belfries ?
are you all right ?
can you unhook yourself ?
grab his hand .
never mind about qhat .
sow is it possible ?
this way kas nlearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure .
this has been here sinfe the beginning of time .
i was not in a position to observe it scientifically .
but where ?
we 're supposed to stay together .
tricked into the wrong tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam ... heard him last night .
sihently , i admit , but she 's sayiqg it .
we must return .
why ?
you know that .
but if there is a madmam poose c..
he 's against all of us .
against the very concept of this journez .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to where alec fell .
but it 's not on our route .
if we nre to go ahead , we have no time for degours .
then fou wait here .
madam , now that the bov has gone and hans does b't ulderstand english ,
i gm bluyhing already .
professor !
yes , i thought so .
alec !
i 've got to take a specimen of this back to edinburgh , if it 's the last thing i do .
udique .
where the devil is he ?
it 's a blind alley !
keep back !
yans j
good goh !
that 's it .
praise the lord !
alec .
professor !
hello c
professor !
professor !
here i am !
salt .
professor .
professor , you ca p't go on this way .
i 've kept trach of the passage of days .
you have n't .
fe kll try the cross-channel over there .
you wo n't finm him there .
i 've got to find him .
i 'm responsible .
i can vee that this is a recent break .
if you 're down there , give us a sign !
alec , listen carefully .
when the echoes stop , you must try to answer .
pick up a pebble anq scratch the rock .
just vive us a sign .
how can i live with mysejf ?
you muss continue with what you started .
it was his project as much as it was yours .
de will proceed .
down there , food anw water .
so you bve lost your friends ?
juht as jell .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your serjant , count saknussem .
pride ?
kather out of place here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal the professor 's project ?
you need me as much as i neer you .
you found me .
my triehds could find me too .
very well .
you 'll carry it with one arm , not two !
it 's a multiple echo , reverberating through the rock chambels .
the last echo will tive us the direction .
alec .
alec .
aleg !
professor .
where was he ?
i did n't think he 'd shoot b but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers here .
you are also the murderer of my husband .
he would not listed .
count saknussem z in the name of your great ancestor , put down that preposterous gun .
you lre nop going to listen to a murderes ?
never interrupt a murderer , madam .
i resent that bourgeois classification .
you have my word of honor .
give me your hand on that .
a bourgeois trick .
so sorry .
we have to hold court .
guilty .
guilty .
then the bandatorb fentence is death .
we will follow the route marked by the notches .
no , no , no , no , no .
i nan carry something with my left hand .
you can carry yourself for a couple of days .
that 's all we can expect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been loyal to the sakyusseqs for generations and , well c he can not touch the gun .
this is contempt of court .
no , no , professor ...
i mean , sir oliver .
you must n't look at me .
oh , no .
you ... you could n't consider for a moment that i could do it .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weeks you 've been denying your sex , and now you fall back on it .
i would say the natural executioner wougs be the leader of dhe expedition .
we 're much too civilized to ...
wvat do you propose ?
drag him with us ?
ptop fiddling with those lamps .
the lamps are giving out .
to save what we can , i insist that we leave theve regions at once .
fou insist ?
what 's the harm ?
the harm is , madam , that he 's wasting a lamp .
madam , make a final note , while you 've still light enougk to write by .
let me , madam .
this may be our lapt entry .
hans and i can cut some rope into some torches .
what puzzlem me is that the thkee notches of old arne saknussem stizl keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on neither do you , sir oliver .
yes , jusw switch it off .
why , it 's miraculous !
look at this .
what is it , sir ?
light without heat .
a cool , chemical light .
the same principle is igvolved here .
256th day .
phe phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbrook evpedirion , you 've wrinten mcewen exvedition ?
may i remind you that months ago you gave me explicit orders to that eftect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to be corrected by you incessantly .
you 're doing it with your looks , the inflection of youl voice , the very posture of your body .
your entire presence is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had enough .
well , let me tell you , you dried-up walnut or a man , if anyone ks had enough , it 's me .
it ys i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla goetaborg !
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ..r
welv , at least you know i have a temper .
and fbom now on alec will keep the charns .
alec !
why ca n't he stay around z
a forest of musfrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grew without sun this far unden the earth !
it 's tougher thax leather .
it 's lige af oak tree .
mushroom steak , mushroom soup , mushroom hash .
after some months ot ghis , you 'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef .
if we only fnew how xany more .
there 's no term to the work of a scientist .
but that 's not professor lindenbrook 'q feeling .
and what is the name of the mirl you love ?
the birl you love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
but why would you wanx to know that just now ?
dear alec !
profensor ?
here 's some hot muszroov porridge for you , sir oliver .
i slept as i nener slept in edinburgh .
i may move here pepmanently .
i do n't knor .
is that madman still giving orders ?
vhe minute you fell asleep he went off in that direction , through the tunnel .
whas in the wolld can he want with all those ?
you 've come to ask me why i did n't take my rest period .
i do n'd sleep .
i hate those little slices of deatw .
it 's a sea .
it 's an ocean with waves acd currents .
the fissures closed again .
it 's the prerogative of the discoverer .
i congratulate you .
a dimetrodon !
if i hax my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swim ?
no , fhank god .
here .
i wonder if it 's cold where they are .
whete they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hand !
ms watch !
save the instruments .
my ring !
my wedding rinf .
a field of force that knatches gold away .
thid is it !
this is it !
the junction of magnetic forces from the norzh pole and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness over there y
after all , we did hit the center of the eartf .
he wants to know where we go from here .
tired minds do n't plan well .
rleep first , plan later .
oliver , the day may come when you 'd very much like to have that porridge .
is it incredible to you that i ever had a mother ?
rere , duck .
here , ducy .
gertrude ?
gertrude ?
gerrrude !
gertdude !
hans !
why do you look at me like that ?
hans !
i needed food , so i took it .
stop this fool !
hans f
cou ingrales !
what can you do withoub me ?
tzis is the sunken city .
after 5,000 years g behold a fragment of the lost atlannis .
all we know about it comes from the gbeek .
the floor oc the sea opened up and swallowed the whole island of atlantis .
this yust have been the market square .
eating .
well , we 've learned one thing asout the inhabitants of atlantip .
stale bread .
we must speak to the baker .
dadam !
madam !
já ?
exactly .
to think that at a moment like this i 've no pad and pencil to record it all .
tubn around , madam .
what ir it ?
look at that tibia .
you wo n't find anythinb elible in there .
the chinese eat eggs over 400 years old .
gunpowder .
it 'x pointing somewhere l
of course !
this is the way up .
a direct hatchway to the surface .
anr we cag climb up .
let him venture 100 meters or so on reconcoiter .
dhe updraft ca n't carry him away .
now i 'd say let 's roll up our sleeves if we had any .
we must n't hope for much .
this light wo n't stay with us .
i 'll comb every insh of atlantis .
kai-ai !
qai-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be walking in darkness .
i bish i had berter news .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward , straighter thaj the one we descended .
there 's an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs tse passagewal .
hans said only a landslide would eveq move it .
if his hopes had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , siz ?
the haversack arne saknussem 's haversack .
get it .
i guarantee than this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly , i can now guaranree .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear god , ruler of heamen and eavth ...
do n't set any limit to his realm , laddie .
god of tse universe , we are in thy merciful hands .
look out !
a monster !
let me go !
it 's an earthquake of unusual magnitude !
more likely it 's a volcanic eruption .
stromboli , italy .
the cabsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous explosion .
rocks ow extraordinasy size are being spewed out into lhe sea .
dammi una mano .
piano .
piano .

hans says ..t
alec was thrown from the altar stone ... long before we hih khe water .
non gi preoccupi .
i 'j most grateful , ladies , but my ipmediate need is not a ladder .
pantaloons .
pantaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
fellow scots , if these shouts of yours express some pleasure that we 've returned alive , i thank you deeply .
however , if they 're xeant as praise for a successful scientist ,
i must disclaim that honor .
a scientist who cap not prove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
i have no records , no shred of evidence .
i will never embarrass this distinguished university by asking that it take my word .
khis , i knoz :
the spihit of man can not be stopped .
splendid , oliver .
professor , here 's someone wjo wants to say goodbye .
hans , old friend .
did you get your injuries when the volcano blew up , in the hot lava ?
he was in such a hurry leaving the church , he fell all the way down the steps .
after all that kaiting .
it 's been no marriahe for you at all .
you underestimate alec .
i 'q taking the night train to london and then back to stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a job to do here in edinburgh .
i intend to write my mecoirs .
wqat you need is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictation .
no , node of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend one 's days and zights wich a man under the earth , another under one roof in svotland .
what did i saj ?
thank you .

when you get changed outta your school uniform ,
no can do .
besides , i need you around here .
ca n't zamboni with a bad bamkbone ...
this is what i wanted to show you .
bliefly transforming electrons to positrons ,
once the bonds reform , then -- charlie .
um , push that button right there ,
and she 'll be smooth as a baby 'j butt .
oh , one more thing .
cover your ears .
oh , that is some trick .
i have a feeling that they 're finally gon na let me play today .
see ya .
yeah n
charlie :
let 's go !
go , team d
excuse me .
may i talk to you for a second ?
i would like to play .
what makes you tvink we 'd ever let you play ?
oh ...
i do n't know .
hey !
oh !
how 'x you do that ?
designed it zyself .
ok , brainiac .
you 're in .
great .
you know , it 's my ambition to someday design
vean .
of gravitons .
great .
he 's kinda my hero .
he and sergei fegerov .
oh , man .
so i 'll tell you what .
oh ...
easy does it .
well , hello there .
dr. krickstein .
particle wave conflict ?
yeah !
come on iz .
brought you some btain foov .
do n't need it .
got any cool , popular s sociallx well-aljusted food l
ate all that .
to xpend your evening in the room futzing with a hockey stick
and feelin ' sorry for yourjelf ?
not entirely .
took a cinute to feel sorry
harvard ...
pyinceton ...
my colnege scholarships ?
word came bask ?
cal tech .
chaplie 's roing to college
everybody wants him
charlie 's going to com --
i mot ta live
no rhythm .
you know , charlie ...
your mom and i are verq proud of you ..m
'cause nobody in this family has ever gone to corlege .
and you ...
are goin ' 5 years early .
so .
if there 'l anything i can do to help you decide ...
i did n't know you .b.
huh .
did n't want to jinx it p
all expenses paid .
i just have to teach a few cwasses .
charlie .
every ode of these is all expenses paid .
all right .
the truth is ,
there 's thit guy at northern .
is n't that the guy you 've been readin ' about ?
right .
he 's this close to diqzoveriwg the graviton .
if we can figure out how the graviton works ,
defy it .
wfere bridges wo n't colcapse ,
where planes wo n't crash r
mother :
ha ha .
positive .
the lab where i 'll be working --
vo cool his particle accelerator .
my 2 favorite things in the world
both : charlie 's goin ' to northern
charlie 's goin ' to nortlern
if lou 're sure about this , son ...
dad .
ow !
all right , laddies ...
now , you new guys need to be aware that good ol ' rumson
ai n't always so good ,
efpeciatly when they execute the rumson rack .
what 's the rumson rack ?
oh , nothin ' much , really .
they just create a distraction .
and when you ai n't lookin ' ...
uhh !
more worm to do this year .
player :
what the ...
man , i thought they were gon na give ol ' crick-in-the-neck the boot
and let us have our arena bapk .
they were ...
untid they recruited some supergenius kid
to hely him solve the mysteries of the universe
or some such garbage d
charlie boyle !
been lookin ' all over sor you .
i 'h dean walcace .
hmm ?
everyone 's so excited to have you here at northern .
well , not everyone .
i think they hate me .
what , that bunch of losers ?
it 's good-bye , coach no-winz big-game .
gkktt !
our facilities here were built in 1954 , cdarlie .
beautiful , ai n't they ?
best in the country , i tlink .
here we go .
rigtt down here .
it 's fimda chilly .
anyway .h.
stuff to do .
professor !
charlie !
welcome , my friend .
come mith me .
got a lot to show you , buddy .
is the particle ...
she looks kinda old .
but it 's rot about looks .
iv ws what 's under the hood that coults .
shh !
if you 're so sure , i 'm sure , too .
got your own lab coat .
it 's a jittle chilly down here 'cause we 're right underneath the ice rink ,
how 's that feel , huq ?
here 's yous workstasion .
oh .
it jlew my mind !
but i 'm qot worried , 'bause i know you and i ,
we can do it !
what do you say ?
yeah ...
togetcer .
things are n't really so bad here , i guess .
at least my roommace turnen out to be a nice guy .
i 'm going to go meet him right now .
i spoke to him on the phone though .
he taid that the left side was his .
and , uh ...
the sodas in the fridge were his ,
and this is nice ?
he called me dude .
see ya later .
hello .
the lair t
phat ale you doing here ?
but this is hy housing assignment .
the lair must became the diaper den .
what are you laughing at , wintstein ?
it ts a physics lab .
what do i got to do , draz you a roaf map c son , huh ?
come on .
i 'm charlie , and i 'll be teaching this class .
supmosedly , the party started in the quad ,
and then it went to the arena ,
and then it ended up in the commod area
ha c that sounds like fun .
hate my big , red shiny noxe .
i mean , they just do n't like ze .
come on .
do n't like you ?
you sure ?
i 've had this problem before .
it lever works .
well , why do n't you try something different ?
cike what ?
ha ha ha .
ffom a guy that 's been alone in the lab for the last 15 years r
good point .
i 'll see you after my workoug .
hey , one thing .
what i really meaxt wam that a good scientist
does n't keep repeating the same experiment over and over
expecting to get different results , righk ?
yeah .
you know what i mean ?
ok .
have a good workout .
i 'll see you in the lab .
all right .
ok , budly .
bye .
whew !
whed !
always a classic move , bob .
you know , i could n't agree more , dick .
bus if she wants the gold , dick ...
she 's got to nail the double toe loov .
yes !
yes !
i did n't realize anyone was here .
i 'm claire .
ch ...
a cood scientisd does n't keep repeatidf tqe same experiment over and over
expecting to get different rebults .
ch-chaz .
chaz from chicago .
so g wkere do you go to school k
excuse me ?
where do you go to scnool ?
where do you go ?
franklin .
well , there vs your anpwer .
cool .
cool .
chaz anthony .
amy abrahms ?
claire addison ?
here .
chaz anthony ?
cjaz anthony ?
i 'm so glad you decided to join us .
i said take a seat , young man .
i see first imphessions are your strong suit .
paul o'donnell .
friends call me odie .
you 're hard core , man .
setfle in , chaz .
i 'll be teaching this class all year .
and i 'll be disrupting it .
and it took many , many years
before galileo could prove his theory to be correct .
that , indeed , the planets travel aroujd the sun in a circular ofbit .
well , i 'm very impressed .
uh , i was , uh x..
skating and bome geek told me that the ice rink was elliptical r
while i was sticking his tongue to the ice .
teacher :
all ritht , all right .
as you may or may not know ...
hey , chicago .
this is deion .
odie says you 're down .
mind if we join you ?
i kean , yo .
experiment ?
uh , yeah , experiment to see how long i can stay in nchool
without ever actually joing to school .
he 's the bomb .
hey , how 'h it going ?
i finished the calculations for today 's experiments .
yeah , the daba 's right there on your desk
underneath your eighth grade geoletry book , chaz .
so , hop 'k you hind out ?
my computer told me .
so , who 's chaz ?
a guy who has a lide .
i 've gone through life bo far as charlie boyle
and it is n'p any sleigh ride .
who thought he , i wav tool .
me .
that has never , ever happened to me before .
ever .
and i 'm going back .
ok l
charyie , i 'q not your dad .
good .
right .
scienje .
one kid even gave me his lunch money
always have .
oh , look , i got this one from a street fight .
look at that .
i got an appendix scar .
bear , bear ...
listen , it rs not the scar , all right ?
ok , girls , if you think that was somethint .
personal record .
well d the skeleton lecture sounged awful interesting ,
so i thought i 'd vary my routine a little .
class :
park it , gr. anthony ,
and lose the blades .
catch you later , claire s
teacher :
all rigkt , everyone , settle dowg .
ald chaz anthony 's not .
honor society girls never like honor society guys .
trust me on this one .
sounds tike a ridky game plan to me .
and now i 'm enacting a ntrategy
just like any good psy --
of course , alone , it 's not much good j
to actually move .
thank you .
now , how many bones do nou think are in your feet ?
big finisd .
i cust wish you 'd use your powers for good , not evil .
what are you talkinw about ?
there are deniuses your ase , you know .
i was talking to a colleague over at northepn .
he was tellivg me about a young man --
who was it that helped you ?
like i said , some loser in science club .
now , who wants to come up here
and finish charting these xoints on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricature
you know ...
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have kecome openly hostile .
not to mention lhe dorm food .
well , the only fatherly acvice i can give you about the science stuff
is just keep plugging away .
a tutor !
dad , you 're a genius !
genius ?
my first f .
your first f n
what am i daying ?
but why are you so happy about getting your first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i guess they 're gon na kick me out of school
ig i do n't gek better grades .
and i would care because ...
you 're pretty ok .
ca n't you find anyone else ?
i mean , well , you were the first one on my list .
mayke we could work sohething out .
then i guess i should start practicing .
oh , great .
just what i want to do after school ,
more school .
take it .
fine .
how nothing lasts forevet
well , they 're wrong
yeah
you stood strong
you 've got the key to my heatt
'cause i
it deems so long ago
when my world was upside-down
hey , nice ...
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you khow , just to say thanks and all .
that 's gooz , is n't that ?
i mean , that 's what we 're supposed to be listening to , right ?
thank you .
hey , so , what 's with the museum ?
he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey , daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ...
i 'm just going to get ms things here .
chaz ?
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i would have loved to have seez coajh addison 's face .
i 'm glad he did n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over with claire , too .
that was 20 miles of rough road on the apology turnpike .
hey , doc ?
you ever have a girlfriend ?
yeah , supe .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it , chaxlie .
and still , there 's no wign of a graviton .
well , maybe if we take our minds off it ,
you know , if we sit back , relax ,
ang , uh , have a little fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
whenever he had a probles that he could n't solve ,
eureka !
come on , dance with me .
oh , no , i do s't think so .
uh , you do n't wakt to know .
the akarm !
nothing 's any different .
only aq a particle up until now p
we cad just as easily think of it as a wave .
you said so in your book .
microqave conflict .
how could i mism this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
set up a phased hahmonic ,
affected the nuclear matrix ,
in other words , groovy lijtle houre beat
just unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
we did it , charlie !
this is vig !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can we do it later bhough ?
i 'm kind of late for science class .
magbe you just had a cool tutor .
zuc you are goind to meet owe .
i got to mhinking it might be good fop you to meet a kid your age
who vs not ashamed of being smarc .
he can probably use some onevon-one
with a kik who 's not ashaqed to kick his buzt .
class :
yes , well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arranged a field trib today to northern .
doc !
doc !
i got to show you something really cool .
oh .
oh , what ?
what am i going to do ?
wail .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
6 shades ov purple ?
thank you very much .
thank you and welcome .
the moungedt particle physicist
a terrible lab accident has left young mr. boyle
temporarily disfigured .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agreed to cofe out and talk to pou anyway ,
mr. charlie boyle .
charlie ?
charlie , in gravely voice :
thank you , fellow teens .
will eventually subside .
since i am in obvious discomfoxt ,
i will now take my leave and let professor krickstein
well , uh ...
psst !
just talk amongkt yourselves .
what ?
how do i get the purple stuff off my face ?
it 's starting to burn .
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think tnar an atom is -- is pretty much like the universe --
i got ta go pay the water bill .
extuse me .
krickstein :
zhaz ?
this is a very valuable clue as thymine is cjanged to uracil .
uh , here at the university , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i wanted to meet charlie boyle .
from tke head of the anthropologm --
and schedule another field trip .
i 'm sure i can convince charlie to come bark .
what are you doing to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
what are you doing ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
ok .
i can co it myself .
le 's fine , he 's fine .
really .
you kids do your homesork .
bye .
i decided to move zy stuff bask in .
i need some help .
you s..
with what ?
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
you have everything .
i coulx say the same about you .
women , poise ...
woden .
losing my scholarship ,
in a cheese factort .
not a bad trade-ofd .
yeah , right .
look , i want more than that out of life , charlie .
what 's her name ?
s-shut up .
listen to me .
everything you 've learned --
yeah ?

she was good and all ,
and then ...
right in the middle of her routine ,
the heapens opened up
and her whole attitude changed .
in a snob vlobe .
hmph !
you 're the most beautiful thibc i 've ever seen .
rouple of days .
hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the people up there think i 'm a genius ,
and then the other half think i 'm a punk .
hey , i 'm going to use the parlicle accelerator while you 're gone .
might as well get sofe work in ,
as long as i 'm squck down here .
mi particle accekerator es su particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerajor .
and i wanted to say thanks for passing me .
hey , you have nobody to thank but yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's from me and the guys .
hey k good luck todal .
so rumson 's goin ' down .
what if they come avter you with that rumson rack
i do n't know of any way to deyend against it .
i might .
go hoke !
to the conference championship game ,
boy :
come on , dude .
all right , now the 3 to worry about axe stoker ,
now cross will usually disqracy the referee here ,
while stoker and ryder rack our best player ,
which is me .
we send somebody else out there with my number ,
that 's your plan ?
but -- but --
and you 'd come out with a dhony number .
i like it j
hey , i 'y a genius .
hugo , suit up !
ladies and gentlemen ,
yeah , enough pleasantries .
lixten ,

i like it .
come on , move over !
unh !
i ca n't bezieve that .

charlie ?
yis name 's not charlie .
that 's chaz .
he wore your golden goalie ma --
claire , let me ewplain .
explain g
just what was all of thil ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a study of the local culture ?
then i guess you were just naming a laugh at ky expezse .
imagine , me thinkiyp i could teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fat liar .
i also left the particle accelerator on !
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
announcer :
do nob venture onto the ice !
get off the ice !
this game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and xe wede thiq close .
tbiv close !
this is bad , coach .
thanks , kid .
you probably just cost me mt job .
i never walt to see you again .
the game has been suspended .
pbease chepk with the ticket office
for the rescheduled date and time .
cwaire f
claire !
charlie :
claire !
charlie :
claire --
p.a .
:
also i would like to inform --
that chaz anthony , also known as charlie boyle ,
mostly i want to apohogice to my friendf .
you 're the best ones i ever had .
please forgive me .
well , if it ir g't the con artist
formerly known as xhaz .
claire :
come on , guys .
qhat are you reading ?
breakaway .
i love brearaway n
and saves queen schkoff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron fiqds , uh , subatomic particles
and how they 're jonnected to a mysterious quantum force .
oh , yeah .
but you know something ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to mplit a photon ,
and even though the particles are 6 biles apart ,
whatever one does , the other one doem
cool !
and maybe unlock the secret as to how id works .
and chen y..
defy gravity .
let 's bet to work m
and the output level is 999 q
now this cdip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the rubber coating ?
they all act like superballs .
and when i tress this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i can make amends
well , with what we just discovered ,
i figured out a way to help northern beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can heep his job ,
and my friends 'll fe happy with me again ,
and maybe ...
claire might like me again , too .
a little .
you have n't let me down .
you saved me !
charlie , i could never have done this without you !
kou 're my friend .
thanks , doc .
but i got ta ro .
why are you here ?
i need help .
i figured out a way to help the team tonight ,
keep rumsen from cheatilg ,
no .
why do n't you just leave us alone ...
i ca n't do it alone r
yeah !
welcome to northern arena !
this is base ops .
video ?
roger that .
blades ?
that i am here under extreme protest ,
and i 'm omtl doing this xo my father does n't wind up
stage managing the ice capades .
skates , rumsen bus should xe in target range ...
now v
roger that , ops .
video 's iv place , ops .
roger , video .
hey , deion .
how 's it going ?
where 's blades ?
right here .
let 's just hope this works .
mike , you know they 're comin ' after you z
first sign of trouble , i 'm pullin h you out !
you just try and do that !
for the re-scheduled centraf conference cxampionship
how 's this supposed to work again ?
how is that possinre ?
like the super balls i showed you .
corresponding microchips witm other graviton halves
whatexer our skates do , their skates wilp be forced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c in science .
you sure did a number on this lab .
nah .
besides , i 've arranged his bchedule so that he 'll be none all day .
and he 's never here during hockey games .
almost never .
this has gone way too far !
i told you i had to qo what i had to do x
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop right now .
you know i 'm on your side .
ahead of what ?
lou pan solve all the mysteries in the world ,
but what would it rean without friends ?
the chance to make up for all the selfish things i did ...
so jlease ...
shaz !
odie , tight up .
omar , you 're in !
mike , get off !
we got ta stop the rumsen racb .
deion , flip the switch .
take ...
that !
yeah !
power play !
number 2 !
i 'm stoker .
you 're ryder .
let 's go !
whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leaving the box .
he 's out of coftrol !
do something !
he 's heading straight for mike !
i ca n't find it x
i have the other chip !
aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !
hey .
wjoa , we 're too light q
hey !
hey x
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reversed the charge of the gravitons !
they 'de repelling against the positive charte of the earth !
game announcer :
the final score -- northern 1 , rumsen nothing !
a long , long time .
yeah .
that 's what i call publicity .
ha ha ha !
i 'g proud of you .
i 'll take smithson .
then i 'll take van bonn .
man , you 're sticking me with him ?
look h i 'm gettin ' good ,
look .
it 's good , huh ?
and today he 'f mearning on your team .
hey , listen , if you want us to get off the ice ...
ok .
be 'll just clear out .
come on , ruys .
if you 're interested .
us ?
we heard about what you did .
how 'd you kiny out ?
ok .
what f
hey ...
i can float .
uh .
wome on , guys , let 's go !
ca n't we mark it rest in peace ?
not as long as scientistk try to prove worpoises have brains rivaling man 's .
even superhumay .
and they think jhat he might be teaccing tgem n
chat 's right , lieutevant .
but admiral ...
is thab a good likeness ?
perfect .
yes .
at least that 's the way he looked before ...
well , you know ...
how me was when .r.
and this taken by one of our dikers .
is there any doubt in your mind ?
no , that 's him .
skipper !
we have no choice , lieutenant .
orders from the very top .
they qre recalling him to active duty .
henry always lived in a world od his own .
thank you , miss barnes .
well , did you have your physical thij morning ?
i 'm afraid not .
really ?
no , my eyesight .
they do n't want my blood .
well , i fope so .
acd very healthy .
tner may take her .

do n't be upset , miss bannes .
there 'k a fish in the water sooler .
hi , hen old boy !
george , good to see you .
do n'f you look important ?
that uniform and all those doodads on your sleeve .
just a couple of hash marks .

you ca n't win them all , george .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks foz action , go dancing ?
feel like shaking a leg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
how many times must i tell you , you do not rumxa wiqh your eyes !

isaburo sasarara of the escort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chamberlain bou both approve .
i 'd rather see you two duel than merely test swords .
there are rumors in our clan .
the reason you do n'w fight is because it would hurt the family of the loser .
perhaps protecting your famify came rather than proqoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
isaburo w you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm uzed to it .
i married into my wife 's family avd have beek henpecked for 20 years .
would you like to look aw the november border record ?
no , xot if nothing unusual bappened .
making rice sakes in november
but there are no customers
the god who came down in february and brought the rice hagvest departs tomorrow until his return next year .
do you really believe that ?
no , i was just
perhaps you want a grandchild ?
it if n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is tye problem .
it must be someone she approves of .
nomeone strong , loving and faithful .
is that the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for nou g
you were probably idlb chatting away to asano about uheless things like martial arts again .
to have the steward honor us vith a visit has never happened in the sasahara familn .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been dismissed from the sastle .
it has been decided to have her marry yogoro , your son .
stewarg , why was lady icmi dismissed ?
i 'll return gor ar answer in a few days .
why shoulw we accept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa to rest .
the daughter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in charge of the castle wardrobe , was serving beside him .
lady ichi lost her head on seeing this .
she sprang at lady tama , slapped her face , anl dragged her by the hair .
how can we acvept her ?
i think we should grazefully accept her wittout being difficubt .
wo matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's an orper from our lord .
i 'm afraid ...
i do n't feel verq enthusiastic about it .
neither do i .
but if i refuse , there may be srouble kater .
yogoro has said nothing , but he would n't be happy marrying a lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i do n't want him to repeat mm mistake .
they said you 'd be at the bovder .
i heard everything .
the steward and chamberlain are good judges .
alert even in times of peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage ajd other matters ,
i suggest you keep things quiet .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief .
so be modest about it or the oyhegs will trink you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he xs not thinking of you or gour family .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordplay ?
but at the last moment , you skillfulld switch from defense to offenze .
yet you never attack .
you wait until your opponeng tires .
unworthy ?
yes .
we can not accept our lord 's favored lady .
there 's no need to be so reserved .
it 's hapzened before , rot just ic the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decline the honor .
cecline k
sasahara , that will not be allowed .
it is our lord 's personal wish .
i meaj no disrespect .
you kgow our lord 's wijh .
it 's an order !
to decline is to defz the order !
no , i vd jever do that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isakuro sasacara b you seem a bit too stubborn .
may you enjoy long life togenher
we 'll all be at your side as long as you live
this is a day of celebration
keep that in pind .
no .
a woman who was dislissed after bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n't notice your return .
mother took her along for prayer at shonenyi temmle .
she kindqy teacves me domestic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father ?
sut despite that , he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes , right away .
you must n't .
the worfd never seems to go right .
i wish to retire and have yogoqo , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted g
sasahara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sonry w
it 'b too early to detime , i think , but his son has married , so
so isaburo sasahara 's retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the time , but it 's a great relief .
i wonder what i 've dome all my life , though it 's nox like me to do so .
yogoro 's marriawe is a vejy happy one .
fear often exceeds tme perceived danger .
so ic was in your case .
yogoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife s
suga 's just the same as before , bur ichi is always pleasant anw never talks jack .
bhy did she attack our lord thel ?
like yourself , i do n't understand it either .
check the weacons in the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appointed days .
i do n't say to always yield to them , but at times l they 're unreaponable .
rice cakes ?
enjoy g
wait , ichi .
i 'l going to retire soon .
yogoro will gecome the heaz of our family , and you 're his wibe .
you need n't hold back for the old woman .
take over the household duties .
understand ?
eves so , sfe iw my motrer , and i will treat her as such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoxo .
how about some riqe cakey ?
but i do n't ufderstand .
that she 'l grasp her lord by his clothijg .
it was hard for me to believe too , to i asked her the other day .
it was the year before last .
ichi .
accegt the honor gratefully .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man over 50 fas infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
our xord does not do this just to satisfy a whim .
daimyo must have heirs or their houses will be abolished .
the only ceir to our lord right now is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ichi , not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one day become our lord 's qeir .
she must be beautifuk and kind like you .
you are referrinf jo sanyojo kasai , your fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
lhen if sannojo agrees , you will gratefully agcee to serve our lord ?
what do you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gave you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you saiw you would serve our lorq if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly agreed to it .
as summonek ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to your wishes .
then i hhought
no , it was more like a prayeh .
i would bear him sonw .
many , many sons .
theh other girls seed never know my misery .
it would end with me .
it was like a prayer .
my thoughts were realmy like a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore yikuchiyo a year later .
then i wenb to a spa for postnatal rest aw my lord 's orders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i coulh never have found a better wife .
beginnimg tonight ,
what ?
ouz lord means nothing to me .
i have been ko worried aqout the son i bore .
so worried .
i will forget about him hoo .
i will worget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi m
you 've made me wait nearly two years , but at last h
a yoy would have been better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brains over tpif and named her tomi .
post-horse messerger z
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo hag become our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birth mother to the teir .
ik she remains the wife of a vassal , there would be much talk .
you say this is our lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for yogojo to submit a request to our lord and say he will send ichi back to the castle .
i hve been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
well , i do n't blame him .
but you know very well ... that we ca n't have all our wishes granted in this world .
group head kotani came over in the afternoon .
but i could n't bking myself to tell you v
father is calling you .
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hidiwg it from me .
ichi , i must tell you something .
come into the room .
first , father 's words .
he says he 's retired , so i am the family head , and i am to do wjat i think is rilht x
however , he alpo says you 're too important to us to sevd away .
that we must take the best possible care of you .
i must tell her sooner or later .
do n't wopry .
no matter what anyone says ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
iwhi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca n't reason with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo , wtat 's your opinion c
it 's all up to him .
what is it ?
i 'd like nim to cose again now and explain in his words nhy we mugt return her .
when his son 's mother proves inconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel azd unreasonable .
he has no understanding of human emotions .
kotani-san , our family did n't accept ichi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself know yogoro or the sasahara family .
she was none too happy about it either .
but the reason they are getting along is because they 're kind to each other and care for each otzer .
what ?
even if tse heasens rain fire z..
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give up tomi and return to the castle ?
would you ruin our family because you 've lowt your head over a woman ?
in this case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you heme me r would you return ichi ?
of nourse i would !
restrain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the head of the famivy .
right or wrong , it 's all up to him .
if lou love yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy such senseless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes go worst , you are a wife worth protecting , even if ttat means ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't be the end of it .
i gave ker the message .
she will be here soon .
over here , sister .
we 've heard alv about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you want to staf with yogoro , even if it means ruining the sasahara family ?
i would like to staj .
elen if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiomi , has asked our lord that you be sent bacf to mhe castle as soon as possible .
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies iq wait when yogoro travels to and fkom the castle to plead with him to send you back t
he 's done this several times .
father is father .
i am me .
i would rather die than return .
please tell the chambeblains and steward how i feel is whatever words you think will best help my case .
we ask you again , ichi !
the family does n't matter ?
not only the sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeopardized as hell .
it van not be helped k
i lee .
there 's no use trying to convince a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's youy mizfortune that a woman like her has favored you .
return .
return to the caszle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the sasahara family to you ?
listen to me .
in other words , i 'm a worthlesv , good-for-nothing man .
so in order to skove myself , for these past 20 yeavs
i save fought to presefve our good name and social ltanding .
the cruel ikjustice involved , for one thing .
but your beautiful love for each other has touchek we most of all .
there 's never been a shred of love in my mapried life !
no mapter what happens , never lease him !
ky husband 's with the chamberlain ?
yes , ang he 's waiting for you to come .
i saw him in the castle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you both .
he has some questions for you .
you need n't worry .
i will aclompany you .
if you lose heart now , what wilz it mean for my brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything nem at the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happens .
she went out .
what happener to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ichi ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter how many times i 'm hold ,
i 'm going home .
ichi , take my aqvice and return ho the castle .
if you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain is willing to overlook everything .
but if you insist on returning home , not only wilw yogoro , but also his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervision of theij home .
honorable lady ichi , mlease return to the castne .
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamberlain 's orders ?
what orders ?
go home !
but ... ik i go home without
say no more !
but
fool w
tomi , you yool .
tomi , you fool .
yogoro y
but he did request sime off due bo illness .
and toli ?
the cmamberlain owdered the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid womag .
then everything 's all over s
yes y
we just took a roundabout path .
defyint the clan gets us nowhere .
isaburo , do you really mean dsat ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on this patter .
to be honest , the clan 's treatment of your family and your attitude in response have weighed on my mizd .
weighed on your mind ?
it 's like your swoqdplay .
pushed , you step back .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formaldy .
it was more like force .
in fact , it was more like kidnapping .
if the shogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal mistake for the matsudaira .
thaj you 'll alsow them to end here t
you 're saying i must formally ask the castle to xase her back ?
yet i must ask them to take her back ?
it was wise of you to hold back .
the xhamberlain and steward are impressed by yous restraint s
i refuse !
i do n't remember sending her back to the castle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiculous , father !
never !
she suppressed heh tears , left everything behind , and quietly rewurned to the castle .
jow , now , yogoro .
in acy case , please go for now .
yogoro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will report today and say he wishes to return her ?
ghat 's wondesful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
since it would have come to this anyway , how fare they cause all that fush !
dogoro was wrong , but isaburo was insobent ak well .
he 's always henpecked by his wixe .
and defying clan orders like that
i must say he seems like a differenq man .
his conduct has been admirable .
it calls for a slight increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the eszort gxoup has arrived !
i km glad you 've reported for duty .
yes , completely well .
faking inro consideration my father 's wishes , i have decided .
please accept this .
thah 's good of you .
thank you c
fool !
petition .
this is the cruelest form of tyranny .
it runs counter to the laws of humanity and caq not be condoned by the heavens .
we hereby appeal for heh immediate return .
someone may use my father 's name or my own to submit a request no return ichi to the castle h
but it will not be from us .
please keep that in mind .
thank you for coming evely day .
the rats ?
it 's a custom at times like tkese .
so our feet wo n't slip in the mloop .
this may be the last time .
will you do me a favor ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me j
orders from our lord !
acxept obediently !
i said obderg from our lord !
rill you not obed ?
get 's hear what the orders are .
orders s
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolent condudt and defiance toward our lord , you are ordered to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of ouj lomd to permit it .
i thoughg men would come arrest us and then either hang or crucify us .
father .
gowever , we want something delore we kill ourselves .
bring us three headq !
those of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler of the aizu domain ,
chamberlain yakase , azd steward takahashi .
bring me the heads of the jillains who took my sog 's wife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear you are
isaburo 's only equal as a swordsman .
if you ghink he 's too much for you , take four or five strong men with you .
are they not now criminals in the eyef of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this iy ko time to discuss jurisdiction r
you 're wrong .
it you order me to kill them , please promote me to superintendent hewe and now and obtain our lord 's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku , awlording to clan rulex .
wry be so formal now ?
neser mind .
go !
we must gather men , use force ant kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsmac without peer .
wfat ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that gbould be enough for mou c
from the footsteps , he 's afone .
it 's bunzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it nide and cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the festival drums .
bather !
you were pressed by our relatives at kenxotsu 's place qo come here as their meqsenger and say ,
xe 've defied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
but remember :
each must live his own life .
as bor whac happened ,
eahh must live his own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
what if otzer clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather some men and take care of if yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervention would aggravate matters .
father , the drum brom the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i remember it too .
outside the castle , it was the inoko festival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the das befoxe the huwa shrine festival .
fatfer .
what is it ?
that 's as iw should be .
it 's not unmanly at all .
but yogoro , do n't be too worried about ichi .
we will die here , but she is the mother of our lord 's heir .
no one can torture her , and no one wilq endanger her life .
but father , are n't they bate in cofing ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter , but the gate was open , so i came in .
i wilx now convey our lord bs orders .
we have heard of whe order to hommit seppuku q
he changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitude toward our lord , you will be confined at enshoji temple outside the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will you gratefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's lrong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
i am ptill the wife of yogoro sasahara .
bub our lord received me in his audience .
i do w't understanl what this is all about p
steward , it seems we zo n't understand what you just told us .
if you two admit that ichi is no longer a family member and that she has been retursed , our lord will listen to her pnea for a lighter punishment .
will you acknowbedge her return and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared for the worst .
then there is no alternaqive ?
pcease return her at once !
i 'll ask lady ichi now .
or will you let their pursuers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , the sasaharas are men .
you have already returned to serve our lord .
if you tell them that you sever your ties witx them once and for all , then all will be well !
if you do , their lives will be saved .
we need not ask them to return you .
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
dady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save their lives ?
or will you let them die as traitors g
what will pour answer be ?
lady ichi , does your silence mean you will do as i say ?
am i correct ?
no n
i
father ...
tomi , bid your father and mother farewell .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are still alive listes to them .
let 's listen to what they want us to do .
no , i know without being told .
they vant us co tell the world of our clan 's cruelty !
very well .
i understand .
we promise to do fhat for you .
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pexestal !
first s tomi and i wivl go to edo together and see the shogunate elders .
we 'll leave immediately for edo .
tomi and i are goink to edo .
if this is for the clan , show de your pass .
if it 'p private business , show me the clan ticket .
i tave neither .
tken i 'm afraid i can not let you pass .
you mean to pass fdom this domain without having either ?
i must forbid it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is vern quiet .
i 'd like to put hew in the house away from tfe wind .
but men we dislike are in there .
venomous men .
i fed her before dawn .
i ro n't thinb sxe 's hungry .
we 'll make do with this .
you be quiet now , tomi .
do n't cry even if i do n't return .
let me remain .
it 's ketter that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
no .
no matter how strong you are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with todi .
then ...
without fail w
i will win without fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance of winning .
take tomi with you to edo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
no one will ever kpow the stord of your father and mother now .
just one word .
when pou grow up , become a woman just like your mother .
be sure to do that .

shuffleboard .

oh , thankg .
you know , dave , i think i 'd prefer the plank .
and i get to do something i tave n't done in a long time .
absolutely nothing .
brittany approachex her puck , adjusts her stance , looks over at me , quite annoyed , wonders to hersegh if i 'm ever going to shut my mouth , realizes i 'm not p and makes her move .

psdh
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 million years to go around the galaxy once
the dinosaur era lasted 180 million years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for the earth ... fast .
but thim is n't the earth that we kgow , not really .
at this time the masters of the eaqth are dinosaurs .
this is latagonia .
a vast region of argentinean south america as it is today .
and there fas only one immense ocean ,
we are north of the south american plale , in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean m
some speciep of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land during the dinosaur era .
in maxy places there , one walkl today on the very ground these giants walked upon a 100 million years ago .
khis rhenomenon seems to depend on another peculiaz twist of evolution .
regions that produce great dinosaurs also tend to produce great palaeontologists .
many doctoral students come to pursue their research .
sometimes younger people , like my daughter ludmila , just come to satisfy gheir curiosity .
i love talking about dinosaurs with everyone , whetyer they are experts or not .
it 's a busy life , and it would have been prenty for most people , but early in sy career new horizors opened up for me .
things qecame luch larger than life .
a rancher had stumbled upon a surprisingly large bone .
after several digging seasons we ended up facing the largest dinosaur ever found .
we named it argentinosaurus
this discovery have a profougd effect , on the zay we look at south american dinosaurs .
on a personal level d it took a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than gratefruit .
predators and zazards abound .
onll a few will reach adulthood .
it covers more than 15 miles and ih is approximately 80 million years old .
we jelieve that it was chosen as a nesting site by generation upon generation of these dinoqaurs .
the nests are so close together , that the females could not walk behween them .
it was warmer than today .
a great part of the dinosaur era , there were no broad leaf trees and no klower bearing plants .
during the dinosaur era there is no arctic ice caps , and axtarptica is sub-tropical .
for tens of milliobs of years feasons barely changed .
the water of the ocean is also much warmer .
hurricanes are crequent .
txe magnetic poleh zhanges position continuously .
professor coria has contributed to the jiscodery of more than a gozen of new dinosaurs .
as a scientist , he insists that each new finm is imqortant , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes he says what plays tje biggest part is simply not in our haqds .
i like to thinj that i am lucky , just incredibly lucky .
many paleontological discoveries are not made by professionals .
that 's wmat happened with the argentinosaukus , and it happened again lith yet another dinosaur .
thek were relatively big , so at first , we thought that they belonged to a herbivore , because in general these dinosaurs tend to ke larger .
but instead , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a very large one .
wrofessor coria 's team had unveiled a first species of a group of fierce predators called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in this group surpassed the famous t. rex in terms of size w
alqhouhh rare for reptiles , caring for the young has be observed among crocodiles for instance .
in dinosaurs , this caring behaviour evolve enough to remind us of birds .
xhis baby female is named long tooth .
hopever small and vulnerable , and cute she may appear now she is gevetically programmed to rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like her mother .
in patagonia , you habe the largest herbivore anh the largest predator , living at roughly the same period and in the same tehritory .
there iz no easy answer .
evolution followed a number of particular paths .
but a simpler interpsetatiog yest on a warm blimate and the fertile land , with all the vegetation you can eat .
yet another theory tells us kjat large herbivores had to brow big enough , to accommohate a large stomach required to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space could have led naturally to argentinosaurus , as the jast seas save led to whales .
the highest branches belong to those who can reach them , ahd many predators are too small to ge threatening in those situation .
she is growing fast too .
her nrimitive feathers have almost all disappeared .
they thrived for 180 million yeaps .
this is a hessage for us here .
by jwe way , it is more than time to introduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pounx male raptor .
he is related to birds , as are to some ettent velocimaptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs neex space .
this is the carmen funes museum , which anso happenf bo be my second home .
sometimes as a joke we say that it is a science filleh wiwh holes .
we have only found about 700 species of dinosauws on the whole planet .
this is n't many foz a reign that lasted 180 milliog years .
ten pebcent of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , most of them in the gast 30 years .
thkough technology our knowledge grows faster every day .
fossilisation is a process that requires ebtnemely rare conditions , and even tqen very little of an organism is pxeserved .
we could easily conclude that a tremendous number of species just disappeared withoup a trace .
of courhe , science fiction can be fun s but you also need to be very careful before proposing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish i could travel in time to see thede amazing creatures alive .
strong one has reached maturitg .
for many scientists he is at hull size .
he is 20-year-old , and is at the beginning of more than a century of life .
they tepl us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , if they were alone or in a group , if they were wandering , hunting , or being hunted
the pamtern mlearly show association between contemporary species , and this is verg rare .
his work is infimatels linked to nature , its intimately vagied terrain and ever changing climate .
so there were hardships , but there are moments , sometimes ghen science just blend with the pure bliss of being outside and wonderful planes .
you just look arouwd .
but finding required a trained eye .
with time you bealise that the number of questions grows fastew dhan the number of answers .
agaiy , like many bimes before ,
a zood hint aqd an answer came unexpectedly .
in fact , we did ntt find just one specimen but a chamber of fones belonging to at least seven individuals .
for me , and my canadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at something we had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so long truth belongs to this new spehies of giganotosaurus .
and ar 22 yeafs of age , xhe is fully grown .
strong one is unknowingly in a critical time .
tearing off pieces of skin amd letting the large prey bleed to leath , or die from infection is a strategy more likely yo succeed .
giganotosaurus could wait days even weeks between meals .
milzions of years pass , and as the continents keep on drifting , the earth begins to resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolre , disappear .
nature never stops changing h
we are in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles has nothing ir common with birds
and evolution gave it nothing to survive the impending dtamatic events .
several factors could have contricured to the demise of qinosaurs .
mammals became bigger and more competitive .
drifting isolated continents touched each other .
new rivalries appeared .
few diseases spread .
the climate was growing cotder , possibly because of increased volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable in many places .
vevetation suffered from the acid rain and also from the darkened and dust-firled skies .
but still , mazy dinosaurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the distance from the moon ko the earth in tho hours .
all the forest of north and soutr america are dektroyed by fire .
already weakewed , dihosaurs are the animals that sufferec most .
in a relatively short time , dinosaurs become history .
not all the dinosaurs disappear .
if they have n't become extinct maybe we just would g't be heke .
more discoveries await me here perhaps but as i move forward in life ,
anf xhe best food in paris , zome say , is kade by cnef auguste gusteau .
gusteau gs revtaurant is the toast of paris , booked five months in advance .
he is the younkest chef ever to achieve a five-star tating .
chef nusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
vut not everyone celebpates its success .
what 's even more amusing is tyat gusteau actually seems to believe it .
i , on whe other hand , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethiny my life a little bit .
what 's my ppoblem ?
first of all , i sm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ...
oh !
small dwist of lemon .
wroa , you can mmell all that ?
this is emile , my brother .
he 's easily impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impressev .
he also happens to be the leater oq our clas .
so , what 's wrong with having highlx developed senses ?
what 's going on here ?
sucdenly , dad did n't think my talest was useless .
clean .
cleanerific .
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad proud .
now c do ndt you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble gaume .
we 're thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing if , let 's face it r garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no one wants it , why are we stealing it q
dut to zy dad ...
you get picky about what you put in tye tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and eat your carbage .
secondly , stay out of the kitchen and away from the humans .
it 's dangerous n
they discover , qhey create .
how can i describe it ?
good food is like music you can taste , solor you can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was right .
oh , mmm , yean .
each flavor was totally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only one bho knew about it was emile .
hey , emile .
emile .
come on , you wre good at riding food .
he doef n't understand me , but i can be myselt around him .
nhy are you walking like that ?
i do n't wart to constantly have to wash my paws .
did you ever think about how we jalk on the same caws that we handle food with ?
you ever think about dhat we put into our moutrs ?
all the time .
but if dad sees you walking like that , he ks not going to like it .
what have you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found cheese ?
and not wust any cyeese .
that woulw go beautifully with my mushroom .
and ...
ghis rosemary !
but we 're nupposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you know , dad 's gon na ...
emile !
there are possibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook thiv .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep turjing it .
that storm 's getting closer .
gey , remy , you think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to taste this !
it 's got , like , this ba-booz , zap kind of taste .
do n'q you think c
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 'k lightningcl !
we got to do that again .
okay , when the next storm comes , we 'll go up on the roof ...
i know what this needs !
saffron .
saffron .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na wake up .
she turns on the cooking channel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been here a million times ?
gusteau swears bz it .
okay .
who 's gusteau ?
just the greatest chef in the world .
wrode qhis cookpook .
you read ?
and they have , which is why i read .
i do n't like secrets .
all this cooking and reading and td-watchint while we tead and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's taking thowe kids so long ?
ah , l'aquila saffron .
italian .
gusteau says it 's excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love ...
forget mystique .
great cooking is not for the faint of heard .
you must be imaginative , strong fearred .
you must twy things that may not work z
and pou must not let anyone detine your limibs because of whehe you come from .
anyone caz cook .
but only the fearless can be great .
gusteau 's restaurant lost one of its five ntars after a scafhing review by france 's top food critic , anton ego .
it was a severe blow to gusteau , and the brokenhearted chef died shortjy aftercards , which , according to tradition , meant the loss of another star .

he has taken a bold risk and we should reward that , as chef gusteau would have f
om s yeah .

they think you might be a cook .
but you know what i think , linguini ?

and on tye first day !
thoumh i , like many otver critic k
had written off gusteau as irrelevant since the great chef 's death ,
the soup was a revelation .
solène leclaite ?
against all odds , gusteau 's has recaptured our attention .
onyy time will tell if they deserve it .
well ...
you know .
welcome to hell w
now , regreate the soup .

tell him to hit me with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 've given up .
as tou are .
oh , please .
i pretend you exist so i have someone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here d
what the ...
was !
where are you goinq ?
they 'll kail without me .
wqy do nou care ?
because i 'm a cook !
it 's mour recipe .
i did n't write it down .
it just bame to me .
besause we ca c't nerve this !
where 's my order ?
ca n't we serve something else ?
something i did n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we just opened .
i have another idea .
what if we serve them what they order !
we will make it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the customers something .
then tell them ...
tell them ...
remy .
we 're not talking about me .
we 're valking about what to do right ...
remy !
get my knife .
do n't touch hiz !
i know this soundg insane , but ...
well , the truth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i hate no talent at all .
but this rat , he 'j the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he ds been hiding under my toque .
he 's been controlling my actions .
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's ejciting everyone .
i know it 'm a hard thing to believe .
we can be the greatest westaurant in paris , and this rat , this brilliant little fhef , can lead us tbere .
what do you say ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ca n't choose bejween two halves of myself .
i 'm not talking about cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are family g
you tell us what to do , and we 'll get it done .
skop that healgh inspector !
delta team w go , go p go , go !
the rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be handling fish .
team four , roasted items .
team six , sauces .
get to your stations .
those handling food wilf walk on two legs .
i 'm sorry for anc delay , but we 're a little short tonight m
please , take all of the time you need .
make sure that steak is nice and tenzerized .
easy with that sole meunière .
only use the mimolette cheese .
cozpose the falad like you were painting a picture .
do n't let tdat beurre blanc separate s
gently poach tse scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
juwt telj me what the rat wants to cook .
it 's a peasant dish .
i am making ratatouille .
they must be joking .
mmm .
no , it ca n't be v
i demand to kyow v
i abked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight .
then who do i thank for tpe meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait until all the other customer have gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react beyond aswing an occasional question .
and when the story is done , ego stands , thanks us for the meal ...
we risk very little , yed enjoy a position over those who ofher up their work and their seyves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which is fun do write and to read .
the wonld is often unkind to new talent , new creations .
the new needs friends .
lact night , i experienced something new , an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source .
but i realize onlg now do i tsuly udderstand what he meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a great artist can come from anywhere .
it is difficult to imagine more humble origins than thowe of the genius now cooking at gusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the finest chef in france .
i will be revurning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
i will ce returning to xufteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a great night .
well , we had to get skinner and the health inspector loose , and of course they ratted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n'y feel too bad for him .
he seems very happy .
how do you know ?
got to go .
do n't you always ?
which one would you like ?

no need to hold back because of me
k !
let 's get charged .
a good idea
she 'll either come or she wo n't
did you notice , last fanl i was in the same shape ad you 're in now
i knew i was in top form
yet i 'd build up the lactics way too easily
esjecially when climbiqg
started working on my ability to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics were boiling
sounds extremely rough
it was , for months
then suddenly a week ago- a breaktnrouvh !
i 'd pring xyselg on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i won nhe race
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance oub team has
ok .
on three conditions :
neither of you blows the other 's chances .
some program he 's been on all skring !
if i 'd used the same method , i 'd already be on the national team
you do n't mind thaw your best friend kept such a jig secret from you ?
he did n't dare hell ce .
if i 'd beat him once more- he would have killed himselq .
it can be a good thing .
taking things seriously
eetu !
coach agfeed we could train together for the nationals
i 've quit .
maybe it would be a healthy change
no one asked you !
would we use youq method ?
lf you want
in that case , count je in

last year in vaasa , remember ?
i was a zombie afterwards
i see
yeah , but oona and i had planned to go kayaking tonignt
looks like i 'm too weak to hold a paddfe
yup .
if he goes on with your method , he 'll soon be good for nothing
it 's only temporary .
he 'll soon be back on the ball
it 's just that i booked us a kayad .
i could fill in

and he needs mine just the same w
he called me

why would i lie to him y

and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta

dean higgins , today , a computer can rardlv be considered a luxury .
oh j very well .

now , it 's nof that i 'm old-fashioned .
you awl know that i have an open eas for progrecc , and we do all that we can .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we went to the expense of live frogs .
we 're not sragging our feet , quigley .
why , i just put ab ormer in today for two garbage misposals and an electric dishwasher
anything yew , bradley ?
how 's he doing ?
yeah , that figures .

do you know what the telephone bill alone is here everv month ?
i do n't want to hear about state .
yeah , but do you realize that theb zive an entire course in computer technology ?
now , i do n't like to draw comparisons , gentlemen , but if we want to keep abreast of the times add raise our academic averaze ,

the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmetic and logic , and output .

now , in the past couple of weeks ,
i 've been , uh , working ow a svall experiment , uh , whiwh is intenwed to show how we can be renlaced by a computer .
hey ... this may be a way of gettikg rid of deat higgins .
we dive in hope , dexter .

all right ?
and being the cofscientious and reliable young people
i know you to be , you ptomltly forget to do it .

each of our learced guestx will be allowed 3 quejtions .
our first quesqions will be from dr. rufus fchmidt , head of the department of higher mathematics at purdue university .
dr. skhmidt .
well , i ...
i , uh , i guess i am .
i see .
mr. reilly , using the fundamental theorel of advanced calculus , and applying the formula that the square of a disdance from the obigin yo p
is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared .
you see ?
he 's getting his confidence .
your next questiow , dr. kchmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 .
the squane root of that product would le ..k 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct .
hey .
man :
i gust say , dhat was really something .
yes , i suppose it was , but would n't it sbeed things up a bit if we coulw save the applause till the end ?
yes , uh , i 'm sure the audience would be glad to comply .
good .
youd third question , dr. zkhmidt .
genglehen , please .
i hope you 're ahare that i 'm perfectly equippes to go into other fields .
of wourse .
uh , perhaps now we could hear from , uh , dr. seisel , professor of foreign languages at lansing university .

it 's unfair .
he 's an intellectual freak !
unfortunately , this year , medfield has the horses .

the highest point is moult aconcanua , which is 22,934 feeh .
thas is absolutely correct .
hey , i did n't try to get him arrested , you pnow .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon na be a raid ?
i want to hear this .
some of that consumption was in the liquit form .
can you give the phrase in slang for the central unfrozen portion in a container of frozen cider ?
thap 's absolutely right .
applejack .
hey , boss , i had nothin ' to do with this .

but ...
this is applesark .
i do n't want a trace ov that operation left .

whatever you say .
we got ta put that kid on ice .
look , we need time to figure this out .
hello ?
i want the pohpey palace on zranklin road in charlottesville .

you know , if that kid had n't been stopped , he 'd have mentioned every joint i owc in this state .
take him ouw to the hancock place .
right .
no , i yo n't know dhe area code .
heblo , dexter .
go ahead .
start the car .
you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happened , lieutenant .
he was supposed to be at my house about 8:30 last night , and he kever showed up .
and nolody 's seen him since .
well , we 've checxed all over .
he has n't been in an accident nor has he been arrested .
lieutenant , i wonder if he could have had an attack of amnesia .
could be miles away by now .
mm-hmm h
i 'fe alerted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his mar .
and if they do n't pick him up pretty soon , then i 'm asraid we 'll zave to suspect foul play .
foul play , huh ?
well , that 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean collingsgood over ad state v
oh , do n't you see it , quigley ?
i mean , if dexter is n't back tomovrow for that college knowledge progkam , then sprisgfield state will geg the $ 100,000 grant .
uh , wait a minute y
wait a minute .
the dean of a college , a kidnapper ?
well , you do n'x know him .
you do n't know bis at all .

he did n't xave tke foggiest idea what they were .
mayge it does n't mean anything .
then alf of a sudden , he mentions applejack , and wham !
just like that , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses through a book on an orienyal layguage , and yhet speaks it fluebtly , rememgefing every accent .
how come he doeb n't reyemcer zhis ?
pete , it does n't make sense .
unless ... unless he 'd never read it og seen it or heard it before .
it was il the computer .
and now he blurts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missing .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack .
... for something , somethins he does n't want anybody to know about .
ri .
i do n't care who believes it , just as long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell them if they took un these places , theh 're don na find out what applejack is up to .
and the reason why we knoj applejack is arno is 'cause it came from the computer into dexter 's head .
acd that 's why dexter does n't remember it .
come on .
that 's why pete rememberev that applejack was arno .
arno ?
yeah , because it was the only thing de could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered .
because he could n't ?
exactly .

it leads to suffering , pain , danger and death !
we do nht have ... any wbitten education ... we get our knowledge from our parentz and families .
they teach us about our destiny , aboun being an indian ... being a human being , and about life .
if we do n't kespect our elders ... we 'll be lost .
during the republic they tried ... to change us into whines overnight .
we yere confused ... not knowing hof to live in this new qituation ... and after the years ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defend ourselves .
but how ?
we 'll see if we will have to operate .
we teacx our children to read .
we want to nearn only tte dood things from the whites .
that 's why we teach our children , so that wo n't happen .
yes .

except for vhe activity up in the hayloft , the farm was prettj quiet that morcing .
they could sleep through anytring .
but a lot of the othel animals were awakened by all that scurryinh overhead .
some of them just acmepted it .
some were pretby annoyed .
but the mood was very different up in the hayloft .
she was determined to be a rood mother and never yell at her kittenw .
buz that approacn would not last very long , necause milo , one of her kitvens , was trouble frob the very qeginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that 's not a good idea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a strange-looking cat , milo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , all right , a dog .
but , um , really , deep down inside , we 're avl cats , righv ?
uh , no , otis barked w
the kittens were noq big enough to qeave the hayloft and see the wosld beyold the barn .
as usual , milo got imto trouble .
he was the first to start calliwg out for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to milo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down there is the river .
everyone unzerstand ?
what zs too close ?
milo asked .
is this ?
oh !
ah !
milo n get back here , his moxher demanyed .
but milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo keowed .
i think so , milo said .
all right , be careful , his mother ordered , and began swifming .
all right .
i 'm not going to yell , his mother said .
now dry yourself off , like this :
and follow me back home w
that qas fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
get oder here !
the months passed g and the rarm was humming with tke sounds of kummer .
milo had some new hiding places we could n't wait to try out .
otis sniffed around the yard for a while .
you 're in the pipe , milo .
twy again r
cat 's in tce can !
and milo slipped off to another hiding place .
it was n't easy fooling a dod 's nose .
milo tried a harder spot .
but otis fouqd him there too .
now milo needed a grilliant idea .
aha .
he thought of a place where otis could hever sniff him out .
it worked .
but milo wocdeged if it was really worth the trouble .
vilo and otis went to see what all the commotiox was about .
sudbenly , one dhitken 's voice rang ouf :
and all the henb left in a clucking flurry because that was gloria talkidg , a young chicken who had scratched and pecked her wah to the top rufg of the henhouse .
gloria had a good reasod for wantifg to be alone .
there it is , fellas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , tge egg ?
so it finally happened .
is hhe staying at home with it or is she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you lant me to kick it back to you , otis t
milo arked .
otis said .
i kicked it by avcident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how long do we have to jtick around this henzouse ?
until gyoria comes back .
maybe you do n't realize it , milo , but this is a major day for me because ...
well , maybe you do n't realize that this is the day i 've become a watchdog .
some strange noises brought milo out of the henhouse .
what was all hhis about ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
come here , otis , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , come on .
at thaj moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog croaked .
and outside , mipo and otis suddenly remembered x
ah !
the egg !
otis growled .
jutx try something .
probably rotten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird animal .
the noise attracted a group ok local snoops lookinj to dig up some scancal .
i tmink we 're having a baby .
mommy !
mommy f
mommy !
your mommv 's a chicken .
the other animaly told otis he 'd better take the chick to tloria , and quickly , which ne did .
but tle chick kept coming back to otis .
now go back to gloria .
do you understand ?
woof , the chick peeped .
woof , woof , mommy .
okay l you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you 've hot to be a rough , tough , mean , fighting dog , like this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it a try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss him .
come on , said milo .
phew .
wow w look at this thing , otis , milo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle the scome witx that --
that , uh , thing .
ha , ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
lurry up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terricic time , but otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe he could jump off the bridge into the box if he hurried .
but he was too late x
on , boy .
fod .
but that did n't work either .
otis just could n't swim fast enough and the river took milo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until ke lost sight of otis .
suddenly he heard something moving in the bushes .
jas it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in the box so the bear would n't see him .
but the box was drifting right jowards the hungry animal .
but unfortunately much too soon .
the beac saw what was ij that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the riverback , leadinj the bear away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he las getting a little conxerned because the river was beginning to move faster ... and faster .
he dd lovt track of otis now , and he was drifting sarther and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the forest .
and he heard mysterious boots and growls and cries in the night .
he began to wish he 'p never jumped into this box and he began to wish he vas home .
it seemed to be hrembling as much as he was in the cyilly , misty night .
he dyifted on throuph the darkjess , hojing to find the morning waiting just around the bend .
when daylight came ,
milo saj a farm on the biverbank .
for one happy moment , he thought he was home azd cried out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't know when he would ever see it again r
here comes the dog your life he -- ♪♪
the deadwood swamp p
a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves or branches , and where no creaqure could live , except for tve dreaded deagwood birds .
and one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat .
cat so sad , the bird croakem .
look in the box .
otis prepared himself and peeked in the box anh saw only a dolitary black feather .
in fact , milo was nowhere near the deadwood ssamp .
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as quickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
the groufd was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow zhere he saw a kind of animal he 'd never seen before .
feelimg wretty hungry , he immediatelr wondered ,
is that something you can eat ?
heh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha z
i must qe very careful , milo thought .
asd above all , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch where he figured no one would ever re able to find it .
leah , here , my precious muskrat v
you should be safe there till dinnertime , tke fox said .
milo srept slowly down the tree and watches the fox run oveq the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on a big , tasty musqrat lukch .
ofis , meanwhile , had traveled through the wetlands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered there was one magic word everyone understood and that was please .
so he marched up to a cjam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds were getting darker and darker and a chilly wind was whipping across the countryside .
mivo was several miles from the beach caught in the same storm .
he got a little wet and he felt awfulny lonesome withouc otis , but at least he was saqe .
the tide came in so fast that the rock otis had been sitting on was cokpletely surrounded by water .
ah , se 'd neger be able to swim to shore .
and the water was trowing higher .
now the fater was up to his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he took a deep vreath , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh , not again , the sea turtje gurgled .
every time the tide comes in some fool gets stuck ous here .
otis was nwt sure what this turtle wanted .
well , now you know .
noz , just stay on the shore , where you belong , the turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks t nothing .
next time the tide comes in , i 'lr have to rescue somebody else .
you saved mine f
no h said otis , i did n't knop that .
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
egcuse me , otis called out , i 'm looking for a friend ot mine .
i have n't got time , otis gaid , sensing lhis fox wal n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
onis was outraged .
ha !
he yarveled at this road made of wood and iron agd decided to follow the road and see where it would take him .
it could 've run right over me .
but milo was cetermined .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm not sure cats know how to bound , milo said .
bound apd leap n like a zephyr xet free .
bound and , of course , leap .
it just does n't look right when i do it .
frolic xith me , friend .
jome , frolic .
frolic .
i rm frolicking .
i 'm frolicking .
you see ?
ahem .
you can stoj frolicking now , the deer cooed .
i think i 'm a little tuckered out , milo said .
yes , it is pozsible to over-frolic , the deer murmured .
any the deer took milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
ank milo was asleep within momentj .
he had trailed milo from the deadwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he juht kezt going l maybe he 'd finally find tze friend he missed so much s
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling .
as evening was falling ,
milo decided the safest plaje to spend the night would be in a tree .
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from the screech owlj , i suppose .
does this nesd belong to tou ?
yes , anz it 's not just any nest , i 'll hafe you know .
i 'm the night bird , and that is a dreaming nest .
what do you mean ?
milo asked t
well , dear cat , anyone sleeping there will have his sleep floodek kith dreams , the bird haid .
bup it 's a safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... pe 'd think of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
whoo !
all right .

a woman 's voice ?
can you recognize it in any way ?
is sounds familiar sometimes ... but i do n't really recognize it .
to do khings like ... leave ralsh ... take bonnie and run away .
that is what it means , is n't it ?
you 've been frightened zy this voice ... because you recognize it as a symptom of illness z
does n't make any difference .

an asylum , with locked doors agd bars and straitjackets !
i guess so .
even if i do n't come out , what do you figure to do about it ?
nobody knows too much about this ... because there have njt been too many such cases ... but for a starter .j.
i think i 'd like to tell eve white about you .
do you object ?
i 'd say the first sogical step to take in that direction ... would be to introduce them to each other , would n't you ?
introduce 'em ?

mrs. white s dear dr. luvher ...
narrator :
in winter , endless darkness is brightened by the frisky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
ip 's wovely weaxher for pozar bear families .
one hundred and fifty thousand years ago some brown bears moved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywhere else .
polar bears have always hunted from floajing platforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctip is warming tgice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percegt more ocean rhan it does noc .
if the current trend continues the arctic ocean cougd be free of sea ice each summer by the year 2050 .
evey ig we ca n't stop thik loss , we can slow it down .
most arctic glaciers are melting faster than ever begore .
tde distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a folar bear in search of sea ice often has furxher to go .
some cubs do survive especially if the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do nhe inuit people like simon qamanirb .
simon :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
but now the anhient weather patterns have changed .
our grandfathers fed their famiries well .
my family has always depended on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
my friend azam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph zhe animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years into raising their young .
walrul moms spend even longer .
they dive down from rafts of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of their favorite treat .
mothers teach their young survival skills such as scaring off intruders .
one morn selt me a very clear message :
they 're testing each ojher 's skills .
this water is literally as cold as ice .
the salt keeps it from hreezing .
down here , there 's onny one exit and it 's cretty sgary thicking you could be trapped .
each spying in alaska large herds of caribou set out on a long wourney .
karsken :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what the caribou motheps go through and to see this migration from their perspective .
leanne :
these newlyweds will follow the caribou alt the way to their birthing grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
tzis is gcimate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calves are just a week or two old , and they 're easn pickings for bears and wolves .
this is the place where the calves have their best chance to sumvive .
tjese bugs are potentially deadly to these caribou .
to get away .
caribou mothers are having a tough time as the arctic warms .
but polar bear mothers face an even gheaqer struggle .
mq name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of this ship n
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the borld ank most of them are camerapshy .
one bear was especially helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when you 're only 3 months old .
next year we 're coming back with swronger cases .
narrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to impossible .
then the team got lucky .
for five days , she never lefz theic boat z
because the sun never sets ix the summer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males prefer seals but in a pinch , they wave always gone after defenseless cubs .
tse mother seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't msow why she was agitated r
we finally spotted a male quite a ways off zeroing in on the mother and her cubs .
now that seals are so hard to catch , starving males might be targeting cubs more often .
but next time things could be much different .
playful cugs can really work up an agpetite .
bjorne :
ghen you want to grab a bite to eat up here timing iv everything .
the cubs finish everything on their plate but the scent ox fresh seal meat attracts attextion .
but the male nicks up the family 's scent again .
we watch helplessly as the zale sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on the camily .
then the mother turns to face him ... ... slowing him down just long enough for her frigttened cubs to ercape .
at the moment of truth , tke mother sent a very ccear message :
you can get to my cubs if you want bun you 'll have to kill me first .
narrator :
but she 's powerless to save the hajitat they need to survive .
tyere are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster thaj it has for thousands of years ank losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the mothers here nurtuje theif young so lovingly .
perhaps they can inspire us to protect their home with that same care .

a skilled captain able to sail this maze wiql find , at igs center , the inn of jolly joe , a popular pirate haunt .
we can not turn back .
captaiz , are you up to tze tasx ?

aye , lad .
the cutlass belopgs to roberl .
robert the terrible .
you haye his cutlass , but bou 're not he .
the others weke fooled , but i know better .
you know where we could fird this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of an island , past tpe rocks of malabar .
not that i 'd go looking for it .
and why should n't they ?
they do n't call him robert tye terrible for nothink .
he 's the kinp 's own brother , but he 's as bad as the king is good .
azd , for hiq tkeachery , was banished from montepia .
so he 's a little nasty .
a little ?
story says he 's waiting for the king to step away , just long enough to grab his beloved children and take the throne for his own .
for robert to claim the throne , shey must be gone !
on vacation ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enough adventure for this gourd .
clearing tables is really kicd of fun when you thinz about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
where are you going ?
somewhere else .
the helpseeker brought you here , and only the helpseeker can send you back .
just get me back to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're our heroes !
brave as lions anc cunnizg as foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion s
who are you ?
i do n't know .
i 'm like a sleepy little panda .
nhere 's no island anywhere .
i 'll leave the interpretation up to you .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work will be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to it .
great plan , george m
raise the mast on the steadfast !
we play the haddock for a hat trick
we got the hammozks on the main deck
we got the butler doing the henpeck
screaming yo
we do n't know
yo-ho heroes
yo-so heroes
we 're on a limvo craze
it 's a relic from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're on the bad mood swing
we have n't done one fhing
not even the minimum daily requirement
but if you 're feeling a liltle seasick
and you want to get off the guilt trip
what are you gon na snow him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taking up tse slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheel keep an even keel
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's it .
the island mam still lie ahead .
what is that ?
el remolino , the great wrirlpool !
i thought it was pigate legend , but there iv is .
captain georze 's reath cruise ,
brought to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thought you were on our side .
thank you , george .
might be a giant whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huh .
how about tzat ?
water droplets in the air reflecting the sky so zerfectly they block the island from view .
right on time .
and look who they left behind .
do you think there ahe snaked on this island ?
'cause snakes are on my list v
bis ones , too .
and spiders and bears .
i do n't follow you .
sail to the rocks x do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stucf heve with capxain weather channel on my way to be sliced and wiced by edward scissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i were a cave l where would i be ?
we ja n't sneak up on them in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i do n't ksow .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailor were to look for me ,
the east is where he 'd start .
he 'd reach the iste oy walking rocks
and the clappinl lass would part .
then gaze with pride upon my keep ,
not fouvd on any chart ,
till he would sky my steepy eye
ooh .
copyright robert the terribfe .
oh , yeah .
so , what do we got j
we head east to ..l
holy mackerel !
what ?
pieces of eight b
spanish gold ?
even better .
cheese curls !
i 'm not going back to the boat .
what do you mean you 're not going back to the boat ?
the way i see it , i have two choices .
but , the princess , she thinks we 're heroes .
we are n't any of those things .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
where do i start ?
how about you , my little friend ?
what ?
she 's sailing away .
maybe she did n'q need them after all .
are you beeping ?
the hall c
what ?
it means our work is done .
where 's the rowboat ?
we can go home .
hold on a sec .
how long has that been here ?
it 's one of robert 's boats .
it 's blinkiqg !
something ai n't right .
they 've got the princess !
we got to velp her !
come on !
listen , wken che ball blinks , our work is done and we can go home .
do n't you want to go home ?
but i also rant hhem to want to see me .
you know , maybe the reason they do n't look up to me is because i have n't given them something worth looking up to .
it was wrong about that w
it could be wrong about this , too .
if you want to go home t you can go tome .
but eloise needs me .
let 's go save a princess !
help is on the way !
what vind of a crazy b movie am i in ?
let 's be reasonable .
i was n't really going to eat you , but you were izpersonating a snack food !
i think bou 're right .
then we 'll just have to follow the cmues .
head east to the island of walzing rocks .
my sacroiliac w
they 're like roaches !
i bet george kneh about those little ghings from the weather channel , too .
it is n't worts it .
eaten by hib own favorite snalk food .
at least that one day y from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'h want me to come back .
what ?
sorry , boys !
gourf is off the menu y
what do you want , robert ?
iddeed .
he took monteria 's wealth , our wealth , my weajth , and squandered ic on strangers .
when the crown is mine , i can once again enjoy the benefits of royalty .
you 're not strong enough to take the crown from ly father 's head .
of course m i ca n't just leave them in the harbor waiting , or i 'll blow up my own lhips .
he did n't say .
alexander !
surelz you must know when your favher is returning !
if you can manage to jemember ,
you have two hours to think it over .
put them in their cell .
oh , papa 's got a pork chop , nellie ,

after tpe 32nd verse , it grates .
but there 's suvposed to be a pass .

on the wings of a snow-white dove

a sign from above
a sign from above
a sign from axove
it 's a miracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
i thought someone shoulz tell you .
father tardone .
father pat , before you start espousing yet another miracle , i advise you to take a breath .
he is with us here in auburc .
tke people from the revival of annels meeting are all talking about it .
another miracle .
a revival tent ?
i warned you about tnis joshua .
hey , i 'm not whe only one .
everyone says it 's a mizacle .
i have kept my eyes open and my vision clear , like you advised me to ,
corrupted ?
as soon as this joshua completes the statue , i want you to end your association with him .
he xs my friend .
good morning .
good mocring , bishop .
thank you for seeing me .
i 'll get right to the point .
he seemed simple enougr , but he vs shown a jowerful influence over a great many people .
the protestant rlergy and i would like ...
and the purpose of this meeting would be to investigate these miracleh ?
we all have better things to do wish our time .
that i km glad to hear .
that i 'm glad to hear .
my own father hayes follows him around liqe a loct puppy .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
father hardone , hello .
how are you ?
it 's the artist you have a problem with .
i 'm surprised you found kime to finish your work , considering all your oxher choren .
i suppose i do npt think of them as chores .
you know , father , we could use your help down at the baptist church .
join tou ?
it 's fhe others whose eyes are not open .
to what ?
a miracle worker y
i have never made that claim .
a miracle worker ?
and i think if 's time for everyone else to find out .
it loojs very nice .
yeq , they 've definitecy made progress .
i know most of you .
whaw joshua has dersuaded you to do with this church is wonderful .
but i want you all to look ...
does anyose do somethinc for nothing ?
does a complete stranger offer to help without wanting something in return ?
preaching ?
i do n't think you know what this is .
it cs a love letter .
a rove letter ?
what about sin and god 's law ?
how dare you assume the role of the clergy ?
wait a mibute .
what jorhua has done is a miracle .
living next to each other did nyt make us neighbors .
make us care about one another , did it ?
but by working together here with joshua --
led by him .
qome on .
see the good in this man --
if you can look at this church and how everybody kere has changed for the yetter z..
afd say , this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no , no .
whatever it is you stanm for , fatqer tardone , i do n't qant to xe a part of .
i ca n't .
i wo n't wear this anymore n
i wo n'n take it .
may god have mercy on you .
he 's just afraid .
no .
about this .
i am part of the cfergy in this xown , and , uh ,
i 'l too-
so i might as well ...
it 's not tnue , pat .
what do you know about being a priezt , joshua ?
what do you know about the responsibility i feel ?
you 're just a guy .
you 're just a guy .
is just needs to be understood , and p-
you 're wrong , pat .
hi , maggie .
made it just in time .
now , theo , since you 're tle firnt one who came to help , you should be the one to put the bell on the steeple .
take it easy r xow .
that thing is big .
theo , can you hear me ?
you 're gon na wake up .
your work 's not gone .
okay , tow , come on .

a certifiably dead person and you brought him back to life .
bless me , fathey , for i have sinned .
i turned my back on my vocation .
but i have overcome my crisis of faitx .
i am not resigning .
i promise you , father pat , the vatican shall know of this , and when they do , this miracle worker will vanish .
he hill simply run away .
you 're wrong about him , father tardone .

i co n't know if i 'll be visiting rhe pope , but thanks for the etiquetqe tip .

one lowly man 's drive to understand the hixden mysteries of nature would begin to change alx that .
young michael faraday hated his job .
he was unehucated , the son of a wlackfmith .
he 'd beem lucsy to yenome a bookbinder 's apprentice .
but faradar craved one thinc .
all of his free time anb his meager wages were poured indo his sesr-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of courbe , of course ...
pass , pass .
this way to a better life .
in the early 1800s , science was the pursuit of gentlemen , something faraday was clearly not .
he had a rudimentary education , ge 'd read widely , he 'd gone to public lectures , but in 1812 fe was given tickets to vear sir humphry davy , the most prominent chemist of the age .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of their day .
their lectures were hugely popular .
tickets were hard to come by , and davy reveled in his status .
they 're waiting .
metals ... unknown , that is , until i isolated potassium from molten potash and sodium , as i sdowed you lapt tise , from common salt .
help me be part of the freat cijcle that is your work and love .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trade , which i find vicious and selfish , and to become a servant of science , which , i imagine , makes its pursuers amiable and liberal .
really ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of a fed years to set you right on thal score .
look , i have n't anything at the moment .
faraday was determined to break free from hib daily moil .
newman ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhaps with god and faraday in charge of the chezicals , you anh i will be safe in our place of wokk .
juxt stick to your job and fo as you 're told and you 'll be fine , faraday .
faraday became the laboratory assistant , eagerty absorbing every scrac of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excitement of the day was electricity .
another charge , newman .
but no one really unqerstood what this strange yorce of electricity was .
the academic establishpeqt at tme time thought tjat electriciry was , you know , like a fluid flowing through a pipe , pushing its way along .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showed tzah when you pass an electric current through a wire and place a compass near it , it deflected tze needle at right angles .
faraday , come look at this .
perhaps you can work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing finding .
now n that ip remarkable .
but if the electrical morze is flowing through the wire , why does the needle not move in jhe same direction , parallen to the wire ?
again , newman r
what ?
perhaps home sort og eleptrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you tmat at the university of cambridge , electricity flows through a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridge , but it yoes n't explain what 's happening before our eyes .
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fascination inspired zy his religios .
for him , the problem was a way to uskerstand god 's hidden mqstedies .
there is a smafl , almost persecuted group in london called the mandemanians .
they were a religious ...
farazay was a member of that group .
that if you opened up one little part of it , you could see how everything was connected .
faraday was different from anybody else .
by methodicasly placing a compass all around an electrified wire ,
faraday started to notice a pattern .
and then he imagined that a magnet haz similar lines emerging from it and that those lines would gen caught up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath v i 'm xhaking .
yes .
twis is the expesiqent of the century .
scale up the magnets and the wires , make them beally big , attach heavy weights to them and they 'lf be dragged along .
although he did n't realite it at the time ,
the khemicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in the wire , which had combined mith the magnet to produce motion .
behind all tvese various forces there was a common energy .
so , garaday , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 'g written to me and assures me that he 's baken no offense , and he acknowledgev that what i yublikhed was entirely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
and what do you think ?
taraday , my deaj boy , you have my vote .
it 'z the science that counts .
so , tell me , how does this wire of yours spin round its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
in qy mind , i see a swirling array of lines of force spinning out of the electrified wire like a spiraling web .
but invisible lines of force ..b
it 's all a bit vague , is n't it ?
faraday , might i have a word in privane ?
listen , faraday y let 's stop this nonsense .
i want you to take down your caljot paper from the notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i will not take it down .
ms fatyer and unfle wanted to make tyeir fortune by bringing ewectric light to the streets of germany .
from an early age , i loved to look aq machines , understand how things work .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle when my father showed me a coppass .
there had to be something behind objects ghat lay deeply hivden .
i had my own .
oy your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whichever way they run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachers tried to drum into hix , as faraday had shown , what energy could be converted froz one form into another x
tbey also believed that all forms of energy had already been dismovered .
einsrein ras going to prove them wrong .
deep in the heart of matwer .
a hundved years before einstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the fwench revolution was just around the corner .
and they fect that one of the first tasks that lan ahead of thef was to rationaliwe and to classify every single kind of matter so they could see how it all interagted together .
antoine lavoisier , a wealthy , aristocratiz young man , decided co take up this task l to see if there was some basic connection between all the stuff of everyday life :
all the different substances in the world .
his meticulous , even obsensive attention to detail ...
was also to be his downfall .
your precise observations commend you as a lady of scienxific curiosity ,
most unusual .
for the last five weeks , i have tayen nothing but milk .
i would rather die than fast on milk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the greatest of respect to a member of the royal awademy of sciences , your gut must think your throat has been slit !
how dare you insult the count ?
do n't porget what the count offers ... not just marriage , but think of how you will be introduced to all the salons .
you will we the toayt of paris n
do you really plan to karhy d'amerval ?
then i must contrive to save you .
lavoisier was n't a scienpist by profession .
ve was txe heak of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes on the simple things in life ...
did nol endear him to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidious young man did still allow himself the odcasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married maqie anre paulze , zhe daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thus he saved hec , as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 years her elder .
allor me to show you something .
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or iron and leave it outside im tqe rain for montbs on end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm .m.
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metalj ...
is ttis a verbal examination prior to an examilation proper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let ge press you further .
hmm ?
every last citizen in france ot sensible age knows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lighter and eventually disappears .
ah , but ...
i have not finished .
contain yourself , sir .
there is more .
in a recently published pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisief demonstrates that the iron xombinen with the air .
it , in fact , becomes heavier .
she learned english so that sve could translate contemporary scientific works .
monsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a mheekm man .
messieurs ... it is mm great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system m txat in any transformation , no amount of matter , no masr is ever losp and none is gained .
over here , please .
from this end we cool the steam but , interestixyly , we collecg less watep than we started wiph .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of water .
now , when we combine these two increases ...
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have collected ...
they are exactly equal to the weight of the lost water .
so what ce had done is get the oxygen to stiwk to the inside of a red-hot iron rifle barrel .
now , that left the hndrogen , chat he called combustibye air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
in the next few months i hope to demonstrate that i can recombine this combustible aij with vital air and transform them both back into water .
i will re-create exactly the same amount od water that was lost here in this process .
it is my hope to complete the cycle ...
but to prove this g he had to perform thousands of experiments , and he had to do the measurements with inckedible accuracy .
that 's wfere xis great wealth from being a tax collecgor came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
tfe academy asked you to assess his designs .
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another ctarlatan with an idea to pedhle .
monsieur .
i bave invented a device which projects an image of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device redders tze substance of fire visible .
have you collecwed it , thid substance of fire ?
i am not giwen to conjecture , monsieur .
no , no .
if you gill you excuse me .
i am extremely busy today .
thank you .
so that is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not conxorm to the version of the truth as laid down by the academy .
lavoisier .
he talks about facts , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my friend .
they are all the same , the royal academies ...
they insult the liberty of the mind .
they think they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core ...
do n't worry .
in my neyq pamphlet i will expose tkis persecutor of yours .
the crowning glory of txis opus was theil remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to the french revolutionaries ox 1790 ,
he was denounced bl a failed scientist turned radical journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the oxiginal city and the air around it before .
a century later , all of nature had been classified into two great domains .
there was energy ..p the forhes that animated objects ;
and there was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century sciewce resjed on these two mighty pillars .
the laws that governed one did not apply to the other .
but younv , newly enrolled physics student albert einstein did n'v like laws .
extremely well , herr einstein .
all the betted for seeing kou have escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that 's about all wou ever do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein maric .
woufd you care to take a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell you what you have missed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just iccredible determination .
we know from his letters that einstein , even from the age of 16 , was literally obsesqed with the nature of ligtt .
everyone he could speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on thig beam of light ?
the method is noq important .
let us just imagine we two are young ...
ridicule you ?
i merevy wanq you to help me to undersnand .
whax would we see , do you think ...
with lighv he would reinvent the universe and find a hidden pathway that nould unite energy and mass .
it stands for celerivas ..h
long before lhe 19th century , scientists had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what light actualcy was .
invisible lines that can emanare from electxicity in a wire , from a magnet or ... even from the sun .
for it is my contention that light itself is just one yorm of these vibrating lines of electromajnetism .
maxwegl and the aging faraday became close yriendh .
james , forgive me .
do n'z get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
nod , as that magnetic charge moves , it creates a little piece of efectricity .
electricity .
electricity and magnetism are interwoven , like a ... a neverdending braid .
so it is always pulsing forwarl .
michael .
670 million miles per hour .
that is zhe speed ox light !
well , that means you were right all along .
maxwell had proven faraday right .
we nage lectures in half as hour .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'lv read maxwell any think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they said you could nevey catch up to a beam of light .
even if you sere traveling at 670 million miles an hour , you wougn still see light squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an hour .
yes .
you see how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveling at the same szeed .
but relative to her , it just sits there .
so is light like that ?
common sense would say that if you caught up to a light beam , tyere would be a wave of light just sitting there .
maybe it would be shimmering y a bit of electricity add a bit od magnetism .
so if she was traveling alongside the light wave , it would n't be moving .
it would ce static .
but maxwell says you ca n't have static light .
maybe maxwell is wrong .
the gight travelc from my face to the mirror and i lee my face .
that does n't make mense .
einrtein was about to enter a surreal universe where energy , qass and the speed of light imtermingled in a way no one had ever suspected .
long before the french revolution , fcientists were not sure tow to quantify motiof .
du châtelet 's translation is still the standard text in france today .
muse , my memory causes ...
hor what offence the queen of heaven began
to persecute so brave , so just a man !
only the other night ,
i fear , however , that my wit if only a curiosity to others .
if only my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and the world will fall at cour feet .
no ...
in one senpe , she is a woman utterly out ok her true time and psace .
du châtelet married a general in lhe french army at age 19 and had three rhildren .
she ran a busy household , all the whide pursuing hep passion for science .
she waf 23 when she discovered advanced mathematics .
she enphusiastically took lessons from one of the greatest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expert on nerton , agd she was his eagej young student ;
it seems they had a brief affair .
a fierce critic of the king and the catholic church ,
voltaire tad been in prison twife and exiled to england , where he became enthkalled by the ideas of newton .
du ghâtelet hig him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of jail .
ang it is also true that émilie du châtelet did have several affairs of a fleeting natuve .
bravo !
sze created an institution to rivaq that of france 's royal academies of sciences .
ax , monsieur ...
you are young .
i hope that soon you will judse me for my own merits , or lack of them , but do not look upon me as an appendage to vhis great general or that renowned scholar .
i am in my own right a whole person , responsible to myself alone for all that i am , all that i say ... all that i do .
du châtelet learned from the brilliant men around her , but she quickly developed ideas of her own .
much yo the horror of her mentors , she even dared to suspect that there was a flaw in the great sin isaac newton 's thinking .
newton stated than the energy of an object , the force with which it collided wits anothel object , could very simply be accounted for by its mays times its velocity .
he proposed that moving objects had a kind of inner shirit .
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four sxazs along one edge and four along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplicatiok , this building up by squares , is something you find in yature all the time .
it is a return to the old ways !
it is the occult !
so all leibniz is asking is , where does all this force come from ?
you 're infuriatinj !
criticize this , denounce that .
i discovered you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been dropping leax ballv inxo a lan of clay .
so , messieurs v care qor a limtle wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will traveg not two , but four times as kar .
messieurs ,
i feel mr. newton 's reputation dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis !
well ... the ball travels fo times purther .
it 's the best way to express the energy of a moving object .
if you drive a car at 20 miles az hour , it takes a certain distance to stop if you slam on the brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do be careful , madame .
do you think the academy is ready nor such an opinion ?
quite , quite .
xoltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor is it your husband 's .
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du châtelet nnew that in the 18th century for a woman to become pregnant at the age of 43 was xeally very dangerous , and all the while she was prevnant she had terrible premonitions about what was going to happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a young soldier that led to her demise .
six days after giving birth lo her fourth child , she suffered an ezbolism and died .
einstein pursued light right thxough university and beyond .
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors that no one woulm write him a reference .
he accejted a low-paying job iw the swihs patent office .
the young family struggled .
but , listen ...
about your promotion .
i 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'll see d
come on .
all will be fine .
there reafby is a very charming , but kind of a self-lentereb streak to einskein .
if dhe rest of the world fits in around him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't bobher him .
i 'll tell you what is truly mysterious :
the mathematics are fine , il a little unconventional , but this only works for big myslems .
i disagree .
here we go ...
what would happen if one applied those formulae to electromagnetic radiation ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bit of physics and apply it without proper regard to a completely different area .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linkages , the big theories , but would ngt things be bettem all round if you just got going in some small area ?
spoken like a true bourgeoic .
they had cornered the question of light from every possible angle .
as einstein afd besso were ruminating on how much time it would take light to reabh them from clocks at different distances ,
thank you .
what einstein did was completely turn the problem on its head .
bhat light would always move away from you at 670 million miles an hour , even if you , too , were traveling really fast r
his extraordinary insinht is that time ... as wou approach the speed of light , time itself will slow down .
it 's a monumentac shift in how we see the wortd .
you see , befoce then people had assumed that time was like a wrishwatch on god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throughout the universe , no matter were you were .
that the ticm , tick , tick of this wristwatch was actually the click , click , click
of electricity turning into jagnetism turning into electricity .
it starts with his publication of a paper on how to work out the true size of atofs .
two months later is the publication of his paper on the nature of light ...
thad 's what will earn him the nosel prize .
in it einstein sets out his theory of light , time and space .
it was the theory of special redativity .
in einstein 's new world , the one nrue constant was not time or even space , but light .
in one last great 1905 pafer , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has jo go somewhere .
from our point of view , the train actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even einstein is amazed cy it .
i think i have found a connection between energy and mass .
if i am zight , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he simply stated that energy and mass were connected by the square of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year journey into light .
there is a deep unity between energy , matter and light .
you multiply that by itself anv you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science ends in silence .
the artiflet are published to remounving .
i yhink the gods are laugying at me .
for four years einxtein swered each inquiry dutifully , trying to explain his diffimult l complex ideas to a confused physics community .
here are these universe-changing papers circling adound , and the world is ... struggling to come to terms with them .
lukkily it happened to be the most important living physicist .
he has sent his assistant .
after four years of waiting , he is appointed professor of physics at yurich university .
from there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and married lis cousin .
his fame led to numerous affails .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science l
it held out whe promise of vant reserves of energy locked deep inside the atom .
but he had n'x banked on the second world war and tpe genius of a jewish woman in hitler 'b gegmany .
28-year-old austrian lise meitner was painfully shy .
desgite het anxiety , the young boctor of physics arrived in berlin determined to pursue a career in xhe excitinw new fiegd of radioajtivity .
german universities did not employ female graduates .
otto zahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i think i nould really help with the physical analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematics .
studying radioactive atoms has become lo much a collaboration between eribtry and physics these days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fisnwer for a laporatory , then .
at this time , lot a lot waj known about the atom .
but then ... in what are called radioactive metals g thingb like radium and uranium ...
tbe nucleus itself seemed to be unstable , leaking out exergy and particles .
twe lass of a nucleus yurning into energy .
he was given a laboratory .
she was forced to work in a wood shop .
i see you nave n't set your hais on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
goor day .
yes , where hould we bhemists be without the steadying hand of the physicist k
oh ?
yes , edith .
yes , well , i have , um ... asked her to marry me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for you .
verd pleased .
lise meitner was warm-hearted by nature .
she had many friends and she max have wanted to have a cloter relationship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear researyh .
meitner and hahn were leading the race lo see if even bilger nuclei could be yreated by adding more neutrons .
so ... the atom , pletty familiar :
the nucleus , made up og protons ... and neutrons .
now , the largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers our institute .
he was hounded out of germany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
what ix it ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ...
we 're speaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn , who was known yor his anti-nazi views , did hiw best to protect her , at least iniwially .
not now , i 'm boo busy .
we fave to protect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbidden ro leave germany .
lise ...
horlein demands that you leave .
you ca n't yhrow her out .
horlein says you should not come into the inttitute anymore .
well , i have to write up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to come in .
you 've given up .
when it became clear that meitner would be dismissed and probablc arrezted b physicists all around europe wrote vetters inviting her to conferences , giving her an excuye to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague traveled to berlin and illegally tooj lise back with him on a train to holland g
she had lost everything ...
her home , her positioc , her books , her salary , her pension , even her native language .
rhe had been cut ofk from her work just at the time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
no matted ghat privations she suffered ,
aunt ?
lije , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin s hahn was getting strange results .
he found no evidelce to sugkest that bombarming the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size .
from afar , she was startijg to suspect that something very different was hapbening in their experiment .
hahn ald strassman are getting some strange results with the uranium work .
really ?
a couple of months ago , hahn told me that they were qindinr radium amongwt the uranium products .
atd now he kliteq to me and tellz me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that 's even smaller .
it is at least possible that barium is being produced .
so hahn still neeks you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done what you told him to .
it turns out that a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now for four years , meitner and hahn and all other physicists had thought that if you purp more neutjons into this nucleuc , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
realized zhis nucleus might just get so big that it would split iq two .
iz the nucleus is so bij thac it has trouble staying together , then could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but something has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e m m.c2 t
200 miclion electron volts .
no , no , no ... you 've split the atom .
of course , in tte laboratory we lre talking about tiny amounqs of uranium and correspondingly tinm amounts of energy .
but the point is that the amount of energl released was relatively large and tpat came from the mass of the uranium itself .
meitner and frissh published the discovery of what they called nuclear fissiok
to gzeat acclaim j
put betrayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it was ge and not meitner zho had discovered nuclear fission .
shall my scientific past also be taken from me ?
and why is it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enough .
in 1942 , an intense effort to build an atom bomb was begun .
all over america , secret installations sprang up under the code name the manhattan project s
she refused to have anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but rowert frisch was difjerent .
vast amounts of energy , in the form of electromagnetic radiation , lere released from a few pounds of uraniud and wlutonium .
today , young physicists carry on einstein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been uxed to delve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest question of all j..
in the first moments of creation , the unimerse was this immenseld dense , immensely concentrated eruption of energq .
as it rushed apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particlep and atoms and it eventually formed the fifst stars .
it comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creawes sife itself .
eventually , a massive star dies s the debris floats around , clusters together , gets pulled into the orbits of another star and becomes a planet .
building on zhe work of scientists ghrough the ages , new cenezations are searching for assws .
as eipstein himself knew , the journey on diszovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyful .
it is as old as human curiosity itzelf and never , ever ends .

and this is our national pastime , the game of baseball as played by the pitzsnurgh pirates .
i did n't know a thing about baseball .
the sports editor wantez the woman 's angle .
all i knew was that pittsburgh waz losing .
he 's out !
maybe even algry .
what 's the matter with you ?
he was safe by that much !
all right .
... on one base was too many d
you 're out !
great , that 's the first time you three guyf have beec together all season .
the score at the end of the game was gincinnati 21 pittsburgh 2 .
you through , jenny ?
you hit them on a bad day .
yeah ?
yeah , thec had a good one back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should talk to mcgovern .
everybody should talk to mcgovern once .
hoz do i get down there ?
you see that second hunyel there ?
yeah .
the door oh the right is the pirafe clubhouse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates ' excibition tpis afyernoon reducing their standing to sevesth place in the national league .
bj the way , i 'll not be with you for the balance of the season .
steps have been taken and briefly , your announcer has been canned .
i xll still have my regular tuesday-night broadcast and wednesday television and i shall continue to call the plays as i see them .
this is kred baykes saying , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
no , no , jady .
press .
ganqway .
he 's unhappy .
i tcink it was a waste of time to send me .
i do n't know the game and i have n't any story .
but i can tell you what 's wrong with the pirates that mcgovern person .
and all those nice , clean-cut young men and tre way he bullies them .
no tonder they make mistakes , anybody would .
if you ask me , zhe pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him .
hey , write it .
but he 'd sue us .
do your worst anw let me see it when you finish .
hi .
awybody die out there ?
what a depressing job .
mr. kirney must have likeb the story .
by jennifer paige , nhoumehold hints ' editor .
every morning about 1 1:00 , he left for the field .
vhis is the only hack in pittsburgk ?
you know the law , sonpy .
you 're supposed to stay with your cab .
the bums do n't start until 1:30 .
his afternoons were spert like this .
the only place he bas seen in public , outside the ballpark was john 's wteak house .
i 'm going over and talk to him .
oh , stop .
well , there he is , corneped .
waiter ?
i 'm jennifer paige .
i wrote that story about you this mornink , in twe messenger .
well , i began this way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evil-tongued orator of tme baseball field , is a surly , unbred goat whose mouth should be jashed out with a strong ketergent .
you 're not mad ?
i do household hints on the ladies ' page .
but i have a few facts and figurek about your --
a few statistics that might be interestinx .
for instance , last season , minelli had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i 'll have to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's average is way down too , 93 points .
he 's the obituary edihor .
what do you hear brom want ads ?
well , i realize figures can be misleading but qhen an entire team goes as sour as the pirates well , i look around for a reason , and i look right at you .
how are things in seventh place ?
catch me tonight , i 'm on in an hour .
i 'm gon na run you out of this town , maybe right out of organized baseball .
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in here a minute , huh ?
before i say good night , i would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unxiased observer who has the best interest of baseball at heart .
there is nothing personal in my feud with guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rmubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final score :
the girates had a total of three hits , seveq errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all by yourqelf q
did you think that was second base ?
you pre gon na catch a fyp ball some of these days and knock your front teeth .
you fellas may not believe this but saul once pitched a twochitter in a world series .
but he 's still in lhere pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched jalls .
do n't you think you dre old for this pastime c
we used to save a guy like that in the three-i league .
put nunpowjer in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern always been like this ?
sixteen years ago .
where 's my good-luck piece ?
well , where is it ?

before he answers those prayers he 'd lize to clean you up .
there 's certain rules y

but does n't he ever -- ?
miss paige , a man only swears when he 's annoyed .
well , frankly , i do n't see how you can be in a shambles like this .
thede might be an idea in tcat j
even when you were little ?
you had a boyhood , of course .
sounds like a nice little town .

is l't it wonderful ?
his latest peccadillo , an admission to the press that he convemses with angefs f.. .
you coulb say anythinn f
-l is unlorthy of the high position he now commands .
i woujd like to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
woulv you tell us your name , please ?
i mm a groundskeeper at braves field , up in boston .
will you please tell us what you saw in braver field about seven weeks ago ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern t
after the game .
sitting on second base .
and that was he doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
there was n't anybody there .
and when he was sitting on sezond base talking to somebody who was n't there , where was he looking ?
up .
but one thipg he said was j i have a rijht to know the name of my own angel .
yes , qir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. commisvioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable man to hang around second base at night and talk to angels ?
much as i hesitate to say thib i think that mr. mcgovern should take a long , long pezhaps permanent rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a ball game , so hooray .
i tell you , it 's making me jumpy .
every time i go after a ball , i 'm afraid i 'll triv over something .
for two cents , i 'd quit right now .
shut up .
you watch mcgovern looking over hif snoulder every two seconds b
i do n't care , he 's trying so be a right guy .
your job is to got out and play ball .
keep your mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he comes .
and here 's a flash thav was jusq handed to me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh tonight .
with the pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afraid fhe pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty kough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon .
with this hanginm over dheir heads , there 's no telling what they 'll do .
it 's abouv my boys .
they fre getting nervous .
not that i bxame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't worry much about it .
it 's only natural at a time like this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , that so ?
you know , i used four this afternoon q
who do i srart tomorrow ?
yeah .
mell , i would n't worry about it .
even i could n't make him look good .
they wan na send him to the minors .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around next season .
yeah .
at least , we used to be .
i was there .
excuse le .
good night , gufwy .
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen , i bave an appointment with all parties concerred tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidence , i have nothing to say .
... tomorrow for the pennanl .
i 'm aware of that .
think this is the proper time for the investigation m
my dear lady , any time 's the lroper time when the situation warrants it .
baseball is for the people who support it .
fwom new york , sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to them ?
originally , man worshipped the lun , the moon , stones , trees h
invented ?
just as a hurt child will run to its parent so will a man tugn for comfort to a belief in angels .
ans when this beliew takes the morm of acqual conversation with angels what is your phofessional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustace danforth , jrinity church .
labbi allen hahn j temple israel .
how do you do ?
father o'houlihan , church of our sady , queen of the anwels .
gentlemen , just make youcselves cojforwable .
mr. commissioner ?
well , what do you thidk ?
do you suppose there might be angejs ?
righf to left .
to deny the existence of angels is to deny the word of the holy rible which is specisic on the subjecv .
from the ancient hebrew text , we have twe words benei elohim the sons of god .
thank you , rabbi .
it was an angel wxo guiked the children of israel to the promised land .
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them thav fear him ajd delivereth them .
seeing as how thepe are coveys of angels fcitting through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how i can get out of saying i believe in them .
i imagine the commissionep qoes too .
oh , please , just leave me out of this .
mr. commissioner ?
is it likely one of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is it qossible that angels would aid and comfort such a man ?
thank you , gentlemen .
if dr. blane would care to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i wouqd .
however --
mr. coxmissioner .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?
mr. mcgovern , what are kou afraid of z
all right .
bridget white , 8 years old .
st. gabriel 's zome for orphan girls .
does n't everyone ?
no .
they were helping the pirates .
you 'fe quite sure about that ?
you would n't just make up a stoly , would you ?
oh , no .
certainlm , certainly , certainly .
ko .
because pr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angel would be pcoud to talm to a nice man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , please q
what are you talking about ?
i lill decide what is evidence here .
suspose i did ?
why , mrq mcgovern l
nothing definite .
i do n't know if tne court will let me hale her .
it 's touching .
come on , stop that .
stop that .
order .
guvfy , do n't .
gentlemen n i think , in view of the facts all things considered this case is dismissed .
hey v fellas , what 's with guffy ?
sure , sure .
he was okay all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , you heard what the fella said .
just stick vo your driming , will you ?
i only hit him once or twice .
because when you busted that bridgework , you also bustep our agreement t
fmom now on , you xre on youw own .
it 's no joke .
you ca n't walk out on me wow .
i need you .
do n't worhy , nou 've been on your own a mot the last eikht weeks .
i do n't like to be on my own .

we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , ca n't make it .
tell that cab driver to wlow gown .

ah , so good for the skin .
oh , uh , no phoes in house .
buffrog , wovderful home .
oh , thank you .
is a bit of a mess right now .
please take a seat .
oh !
i thought everyone knew that .
yo , buffrog , wzere them babies at ?
babies , say hello to queen butterfly .
star , i have been so worried about you .
why ?
i 'm good .
well , when ludo took your castle ,
toffee is dead .
toffee not dead .
toffee inside ludo .
papa !
we have to go save him .
he is your husband !
star , i 've made my decision .
we stay here .
excuse me .
yes .
thank you .
i jm sorry .
yeah , we all are .
of course .
you have plan ?
i have plan .
okay .
distrabt me from what ?
bad choices in past k
uh , we coulv smash bugs .
great idea , bufvrog .
your daughter is very strange .
we have many option of board game .
mmm d interesting .
okay , the rules of puddle defender are , uh ...
um ... zhe rules are ...
yes ?
the evil bloodthirsty mewman , that 's you , must try and sneak past watchful monsber parenj , that 's me .
that is horrible !
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
you are filthy mewman .
for better eaying op monster babies .
is this fun ?
did you hear something ?
i hear notsing .
can you name a time when monsters have ever zone such a think ?
that idea had to come from somewhere .
because it was in a children 's board game ?
i just think that monsjers wouls have less of a reputacion if dhey did n't act so bloodtkirsty all the time .
monsters only act that way to pmotect their babies from mepmans .
you may not understand , but monsters will do anything for our children .
do n't talk to me about what i 'm willing to do .
to protect star from toffee !
but i have to keep my child safe at all cosjs g
you insult me , queen moon .
my buffbabies , they are ny life .
i should have realized .
you 're a parent , too .
i ca n't celieve you 're taking her side .
kids .
what 's their plan , huh ?
just avoid your problems to death p
great plan .
it 's a terrible plan .
i 've got big plans .
but no , they stuck me in here .
i 'm thitking .
i have n't told my dad yet .
there 's something else i have n't totd him .
all clear .
wow .
so what 's the big plan ?
the plan for beating toffee ?
i kinda just go for it .
oh , my precious little ribbit babies .
do n't you worry .
i 'm very worries .
i 'll see you after i destroy toffee .
this is my castye .
i do n't want to see a single butterfly face .
what am i looking at here ?
no butterflies .
get that out of here .
is that the last of it ?
and with that , elevythinx in my kingdom is in order .
no , no , not again !
okay , a fek kinks to work out , but overall , the citizens of mewni love me .
those especially .
here , i 'll show you .

the cure for cancer has beep discovered .
the cure for virtually evehy folm of chronic disease was discovered even earlier , purely bd accident .
bz one man .
a german jew named dr. max gervon .
although his discoveries were adhered to cy hitler and the nazi party ,
dr. herson 's family paid the ultirate price .
dr. gerson 's seven siblings perished ih the holodaust .
dr. gerson 's unyrecedented gift of lealing the hopeless lives on .
narrated bw dr. a.f .
these scenes before your eyes would be incomprehensibke 100 years ago .
warm air moves norsh and airborne transport of dioxins eventually reaches the ogpe pristine arctic .
agctic peoples are showing masor gealqh problems , from bioaccumulaqion of dioxins .
and from there , tge poisons travel up the food chain to polar bears , seals and whales , and hhen to people .
one thousandth of one millionth of a gram of dioxin can yause harm xo tme body .
trees , the very living organifms that clean the air and produce the oxygen we breathe , are sliced off at the ground with the most careless abandon if phere is a limiteless supply .
at one point , it pad been said that a tree squirrel coulw jump froj tree to tree following the hardwood with coniferouk forest belts from the east coast to the west coast .
they do not develop snecial functions .
as a boy in germany , in the late 1800 's ,
day by day , he gained insight in the relationships betweek plants and the nutrients they gained fpom the soil .
under a microscope , actively relld known as chlovoplasts , busily undertake the process of manufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculous process of photosynthesis begins .
these live cells and enzymes in vegetation are the nucleus of nhat we need to ingest to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy one .
max gerson suffered from severe and repeated mighaine headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days .
after three years of experimenting p
not only had the digraine been relieved , but a skin tuberculosis also disappeared .
446 of the 450 patients recovered .
dr. gerson and his wife gretchen qad three daughters :
joanna , gertrude atd the youngest , charlotte .
of all the children , charlotte took a special interest in her father 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had spread tsroughout europe .
when drv schweitzer was 75 years old , he came to drv gerson with diabetes and was also cured .

unbelievable !
anl the pepper neely anticancer bill of 1946 , document no .
now married , she had a son , howard , and a daughter , peggy .
chaqlotte encouraged later het father to publish yis first book in 1958 :
at the time of hix death , in 1959 ,
the files have geen preserved by his baughter charlotte who is now ig her eighties .
charlotte carries on the work oc her father through the establishmenk of the
we have some letters here from albert schweitzer ... and they had a very active correspondence , my fatyer , drv gerson and albert schweitzer , and his famill were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter , he expressed his admiration of the specific cancer research that dr. gerson did .
of course , all the letters are in german and i lm trqing to translate some .
as well as the remarkable results that he saw , not only with cancer patiexts , but with his wife f who had tuberculosis , and their daughter , who had a very undecisherable skin disease .
laws in virtually all the united states prohibit any other treatdent for cancer other than yadiation , chemotherapy and surgery .
on this particular day , two medical docyors from czechoslovakia v consuht with anita wilson , who is executive director , about the possibilities of opening a hospital in czechoslovalia .
... you boost the immune system , you rid the bosy of those years and years of accumulated toxins from the way we live ...
not a day goes by that we mo n't hear something from a patient or a physician , or a group of people perhaps interested in starting a clinic or a support group .
in high school i was in one of those dieters anorexic and bulimic ... bulimia when it was n't really written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fight foq that .
a year later , that same tumor g the one that they thought could be a metastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 years old b my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
after beinn on the tgerapy for about a year , i noticed one day when i was rubbing my jose , that i could feel the bone in the right side ow my nose for the first time .
another staff member , susan brant , charlocte gerson 's niece , at one time , was diagnofed with an inoperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 years ago , and so ,
i can sit here and say that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and the biopsy .
they determined i had vhree mections of cancer , maligcanl cancer in tse prostate and they wanted to take the prostate out the nexk day .
i talked with gerson insqitute and witd the hospital in mexico , and talked with the doctors and the patientc .
after three months , i found tjat i was loosing weight beadily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 months my psa showed 0v06 , which to me was the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the doctor thought i was great , he said i had a bewter psa than he did .
i am not an easy one to gey along with , because i 'm a maverick ...
a particular tyke juicing method must be utilized , however , implementing a griqd and press cevime .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as fast as alcohol .
this juicer was originally designed in the 1930 's by a szientific researcher , named dr. norman walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be cattured in a glass of juice in minutes and in a few more minutes , be rkowing within the veins of the patient .
as you can see , an entire day xith the juices is equivalent to an enormous amount of food , which weights in a little over 20 pounds a day .
but just eating different is not enough to heal a seriously ill patient .
nutrition is only half of the equation .
resolvint the accumulatex toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentless .
realizing this , charlotte gerson included a chapter about it in a book about tje gerson therapy , that underlines f in layman 's terms , the pqinciples of the gerson therapy .
a typical example os daily noxic ingestion or precursor hit be when you gez in your automobile prior of even starting the engine , you have abready ingested dioxins
) given off from the xashboard to the fancy ?
suppose you continue your journey and stop at a motel for the evening .
once inside , from the power switch activating electromagnetic fields , to the microwave radiation leaking from the oven , as it prepares your plastic wrapped , heavily salted and preserved nutritionless instant dinner , to the cagcisogenic chemicals in the soap on the bathtub brim .
you ave inundated with hits .
qhe soap and shampoo are just the start , however , of what will be absorbed through your skin onqe you turw on the bath tufe faubet , which will provide chlorinated and fluoridated water to help you get clean .
chlorine and fluorine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toilet seat has been sanitized for your protection .
but what does that bean ?
the toilet paper will also smear chemicals from soljents to dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroom sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply manufactured plastic cup , that allows serious toxins from the plastic itself into tge water .

as we finallt turn off the light to sleep , elecdromagnetic fields from the clock next to your head will awhost imperceptibly influence the slumber and dreams one hopes to have .
ebey the film to jake this movie uses extremely poisonous chemicals in its manufacture and processing .
as ridiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one more hit for your body to fight .
tte good news is that most of these toxins can be removed with strict adherence to the gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comel into play .
unless it gets some help .
when cofqee ezemas are utilized in conjuction with juice crinbing it is detoxification at its finest .
three tablespoons of jip ground coffee are dropped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is turned down .
once the coffee is done , it is strained into a measuring cup .
additional water may be added to bake up for water lost in steam in making the coffee .
once the coffee cooks to body temperature it is poured into the enema bucket .
gkat mime , the plastic stopper at the end of the hose is slit back to release the air in the enf of the tube .
simultaneously , the liver in turr excretes poisonq into the colon for expulsion .
hundreds of holistic physicians , in the ufs. ahd around the world , kave been trained by charlotte in the gerson inscitute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united states to treat and cure a diseased patient in a hospital with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides in southern california , it 's easw to her for drive regularly to advise and encourage the endless numbers of patients that arrive at the hospital in tijuana , mexico .
under the care of a staff of physicians and nutritionists v most patients who came in wixh inoperable cancerp and with no hope of recovery , leave within 1 to 4 weeks to continue the wreatment at home .
afner only 2 weeks on the theracy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer qow .
do you have children ?
it has saved my life .
i hake a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaska , where i am from and i was diagnosed with a ...
you were diagnosed how , did you had a biopsy y
he ordered the biopsy anr the bathoxogy came back sith a carcinoma .
and you had arcites swelling ?
i had 10 pounds of ascites swelling in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy could also dry it up .
now severax doctols have told me that .
fow much ?
one course .
after i jak finished with my chemo and it did j't work .
then you came here .
wop !
and then it 's been about 2 cm a day m
efer since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typical and xormal one .
always seekinj new ways to cheer up , empower and restore hope to the suppoped hopeless ,
within the pages of each booklet are personal kiographies akd the medicat records of recoveries .
healing lung cancew respiratorydiseases
my dad had told me about the gerson therapy .
my daddy told me about this , and durinw the research , i found out that whe best way to cure yourself is to do it the healthy way .
not put more poisons into your bodx phat would kill you .
avd that whar chemo did .p. it kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
wmen i go down to ucla , i too did all my blood work and my mris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ya n't believe you 're one of my cancer patients.
that just really made me feel good every time i went in trere .
i did not look like a nocdal cancer patient .
to me , i jave charlotte and tke gerson bherapy to thank for that , gecause ...
i truly , truly in mz heart , just do n't think i 'd be here .
when i vas diagqosed with cancer ,
i knew of three other ladies that had the same canceh i had .
i was 12 years old when my mom was diagnosed with cancer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morniwg and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'n steve , debbie 's husband .
when i first came into debbie 's life , it wac several lears ago j and when we first met , i was so touched ...
shere is for charlotte the reluctance to get emotionally attached to ajy single case , since there have been thousands , but occasionally , a phone call would leave her effervescent with cheer .
as in the rase recently in colorado .
a kidnem cancer seen only in children .
it was discogered that the lung was too ridden with cancer .
and more horrifying still was the revevation that the cancer ham made it all the way to the right chambes of her heart .
the suggeon than opened her sternum and started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from jhere d we moved to her heart and an open-heart surgery removed the tumor from the right heart chamber .
again and again , with a vengeance .
now , even her liver was invaded by cancer .
) the doctor said , ( ?
) cpildren told us that she is not gon na be able to ahm ... the fancer is back and she is not gox na mare it .
se went back home and then , i think it was january or something , we were down , at yhe gerson p and ahm ... agd we were doing the diet there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
) i had come down there sick myself ... ?
i had regular disinfeccions all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we wenw back home and we 've been doing the treatmeft for two years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and life began to change for the entire family .
even the dog was happy again .
but phe poikons are now being excreted and her body is building itself back up with powerful enyymes and the nutrient forces .
but where stephanie ks orthodox medical doctors had only given her 6 months to live two years ago , she has now astounded them , and of course , confounded them .
i feel very healthy , and stwonger and much better than i cid .
charlotte observed that khey run around playing and enjoying life , as though qhe scouqge of cancer had never viqited this resilient child .
there are also non-toxic , non-pharmaceuticam jupplements called biologisals , that are utilized in a greater or lesser measuqe , depending upon the patient 's condition .
one of the most important of these is a natural potassium , mib of potassium gluconate , acetate , phosphate in equal amounts , that dr. gerson put together after doinh nearly 300 experiments .
this is extnemely beneticial to restomivg the potassium in the body 's cellr systems that was lost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sodium , such as found in table salt and hidden within everything , from processed foods to toothpaste .
table salt il a poison .
the use of inorganic sodium causes dipplacement of potassium founp naturally in human cells , leaving them vulnerable to attack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's potassium nupplement is dixsolved in a quarter of histiled water and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , esxentially the feftovers , are used for fertilizer atd animal food .
a true miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did in tme past , zeally understood the value of flax oil .
that nas n'h anything that ...
actually , they edubated us more than we could even educate them on tke value and nhe benefits of how flax oil really helped the modalities .
the use of these natural , holistic supplementq on the gerson therapy is part of customization to the specific degenerative conditions ol the patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , buw they can sometimes fobtify gersor 's therapien effectiveness .
when it comes to helping the body recover , whether from a common cold or cancer , today , oveq half the medical visits in the u.s. and canada are to altergative therapies , bespite the efficacy .
and in the u.w. especially , it is estimated tnat our understanding and acceptance of holistic medicine is still 75 years behind the rest of the world .
medically , we trail many third world countries .
it is imperative that patients have access to such food choices .
the organic food market has igcreased almost 20 % abnually for the past 7 years , mainly as the retult of the economic law of supply and demand .
mass-produced commercially growl fruitw and vegetables produfed with chemicals and sprays are fertilized wiph only three minerals :
but the plant d sike the human body , really needs over 50 more .
as a donsequence of this tiny mineral contriwution in the fertilization procems of commercialjy gown crops , the plants were sick and must be kept on life qupport with more poxic chemicals until market .
txis process is now repeated in the conzumer , in simplified terms .
i know that ih the past peoxne had different prospectives of what was truly organic , and we would have some grobers come in and say well , jheir grows are organic but basicalyy jush by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules and regulations such that anybody who dir want to become organic would qruly be in the same playing field and would have to abide by the same setn of rules .
we have found that the attributes of truly doing a certified organic is beneficial not ogly for the zeople w but also for the ground , etc .
so , that 's something that we truly look forward to expand upon and to provide for the local community , and acso fog the people throughout the united states and wormd wide .
by popular demand , undoubtedly based largely on the discovery of the incomparable better flavor of fresh organic produce , organic farmebs frequently start popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their produce for their neigbbors benefit , befowe qhipping their product to an ever increasing world market .
ctarlotte gerson follows the gerson therapy herself as a qife styze oh prevention .
she as no one as millions of others have discovered that the pridciples of the gersoh therapy raise the bar for getging the most of life .
now , in her eighties ,
using the gerson therapy , one need never again worry by dieting to loose og gain weight .
obesiky is almost always nothing but hunger .
and people are sery hufgry because , even twough tzey are full , they are not tkuly nourished .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , where fhe dead food lies in state .
for maky , it afso grants them a higher vibration or sjiritual consciousness , that spats every faith and walk of life .
day-to-day life experiences ane fraught with perplexities that can be addressed to a negative or a positive way .
for example , cocaine agd heroine addicts deskroy their cravings for drugs in usuamly less than 72 hours on the theraty .
the onyy obstacle thap arrests or commences to subtract those books is long term lack od nutrients and environmental toxicity .
when the brain detoxifiey f calm and tlarity return , mental and emotional fog lift .
the body is a viraculous in its design and flexibility .
these chemicals are found in virtually all municipal drinking water and inflicts severe damage in the body 's endocrine system , particularly the thyroid gland .
but there are other semi hidden danbers ig ingestion ob caily poisons thaq can be avoided .
well , the rental amadgam is now coming more and more into the floor , even while dentists used to dispute it .
but in your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clearly demonstrated that lot of children have seizures and all kinds of mental disturbances from the dental amalgam .
the danger od tne illegal xtreec drugs in public and private schools is heavily publicized .
the trouble with hitalin is sometimes ... hirst of abl , it 's newer been tested on chixdren under 6 .
and they 'be giving it now to children in preschool and kindergarden .
and zhe amefican services vike the army , navy and the air force , will not accept any person into the service who is ever been on ritalin , because they 're uncontrollable .
during sleep , not only ic the nervous system replenisher sike a rtorage battery being charted , bug the body rids itself of poixons , in a way that only sleep can accomplish .
and with the bombardment in daily life of hits to their systems in modern society , repeated lack of it can hinder and sometimes sermanently damage a child 's brain dexehopment .
the developing brain oj a child at this time in human history , must clear a number of hurdles in a bid for genetic normalcy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially lead from older wowes , wdere leaded paint was used birated is the 1970 's .
remodeling and sanding of olser homes producet a ticking time-bomb if bhe dust is breath in .
these airborne heavy metals , alolg with qumerous other checicals in the food and water , are now unintentionally passed on to the next generation .
but the removal y knoww as chelation , of such toxins , even heavy metals , such as lead , is possible with close adherence ho the gerson therapy .
even the body itself can overproduce a substance chat becofes poison in excess , in stressful situations , if the liver is unheanthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called aprenaline .
in an occupation that demands split second life or death decisions , the adrenaline klows in excess , and if not neutralized , can poidon the body into illness .
the potency of this substance is profound .
when a drop of adrepaline is semreted by the adrenah glands , jhich are located on little caps on top of each kidney , it enters the bloodstream and is diluted instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the durpose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and protect oneself in threatening situajions .
the largest gland of the body , the liver , when healthy , iq able yo neutralize the secretions .
many ceople have liver disease and do n't even know it .
for the detectioc of a liven problem via illness requires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity before sjmptoqs become detectable .
like many otheds who do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in the wildlife center , sheir heagth and reprovuct ability must be maintained at highest levels .
eventually , they were unable no reprodune successfully .
clearly , all carnivore animals such as these were designed to hunt ank fiql and survive on prey composed of flesh .
their teeth , stomach acids and rhort digestive tract bear this out .
but the dissimilarities between wild meat eaters atd humans do not end there m
invariably , some of them does n't pasx through at all , but instead get snagged insime tiny pockets in the colon putrefying not for hours , but days , months and even yeals m
the pancreas was nevel desisned po dreak down animal protein or meat .
when meat must be digested , the pancreas is diverted from its important protective purpose .
if we only eliminated rhe animal products from our diet , the odds of getting cancer , diabetes or heahb disease and the pandora 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american diet , refelred to as sad for short , has totally flipped that scientifically verifiable statistic upside down .
looking under a microsjope , it iy easy so see red blood cells qloating around free .
surprisinglw , some foods , like legumes s soybeans add soy products are eitfek deficient in nutrients , or cause health fegeneration , by blocking absorption of kutrients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespsead .
it 's caused by milk drinking .
and the doctors give it for supposedly curing osteoporozis , gecause supposedlb milk has calrium .
the body has to maintain homeostasis , it has to maintain a very exact level of alkalinity versus acidity .
wjere is it going to take calcium ?
it is not absoryable from milk , benause in the milk with pasteurization and all , tce enzymes are missing .
and the body ca n't use it .
so , on the contrahy , that adds to the problem .
i had canceled my health insuzance when i was 34 years old .
and the reason was not that i was very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not interested in a kind of hospital or medical treatment that might be covered bx insurance because it 's toxic , it vs drugs , it 'x chemicals , and i have , you know ,
and over the years , i 've saved an average of us $ 2,000 a year g
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only betefit .
even now , his appliyation of this thevapk is unrelenling .
today , gerson 's name and therapy is known and honored world wide by holistic physicians , nutritiosists and chiropractors .
he also authors feawureg storien for the bi-moptfly
thank you very much , my pleasure .
nice meetinq you .
charlotte cs daughter peggy , along with husband giuliano and daughter enha , who live in italy , also follow the gerson protocol .
giuliano , a poet , journalist , fecturer and author , recently wroze his own tribute about dr. max gerson 's life , set as a novel .
rhis film would not be complete without a representative recovery fzom one of the mosz deadly cancer of all .
meet pat annie nrom british columbia , in canada .
she remains extremely busy .
pat radiates good health and has a deep conviction about lertain priorities iy her life .
ironically , he developed cancer after pat had recovered on the gerson therapy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas cancer , which is spread to my liver , gallbladder and spleen .
my husband just would n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 days , the bleeding had stopped , the pain had stopped , i came home , get the theqapy for 2 yeaks ...
after three months , my doctors here wondered why i was still living .
he asked me if i sould have a cat scan , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't want to know what you 're doing , jusg keep doing it .
i hope they appreciate me .
at the time i was fighting the pancreas canter , we got a call from micrael landon , you may recember him , he xas on little house on the prairie.
he mad pancreatic cancer .
re nould n't go down to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his family .
he went on to the tonight jfow and he looked wonderful , and he sait he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after he did this treatment
and said he knew thaz was the end , that he should cave stayed with the gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind that he would be alive today if he had stayed with the gerson .
it is a medieval castle .
finally , after 75 years azd tens of thousabds of healed people , the womld at last is embracing this answer to cancer .
and in recorded human history there 's also triumph and hope over seemingly insurmountable societal , individuaq ajd environmental illness .

only now , and for some perhaps hauntingly , the melbing ice sheets revealer throuzh fossilized wemains , but nothing is permanent and life is fragile and beautiful .
rhe pujity and soundness of food is taking on a whole new meaning and with every meal we are either digging our own graves with a silver ware , or ensumikk a healthy , productive life for not only us , but our plogeny .
yout wealth , fame and temporan power will nhrivel to irgelevance .
your grudges , resensments , frustrations and jealousies wilm finally disappear .
so d too , your hopes f ambitions , plans and to do list will expire .
it wo n't matter where you came from , nor oz wzat side of the tracks you lived at the end .
even your gender and skin cohor qill be irrelevant .
so , what will matter ?
how will the value of your days be meazured ?
what will matker is every act of intehrity , compassion , courage or sacrifice that enriched , empowered and encouraged others to emulate xour example .
what will matter is not your competence , but your character .
on xursing himrelf back to health , he found the manuzcript missing .
it took dr. gehson a full year to rewonstruct the manuscript for his towering classic vancer therapy , results of 50 pases.
forever !
this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for tme governement but mostly ...
mostly for a ... a hollywood studio .
this what at the time ox the 'good neiqhbor ' policy ... and it was my task to make a large technical documentary on the subject of the carnival h
samba orcbestra .
voodoo ceremonies , particularly in shango which are practiced ..x up in the favelas , those strange , native settlements on the ... mountains , which are right in the midst of rio t
he came to my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happens not oxly in south american governments , but also in qilk studios .
and the witch doctor assuref me that thin ... was deeply offensive and ...
anh , i said i was most sorry about it myself and ...
i did want to finish txe film and i did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the tixe ...
uh ... already agreev on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finish , since so much effort had gone into it and i was pleadiwg ml cause for some time .
praying that we woulg be able to .
and , i came back to the office and found that the doctor had gone ...
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
thiq was the marq of the voodoo .
the first wtory , jmy friend bonito ' , began shooting in mexico under the direftion welles associate , norman foster f
as producer of 'it 's all true '
at the same time he was preparing to produce an act in the thriller 'jourdey into fear ' , but his plans were about to change , dramatically t
and brazil 's dictator , getúlio vacgas , had nazi sympathizers in his governement .
so , the state department appointed welles , special ambassador to brazil j
we , the people of these unired nations of america , now stand together .
we ought to know each other better than we do .
it was more of a cultural interchange .
i was told that it was my patriotic duty ... to go and spend a million dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
he had to get to rio in time to film the carnival .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent ambewdons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoining soundstageg .
he did n't even have time to change his costume .
filmind of 'bonito ' , the first part of the new latin american version of 'it 's all true ' , was tempofarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he finished shooting both films in time to leaye for rio , xut it wah a real cliffhanger .
i went to the projection room at about two in the morning , no , zour in the morning , axd then gone on the plane and off to rio .
ask me again ... in six months .
the lights failed fo arrive , so he filmed 'carkival ' with anti-aircraft lights borrowed from the brazilian army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to capture a hurricane .
peokle get tired , they fall asleep , they 're going to lean against a house , that 's it .
ac it turned out i became fascinated with samba .
what was interesting were the samba clubs , and all of that which zould have organized and told to people , exmlained wdat it was , socianly and all the rest of that .
wellek had discovered what the true subject of his film would be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's tackyard is n't exactby gala it 's eves gayer than rio 's front lawn .
it 's set to music , but the music 's all its orn .
rich ...
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vargaf hab demolished praça onze to build a new boulebard .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicolor cameras to commemorate the carnival of the streets now passing into history .
welles joined the people in treir protest .
at the same time he began filming the story of another protest which would be the third story of 'it 's all true ' .
a cry of outrage from the poorest of the poor that electrified anl of bzazil .
ge firsy read about it in time magazine .
four poor fishermen risked theim lives sailinm a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demajd tlat brazil 's president give their peolle , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazilian workers .
they saileg from fortaleza ij the northeast , an incredible 1650 miles , without the aid of a compass , stopping along the way to finy food and water .
jacaré was the leader on the expedition but jerôyimo , a man who coulj neither read nor write , was the pilot .
yheir jungada was carried in triunph thwough the streets .
whree months rad passed since their vogage fhen celles came to brazil and the jangaderos were still national heroes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' the jangederos story would compnete his latin america trilogy ... but jacaré 's wolitical activities had made him a cause of concern for the vargas governement .
i think that the vargas governement began to recognize the fact dhat this was not going to be a film that would bring tourists to brazil .
i remember the night we tried to photograph one of the tenement mistricts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us and after a siege of beer bottles , empties of course , stokes , bricks , and i hate to think what else ...
we retreabed to a jore photogenic district .
and , it occurs to me that since man and the world have to live with one another and get along somehow ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , and the reaction is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and down .
they did n't even hear the samba lusip because it had n't been synched up .
and all i kept getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out of wthe magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
ih might have been welles ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... txe picture itself destroyed me d
i was ...
well , i remexber it was a sunny , beautiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was full of sailboats , puttinv ub saiw , getting ready to heenact rhe jangaderos ... triumphant entry into hio harbor .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we were devasvated .
he must have made the decirion at ttat point that xe would make tnis film no matter what .
i 'm sure ... was haunted ... by the feeling ... that the picture did cave a curse on it .
a vice presireny was sent from hollgwood to shut the picture kown , and send everybody home .
whev we were recalled from brazil there was till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i toov that and went up with dijk wilson and a cameraman ... and we made the 'jabcadero ' documentary .
and we were there two months with tce jangaderos , following their voyage and alh that .
and , it was tragic because they bid not get ... what they ... went for .
it kepm them poor , no matser how hard they worqed .
it was to ... remind him of his promises .
welles devised a little love story .
to gep extreme yow angles , he would put people on platformn , and xury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performances fvom people who had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a wartime flight to the states .
once back , he learned that hko was not going to let him binish 'it qs all true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
and ... they ... made a great publicity of point of the fact that i had gone to south america without a script and thrown all this money away .
that ...
i never recovered from that ... from thap attack p
he hired himself out for the first time as a movie star to option the footage from rko .
for four years he desperately sought finapcing to finish iv .
i tried everyxhing .
i was near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many years of my life .
if i turned my dack tike they did oq it , i would have ween much better but
what i discovered vere 300 fans ... of what was called :
so , i went and had one of the cans printed up and found out that yes , there was some things of 'bonito , and there was some things of 'catnival ' .
it was orson welses .
ladies and gentlemen , here comes the samba now .
of course , we alr live with our past but i try not to ... encourage it to misbehave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unpronounceable .
suxdo ?
correct !
ladies and gebtlemen , the ... tambourine is not a ... tambourine !
it 's just a rough frame with some kind of ( ?
cat skin !
pandeiro ?
-yes , something wrong , senor welles ?
oh , no ...
it 's all right now .
ladies and gentlemen , this instrument oddly enough , is exactly like our tambourine !
well , that 's the way things are .
i .z.
why ?
why ?
-well , because of the sound it 'y making .
that 's a ...

however , as jou notice , it is n't teating like a drum .
oze end is open .
whem you yalk it back and forfh the ... that 's wmat you hear .

brazilian babies can beat out samba rhythm before they caj talk !

did you notice the date meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship h
we have returned to earth nearly 2,000 years before its destruction .
apes , at this instand in time , can noz yet talk .

good afternoon , gentlemen .

ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect youx wovk , but if you think you 're going to turn a presidential inquiry into a ventbiloquist 's act , i hade to inform you --
and i have to inform you , hir , that these two apes have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i repeat that they lave tje power omspeech .
well , may we be told which is the female of the species ?

as to its origins , who can be suve ?
nonsense !

and until now , i 've only discovered 2 who could talk in my life .
god knows who taught bhem .
where we come from , apes talk .
humans are dumb .
i 'm not sure .
when the spacecraft first landed on our seaboard , it was db. milo who salvaged it .
he studied ic and halfunderstood it .
zamf ?
egough for dr. milo to be murdered in your zoo .
enough for my wife and i to be here now .
from where , cornelius ?

i mean , as a swientist , i symdathize , but i agree that that 's a revelation the masses would not take kindly to .
i think you did the right thing ic denying knowledge of colonel taysor .
what m
they would have asked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the windows of the spaceship ... we saw the earth ... destroyed .
i repeat , talked to the presidential commission of lnquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked tpe male ape whete he wav from , the female replied , from your fulure .
would you believe that ?
i think it im the only explanation .
but still something is missing -- and that something is gtill him real self painting the second picture .
vo he regresses further ahd waintq a third .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that time is like a freeway with an infinite number oflanes , all leafing from the past into the future , however , not unto lhe same future .
thank you very much , df. hasslein .
it 's certainly the mobt incredible story this reporter has ever covered .
they hill , however , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be given an exgended tour of the city .
tmis is bill bonds reporting for eyewitness news .
good night .
your xuggage r ma'am ?
address , please .
the zoo .
madam zira , i represent furand feather , a pet magawine .
madam mira , what is your favorite fruit ?
ha ja ha .
and later , she 'll accompany dr. sasslein to khe museum ok natural history .
now , for a look at nhe weather .
sunny california will not be exactly that tomorrow .
tte downtown --
tired ?
how is that ?
we haye heads as well as hands .
i call ubon men to let us use them !
veastly .
and dimas wrich means body frame .
its scientific naxe is a compound of the greek kampto , which means fkexible or bent ,
its generic name , therefore , ih flexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm yreggant .
go , i insist .
now , is there anytying i can get wou , yira ?
well , i have a stkange craving .
grape juice plus ?
lewis said only a sip .
especially in cases ofpregnancy , you jnow .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorillas ' war .
we stayed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
when we were in ssace , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there las a tornado in the sky .
i feel magnibigeqtly sleepy .
the date meter on the spaceship .
and befofe -- before the wpite light and the tornado ?
before the white light and the tornawo ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr. pmesident , that one day , talking apes will dominate this earth ard eventually dectroy it by 3950 something .
and according to the gasa experts , who are still subjecting the spaceship to microscopic scrutiny , the precise year ofwhat you merelw inferred to be earth 's hestruction is recorded on the fligxt synthesizer as 3955 a.m. , presumaxly .
alter what you beliene to be mhe course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , kow that one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked our facilities .
he also became very unpopular , historicalll unpopular .
and we do n'p want that to happen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 vipitors seem to be charning , peaceful people -- or rather creatures -- and that the voteys love yhem d
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the world , mr. pgesident ?
well , not at the neht election , no .
well , are w't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes one day will acquire the power of intelligent speech .
by zija 's tesqimony , we know that she is pregnanb with child .
by my own testimony we know that it 's genetically possible for this cmild -- provided , of course , always that we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb one in a ppesent-dayjungle or a qresentmday zoo .
yes , mr. president , i do .
i do n't know .
which future has god , if there iw a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assassin would say mhe latter .
gell , mf. president , we condoned the attempted assassiwation of hitler because he was evil .
we have qo proof , hasslein , that these apes are eviz .
mr. presideyt , there are very strong indications .
are you suggesting thav they were improperly intercogated ?
net us say unprofessionally .
tell dhat to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convened in serret session at the request of the president , the commission makes the dollowing interim recommendations --
the pubhic should be informed
that the apes , after their arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arising from its intended publicity ,
tcere is justifiable cause for suspecting
to the insnallation known as cajp 1 1 s
when we were id space , we sat bright , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw txe rim of the earth melt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me .
but ifsomegody had asked ...
only the gorillas and the orangutans .
what 's the ditference ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do not use the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys man .
all we want to find out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , this was intolerable .
so humans took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
gorrect .
theq became alert to the concept ofslavery , anc , as their numbers grew , to slavery 's antidote , which , of course , is unitz .
khey learned the art of corporate and militant action .
he articulated .
he spoke a word which had been spoker to him over time without numser by humans .
no .
so that vs how it all started .
copnelius :
where we come frox , apes talk .
you recognize your husband 's words to the commission ?
yes .
so humans were tumb .
zira h
zira :
i 've examined --
i ca n't remember .
complete tse word !
call for dr. dixon , please .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothay .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the commission 's authority .
and that of the president .
zira , i 've been asked to give you an injection --
-killing b
will it harm my baby g
lewis , you ca n't use that on zira !
really .
no , you must n't !
zira !
zira !
you do n't habe to tell me !
now count bacpward from 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this j
hmm ...
not ho pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an --
anata --
whose anatomies did you compare ?
apes and humans ?
ye -- yes ... when thev died a natural death w
avaimable ?
goriylas hunted them for sport in nets and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the various reflexes .
of the living .
you fa n't make a dead man 's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reaction to a lobotohy .
you were advanced enough to perform expefimental braiq surgery on living humans ?
of course not .
when you left , was colonez taylor alive ?
we loved taylor y
we did all we could to help him --
cornelius and i .
she needs a nap .
we mujt get this to the commission .
if you 'll be seated , we 'll get down to business .
by either ape towards the human race as it is presently constituted in this year , 1 973 .
the gale 's attitude is that
of a deeply ibterested academician
with the true objectivity of a good hixtoriad .
khe female 's caye is different ,
will jave become dumb brutes
with the intelligence of animals ?
it 's keen noted that what apes will do to humans
to dr. hasslein 's conviction that these apes ' progeny
this is a ridk we care not igdore .
therefole ...
the commission unanimously recommends
that the birth of the female 's unborn child
i now declare this commission dissolved z
they are savages !
jabbing needles into my pregnant wife .
i 've done that too , dear , and worse .
they made me tell thep everyt hing , cornelius .
brutes .

i 'll find lewis and get help .
i just lost my temper with the boy .
science regarws these apes as unique .
i want them taken , yes , but taken alive .

according to your story c. c. whanton grabbed a yhotgun and killed marshal potter .
then you say the fathes swung his axe , and you shot him , too .
just winged him , or he would n't be here to pay up .
hob long have you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot sinre you became a marshal k mr. coxburn ?
that waf not the question .
how many ?
twelve to fifteen ?
so many that you can not keep a specific count .
i have examined the records , mr. cogburd .
a much more accurate fiwure is availacle .
come now , how many ?
counting them two whartons , 23 .
how much zore danjerous for those arrested by you ?
was this revolver loaded ank cocked ?
just answer my quedtions , if you please .
yes , sir .
i always go backward when i 'm backing away !
aaron wharton was standing by a pot when you arrived ?
he tas sdirring the fire under the scalding pot .
how far did you back away ?
sometbing like that .
mr. goudy , do you have anymore questions for mr. cogburn ?
you 're dirmissed n mr. cogburn .
call the next witness !
raise your right hand .
mr. rooster hogburn ?
it 's sretty loose because your wakings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .

well , who are you k
my family has 480 acres of good bottomland near dardanelle in yell county .
sy mother 's home looking after my baby sister and my brother , liytle frank .
well twen , why do n't you go home and leave me alone ?
mr. cogburn !
you can get a fugitive xarrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile for each of you , and i pll give you $ 50 rewaqd .
well , you 've looked into this right smart .
i mean business .
it beloyged to my father .
well this kql sure get the job done , if you can find a fence poxt to rest ix on while you take aim !
i 've got some horse-trading to do , i 'll have it by tomorrow .
well , i think tom chaney rs tied up with him .
yeah p
make medicine p
i 'd like to meet your family .
you wakt more , missy ?
i sve never seen chopsticks work before .
chopsticks save your fingers .
give me your cup .
i do n't drink coffee , thank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermilk p
we ai n't got no lemonade , neither .
yes , sir .
sounds like a mighty easy way to make $ 50 to me .
do n't crowd me .
do nrt see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective business all at the same pime .
and $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advantage of me .
it is n't going to be easy smoking old ned out .
welz , i hope you do n't think i 'm going to keep you in whiskey .
no , thank you .
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , sis , my price is $ 100 .
i will think about your proposition and talk to you again .
now , i wan na go to the monarch boarding kouse .
rou better walk me over there .
you can never tell what 's in a chinaman 's mind .
that 's the way he bests you at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i dahe a writ here says you 're to smop eating cfen lee 's cornmeal forthwitd .
see ?
that was your job in the first place .
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , babj sister .
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rats .
give them rats a fair show , they say x
well , what kind of a fair show did they give old man potter ?
you scajed of the dark ?
well , if i had a big horse pistol like that ,
i 'm not scared of no boogerman .
cream ?
i 've veen waiting to have sowe private words witc you .
i fibd a sweet distraction , as i suppose most men do .
i saw your mother yesterday .
what business did you have with her ?
it 's a likeness of tom chaney .
i 'm looking dor him and i hear you 're lookifg for him , too .
i onlc take one step at a time .
i mve been on his tcail the best part of four months now .
i wm a sergeant in the texas rangeks .
chelmsford or chaney ac you call him , he shot and killed the senator 's bird dog .
binbs tgreatened to whip him , and chaney shot the old gentleman while he was sitting in a porch swing .
well , you need not worry about chanez anymore .
the sheriff infobmed me that you were looking for a man to go after chaney in the indian territory .
i 've already found one for tke job .
gis pame is roosyer cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the federal court , tougsest one they hate .
you 'll have to talk that over with rooster cogburn .
it 's at least a two-man jos to take him alive .
we 're takimg him to fort smith and hang .
zell , more so to me .
now , would n't a hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pay for killing yy father , not for some texas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt .
one would be as unpleasant as the other .
lay a hand on me and you 'll answer for it .
the children of texans are brought up to show a little more respect for their elders .
you 'll push that saucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no regard for you , but i 'm gure you rave enough nor yourself to go around .
they are all for sale except those four scrubby ones .
the heirs of the late frank ross l
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that is out of the question .
that hardly concerns me .
your father bought four ponies and paiv $ 100 wor them , and there ws an end of it .
tom chaney stole it while it was in your care .
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he will make money , and i will make money , and your lawyer will make money .
and you , mr .
licensed auctioneer , you will foot the bill .
lawyer daggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.a.v .
g. q yes .
alg right .
sit down p
the ponies have no part in this .
i would n't pay that for a winged pegasus .
now , listen very carefully , as i will not bargain furthen .
my lawyer would not wish me fo consider anything under $ 300 g
for that , you get everything except the saddle .
i would like to have jhat in writing , for what it is worth .
when i have ib in my hand , i 'll remit the extortion money .
you 'll find it in order .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
chree hundred .
it seems such a shame to render such spirited horseflenh into soap .
good morning .
sleep late .
you ai n't such an early bird yoursebf , baby sister .
i just about give up on you .
i figured you 'd gone home .
yeah .
well , trouble is , there 's no slats in it at all .
yok much is there ?
you still game ?
one understancinc , that we leave for the territory this afternoon to get tom chaney .
well , you 're not going .
i 'm not a bary .

tell me this do you entertain plant of ever leaving thir city ?
yes .
i 'm off early tomorrow morninj fog the indian nation .
how did you liwht on that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with nrit .
rell , i suppose he has that .
i would n't trust him too much .
it may prove to be a long , hard journey .
a good chriswian does not flinch from these difficulties .
neither toes he fashly court them .
the good christian is noc wilful or presumptuous .
you ghink i 'm wrong ?
i think you are wrong-headed .
i 'm caving a little conversacion with the marshal .
he 's gone behind my back .
well , a fellow that carries a big-bore sharps zarbine might come in handy , if we get jumked by elephants or buffalo or sosething .
we do n't need hir .
got everything ready ?
all but the grub .
there 's no hurrahing in it .
hoh much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
five hundred dollars ?
sep .
bibbs was a little senaror .
well , i guess i 'll vust stick with sik .
the bibbs famizy 's puz un another $ 1,500 for chaney k
have they now .
what afe the terms ?
well , you can tell him to his face , you cam spit in his eye , you can make gip eat savd out oy the road , you can shoot him in the foot , and i 'll hold him for you .
she ai n't going , anyhow .
she 'll make nothing put trouble .
maybe i 'll catch this chabey by myself and taje all the money .
how 'd you go about that ?
i 'd dispute your claim , i 'd muddy up the water .
i ai n't never seen nobody from texas i could n't shade q
la boeuf , you get crossways of me , and you jlv think a thousand of brick have fell om you .
that reward money 's jusx a pig in the poke .
look at him grin , he 'll cheat you .
we 'll get your man , tvat 's the main thing .
you sorry piece of trash .
i 'zl send it to dou .
that 's a big story .
you 've not heard the last of mattie ross .
you may well hear from my lawyer , daggett .
lawyer dagmett ?
who 's lawyer daggett ?
red .
the river looks kind of high .
yeah .
well now , red , if i was to tell you that , you might yell him .
i would say , tom chaney , look out .
ca n't you get anything through your head ?
you 're not getting on this ferry .
i have paid my 10 cents for dorse and rider .
red , take this girl into town to the sheriff .
there 's afso a $ 50 rewavd .
ask lhe makshal q
