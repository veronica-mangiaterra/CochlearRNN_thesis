gosh .
yeah .
well , we 'd better hurry .
hope they 're expecting us .
all right , gntlmn , we 've all had our say , and we all agree on this one vital point , we are clamping a tght security lid on professor brainard 's trmendous contributin .
oh , you 'll be recompensed .
goodness knows , the armed services ar never chintzy .
matter of fact , i 'm putting two of my bravest finncial officers on the mission .
professor , you are a fine , unselfish man .
it 's a privileg to know you .
but just relax 
no sweat .
the money s as good as in your hands .
schedule four is going in .
wll , professor , i do n't think we need to take up any more of your time .
we have to stockple statistics , buld up pressr , deploy our firepwer so we hit them from all directions .
well , no ,  do n't suppose we do .
d n't let those doble-breasted suits fool you .
those boys are tough .
well , the thing is , we do n't need all the money now 
it 's big .
everything about it .
everything is going to fall aprt all the way down the line , and the fre world loses anther battle .
is that what you want ?
no , i would n't want that , sir .
remember , you 're in washingtn .
stop trying to be reasonable about money or you 're ging to bollix up the whol thing .
you 'd thnk those peopl at the pentagn could at least have given us a coupl of  100,000 out of petty cash .
what 's gon na happen , professor ?
oh , roger .
i 'm sorry , biff .
i got ta face it .
the only time my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was when he got me .
is n't it magnifcent , gentlmen ?
medfield college has , i believe the saying goes , finally come into the chips .
why do n't you just change the name of the place to brainard cllege and have done with it ?
a splendid idea , mr. hawk , though i realze it was offered in a spirit of irony .
we 'll b up to ur hips in crckpts .
no .
are n't you all gtting a little high and mighty ?
oh , splendid .
ask him to come in , please .
gentlemen , would you be good enough to rise ?
whn professor brainard comes in that door ,
 mean you , uh ...
well , you really should n't .
well , not exactly .
it 's just ...
they relly sandbagged you .
they hung your hide p on the barn door to dry .
well ..
but i thought they were delighted with your discovery .
it 's just that ...
numbr one , the boys in washington latched on to your little discovery , so you ca n't sell t anywhere else .
number two , they 're not about to give you ny money untl they think it over .
number three , meantime , yo 've got no money .
number four , somebody bettr lay 350,000 clams on the barrelhead , first of the month by 9:00 a.m .
period 
nd of story .
 ca n't believe you 'd do a thing like that , mr. hawk .
well , boys , it loks like i 'm calling the tune agan .
i know hw badly yu must feel , president daggett , but thngs are nt s bad as they seem .
excuse me .
as a civic leader ...
parls !
oh , i just love pearls .
i make it my businss t know , mrs. brainard 
and nw , little something to keep the chill off 
h 
oh , you must n't .
well , you do n't think it s a little bit to fussy , do you ?
like yu 've been wearing it all your life , mrs. branard .
and here , the fnishing touch .
an emprss .
i do , do n't i ?
this , as you can see , is a check for one million dollars made out to the prfessor and yourself .
for a kind word , mrs. brainard 
you know , in a business deal  the right word from the little woman ...
i m a gret believer in the power of a woman .
you really got something , mr. hurley .
wll , i do n't know what ned 's ging t say about all this .
for a space-ag scientist  he 's a little bit old-fa ..
guess who ?
betsy !
what i 'd like to do ...
betsy  what is all this the dogs and that coat ?
please take it off .
now why do n't we let the little lady enjoy herself ?
mr hrley is a live wire .
professor , when you invented this stuff , i do n't think you dreamed wht you had .
do n't be so modst , professr .
that 's your trouble .
that 's where i cme n .
flubbermint gum , it chews whle you snoze .
flubberin , bouncs away pain again and again .
hit them where they live .
thy 'll wonder how they got along without it .
howie , roll the film .
guess what this is ?
but , betsy ...
hi there .
newton and the law of gravity .
watt and the steam ngine .
edisn and the electric light .
and , my friends ,
branard and flubber .
for it was not too long ago , in a small americn city , that the discovery of flubber burst pon a waiting world .
that was the beginnng .
from those first crude basketball shoes came more shoes , shoes for pople in every walk of life .
he could walk with his head above the crowd .
but this was only the springboard , not only to a vast new line of products , but to a happier , safer way of life .
friends , is your home a boby trap just waiting to snare you the moment you set foot in it ?
i 'm home , dear 
is your kitchen  savage jungle teeming with perls and pitfalls ?
dear , where 's the first-aid kit !
stop clowning , gerge .
transform it from a booby trap into a love nest .
yes , flubberze your home with hazard-free flubberoleum floors .
the foamiest , friendliest floor that ever fndled your family 's feet .
hi .
sweetheart !
i got him !
they live in the house with the flubberoleum floors .
i 'm very impressed , mr. hurley , but ...
now if you 'll just sign this letter of agreement .
that million-dollar check is the evidence of our good faith .
a prior commitment ?
with who ?
all right , boys , pack up the gear .
the party 's ovr .
forget it .
you 've hrt mr. hurley very deeply .
h !
nw just a minute 
do i have to give this back ?
i wo nt !
now give him his chck 
betsy , give me that check .
give it to me .
oh , vry nice .
beautiful quality .
hw do you do ?
my name is harker .
from washington ?
well  am i gld to see yu .
come right in .
how do you do ?
it 's vry nice to know you , mrs. brinard .
may i take your hat and coat  mr. hrker ?
you and your discovery have certainly created quite a stir dwn in our nation 's capital 
and you 've come bout the payments ?
well , thank you .
oh , but first , of cours , we d like to pinch off just a tiny bit for ourselves .
just enough to take care of the household bills tht have been stacking up for months .
all right , dear ?
internal revenue ?
the figure includes delinquent penalties of $ 12,895 at five percent for the first two qurters .
let me explain  mr. harker .
now they put a top-secret classification on it .
i 'm not even supposed to talk to anybody about it .
certainly .
excuse me .
we 've been counting on you .
we trusted yo .
you do n't build those rockets t the mon with green stamps , you know .
excse me , dear .
joey 's hr to collect for the paper .
i do n't think so .
there 's ten cents .
there 's another dime 
he wants his money .
there 's another dme .
tht 's all i 've got .
w 're rooting for him all the way 
oh , ned , i cleaned all the loose change out of ther .
oh .
but uncle sam has to run his store on current income jst lik everyone else .
when th money he 's counting on does n't come in , he 's very sad .
thank yo  mr. harkr .
thnk yo .
thank you , mrs. brainard .
uh , joey marriano .
and how many customers would you say he has on his route ?
oh , i 'd say around 30 .
you would n't take money from a child .
we do our part to keep the wheels of democracy rolling .
fnny you should mention that about mom .
we nailed her dead to rights .
i missed yo .
i missed you , too .
 just could n't help feeling sorry for all those people 
now , you take that ncome tax man .
we 're citizens .
now sit down , and hold your breath .
oh ?
what does that mean , you got hold of the weather ?
what t means , mrs. brainard , is that flubber was only th key that unlocked a great storehouse of cosmic forcs 
i found a gas .
d you realize what that would mean , betsy ?
it would mean that , for th first time , wather would become the slave of man , rather than his master 
ca n't t be something modest that would bring just a few dollars into ths house ?
or trsh can lids that would actually fit the top of trash cans !
trash cans ?
i 'd say i could use a little machine like that right now !
anything can hppen .
nything !
i thought you were nuts !
right .
and they 're practically natonal champs , right ?
right 
evn my own father could n't close a colleg that hd just clobbered the natinal champs , culd he ?
what do y think the suit is for ?
i have n't ben hangin ' arund professor brainard all semester just for kicks , you know .
what 's this thing supposed to do ?
how does that feel ?
oh , hi , prof .
good .
oh , by the way , professor ,
oh .
glad to know ya , humphrey .
hi there .
oh , not exactly .
sir , science neds brilliant young minds lik humphrey .
besides , i neded a volunteer .
for what ?
sir , i hope you w n't mind , but i 'd like very much to borrow a little flubber gas .
humphrey , come on , demonstrate .
there 's only thing , biff .
i do n't knw how much protection those pads are going to give you .
oh , we 'r not thinkng abot protection .
we 're thinking about offensive power !
jst imagine , sir .
the teams line up .
the ball is snapped .
rutland linemen fall like ten pins in every direction !
he 's over for  touchdown !
yeah !
whddya think , sir ?
i think you 're slightly nuts .
you go right ahead .
we 'll go on a crash program right now .
thank you , sir .
now the flubber gas is violent , but we need even more violence , so we stimulate it electrnically .
now , let 's see what we 've got .
now let 's see .
you know , biff , this stuff is labeled dangerous .
oh , now , hmph boy .
look , would i get you nt a situation unless  knew exactly what  was doing 
that shold do it .
i 've nver seen them so worked up 
when i bombard a cloud with a bem like this , it jst has to lead to clustering .
rain all ver the place .
now , for a cloud .
not a cloud in the sky .
ready .
aim 
charlie brainard !
betsy .
betsy .
and that 's only the beginning .
it 's  rsult of my fooling around with the molecular configuration of flubber gas .
all i ask of you is to get dressed for dinner .
whtever you say , dear .
oh , did n't i tell you , dear ?
no , i d n't thnk you did .
if there 's one thing i 'm certan you 're not , it 's narrow-minded .
it is n't as though he were coming ll by himself .
we 're adults , yu know , not children .
you do n't for one single minute mean ...
i 'll get it .
nuzzie !
it 's wonderful to ...
who is that ?
as soon as they unglue themselvs ,
i 'd like you to meet an old friend of ned s .
now wit a minute .
i do n't know any ...
i 'll be darned .
i 'll be doggone .
betsy , do you knw who this is ?
no  nuzzie , who is it ?
it was long before i met you , betsy .
by gosh , mary lee , you 've changed .
well , i 've been married here and there , and  uh ,
paris , huh ?
did n't you know that ?
gosh , we used to have the times , did n't we , mary lee ?
betsy , there was one time when mary lee and i ...
well , i guess that 's all water under the bridge , huh ?
well , uh , desiree was back in twn , and i said to myself ,
old wood burns brghtest ,
that 's très continental .
it 's so interesting seeing the kind of girl ned married .
well ...
a funny thing happened out in the lab tody ...
we 're so different , yu and i. i 'm the gay , irrepressibl madcap flitting from flower to flower , and you 're the nice , sensible little homemaker .
n'est-ce pas ?
the wonderful thing about betsy is , she combines beauty with brains 
i think betsy 's sweet .
i think she 's jst as sweet as she can be 
you know , i do n't think you realize hw lcky you are .
i had to go thrugh three marriages before i realized that ned was the kind of man i was looking for all alng .
h , s that so ?
sometimes i get all choked up insid thinking of it .
imagine going all th way to the ther side of the world whn the bluebird of happinss was here all along .
oh , i 'm sorry , desiree .
yes .
poor , brave child .
what do you man ?
there 's no reason to prtend with us .
what 's it to you ?
it so happens i have just been made
that 's terribly kind of you , and very flattering .
now , let 's have n foolish pride .
just a minute , ned .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like a chance to express myself 
ned i did nt say i ws going to take the position .
that is an absurdly old-fashioned attitde .
culd i have an onion instead of an olive this time ?
excuse me .
h .
if i 'd married him , i wuld have just spoiled him rotten .
you should n't take it this way , brainard .
after all , what are friends for ?
here we go .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do n't wish to pry , but may i inquire wht this mrvelous new discovery is ?
it 'll effect people all over the world 
may i ask how it works ?
i bombard the clouds with a technique
i am not at th moment at liberty to divulge .
oh , i see .
biff !
biff !
that is orignal thinking .
humphrey , are you all right 
answer or i 'll blast you to ribbons .
nobody in here bt us chickens 
dinner 's ready when you are 
fin .
flubber gas has a certain antagnizing effect on the atmsphre .
yeah ?
and today i 'm really going to stir it up .
like that big , fat cloud out thr .
come on , humph .
let 's get suited up .
will you stop worrying so much 
well , why could nt yo test the suit with a chimpanzee ?
thy need it there too .
switch on .
all right , here we go .
now ...
cry a little .
maybe we 're going to have a change in the weather , dear .
yes .
just nothing .
well , you ca n't blame betsy .
no !
i just do n't see how you can bring yourself to sell it .
let 's se .
there 's 40 , 60 ...
brokn wndows ?
sr , captain .
sure .
hanson  kelly !
somebody answer me !
i hear water !
we 're just gettin ' th car washed .
no , no , no !
we do n't pay off on that !
read th small print !
hold on .
now look .
and that goes for all of ya !
absolutely nothing .
you can come out now , charlie .
well , charlie , maybe  was wrong .
it wo n't be the first tm we 've struck out , will it ?
hey , where do we put this stuff ?
ur test site s over here .
what 's the big secret ?
you 'll find out soon enough .
rainmakers hav always rn into that sme old snag .
wait a minute , charlie .
or could it ?
now , this must have ntegrated the vaporific forces and promoted the coalescence of the interatomic junctures .
poor lamb .
oh , yes .
hugs and kisses .
arrivederci .
well , that puts the tin hat on it !
gt , dh .
we 've made our own cloud !
and it 's raining !
oh , my notes .
now i know how those texas oil fellas feel when a gusher comes in .
where 's my pen 
hey , come on , biff .
yu know , this is nt the frst time we 've been roped in on some half-baked idea of yours .
you know , it was n't my idea entirely 
the professor 's in on ths too .
just as good as .
'cause if the prof says it 's okay .. rining yu know it 's raining
betsy !
betsy !
betsy , i made a cloud , and i made it rain .
out of th moisture in the air around us .
well ...
speaking of things going on under our noses , have you ben seeing desiree d la roche ?
i may have bumpd nto her a couple of times .
she phoned a while ago , mentioned somthing about a little get-together tomorrow night .
said tht you 'd know all about it .
why , i have n't the ...
wait a minute .
there was some talk about a party .
ha !
 was on my way home from class , and she just happened to be driving by ...
what 
if i was n't such a sweet , nnocent-minded little wife ,
mary lee ...
do me  persnal favor and stop calling that woman a girl 
well , anyway , underneath all that glamour and gaiety and intelligence is really a smple  kind-hearted person .
betsy , i hate to say this , bt i 've noticed a change in you lately .
it all seemed to start th night that sneak shelby ashtn came over and here offered you that job .
i told you i did n't want that job , but i 'm beginning to chang my mind .
betsy , are yo going somewhere ?
if t were n't for that , i 'd know xactly what to do .
ys  i 'm going somewhere where i can think clearly .
think clearly ?
desire does n't mean anything to me , betsy .
well , you should 've heard her on the phone when she thought she was talking to you .
but , betsy , that 's just her way .
ned , i 'm going to the daggetts ' for a few days .
betsy .
betsy , you ca n't go anyplace .
i dd n't do anything to it .
pleas , betsy , ca n't we reason this out ?
but , betsy , you 're not being very logical about this .
ready , humph ?
oof !
who 's in there ?
tht 's it .
 quit .
look , after all you ve been through  you 're not gon na turn chicken .
you 'd better answer it , mrs. daggett .

why does n't somebody pick up that phone 
is this the , uh , daggett residence ?
ja .
new maid , by golly .
oh .
well , hulda , may i speak to mrs. brainard , plese ?
she invited mny parties .
very popular , i thnk .
oh ?
friendless , hungry .
there 's nothing to eat in the house .
i think i hang up now 
as far as she 's concerned , i could starve to death .
there must be something to eat in this house .
dandy .
sorry , charlie .
mmm .
there 's just not a thing in the house .
trick or treat .
except these choclates .
yes , we do .
hey , that 's some crazy rdator cap th professor 's got there .
well , science marches on , but not on an empty stomach , huh ?
grat !
yeah !
oh , i 'm srry , prof , but the hot water bottles did n't work , and we had to blow every cent we hd on th scuba suit .
god , i wish we were invitd to one of those hlloween partis around here .
i bet they got lots of eats .
now , let 's see .
help me get that old trunk off of the shelf , huh ?
but how bot humph and me ?
just a littl something in case i get hungry later .
two longs and a short .
i 'll get it .
boo !
trick or treat !
well , we do n't want any trcks around here , do we ?
here 's some nice popcorn .
oh  boy !
popcorn !
potato chips .
i like potato chips !
i want a drumstick .
jiggers 
thre 's a tub of martinis in hre , nd everybody 's bobbing for olives .
it 's just terrific that you broght your saxophone 
oh , well ..
boys , i 'd like you to meet the finest saxophone player in the history of medfield high school .
now go on , nuzzie .
play .
it 'll be just like old tims .
well  if you fellas do n't mind .
the same sweet clwn .
i 'm so glad to see that girl hs n't changed you .
a bit of gaiety will do you good .
good evening .
god venng , sir .
good evening , mdam .
he 's so helpless all by himself .
hello , frederick .
may i take your coat , madam ?
betsy !
excuse me , plase !
btsy !
what in the world are you doing here ?
i might ask the same thing of you .
well , i was .
but there is an instinct calld self-presrvation  you know .
under certain conditions even the lwest form of animal life will go searching for food .
look , neptne  why do n't you just submerge ?
you see , brainard , you 've already spoiled the party for her 
now why do n't you leave betsy alone ?
ashton  if you do n't stay out of this ...
some kind of  peasant , are n't yu ?
wait , betsy ...
come on , nuzzie .
i did n't want to hrt you .
as the poet says , the hurt is not s dep as a wll ,
nor so wide as  church door ,
but 't is nough , 'twill serve .
i 'm sorry , shlby .
okay , charlie .
oh , say , captain , we want to thank you again for this new prowl car .
do n't worry , captain .
officer !
it 's that fiend , brainard !
he 's up there  somewhere !
bright and early , professor .
mr. hawk !
plate glass in stores , automobile windshields , bottles , clock faces , glass of every kind and description began to break and shatter n various portons of our community .
as you se , they formed a pattern , a sort of coneshaped pattern of devastation , as though some unsen force had fnned out from one beginning point , at a place on the corner of maple and ltchfield .
now , i may be wrong , professr , but is n't that the precise point on which i m standing at this very moment ?
but utside of making me feel good all over , what would it get me ?
no , the point is , i 'm not sore at you at ll , professor .
whle everybody else is busy making things , you come up with the nswer .
you come up with smething tht breaks things !
we replace it wth new glss .
it breaks .
mr. hawk , you do nt seem to understand 
how about that united nations building in new yrk ?
mr. hawk , you do n't for ne minute think
i 'd go along with a scheme like that  do you ?
well , what are you acting so high and mighty about ?
look , professor , why do n't you just settle for what you got here ?
with the money from this thing we 'll both get fat .
nd there 'll be enough left over for you to tke care of the medfield problem .
sve medfield college ?
tht kind of money would never help medfield college or anyone else , mr. hawk .
well , yu know what you 're doing , do n't you ?
and before this day is ovr i 'll be back here with the sheriff .
and w 'll have this place tied up tghter than fort knox !
with all your work and all your experiments !
and as for medfield , a year from now , peopl will have forgotten there ever was such a pnk little college .
out of the way  son .
you 're a little overdue on my allownce .
why , i 'm just liabl to send you off t jail with this criminal here , as  fellow conspirator , a partner in crime !
professor , yu mean you 'r gon na help us ?
maybe th college wo n't be here next year , but we 're going to see tht nobody ever forgets it .
come on  humph !
let 's hustle into it !
will you forget about that ?
the prfessor 's with us now !
the first team s comng into the gam !
bff , biff .
let 's take t easy for a minute .
i just think there mght be a more effective way of using it .
boy , just think , 70-yard kicks , 90-yard passes !
are you cracking up ?
so , we never throw just the ball , we throw the player with the ball .
right !
that 's right .
humphrey , it 's just simple logic .
with th flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless , or buoyant , and then we throw you with the ball .
you do ?
do n't you see the beuty of it ?
even if they intercept , we still have possession of the ball .
right !
rght , humphrey ?
uh , rght 
poor old mdfield !
see them run !
well , ladies and gentlemen , here we are in the little community of medfeld .
say what you will about their football team , at least the weather here is good .
 'm afraid we ca n't promise you mch .
mghty rutland niversity , untied , unscored upon for the past three seasons , knocking t the door of the national championship pitted tonight against puny medfield .
oh !
wait 'll i get my hands on those two !
coach !
oh , good , good .
so go ahead wthout us 
steady .
best wishes !
h !
and at fullback position for rutland , hjalmar woccskyinska , a 240-pound husky from broken jaw , idaho .
back home during his smmer vacations ,
hjalmr runs a training school for prison guards .
well , here come the lambs to the slaughter .
come on , medfield !
second quartr , rutland 's ball , first and ten .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
hut four !
sir , we 're never gon na get this thing ready in time .
if you 'd just rconsider my ida .
what 's that , humphry 
there 's flubber gas in here .
well , s i do n't hve t wear this suit .
instead , we give the good ole football a shot of gas , and then zzshhhh 
humphrey .
we 've been through all that .
with this new valve you have perfect buoyancy control at ll times .
we got ta gt out of here .
what 's wrong , biff ?
my father .
pop walked in to get the sheriff who was his dinner there , and i overheard them talking .
thn they went over to judge murdock 's .
w 'll have t fix the suit in the locker room .
look out !
he 's gettng away !
ladies and gentlemen , i 'm afraid t 's going jst the way we predicted .
mighty rutlnd is shredding the little medfield team to bits .
well  he must be here someplace .
you two get the rest of the boys and spread out !
look , i do n't mind losing the football game , professor ashton , bt spare us your garbled quottions .
you 're not expecting nyone , re you , betsy ?
thank you .
you 're winning .
it 's a mssacr , coach .
yeah , ai nt it a shame .
we should have brought long the girls ' volleyball team .
we could have sent them in .
everything s okay , sir .
where 'v you ben , hawk ?
and what 's all this static about a secret wepon ?
you 're the secret weapon ?
it 's not fir .
it 's not fair .
come on , boy .
let 's mop up the field with 'em .
way to go , humphry !
come on !
and forget your manners !
and there gos th try for th extra pint .
it 's good .
i tell you , that medfield touchdown was certainly a surprise .
george , what kind of play would you say that was ?
uh ...
now we ll see what happens 
hut one !
hut tw !
hut three !
what happened to me ?
wht happened to you , clod ?
well , now .
did you see how that happened there , george ?
uh , well , it ...
here h comes !
catch him !
upsy-daisy !
down !
hut one 
of !
here s a rule book .
you find it !
well , ladies and gntlemen , i guss yo know by now , we are witnessing one of the wildest , slm-bang football games ever played nywhere at any time .
rutland fumbles !
medfield 's got the ball again .
hut two !
hike !
the ball s snapped to hmphrey .
now hawk has humphrey .
get off the playing ' fild .
take it easy , huh ?
well , it 's a rac against time now .
medfild trails rutland by nine points 
with less than for minutes left to play  the big question s can rutland stop medfield 's brillint aerial attack ?
h , it looks as if rutland may have something up their sleeve .
i 've never sen 'em use this kind of defens before .
down !
hut one !
hut two !
nw , remember , you guys , the old ldy with a twist on two 
ready ?

hut two 
biff !
biff !
medfield calls time out .
they 're back on their own two yard line with eight secnds left to ply .
well , if you 'd jst let me use my needle , we 'd hve won easy .
well , it is n't doing us ny good back at the lab .
well , like i said , i never did trust this crummy suit .
humph 
there may be time for one more play .
repeat , 98 yards .
too bad .
it 's gaining altitude .
and there goes the final gun as the game ends and medfield wins .
the ball , the ball is still going up ...
up ...
up ...
george , did ya see that ?
oh , shut up !
well , the tral of professor ned branard swung into its third day today 
professor brainard continued t ct as counsel in his own behalf .
he was quoted as saying he was confident in th due procsses of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony against him , as the proscution kept a steady parade f witnesses moving through the witness box , today , the prosecution unlimbred its big guns against the dfnse .
professor brainard , you seem proud of your job as a teacher .
do yo like it because you believe it makes you important ?
bt i believ the work i do is important .
would you care t tell us a lttle about it ?
maybe plant a bug of discovery in their minds , or ...
and you think tht 's important ?
one of those young people might discover something the entire world has been looking for 
he might not , but i like to feel that i had a part in giving him a crack at it .
i see .
now , regardless of whether you are fund guilty or not ,
would you continue as before 
wold you recklessly incite the young minds of your class gain ?
i put the question to you gain , professor  and i ask you to mark well yor answer .
would y still persst n these dangerous and malicious follies ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , falling har , even fer of mr. hawk .
we find our self apologizing , hiding our heads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog day only came once a year in this country .
now , i see a lot of students from my science class hre in the courtroom .
they may not be the most studious group of young people in college tody , but i 'll say this for them , so fr they are unafraid .
i have high hops for them .
am i to understand , professor , yu actually encourage mistakes in your class ?
suppose you are returned to your rol as a teacher , would you do exactly as you did before ?
yes .
you may step dwn .
come on .
let 's tie this thing up and get out f here .
15 or 20 mnutes should do it .
in that case , i will sum up briefly .
may i suggest , professor , as defense consel , you 're not doing much in your own behalf .
i 'm a witness for the dfense , your honor .
both objectons overruled .
but , your honr , this is most unusual procedure .
it is also unusual procedure for the defens to have no witnesses in his own behalf .
swear n the witness , please 
my time s your time , mr .
do you solemnly swear to tell th truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?
elizabeth brinard .
will the defense queston the witness ?
no , your honor .
as i was saying , my name s elizabeth brainard .
he scratched my fender in the parking lot just outside the dministration building .
on october 30th of this year ,
i told him i did n't think i was cut out to be a scientist 's wife 
well , i 'd like to nform the defendant at this time that i was wrong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
of course , she means it .
oh , betsy .
yr honr , will you excuse th witness at this time ?
the defndant always said he loved me in midnight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does all ths , uh , foofaraw have ny bearing on the disposition of the case ?
you bet , your honor .
i do nt believe it .
tht is , if you d n't mind wasting the time .
gangway !
gangway , everybody !
i do n't wish to pry , but would yo kindly divulge your ntentions ?
the court is waiting .
i 'm sorry , your honor .
may i ask that this witness be recalld to testify for me ?
vry well .
mst w subject urselves to irrelevant testimony trumped up by the defense ?
th witness is qualified .
but your honor ...
i 'm the county agricultural agent , that 's who i am .
oh , yes , yes .
i certainly did .
and you were very pset .
so much so that you decided to investgat the matter thoroughly .
well ,  did n't come here to toast marshmallows , you know .
now , mr. allen ...
first , would you mind telling us about the soil cnditions here in medfield cunty ?
medfield county has the thinnest , rockiest , wore-out , farmed-out  pooped-out soil in the whole state .
i 've been so shamed .
it 's not much good for growing things .
wait , i 'll show you something .
that s an ear of corn .
a radish !
if yo want to se something really miserable ...
somebody put ...
t 's arund here somewhere ...
uh , that 's fine , mr. allen .
why , everywhere i look , everything is suddenly all fertiled up !
oh , i do n't ...
he can call it anything he wants .
i think that you 've invented ..
is it anything like taking a dry bath , or going for a dry canoe ride ?
you see , professor brinard 's rays must have combined with massive amounts of ntrgen out in the atmosphere , see ?
why , for all we know , it might be dryraining right down in this courtroom this very minute , fertilizing evrything in sight !
you ca n't tell , you know .
do you expect this court to believe all this mumbo jumbo 
can you substantiate it ?
oh , my goodness !
come on !
tht 's right , boys !
look at those carrots , judge !
boys !
do n't push !
yur wife says to get home right away .
a summer squash just rolled off the vine next door and smashed your sports car !
the jurors will please sit down !
thank yo vry , very , very much , judge .
you should try some of this walnt .
oh , yes , yes .
i leave t to you ...
case dismissed .
do n't tak it so hard .
as  mattr of fact , i 'm crazy abot it , but ..
offhand , can you name one thing that science has n't improved upon , one way or another ?
oh 
i guess i 'll hav to go along with that .
this is my home , the great karoo desert .
i 'm not even born yet .
surviving in these prts is n't easy .
you need to be tough and flexible .
that 's why we built this enclosure .
them being everyone who is n't us .
i got it !
it 's time .
it 's happening it 's hppening !
watch out .

like mama .
khumba , oh .

i 'm nothing lke dad .

they say that the first zebras to walk the earth all had exactly the same skin with no stripes at all .
mm-hmm .
all the other zebras admired his beautiful skin  and he was proud to be so different .
 think i know 
they all looked the same .
whoa .
how are you today ?
uh ..
feeling different , peculiar , left out , hving trouble fitting in ?
well , i ...
you wnt more stripes , but you think there 's no way in the world you could get more stripes .
of course i m right .

bettr than nothing ?
a herd of giant wldebeest .
a pack of crazed ostriches .

mark my words .
i will hunt this creature down to the ends of the world .
there s nowhere h can hide .

it 's to far .

this change stinks .

caitlyn :

you 're all my friends , and i adore you .
hey , guys .

and i do n't blame you .
i mean , citlyn crisp is no more miss perfect than i am a ...
who are yu ?
okay .
dude , that s , uh , stewart 's uncle .
he still thinks you 're a vampire .
it is not wise t ignore me , creature .
what ar you talking about ?
this whole not really beng a vampire thing just is n't sticking with you , is it ?
i am coming down .
bloodsucker 
ah !
with such speed and agility , how can you claim to not be a vampire ?
i 'm the ral deal , and i 'm real dangerus .
so i 'd advis you not to challenge me .
give up now 
arm yourself !
okay .
ah !
you know that there 's nly one way to render a vampire powerless .
exactly .
and i accept yor challenge .
on the count of three .
you fought bravely , human 
i see .
there 's humanity , even in the undead .
i will spare your life .
i will spare his life !
vi !
i forgot vi !
well , maybe .
but i 'm thnking you 're probably blamng me for all of this , and that you might actually hit me .
that 's true .
so cool .
yeah .
you 're not even my type .
both :
you 're welcome .
now this is my scene .
hold on tight
all aboard on ths endlss ride
so mayb
i m not the colest guy in the world , but who cares .
and they all seem to like th real davs .
that 's pretty col to me .
nd just to treat yo fair and square , we 're paying double wages and a bonus , from frisco to shanghai and back , all found .
tell 'em what yu saw  bll .
and it came a-bellerin ' out of the night , with one big eye like a lighthouse .
we 're stoved nto starboard .
and then it come up amidships .
and brke our backs and snk s .
and it s a miracle old billy 's alve today .
tell 'm about ts teeth , billy .
you mind answering a few questions ?
monsters interest me .
all kinds .
boiled down for his oil , lads , there 'd be free grog for all hands , if you can swallow it on top of his tall yarns ..
thre !
stop it !
com on , casey 
this is no place for a clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie !
do n't bother unloading .
this is ridiculus 
we just hav t get to saigon .
halfway around the world from paris , and now this happens .
except pack and unpack .
oh , professor ?
i 'm from the bulltin .
these gentlemen ar from the globe and the post .
we 're interested in your opinion of this monster .
professor , what does the ntinal museum in paris think about it ?
i can not answer that .
we heard this expedition of yurs was to gather facts bout the monster .
i 'm afraid you were misinformed .
why do n't you ask a fish ?
do n't you print tht .
you do not deny then that such a monster could exist .
is that correct ?
thank you , professr .
look at this drawing .
i knew it .
by professor arronax of the paris national museum .
why , this is the most far-fetched nonsense yet .
far-fetched ?
you 're not srious , professor ?
oh , i do n't mean flyng off with a ship in its mouth .
but the general size ...
i 'm nt a reporter .
may i come in ?
thank you 
would you accept ?
i would be interested , yes , naturally .
why..
i think the honour is ours .
as th foremost uthority on the sea and it 's mysteries , you can be an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it concerns the monster .
very much s .
according to the ppers , you seem to believe the rumours .
no .
yes , i 'm afrid i ws misquoted .
however , i have an open mind n the subject .
we accept .
good 
if you do n't mind , i 'd lik yu to cme downstairs and meet captain farragut .
he 's in command f th warship upon which yu 'r siling .
every man aboard was on the lookout , and the watch was kept day and night .
captain farragut left nothing to chance 
with tradtional thoroghness , the navy plan was to cut the south pacific into squares and search each square .
false larms were common , and they did n't help our morale .
our hopes began to wane .
it came as no surprse ... when captain frragut on the night of dcember 8 , 1868 , summoned s to the wr room .
gentlemen , i believe my obligation to ths legend hs been dispatched .
it does n't seem to me we have proved anything one way or the other  captain .
we 'll set you ashore in saigon .
cheer up , professr .
i thought they promised you a bonus if you harponed this monster  mr land .
knowing full well i could n't cllect it 
when i get back , i 'm shipping out on the first whaler that 'll take me .
you scare me .
be a good lser , professr .
what a pity , professr .
i know you had visions of that monster munted in the national musum .
'bout the flapping fish and the grls i 've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
met her dwn in madagascar
sh would kiss me
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whal of a tale , and it 's all true
there was typhoon tessie
mt her on the cast of java
blow me down and pick me up
she was the captain 's wife
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tle , and it 's all true
thre was harpoon hannah
if i kissed her
and held her tenderly
a whale of  tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
ahoy !
ship off the starboard bow 
aye ay , sir .
i 'm thinking she went down with all hands .
what could have set it off , though ?
you meaning the monstr , ai n't ya , mate ?
ay !
it might be the monster .
sure  it 's the monster !
it is the monster !
pipe down on dck !
 must insist , professor , that you keep these fish stries to yurself .
there 's the monster !
look alive there !
get your range and fire .
well , hit her in th heels .
aye aye , sir .
run her out smartly .
she 's turning !
stand by to lower away .
profssor !
hey , do n't leave us !
help !
they can not help .
but they must !
help !
i 'm getting numb all over .
look , professor .
there 's somethng over there .
i do n't know .
it loks lik th monster .
a submarne boat .
but , this is incredible .
men have dreamed about such miracles .
you know something ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahy !
it seems deserted .
i think we are asking for truble , professor .
mayb somebody will come up .
no .
if we wait , this thing is liable to sink undr us .
why , it 's as bright as day .
ther is great genius behnd all this .
yes , nd great evil .
do n't forget this is an ngine of destructon .
is anybody aboard ?
wait .
look at this 
give me  hand with this line , mate .
anybody lse get off ?
ys , the profssor is down below .
well , he really got his mnster , did n't he ?
i 'm not anxious to get in their company myself .
my sentiment exactly 
big 
i 've never seen a barge lik this before 
hey , this looks like the galley .
cook 's day off , too .
professor .
professor .
professor .
professor , where are yu ?
hell .
i 'm in here 
what is it ?
you know , ned land is here with a bat .
that tall one must be the leader .
they 'll be comng back any moment .
get away !
help 
help !
search the boat .
you are from the warship that attacked me , are you nt 
this is ned land , master hrpooner .
you may remain .
i did not invite you here .
you came as an enemy t destroy me .
they 've done no harm .
do n't blame us because the warship shelled you .
the sea shall have you back .
easy , mate 
i 'm not what is called a civilised man , professor .
but i am as guilty as they are .
i will grant yo that both of them and me , to , enlisted to track down what we thought t be a monster .
but , in that case , w are no more guilty than the rest of the world .
yo 've carried your work as far as terrestrial science permits .
the real stry of the ocean depths begins where you left off , wonders that defy my powers of description .
the secrets that are mine alone , bt which  would be willing to share with you .
at the expense of my companions ' lives ?
i 'm sorry .
then i can not accept .
professor , i regret your choice .
take him up !
and secure for sea 
ay  sir .
all sttons ready !
prepare for diving .
ys , sir .
prepare for diving .
ahead slow .
trim your forward ballast .
wht abut the other one ?
i found ot what i wanted to know .
there .
come in , gentlemen .
be seated , plese .
professr .
i 'd like to express our gratitude , captain .
we are grateful to be live .
i want none of your gratitude .
you 're ll on the strictest probation , and i 'd dvise you not to attempt escape .
yu understand your position ?
i guess that makes us a little bit of both .
 tolerate no guests aboard the nautlus , and yu already know the fate of prisoners .
th food is delicious , is n't it , professor ?
oh , very good .
i 'm indifferent to 'm .
thes dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen .
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppose this is n't lamb , then 
yes , my cook excels in preparing these vrious products .
well , just the main course .
the cream is , of course , milk from the giant sperm whale .
saute of unborn octopus 
since we re nearing the island of crespo , you 'll have an opportunity of selecting your own food .
for a brief hunting expedition .
wll , that suits me fine .
when d w start , mate ...
almost immdiately .
delightful smke .
havana ?
i am still curios as to the reason you spared our lives .
i may have use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaced ?
it comforts me to know that your life was not too dar a price to pay for the love of your fellow man .
at the moment , i do n't intnd that you should .
we 're almost at the island of crspo .
all ths was once an island .
i knew there 'd b a catch to this .
seems you ca n't do anything on this bot without getting wet .
hey !
wait a minute .
where you going with this ?
an expedition from the natilus .
it 's a new xperence for them 
thy 'll learn quickly .
i 'll introduce them to you .
captin nemo and i were not alone .
an underwater larder filled to overflowing , and all captain nemo for the taking 
ballast ?
ballast !
ned , you forget yourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. lnd .
why did you do it ?
ask him .
that was scientific interest .
i had no idea he was after treasur .
oh , no ?
we must n't quarrel among orselves .
we must stay together .
it 's our only chance .
chance ?
you want to play a waiting game , hoping to lern nemo 's secrets .
i believe we owe the wrld that mch , ned .
hav you  better plan ?
 want to get off .
of course i do n't mind going with my pockets full .
and do n't call it stealing , because that 's the way he got it .
if we could take this thing over , we 'd be rich .
i 'd have a ship of me own , and you would n't have to be starving on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me with those soft-boiled eggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them when that chest busted .
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win the captain 's confidence , but i need tim , and  need yur help .
all right .
it is the best way , belive me .
trivialities .
nonsense .
that depends on your pint of view .
i just think that ned vlues his life above scientific achievement .
tday we encountered a fearsome storm .
an ordinary vessel would have sufferd heavy damage .
a whale of a tale that 's true
at my hst 's invitatin , i inspected the shp .
we went to the very heart f the vessel , the propulsion unit .
this secret alone gave him mastery of the sea 
and in a sngle stroke , harness power beyond the wildest dreams of scince .
or destroy it .
with seeming indfference ,
as i studied hm ,
i became awre that powerful forces were at work within this strange man .
think of it .
on the surface , there is hunger and fear .
men still exercise unjust lws .
they fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few fet beneath the waves  their reign ceses , their evil drowns .
here i am free .
far btter that they think there 's a monster and hunt me with harpoons .
after travelling 10,000 leagues under the sea ,
i felt at long last i was to have my answer .
the prison camp of rorapandi , the white man 's grave .
but i thought it hd been abolished .
what is in those sacks they are carrying ?
nitrates and phosphate for ammunition , the seeds of war .
they 're loading a full cargo of death , and when that ship takes it home  the world will die a little more .
i was onc one of those pitiful wretches you see down there .
lok at it again , professor .
i do n't want you to forget what you 've seen here today .
it sounds remote .
it was there that w built the nautilus .
you will have the privilege of seeing all this firsthand .
when our mission is completed , the nautilus is going home .
they 're getting up steam , sr .
very god .
that ship that flies no flag sails wth the tide 
you have your orders 
i said go below !
collision speed , full !
profssor ?
are you all right ?
all those men , they did n't even have a chance .
ned , do n't .
damage report , sir .
we 'll make temporary reprs here .
i askd you to leave , professor 
why ?
you are not only a murderer .
well , i see murder , too !
there are the assassins  the dealers in death .
i am the avenger .
is murder a right reserved fr that hated nation that has taken everything from me ?
they tried .
they cast me into prison , and when they failed ...
what yu fail to understand is the power of hate .
i was just trying to tidy up .
bout what ?
well , i believe things have gone far enough .
murder mens nothing to him .
it is not yr plac to judge .
you do n't know anything about the captain .
now , please go out and leave m lone .
what did you call me ?
captain ?
yes ,  did 
seen enough ?
did the professor pt you up to this 
you bet i was right .
and i was right about you spying on me .
w may need it .
we ?
since when do i ned you ?
i wan na be friends .
i want to escape .
so do i , with you .
you once said you had a plan .
well ?
trouble is , it wo n't work .
i ca n't figure how they navigate this barge .
no courses , no bearings , nothing .
if w could fgure whre we 're hading , we 'd have a chance .
that 's no problem .
vulcania !
aye , sir .
keep your ye peeled for th mate .
ned , put them bck .
he 's coming .
that was close , mate .
maybe ...
nd , let 's get out of here .
get me a pencil nd paper quck .
i think i found something .
yes ?
see ?
all the distnces are msured from that point .
it must be .
get me those calipers , quick .
quiet .
here .
have a cigar .
hey , she likes 'em !
you want another ?
be quiet !
i 'm nt playing !
b a nice girl .
lt 's go .
resume speed at 50 fathoms .
 've got to d some research .
what kind ?
well , ned , you 've got everything here , from the rarest nudibranchs to oysters .
i want the bottles .
you ca n't do that .
these are priceless .
why , that went out with robinson crusoe .
that 's for spying ' on me .
do nt let me ctch you padding the shadow of my stern again .
remember that .
i do n't like bashing ' anybody  but you hd it comin ' , lad .
and i thought we were friends .
sure we re friends !
hit me .
hit me 
you mean that ?
you ca n't miss t .
oh , all right , shipmate !
t 's priceless .
anyhow ... hold this  lad .
well , they had plenty of time on their hands , so they began writing ' notes , puttin ' 'em in old rum bottles and setting ' 'em adrift .
i swallowed it .
there was  flabellina oculina in ther .
astern , full !
we seem to have run aground .
an accident , captain ?
the tide will float us fre by evening .
would you like to g ashore ?
the last time we went ashore , t was a prlude to murder .
ay , sir .
throwin ' away a chance like that .
the professor 's losin ' his ballast .
dry land , mate .
nd so would the professor .
me ?
i 'm a collecting ' fool 
there 's no harm in asking .
and i can row , sr 
got a strong back .
i 'm no dserter 
happy to be aboard , sr .
very wll .
permisson granted 
thank you .
the natives are cannibals .
brak out the skiff .
shove off !
take it easy .
hey , ned .
hey !
come here , quick .
a trail through the jungle .
you had this in mind all the time .
i figured that .
i ca n't get through that jungle .
you 'll go faster alone .
we 'll be laughing about ths , havn ' a drink together in frisco .
good luck , nd .
hey !
hey !
wait for me !
hey !
hey ... cannibals !
scores of boats !
naturally .
they 're coming abard , captain .
get me  harpoon , quick .
this is amzing .
hey , captain , that 's one way to keep guests from droppin ' in .
a mild charge of electrcity , mr. land .
not very hospitable , but harmless .
and spekng of hospitality , may i say you have abused mne for the last time .
you 've cntinuously disobeyed my orders .
who , me ?
i told yu once the fate of prisoners .
i have no choice but to oblige you .
what 's this all about ?
the only reason you only came back is because the natives forced you to .
you 're going to regret that choice , mr. land .
when we clear this reef , i 'll see you trouble my existence no longer .
put him undr guard below .
take him below .
we must break free of the reef .
aye , sir .
lighten ship and drop all ballast 
get below 
lt me out of ths ..
professor 
a wrship , professor .
we 're breaking ut !
let us out !
wait !
break out a spare shaft !
put the aft end under the lek .
take up the slack .
we ve gone too deep .
make braces !
braces in place , sir !
the air will clear now that the fans are operating again .
are you all right ?
have w stopped sinking ?
frtuntely .
we 're deeper now than man hs ver been before .
emergency speed , all engines !
full rpellent charge !
prepare another charg .
sorry , sir .
then we shall have to fight on the surface .
you 'll be fighting at close qurters with the most tenacious of all sea beasts 
stay clar of the tentacles 
they 'll seze anything within reach and hang on to the death .
the only vital spot is directly between the eys .
forty feet and surfacing , sr .
stand by .
stand back !
quick !
the forward hatch !
give me a harpon !
throw me another iron !
watch it !
your hand !
well ,  'll be ..

we do n't want none of his gratitude !
wrap yourself up god .
i do nt want you to catch cold .
my apprentice tells me yo have taken my jornal .
may i ask why ?
i might have expected you t say tht .
actually , he regrets saving my life as much as i would regret savng his .
the only differnce is that i wuld n't have tried .
then it is that difference that gives ned land a human dignity you no longer possess .
i know yo were deply touched by ned 's gesture , but yu are ashamed to admit it .

and yo are a very gllible man , professor .
gullible ?
what he wuld do one day , he would gladly undo the next .
to be of benefit , godness must be constant , forever building .
you will never find it .
if men and ntions had this goodness that  speak of ,
hav you considred sharing it ?
i had hoped that you would be the key to a plan i had in mind 
i had intended using you as an emissary .
but nw i do n't know .
is it that you do n't trust me ?
but you are ever the optimst .
do you really believe thy would lay down thir arms and abolish their slave camps ?
enough energy to lift mankind from the depths of hell int heaven ... or dstroy it .

just something so quiet
no magical change
the first time it happens , you know
and so you fall
and for each moment that it lasts
how simpl , how rare
and just when you thought
and though you feel much more
than you dare to show
the first time you see her
no magical change
no dreams to arrange
the first time it happens , you know
what a great number !
nicky ?
for the first time
a-ha !
the moment t happens
then suddenly there s a whole new world
the first time it happens
you know

your aunt has no imagination .
oh , i lov rost chcken !
did you ever hear of sour stomach ?
wait 'til tomorrow .
praise him above ye hevenly host
they trust t nothing but a shadow .
but bear testament .
death cmes unexpectedly !
i ntended to take effectual care , but death came unexpectedly ... like a thief , outwitting me , too quck for me .
nw the great king of heaven and erth ... will abolish and annihilate this pride !
will crush the hardened wretch ... of the pollted nfinite abomination , and rain on him ... a delge of fire and brimstne !
where are the great leviathans who defied god then ?
where is their courage , these , thes , these , these proud spirits ?
now , isaiah has warned us , on the day of vengeance , the earth shll be laid to waste 
the raven and screch owl shall dwell in it .
yea , he can lay the earth to pieces in one moment ... or shatter the whole unvrse with ne stroke of his fiery sword !
how dreadful is the state of those who ar in daly danger of this great wrath  this abyss of death and despair .
there is no security for the wicked ... because there are no visible signs of death at hnd !
the arrows of death fly unseen as noonday 
god has mny different unsearchable ways of taking the wicked from this world .
calm in your knowledge of health , secure in your well-being .
yes , death comes unexpectedly !
i thought the reference to jremiah at the finish was very effective .
did n't you , mrs. ford ?
i ca n't deliver the message with syrup .
your voice is gd 's instrument and should b usd accordingly .
he sur sermonizes something fierce , does n't he ?
brimstone and damnation on top of ham and eggs !
the one day a week we have off .
ooh  i just hate them !
breakfast still a ht ball in our stomachs , and him chewing our ears off from that pulpit !
we get to have roast chicken , though .
wht is all this glad busness you talk about ?
a game my father taught me .
helps what ?
that reverend !
go away .
folks just hate the coming of snday because of him .
that 's true .
here it comes- miss goody two-shos .. is gon na find something about sunday to be glad about .
if you knew how to play the game , then you culd find something to be glad about too 
well  there 's always somthing .

you 're still as opinionatd as ever .
lots of meetings and civic duties and oblgations .
it 's a poor substitute for what 's really wrong with you .
would you like to be paid for your diagnosis ?
there 's n medical term for it .
you can give everything but lov .
it 's as simpl as that .
mum ?
i found them dry again today .
yes , mum .
like water off a duck 's back to hr .
that woman 's got no feelings at all .
a lot of foolish nonsense .
hi , dear .
what 's the matter ?
oh , nothing .
is the bazar off ?
you would nt understnd .
is it because of aunt polly ?
yes .
it takes a word frm someone who is n't under her thumb .
fat chance you got , ed .
one woman owning a town .
nancy .
that 's right .
what did you say ?
um , i just sad that nobody could own a church .
our scial structure in this small town seems to teeter on a delicate balance , one which i certainly can not n any wy ttempt to influence .
then you 're siding with her by not mentioning it !
i m staying completly out f it , and that 's all thre is to it .
rvernd ford , if you 'll just let us say that you 're in favor .
there s nothng more t discuss .
this is all just mpossible .
i 'm afraid you 're right .
thank you , reverend ford .
you se , i
of course you understand that ... personally i think it 's a good case and all that , and i wish yo luck with it .
she said nbody cold own a church .
hello , dear .
what ar you doing here ?
aunt polly sent me 
uh , something for reverend ford .
t 's a lovely day  is n't it ?
and he sayeth unto them , the wicked shll be punished !
thir poison is like the poison f serpents .
a house divided against itself can not stand .
a kingdom dvided against itself can be brought to desolation .
am i reaching out t you ?
well , week after week , i stand here ... reching out to you , begging you to understand 
the same dissension , the same belligerence , the same feuding ... until you are 10,000 times ... more abominable in the eyes f god ... than the most hatefl , venomous , violent  vicious
h , nothing .
um , i mean , i was looking for yu .
uh , aunt polly sent you this .
uh , i do n't know .
wuld you like someone to practice your sermon on ?
yes , yes  so he was .
uh , do you like being a mnster ?
oh , the way you looked just then reminded me of my father .
onc i saw him sort of sad like that and i asked hm .
and what did he say ?
i suppose every minister of god facs the same problem 
mmm ,  suppose .
no .
just something he read someplace .
it always makes me cross-yed .
when you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it ,
you surely will .
yes , yes , i know .
but i nevr heard that befor .
neither had my father .
and from then on , he was going to look for the good in people .
yes , you knw .
my father called them the glad passages .
you know , the happy ones ... like , um , uh ...
there are 800 happy texts .
and , you know , my father said ,

i thought i told you , or i meant to , or i 'm just old .

not that there 's anything wrong with that .
look , shen , even though it 's  little bit unannounced , we want you to feel welcom .
please stay as long as you want .
how long do you think that 'll be ?
ow !
i think he has to leave soon .
he 's on a mission to visit us .
it 's a chinese thing .
it 's very rude to our guest .
eat .
oh , right , the posters .
yeah , it 's really fascinating but i 'm having  hard time getting the research straight .
perhaps i could help you .
one of my teachrs t gingi temple is a direct descendant of qin shi huangdi  the first emperor of the qin dynasty .
hey 
shen , i would be so grateful if you cold help me understand th history of some of the artifcts .
the exhibit is next week and i hve to get everything rganized .

just because they see m with hm does n't mean they 're not gon na vote for me .

oh , hey , i was practicing that move .

yeah .
the same way dd said it was okay for you to ditch school and go surfing last week .

how did yo do that ?
t 's an ancient american move called , monkey jumps for smarter sister .
come on .
we 've got work to do .
i 've got a song but i ai n't got no melody
i 've got a song but i ai n't got no melody
will it go round n circles ?

come on .
i thought you were to full 
but it 's just when i saw these mooncakes , it was like i was a boy again .
and then i flt guilty tht  grew up turning my back on all of this .
i do n't wan na do that anymore .
you did n't do t alone .

he went from monk to hnk .
here , take one .
everybody was talking about you t school tody .
yes , it was fun .
i 've never wrn anything except that stupid rb .

buddhists say the tiger is the mightiest but it is the chameleon who will endure .
you did it for me  did n't you ?
this is good .
what is name of this taste ?
chocolate .
you 've never had chocolate before ?
well , do n't they have t in china ?
i 'm not sure .
some better than others .
not all yin warriors are memorable .
she almost failed .
that 's why you must trin harder than any of yor ancestors .
i hope s , but you may have to find the strength withn you that i ca n't teach you , or ths may be the end for me and you and everything god .
whoa !
not too much prssure .
let 's talk about something else .
tell m about your girlfriends .
what 's t like beng in lov ?
then why are you with him ?
nother buddhist saying ?
tll you what , since yu like my chocolate cupcakes so mch ,

zenon :

zenon :

oh , my gosh !
there ar so many blips in there .

concentrate 
oh , my gosh , nb , come on 
ther 's one left .
there 's one left .
d n't let it out .
man :
they 're worrid .
something wrong , leutenant 
plank :
zenon :
high five !
someday , we 're actually gn na find out what thes little blips mean .
no , n  i ..
i understand fully .
yeah .
what s wrong ?
i men , it 's not like  expectd that we 'd be together forever .
i 'm not a moron-majr , but  he dumped me !
i 'm not sur how , but she 's down thre , and i 'm p here , and she 's probably been plotting to get gregory to jettison me and pay attentin to her .
it 's just ...
well , look at the upside .
all the time you 'v ben spending zap-padding greg can now be used to take further advantage of your free run of the spay-stay .
zenon , i 'msorry , but after your little incidnt this morning ,
kindlyhandin yourrzrp to my office asap .
and i lost my favorite shoe !
zenon :
yes , i 'm sure you did n't , zenon .
nevertheless !
i firmly believe that the discipline of wrking down here in the alin patrol lab will be good for you .
and truth be told , you 'll be performng a mission of mercy .
your poor friend orion 's been working down here for five full years 
you know how many signals he 's picked up in all that time ?
none !
to assume we are the only units in space ,
i prsonally call t rudeicrous .
now , look , in my hardly humble opinion , bidirectional telemetry is only a matter f time 
come in , cme in .
you know ?
okay .
zenon 's being assigned to a month of threehour evening shifts with a six-hour day n saturdays .
cetus-lupeedus , commander !
you simply need to be hre .
but what if today s silence turns to tomorrow 's thunderous call from the void ?
look , no lie , just last week , i uncovered evidnce of a new planet that may have formed  mere 20 au from gamma pictoris .
yeah , see ?
i got ta gt back to the command deck .
i expect you to report back down here at 1900 hours tonight .
what ?
oh .
uh , okay , you ready for your tour ?
the frst thing you got ta know abot are these bbies .
um , look , if they ever strt rotating at an accelerated sped , y come over here , and you sound the rd alert ...
alien signal ...
alien signal !
alien signl .
alarm clock .
ah , congratulatons , ze , you just survived your first shift .
zenon :
yo 're in comprehension-mode-minor , mom !
well , the month will be over before you know it .
kind of like me and greg .
do n't worry ,  am not s squashed .
protozoa .
butwhtis certain is that since his return frommicrobe 's trmphant concert in space ,
protozoahasnot been seen in public , nor has he been in a recording studio .
cets-lupeedus , he ca n't be doing this !
why is he doing this ?
he s on a break , a vacation , something .
repeat , allhands to the mess hall for an emergency briefing .
look , team , i 'm sorry .
me too .
military ?
yeah , what ...
all right , first they 're sending up a squad to assess the condition and contribution of each module .
following that evaluation  some spac station components could be detached and jettisoned .
plank :
if that occurs , certain personnel might b reassigned to earth , but any speculation in that dirction is ...
are they considering shutting us down altogether ?
to the best of my limited knowledge  bsolutely not .
what ?
right 
plank :
i know it 's hard , but we 're professionals , and if we can just wait for gneral hammond to arrive ,
i think everything will be explained to you .
zenon , i know yor mother has an incredible fer of flying nd an even more acute fear of earth , but any decisions regarding who stays and who goes wo n't be up to me .
but you 're gon na have some kind of opinion , right ?
they do n't even know us .
general hammond and his tam hav arrived in the transport lounge .
all right , have him report to my office .
whenever i have a vital , formidable mission to assign , i look for the best man or young woman for th jb .
whatever you ned , i 'm your girl .
it 's not often someone my ag gets to serve her country under the command of such a noble and gifted leader .
you requst it , i 'm in .
spacewalking , duct crawlng , undercover ops ..
margie ?
margie girl .
since you 've had a long , grueling flight ,
but , daddy , why ?
 'm not in the least bit tired .
hmmond :
all right , all right , i ws just ...
did i mention that gregory sid to say hi ?
are you pancaked 
i 'll survive .
bt up here , you are on my turf .
if daddy 's the commander of your ship , and let s face it ,
i 've got daddy totally wrapped .
no !
i have n't even worn it yet .
it just arrived from the virtul mll this morning .
so if you 're not mondo nice to me ,
bye-ness !
homework lesson b 
she only gets under your skin 'cause you let her , zee .
why so she can call up daddy nd order him to send my family packing ?
whoa .
yeah , but you know what 
it 's not gon na happn to us .
zenon !
voic : zum .
plank 
wht is it ?
you need to rocket over here warp speed .
well , there is a slight spike on the graph , but there could be 100 different reasons for that .
you know , it 's true  ze .
i mean , with every country in the world sending up satellites into space , we 're always picking up interfernce of some kind .
no , it was a very specific and very distinct zum .
look , zee , i 'm the first one to wan na believe you , but there is nothing hre .
all right , h , let 's just go with simpl logic .
for as long as this space station has been in orbt , for as lng as mankind has monitored the skes , no one has ever gotten ven the tiniest indcation that there was any sort of intelligent life out there .
zenon , i assigned you this dty to keep you out of trouble , and that 's all .
you believ me , right , mom 
i bleve you believe you heard something , but it cold 've been a billion things , honey , you know , a computer hiccup , a power surge .
do n't get mad at me fr saying this , but you 've been having a pretty losy few days ,
do n't you think it s possible you could have invented this signal just to pt yourself back in th spotlight ?
dad !
i heard  zum !
got any clls from oter space today , zenon ?
next you 'll b saying an xtraterrestrial ate your homwork .
aw , sounds like too much time alone in that ap lab scrambled your brain .
nebla :
come here  cme hre !
you 've got t see this .
it does n't take disks or anything .
it s wired into a totally unlimited catalog of movies you can upload by hitting a button .
it ven has romeo and juliet on mars .
one and two .
do you wan na com ?
what time is it ?
you ca n't .
you 've got ta go t the ap lab .
would n't wan na miss any calls from your alien pals .
margie , let me just say one thing .
hell , daddy ?
nbula , go watch the move .
okay , see you !
zum .
zum .
hell ?
oh , com on !
is anybody out here ?
something wrong ?
another zm ?
well  kind of , only higher .
zum .
ah , well ,
that is what ur montr alarm sounds like , zenon .
no zum or zum .
but , commander , i ...
hammond :
yu 're not going to believe this 
even thogh the graph spikes clerly indicate nothing more than normal satellite interference ?
in fact , i think it wold be better if w suspended the rest of your assignment up hre .
inanticipationof the tremor-like jolt associated with the separation , allpersonnlshouldreport to designated secre areas at tht time .
where 's my stress helmt ?
as far s i can figure , wyndham and lutz 's sabotage ffort knocked our station ot of its intended orbit .
are we just gon na sit here and tk this ?
what do you propose w do ?
i do nt know , but i 'll think of something .
whn heard from your lips , zee , those ar the most terrifying words in the galaxy .
you see this ?
is n't that more of a reason to fight back ?
this is where w 're meant to be .
i 'm strtng to wonder if we would n't all be bettr off back on earth .
i could marry judy .
i could get a normal job .
cetus-lupeedus , this is not you talking , commander plank .
girl :
my mom says that everybody 's calling her the girl who cried alien .
boy :
you hve to come along .
you 'll love it 
there you are .
i ned you to do my history rport on the stock markt crash of 2006 .
is n't that so fun ?
forget it !
in fact , why do nt you just forget w were ever friends !
nebula :
do you want to laser-zap me for it ?
i 'm sorry .
what 's this really about ?
she 's a pain-major , nb !
you 'v been s caught up in this whol alien thing  i 've hardly even seen yu .
fine , go with her and ride the inky commter pod .
ugh !
i d n't care if they think i 'm a lunatic-major .
they can ridicule me and blame me , but i fully know i 'm right about this .
i wish i 'd never ben sent to that stupid p lab in the first place .
whoa .
i want you to hear something .
but it is .
zum , zum , zum
ar you inferring aliens sent you that ?
why ?
they 're nt trying t contact anyone on the spay-stay .
zoom  zom , zoom♪
i 'm seriously sure that we need to alert plank .
orion !
both plank and hammond so do n't want to hear bout the aliens right now , s i m kind of thinking we should keep this to ourselves .
reporttosecurareas immediately .
thejettisoningof sector seven will begin in one minute .
i think it is rudeicros times 10 how they are just blasting away our home bt by bit .
the way things re going , i half expct to look ot the windw and see  gigndous interstellar wrecking ball .
yu wo nt lsten to me .
you 're so flly inked-out over that silly little fight we had 
we 're bfs fr life !
okay .
be frinds with margie if that 's what you want .
i just want to know how we 're ever gn na get past this if you wo n't tell me what 's truly tweaking you ?
no .
they are .
but , we 're a pair .
why did n't you tell me sooner , neb ?
well , you were so mad at me ,  did n't think yu 'd care .
ths is criss-mde-extreme .
we 'll think of somethng .
wht if those signals were n't really from outer space ?
besides  when you 're as low on the poplar pole as i am , the only way you can go is up .
cn you bliev it ?
zenon :
how am i gon na survive on earth ?
hey , at least it 's not as gaseous as w used to imagine it to be .
the food ...
the food is lunarious .
the second you get there , yu have to order a bacon double-mushroom onion cheeseburger and dedicate it to me .
oh , we understand , believe me .
i wish thos militry clowns had some dea what they were doing to all of us .
woman : attention !
all earth-bound passngers mustnwboardthe shuttle in preparation for departure .
all earth-bound passengers ...
man : 49r , alpha foxtrot .
zenon :
ow !
margie :
about time , houdini .
margie 
are yo tryng to ruin everythng ?
i ca n't believe this .
were you spying on me ?
ugh !
do i look dredful ?
rgh !
oh , wait a second .
re you in trouble again ?
was i supposed to pick you up somewhere ?
what in the world is going on ?
breathe .
it 's okay .
i ll explain everything 
and nobody wants to blieve me , evn though i know the aliens are real , 'cause not only did they signl me twice n the p lab , but ...
oh , it 's liens .
do you seriously believe that ?
as sure as i believe my name is judy kling .
most days .
i mean , how could there not be ther life out in the endless expanse ?
what re we , a planet of egomaniacs ?
is nt she the most stllanarious grown-up ever ?
please ?
okay .
let 's think .
his own managr 's been on the flat-screen saying he hs no idea where he is .
do you seriously thnk a ufo could swoop down , swipe up one of the most meg-fmous guys on the planet , nd then zoom away without anyone seeing them ?
negatory , mrge .
no .
he 's here .
yeah , and this wuld help ...
 know , i know !
supernova girl .
impressve-major , aunt judy .
there was also nva nights , nd
perfectdramhadaline init about the nova of my heart .
so he 's a nova freak .
what does that prove ?
what else does he talk about a lot ?
okay , does n't he mention som linda girl in a ton of songs ?
cetus-lupeedus  mrgie !
you 're a genius-major !
so , what else is new ?
what 'd i say this time ?
aunt judy , does nt lnda mean somethng in spanish ?
linda nova , nova linda , hmm .
what are yo doing ?
this is it !
as my manager , les , you should understand bettr than anybody , tht someone as undenably fantastic as me should be doing only undeniably fantastic things .
well , i ca nt run for president .
but we 're older now and wiser and fully ready to handle anything .
margie :
i 'm tired !
i 've got all these icky little pricker-thingies in my ankles !
no , no , no , no , no .
s , that 's whre i fully draw the ln .
see ya !
hey , wait !
i hate this !
i hate it !
if people were intended to be outdoors , then they never would have invented houss !
zenon , if you 're gon na stop dead , yu culd at least warn a girl .
fine !
go right ahead of me .
margie ?
are yu here ?
sinceyouprbablyleft ths mrning thinking  was still asleep , bythetimeyou get this , daddy , i 'll be on earth with zenon .
iknowsheseemsharmless , but ever since this whole alien-mana thing ,
iloveyou , daddy .
i 'll contct you th second i can .
bye-ness !
there 's no other way through .
well , we ca n't just stand hre until w turn into statues .
c n't you knock it down or something ?
what if it 's poisonous ?
oh , so you 'd rather me get bitten 
obviously !
ew !
what happened earlier when you knocked ?
she 'll be fine by the morning .
she 's downstairs in her bedroom .
zenn :
go way !
levemealone !
m , i btyou'rprobably wondering where your darling daughter is ?
zenon :
years of practice .
yu try too hard .
rlax .
margie , it tickles !
i ca n't move !
never send an amateur to do a job that requires a pro .
no , margi !
do n't 
now  'm stuck , too !
and that 's my fault ?
zum , zum , zum .
they 're flly mitating you !
of course they are , love .
wh would n't be ?
she s fin .
come where ?
i 've done the spce thing , remember ?
proto zoa !
first rock star ever to sng for lien beings from nother galaxy .
oy-oy-oy !
pack my spacesuit !
all i need to know is when do we leave .
sometimes judy gets so caught p in being the fun aunt , she does n't always se her best judgment .
it 's not going to happen , hn .
but f it does ...
this has been our home for so long .
it 's so fmiliar and protected 
and it 's where we belong .
being a family is nt about our addrss .
sorry , sir .
i 'm here on orders from general hammond .
you and mrs. kar are under house arrest .
we 're what ?
what ?
we have to get dwn t our lab .
w hve some vry important experimnts in progress .
i am sorry , sr .
i 'm ctually writing .
i have n't been able to scribble down a single note since  fell into my funk .
it 's like my mom says 
gemm usually dos ll the cooking in space .
yeah , and as soon as they land , creepy government official gys with lots of keys would try to catch them and experiment on 'em .
outer spce is a pretty enormous expanse , if  recall .
voice : access denied .
right aftr they sent the first message drectly to me ,
orion said he suspected they also downloaded all kinds of information , but i hav n't figurd out how to get it .
ccessgranted .
ctus-lupeedus , look !
wedefinitelyknow it 's a mp , rion .
ijustdon'tknow how t read it .
oky , can you upload it to me ?
icantry .
i 'll see if  can match any of their coordinates and get back to you asap .
how does she do it ?
he would have gotten all red-faced mad at me , if he thought i 'd flown off jst to have an adventure .
oh , so once again , i 'm the expendable on .
but i thought you had him , oh  s totally wrapped .
about some thngs .
look , you fully have to convince him to let us us the shuttle .
the aliens are waiting , margi , and if we can shw th world that our spay-stay s responsible for contacting other life forms then ...
maybe they 'll stop tarng it apart and leave us alone .
come on , marge .
that 's it .
prto zo and  will be right here rooting for you .
thetruenature of our mssin ...
hello , daddy ?
assonas we 'verelocatedall space statin personnel to arth by th end of next week  wewilljettisonthe remaining sectors 
man :
i could hear him .
he just could nt hear me .
can you believe this ?
judy :
i 'm telling you what zenon heard hammond telling hart .
and soon .
supposei couldrustleup a shuttle , and suppose , just for  minute , thati wasinsaneenough to take off after a pack of proto zoa-loving aliens .
judy :
are you ready for this one ?
thealienssentzenonamap .
thy what ?
it'strue !
noonedownhere knew how to read it , but we 're hoping that he 'll have th skills nd the tools to decipher it .
sweetheart ?
doyouhvethe slightest idea how crazy this sounds ?
especially life with zenon .
i simply used their benchmark symbols of the earth and moon to calibrate their distance units .
then i re-plotted those locations to our standard issue navigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in all candr , oron , do you believe this map is legitimate 
look , sir , if you gt on a shuttle and you fly out to the location indicated hre in my hardly humble opinion , you are going to find yourslf , face to face with extraterrstrils .
h  'cause i was thinking ...
why do you hate me ?
what are yo talking bout ?
you ve been mean nd sarcastic to me since the last time i was on earth 
oh , that .
wait , are you actually saying people listen to me ?
okay .
do you know how many times w 've moved , how many schools i 've gone to ?
i do n't try to be a jerk .
what if i get plank into a lot of troble for taking tht shuttle ?
everybody 's got pressures in their life , margie .
if yu wan na make some real friends , start by learning yo 're not the only person in the galaxy with problems .
like what ?
the air is inky brown 
the food tastes like plastic .
captain rand wlls , united states intergalactic patrol .
to interview your daughter , and find out what sh knows about the current whereabouts of zenon kar .
oh , please  come in .
um , i have ...
i 've been missing her terribly .
would you permit m to pilot the departing transport shuttle this evening ?
i do n't see why that could n't work , commander .
we appreciate this .
lsten , i told you everything i know .
she came down here t find proto zoa 
precisely how did miss kar intend to discover his whereabouts ?
zenon :
he is actually cmng down ?
that 's a miracle-mjor !
did you hear that ?
we got a shuttle , and plank 's going to pilot us to meet the aliens .
where are we hooking up with him ?
youguysneedtogetthere as soon as possible , butmakesurethat you stay out of sight .
what 's up ?
wll , nebula clled to say that hammond has a patrol dwn here sarching for you , checking anywhere and evrywhere that you guys might be .
have they shown up at your place yet ?
notyet , buti 'm sure it 's only a matter of time .
revise that .
h !
did you hear tht , guys ?
we 're going t space to meet the aliens !
woohoo !
judy :
it does n't seem like anybody 's here .
h , mn , you have zero idea how envygreen i am .
 mean , this is the real deal , commander .
this is the trip  have spent my whole life cogitating about .
i mean , you 're actually getting t meet extraterrestrials .
yes , well , i 'm still very ...
i 'm still very skeptical about this whole thing  rion .
woman 
oh , hang n .
you do n't want to be rocketing off to meet the aliens without your navigational charts .
thank you , orion .
i ca n't tell you how much i appreciate ...
all your help .
now , before yur heli-hover arrives i have t ask you one thing .
i 've seen lggage stores with less luggage .
let me remind you ladies that staying as fabulous-looking as i am requires meg ttntion
have we heard from zenon yet 
they 're back from nova linda cove and they 're headed for carlson beach .
before we go , would you mind terribly if maybe i washed up a little bit ?
come on .
plank is now under full military rrest .
now , asmuchaswewanna support yu in this , honey , yourmotherandi ar starting to think thatmaybeyouughtto surrender to hammond 's patrol andcomehome .
and fully forget about the aliens ?
now , thebottom-line reality is , plank is the only one on our sde whohstheability to fly a shuttle .
i ...
not to mentin historical .
why could n't you be the pilot n the family 
i mean , yo 'd go ut there in a heartbeat , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
when did i turn into such a big , fat chicken ?
i used to love flying .
zenon does n't get it all from you , you know ?
i do know .
suddenly , the stkes changed .
i mean  she wants me to do this more than anyone .
so , where are they ?
worrydwn , aunt judy .
i 'm sure they 'll be here any minute .
i studied this ship 's navigational charts 100 times .
you sure ?
i 'm capable of flyng a shuttle at this point , orion .
i 'm telling you , mrs. k.  it s fine , you wo n't have to .
what ?
what do you mean ?
um 
h , you guys !
hi .
h , hw did edward ever pck this spot to land 
cetus-lupeedus , aunt judy , no one 's told you yet ?
hammond threw him into military jail .
hammond 's going on the mega-warpath and if i 'm wrng about this whole alien thing , it could be disaster-extreme .
but , sweatminor , aunt judy , 'caus i 'm fully sure everything 's gon na be just fine .
but , if edwrd is n't piloting the ship , who is 
oh , my word , this was a mistake 
i ...
how did  let myself get talked into this ?
look , just relax , okay .
the only thing more terrifying to me than taking off is landing .
i , uh , i really do n't think  can do it .
lok  i do n't wan na b unsupportive or anything , mrs. k. , but mybe you should 've thought of that before we took off .
we 're the united states military , wills , she 's a 15-year-old girl !
it'sharderthan we thought , sr .
orion :
okay , brace yurself , we 're abnd to enter the atmosphere .
oh , dar .
oh , my word  the landing .
look , mrs. k. , i have full confidence in you , but can i suggest this is gon n be esier if you open your eyes !
from you , dllfac .
it 's true .
there it s , it s almost here !
orion , what if it kept flying right out of my chest ?
okay .
oh .
oh , oh , oh !
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blue-eagle-2 , we re clsing on target .
we have visual confirmation .
wtchyourflanks , people .
who 's tht ?
mom , we have to go !
zenon :
wht 's happening ?
what 's going on ?
i ca n't get them to reignite .
engage target .
soldier 2 :
rin :
come on .
and yor girlfriend 
mr kar :
and since it s also a very risky and brave endeavor , and since we all have people we lve on that shp , sir , maybe instead of assigning blame and punishment , we ought to focus on a way of helping them achiev a safe return 
sir .
i do n't get it , mom .
well , the trouble is , converting their measurements to ours does n't mean the calculations were precise .
i men , even a variance of a few degrees on paper could mean thousands of miles out here in space .
we are gon na find them , are n't we ?
i mean , we 'll just fly arund out her until they show up ?
we have a finite fuel supply , limited provisions .
it 's okay , they 're gon na be her  i know it 
whatever ends up happening out here , thank you .
for what ?
honey , you showed me that it 's fine to wan na lve a safe and sane life  but sometimes we can get so safe , you practically stop living .
ship cnsole :
fuel tanks in dpletion zon .
orion said that the axiliary tanks h put in are even largr than the main tanks .
ship console :
now , that 's wrong , it has to be 
please reconnect to main tanks .
auxiliarytanksempty .
orion , did everything appear normal when you refilled the auxiliary tanks ?
i mean , i know they 're nt exactly thrilled with us but they ca n't wan na leave us up here to die !
i tried calling but there must be a mter shower in progress because all i got was sttic .
tell me one thing , do i lok half as hystericl as i feel ?
what , more so than usual , you mean  love ?
uh  folks , we als hve another problem .
before anyone can reach us , we 're gon na get scked into the moon 's gravitationl field 
is that bad 
look , everyone first of all should stay calm .
are you sre ?
i have always known that blasting into an endless vid was bad fr one 's health .
so , how did i end up here ?
zenon 
come on , come on , folks , we ca n't die out here in space .
look out .
exactly as orion predicted  the moon 's gotten a hld of us .
we 're gong down !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
where 're thy taking us ?
am i dreaming ?
hw can this be happening ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
what if they try to come on board ?
do we think it 's ...
i certainly think s .
cetus-lupedus , did you see that ?
madam , sir ,
i bet yo got  million questions for me , ai n't you , you little beasties ?
well ,  'm here .
what if we were wrng ?
apparently , their ship 's navigational computer 's gone into meltdwn-mode-major .
it kind of feels lke ...
if they 're such highly evolved , intelligent beings why d n't they simply tap into our space station minframe and take the charts they ned .
what ?
we are telling you exactly what zenon zap-padded us .
margie 's with them , they 'r all safe , they 're on their way back nd if we stand by , we are gon na wtness something that s , and i quote ,
the most astonishing event-major of the 21st century 
lt 
at this pont , sir , um , it looks like a flying rainbow .
zenon :
they were real !
but the fact remains , i was not set up here to be some mustache-twirling villain ,
this space station has drifted out of its prescribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hammond , i ..
d you dare to argue with me ?
and we gave them the navigational stuff that they needed and they gave us a tow home .
and the whole thing is so macro that the world needs to know about it .
proof , margie .
what no one hre seems to be offering is proof .
uh , actually , we 're falling back into orbit .
stellar .
thank you !
thank you , thank you , thank you , ladies and gents .
well , as my pal zenon kar can testify , when she so cleverly fond me on nova linda cove , i ws a mess .
so , she told me about thse space aliens , and she tld me that they wanted to contact me .
they pcked up my transmisson of my concert in outer space and used that t contact a true believer , zenon .
so what if i 'm not the center of the universe ?
i mean  look at me , i wanted nw challenges and i ve gotten them .
s , to cmmander and mrs. edward plank ,
all right , everybody , clap !

of all the plnets in or niverse , there is only one we know can support life .
t 's been called the lucky planet .
without that crucial tlt , everything would have ben different .
all life on earth is built on chance and powered by the sun .
but the delcate balances of or world are faltering , as the planet struggles to support our growing demands .
january , the high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month .
every living thing is just waitng .
perhaps it 's just to clean her fur , but it looks like sheer joy .
they 're drawn to their mother 's calls , but these slopes are not the easiest place to take your first steps .
the cubs have n't been fed this morning .
the mother has delayed their first meal on this special day .
hunger will draw them to her .
milk is the only food the cubs have known snce they were born def and blnd beneath the snow .
every year at this time , fmale bears ned food desperately .
this is the only place the bears can hunt for seals .
if they do n't make it ther before the ice breaks up , their families will starve .
it 's unlikely both of her cubs wll survive their first year out on the ice .
march , and munch of the north remains snw-bound .
a thousand miles south of the bears , stunted confrs are still locked in ice .
it 's one of the last great wildernesses .
these conifers have needleshaped leaves virtually inedible so the forest supports very little animal life .
this creature is the very ssnc of wilderness .
as spring creeps up from the south , the taiga is unveiled .
they 've come to make the most of the brif flush of spring food and to have their young .
if newborn calves are to keep up , they must be on ther feet and running the day they 're born .
but these vast herds do n't travel alone .
the calf may be young but it 's capable of utrunning the wolf , if it manages to keep its footing .
by this stage , the odds are even .
april in the arctic , and already the sun nver sets .
but further south  the sun works its magic in more gradual familiar ways .
the broadleaf woodlands of europe and north america .
more thn any other , thse have been crwded out by towns and frmland .
only fragments remain .
summers are longer hre nd deciduous trees can flourish .
spring has also come early for the mandarin ducks .
it 's a long way down for a maiden flight .
a few calls of encouragement are needed hre .
there are still two missing .
only tw dys old and already one great adventure behind them .
a seasonal cycle that seems ncreasngly unrelable .
but there are parts of our world that have no seasons .
may , in the tropics , but ther is no spring .
this is what allows the jungle to grow unchecked and support so munch life .
ranforest now covers a third of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planet 's surfce nd yt , it contains more than half f all the plants and animals on earth .
he can concentrte on more important tasks , like tidying up his display area .
this magician has a special trick .
with the audience n place , the shw can begin .
sh just has to have been impressed with that .
after all that effort , can she still have doubts ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % f ts plants and animals nowhre is there more at stake .
deserts cover one third of the land 's surfce on planet arth , and they 're getting bigger every year .
and the challenges are becoming greater than ever .
june n the kalahari desert of southern africa .
lt 's the dry season here , and thousands of elephants have started the desprte trek for food and water 
at th moment it is dry , but water should come .
buffalo join the great trek .
dust storms make the going tough all the way 
they 've become separated from the herd .
this is a dangerous place to lose your way .
they dare n't rst until they reach t .
finally , the stragglers emerg from the dust .
the storm has died down .
bt not all the animals have been so lucky .
sand dunes give way t praires and savannah .
grass is a great unsung hero of our planet .
this is the circle of life that most of us , in our urban lives , have lost touch with .
perhaps spurred on by a memory from the past , the mtriarch leads the herd to a temporary water hole one that may have saved her life years ago .
the calf and ts mother are most at risk .
ln the darkness , an elephant 's vision is little better than our own .
the lions bide their time .
it 's th calves they 're after .
the calves are too wll protected .
as the deserts grow , and traditional migration routes are blocked by farms and fences , elephants must trek ever greater distances .
the sun that scorches the desert also brings watr to the land .
s it beats dwn on tropical sas , moisture rises from the warming oceans powering our global weather system .
as th air rises , so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scne is set for one of nature 's most challenging migrations .
each year , thousnds of demoiselle crans try to escape the harsh winters in mongolia , by flying south to the warmer climes of india .
to get there , they have to cross the highest mountain range on earth , the himalayas .
the cranes hit violent turbulence .
the sn 's rays weaken in the afternoon and the turbulnce flls away , but it 's too lat for today .
the adults must guide their young on this hazardous trip .
it 's early morning and the warm air is alredy rising fast .
this is the great unending cycle .
for genrations , humans and animals alike cme to depend on the great rivers and their seemingly endless flow .
after months of drought , the rivers begin to flow again in the kalahari .
this is an africa we rrely see a lush water world totally reliant on a seasonal flood , originating from a tropical ocean thousnds of miles away .
many animals are quite at home in the flood , but there are some more apprehensive bathers .
after weeks of marching , the elephants are xhausted .
after so many weks , many hundreds of miles , they 've arrived .
the seasonal cycle that drives the lives of elephants on land , is jst as important n the oceans .
it 's july and the humpback whales are in their breding grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no more than  few wks old and as he begins to tire  his mother supports him close to the surface , so that he can brethe .
these shallw equatrial waters make good nurseries they 're warm and calm and there are few predatrs .
to find food , she wll have to lead her calf on an epic 4,000-mile journey to rcher feeding grunds at the southern extremes of our planet .
this is the longest migration by any marine mamml , and it depends entirely on a healthy ocean all along the way .
out in the opn ocan , th whales meet others serching for food .
they have to cross half the globe , from the quator all the way t the edge of antarctic .
the tropical seas are a long way behind them now .
they 're heading for strmy seasonl waters .
great whites attack whale calves , but they 're not the victims tday .
thse magnificent predators , at the very top of the food chain , are a vital part of a healthy ocean .. and yet we slaughter almost a hundred mllion of them every year .
their populations ar in freefall .
out to sea , the ice is now too thin to support the cubs ' father .
this is  disster for plr bears .
without a solid pltform , they struggle to hunt the sals they need to survive .
how will the father make t through the year now that the ice is almost gone ?
the waters are getting colder and rougher .
so as not to los track of ach other , they slap their fins on the surface .
the whales have finally reachd antarctica in tme for the summer 
at last , aftr their 4,000-mile journey , the humpback whales can feed .
now , at last , th mother can replnish her reserves as sh and her calf join the rest of the team .
winter in antarctica and the greatest seasonal change on our planet is underway .
soon the continent will be plunged bck into darkness .
th auror australa illuminates the southern skies , but these spectacular lights bring no warmth to the wilderness of ice .
our male polar bear is in great dangr now .
after many days at sea , the exhausted bear is drawn by the pungent smells of the colony .
he 's desperate for food  but walrus are munch larger than his unseal prey .
it 's the pups he 'll have t get to .
the powerful adults can do terrible damage with their huge tusks .
he tests the barrier .
and agan , in sheer frustration now .
t slips from his grasp .
this one took the gamble .. nd lost .
unable to feed , he ca nt survive .
they 've left ther mother ... and re thriving .
the polar bear has become an emblem for the state of our planet and for all the creatures who are strugglng to lve alongside uns .
my friends , this is paris .
of love .
but not all the love stries of france begin in paris .

those sidewalk cafes were so much fun 
and paris is so beautiful !

robesperr , look !

i 'll bet they 'd know whr she is .
her we go agin .
thre 's no one here .
no one at all .
let 's find our way out of here nd get back to that feline place .
dear mr. phtt :
ps .
there are other suitors .
if you ever decide to marry , boys , marry for love of money .
pardon me , my friend , but that was the mst remarkabl exhbition of vrtu-mouse-ity i 've ever witnessd .
vrtu-what-sity ?
virtu-mouse-ity .
we accept !
and now can we eat ?
milk .
lt 's really live it up big  jaun tom 
champagne for the greatest mouse catcher in all france and his manager .

shaloot ...
i salte you !

lmpossible .
where are you going , turtle ?
wht do you know 
i wo n't harm yur little friend .

then we will retrn to paris in styl .
no time for games , little turtl .
i must swab the deck , yes ?
according to your instructions , i am having mewsette 's portrait painted by the most famous artists in paris .
you will notic how monsieur monet achieves a shimmering light throughout the pictre and an mpression of air and space .
henri rousseau is an ex-soldir with no formal art training .
with his vivid imaginaton he is creating a chrming world f his own whre oranges grow on banana trees .
sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pos for him 
to achieve a strng emotional impact he sometimes applies paint drectly from the tube .
monsieur edgar degas frequently uses ballt dancers as his models .
monsieur paul cézanne is an intellectal artist .
the dynamic paul gauguin has only recently returned from tahiti and his paintings show the influence of the suth se slands .
here 
now , i want no slip-ups .
i want you to see that she is comfortably settled in her ...
no mney , no mewsette .

it will be well worth it , meowrice .

lesson number one -- food .
slugs are extremely juicy and tender 
and these seds are a wonderful between-mal snack .
they 're high in fiber , and they wo n't fill you up .
this is n't what wild dogs eat .
this is n't what any dogs eat .
there 's something you might prefer over there .

captin !
cptain !
oh , nurse ..
i 'm from the maritime bureau .
he 's not wll enough to speak with anyone !
i only need two or three minutes .
he has n't regained consciousness yet .
is he in danger ?
the others must have drowned when the boat sank 
hw is it ?
th only thing we found was this .
the ship 's too big for everyone to have been washed off ...
the water surge could nt wash away that many people so thoroughly .
it 's notjst a concidence ?
it 's mazing that you were the only one to survive .
how many times are yo going to say that ?
enough to her your response !
i want you to tell us wht really happened !
the for other men ...
i called out to them ... before the ship was jostled , and i saw the frankenstin monster ... .
that monster has n't been found !
do n't you have another story ?
i know what attacked our ship !
i know in my heart that it hppened !
after that , the four men ... !
i am not lying .
believe me , i am telling the truth ..
captain , we 've discovered what hppened to the four men .
yu did ?
we 're sure this is all from the ship .
what could have done this to them 
tokyo tlphone ?
i need the kyoto shinagata institute , frankenstein research unit .
hello 
yes this s it .
yokosuka 
hello , this is dr. stewart .
we have n't had  franknstein here since the ne that vanished at mount fuji .
yes ...
what did he say ?
he said that a frankenstein monster may have eaten sme humans .
oh , my ... !
thy want to ask yo questions about the grgantuan , frankenstein .
have  seat .
-it is ?
he would n't be doing things like tipping over bats , or eating humns .
yes , that 's my opinion .
let 's lave that closed , okay ?
now , this is what we have next .
not yet .
now , g ahead 
just bfore h escaped , he found his wy into my apartment .
what 's wrong ?
heave !
heave !
heave 
heave !
they 're chasing any story that relates to frankenstein !
i have ...
we just do nt know how much of this is flse .
perhaps they just do n't know where he is currently living .
look at this ...
it is ...
doctor , i would like to chck it out , if you do n't mind .
what did you find ?
do you knw what it is ?
s n't it from the frankenstein 
no , i ca n't say what it is yet .
hey , wait a minute ...
up  over thr .
it looks like we 've got a bit of work cut out for us back at the lab .
thank you .
i 'm afraid that those ar from frnkenstein ...
i do n't believe those cells could have come from any other life form .
but ... why is it living beneath the sea ?
flight 17  proced 180° at 10 knots .
a mnster is coming !
a monster is coming !
a monster s coming !
no !
mergency , emergency !
your back !
what was the thing that attacked handa airport ?
i do n't know ..
we have nt yet heard any details of what had happnd .
did n't you say that the frankenstein yo had in cstody posed no threat to mankind ?
everyone , please !
please !
we leave for tokyo immediately 
what could make frankenstein live in the sea ?
nothing ...
doctor , can you answer some questions ?
-doctor !
what is the defense plan ?
we plan on sending a pwerful electrical current through tokyo bay .
he ca n't withstand the light on a clear day 
dr. stewart , what do you say ?
i think you 're right ...
does that mean that you 'd continue your studes of frankenstein  regardless of wht happened ?
yes ... yes , i wuld .
that is the point of our problem ...
do you know what would happen if frankenstin appeared in a peaceful city like this ?
the lights !
is ther a doctor here !
is there a doctor ?
the monster is going awy 
go get a stretchr !
-right .
the monster seems to be harned by bright lights .
the monster seems to be harned by bright lights .

ki 
kyo !

hurry !
let 's go , let 's go !
we 've done ll that we can !
hlt !
move !
ready the searchlights !
we 're all set !
lights !
here is the latest report from headquarters .
the creatur has proceeded frm tokyo to the mountains along th river .
take positions !
command , we re at position 10.95° .
the creature is apprximtely 300 meters ...
fall back !
-fire !
look ut !
cese fire !
order all units to stand down for now .
wherever he emerges  we will b able to engge him with siz units .
alright , let 's go !
-yes , sir !
right !
we 're ready in this sector 
commander , helicopter unit one ...
yo are ordred to lure the monster into the established attck zone .
roger , roger 
the monster has slowed its pace .
we 'll attack soon .
calling base !
roger .
i think we should let him go a little further .
first unit is ready !
-right !
third unt is redy !
-switch the units on !
it 's time !
-alright !
converter one is ready !
-generator two is redy 
go !
bring the helicoptrs into position !
hurry !
-hurry !
fall back !
fall back !
fall back !
-right !
we 're all set !
-fire !
callng base !
switch on the electricity !
-switching on !
alright !
commander 
calling the commandr !
doctor 
that ne has to be the frankenstein we know !
then it seems your hunch was correct 
well , it proves tht there are two of them .
now , i hav to convince them that on s nnocent .
that is all ...
it 's incredible ...
what 's sand got to do with this ?
maybe , if we do n't ask so many questons and try to find some clues , we 'll know that answer .
mr. yokosuka !
good find , akem .
oh , thank you !
thank yo for coming .
have you fond the mnsters 
you may want to check the lkes and streams around here .
i see ..
notfy headquartrs .
shall we continue on our way and see wht we can dig p on gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like his hair nd tissue ...
the cells are identical .
this means that the frankenstein 's are brothers .
maybe not ...
he could have torn off some flesh on a rock that made ts way to the ocean .
once there , on prtein-rich plankton , another frankenstein could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the othr .
doctor , if that is the case  would n't an explosion create even more frankenstein 's ?
we 'll do what we can to avoid using them .
we can us napalm !
it 's strange ..
whenever there s a strong evil force around , youth seems to blossom .
are n't we guilty of ding the same thing ?
i do n't feel any guilt .
let 's go for a walk .
before this mist gets ny thicker ...
run away !
help me !
akemi !
lsten to me and do n't panic !
doctor !
akemi !
hold on !
are you okay ?
you remember who w are !
wat !
gaira is the one that s dangerous !
they are north at 135.10° and appear to be running away !
rders !
we will attack with every availble weapn at our disposal until they are finished .
we will deal with that after we have completed the task at hand !
all units , retreat !
retreat !
at the moment , he 's still moving .
sanda is innocent , generl ...
to save , not destroy ...
i agree with hm .
a plain and simple fact that has already been proven .
if you hit them with your heavy artillery , you will sctter thir cells hlfway to china .
then you will be faced with a thousand frankenstein s .
how can you be sure of your theory when it is n't proven ?
doctor , could you do that ?
they have the same cells , the same genetic structure and the sme blood .
what could that mean  doctor ?
gaira !
that 's just what we needed .
doctor , you 're turning off the lights ?
get me the defense agency .
yes , and hurry !
yes 
he now knows that where there s light , he 'll find food .
turn off your lights !
-please !
hurry !
hurry !
hurry !
wht 's going on here ?
hrry !
hurry !
turn off your headlights !
you 'll have to lave your car here !
-dmn !
help me out !
where is he now ?
-where is he now ?
hello ?
sanda 's in tokyo ?
i 'm positive he has n't come to help gaira !
doctor .
this is dr. stewart .
there 's nothing we can do .
sanda is entering tokyo .
i 'll be down there right away .
akemi .
where are you going ?
we have to convince him to turn back .
you ca n't .
it 's too late now .
this time i 'm going to sve his life .
halt !
go on !
you silly nut !
come n now ...
for yur own safety , please evacute at nce !
we 're all set to open fire !
for your own safety , please evacuate at once !
you 're orderd to clear the streets immedately !
this way .
akemi !
kmi !
-what happened ?
head for the secondry command !
akemi ...
are you alright ?
-yes .
by the way , sanda came to your rescue again .
i think he hs a crush n you .
thrty minutes , then ...
but hw do you know he will destroy gaira ?
two minutes to attack .
hello !
i 'm sorry , akemi 
i did everything i could .
the only thing we can do now s hope their cells do n't multiply .
they 've made their way to the docks .
more , more , more , more , more ...
are you alright ?
are you excited by electrc trains

virginia :
last night we had it out .

together :

science frees us from superstition and dogma and enables us to base our knowledg on evidence

they do now , but you were aware it as a norm
through faith and superstition or through the rigours of logic , bservation and evidence , through reason
i want to confront the epidemic f irrational superstitios thinking
yu really believe it ?
and throws up new ag gurus who exhort us to run away from reality
reason and respect for evidence are the source of our progress our safeguard against fundamntalists and those who profit from obscuring the truth

well  i got really nobody military in my background at all and actally nobody fitting the g either rght .
e something tell me more about her , please
the lady i d feel with her .. a lot of cats
all right she liked dogs , but she hatd cats
not evrybody
i mean i 've got people like yourself ...
xtraordinary claims requir extraordinary evidence
because now many people come to this vent for some reason and because they want to close to yo in that directin in the line
many cases that people that are , you know  have lost somebody , lost a child s dear to them then they can not get out with the fct of having lost the child and become addictd to these ...
oky , this a lady who is trying to cnnect with somebody at the frnt of ..
derren brown is a celebrated illusinist but also a skeptic
h makes clear his perfrmances depend smply on mental tricks
she looks very , very elegant and thre 's guilt on her part
he gives me the inside intelligence on how a psychic medium might xploit entirely earthly trade secrets
well , the saying was you 're constanly supplying the meaning yourself but it can be really convincing
charls ...
th psychic wll , it 's a group throughout names ,
you knw it really could be anything so somebody just pick up on it and tell you nto what thy want to depict
he 's saying something about a hat that you used to like or something with the hat
and he asks me back
no , and i just put another picture , i put a picture in the hallway of the family or smething
and we ask that we can now build a bridge between ths wrld and the next so that we can once again go some way to proving that we survive death and the ur loved ones in the spirit are forever with us .
okay , i expect most of you are familir with spiritualism but thse that ...
but i thought i could hear and it could b dave , devon or davenport something like that
no , but i have a home in davenport
you have a home in davenport ?
well , it depends on what you call cold reading or something got a lot of the rations that cme up sayng that what you do or you say something can people basically make it fit
now , see if i can find the charles in a minute but let me ... give you a few things i can feel abot you
has tht been a few problems with the stomach condition around you
and i feel with this lady i want somone that 's a fairly comfortable build i would say a biggr build lady not the slight build ldy that 's given me this  yes ?
i hate you when i ca n't find the link let me see if ..
i think if i were talking to someone in the spirit world
 'd say things like 'what 's it like being dead ?
i believe it 's a blending of thoughts between myself and the spirit communicator but if only it could be just lke a telephone line
let me just say wht we can get a lttle more information from her first
f yo 've convinced the person that as their grndmother to the point that they re actually crying
i mean surely those tears enough are perhaps proof that they had proved that really is their grandmother that 's making the communication
it could indicate just desperate wishful thinking perhps
now , i do n't fit on with a steve bennet for i 've got those things i want to bring together somhow with particularly a car crash
my friend ben died in a car crash and he 's ... on schol 's day
your friend ben passes and so there 's not bennet as  said it was ben
beyond whether it 's true or false what concerns me as well is the exploitation of often vulnerable people
can i say when you were buying the nw shoes have you been on your mind at that time 
it was on my mind , i know i really buy , yeah
and you know his messages relly in a whiny sorry , becase he ca n't ..
he gives me the feling that ...
but do people move forward ?
he actually had a tire on the left hand ...
okay , well  i ca n't remember that
seriously you beleve it ?
 have personal proof it 's true to me but as with religion if it hangs on private feelings that ca n't b proved or disprved by scence then in wht way can t be vlid r meaningful to the rest of us
next i want to find out what happens when those wh claim mysterious powers do allow themselves to be tested
now , i think it 's false so shall we see how well yu have done ?
i want to show hw scientific reasn is always the best way to look at the world and explain the dngers of superstition
i 'm oftn askd how i know that there is n't a sprit world r psychic clairvoyance
it seems improbable but unlike the fixed world views of mystical faith science is always open to new possibilities
until qute recently scientists did n't know how bts fly round in total darkness
could they have paranormal extrasensory perception ?
but the more scientists tested the evidence , the more robust the theory became
verything about it added up t a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence tht this really was a fact
the more we look at it , the weaker it becomes
the alleged detectin of water through dowsing is not obviously ridiculous it might work but does it ?
the only way to tell is through a rigorus xpriment
how does dowsing work ?
1 question and nobody can answer yu
i think of the question and i expect god respond in a way that i undrstand
i expect th right hand one point to the camer and the left hand one straight forward , i wan na ...
have you dne th test yet in the tent ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 right , 100 %
so what do you make tht then ?
the psychologist chris french thinks there may be a simpler explnation
he hs devoted his career to investigating claims of the paranormal
but thre 're always th possible explanations there , what we 're trying to do it a set of cnditions which rule out any of those explanations then we get down to the very fundamntal basic issue ca n't the dowsers actually do what they think they can do .
i think it 's false
so shall w see how are you done ?
this is sand .
in that case i ca n't do this
this is the wter in no .
3
well , you got one right and , that was 6 which is what we xpect by chance
thre .
what 's interestng is it does n't actually tend to dent their confidence at all
i think they are completely sincre and they are typically very , vry surprised whn we run them through series of trials and actally say at the end of the day where your performance is no bettr than what w would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has happened but i did say from the otset could n't we jst sort out some gry blocks and some scaffold boards , so then i can work about it which is what i would rotinely d and i 've done for 40 yers
who knows where or what bottles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole pnt
this state of denial is extraordinary 
even when confronted with hard fact thes dowsers prefer not to face up to truth but retain their delusion
irrational belief frm dowsing to psychic clairvoyance has roots in early mankind s habit of attrbuting spirit and intenton to ntural phenomena such s water , the sun , a rock or the sea
in 480 bc , king xerxes of the persians built a pontoon bridge across the hellespont and the rough sa came and wrecked it
i wonder whether there 's smething of king xerxes and all of s to this day
we do n't want to believe that things just hppn we want to believe that there re some kind of deliberate intentin behind everything ven when nanimate objects are concerned
and perhps that is the key to humanity 's belief in the supernatural
even in the 21st century , despite all that science has revealed about the indifferent vastness of the universe the human mind remains a wanton storyteller crating intention in the randomness of rality
the delivery of rewrds by a on-armd bandit is dtermined at random but many gamblers want to think that what they do can increase their chnces of winning the jackpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
thre 're two kinds of mistakes they cn make they can ither fail to detect pattern when there is som or they can seem to detect pattern when there is n't ny and that 's superstiton
60 years ago , the american psychologist b.f. sknner investigated the behavior of pigeons rewarding them with food when they learned to peck a key in the feeding apparatus
but then skinner set the apparatus to reward the birds at random now the pigeons just have to sit back and wait , but that s n't what they did
when an individual pigeon , for example , happened to look over its left shulder and the reward mechanism just happened to click in at that point
by sheer luck as it happnd th reward mechanism delivered food at the same time again and so the pgeon was rinforced n its idea that looking over the left shulder was what got it the reward
and it went on and on and turned into a maniac for looking over the left shoulder
humans can be no bettr than pigeons
spiritual slf help guides d a roaring trade in the material wrld outnumbering science books by 3-1
but what does spirituality actually man ?
s please take your set and please come slowly and gently and so tht we can start the proceeeding without losing time
so could yo please ...
and he counts amongst his many fans price charles and dlai lama
i was presnt in the beginning , in the first big bang nd i 'll be here for billions of years to come
but is n't satish 's spiritualty just about imposng yet another superstitious force positve ?
world is made of two elements .
there the spirit is very big , and very holistic  and very inclusive world
it is not defined in a ne particular way so when you go in a rom you can say the tree has  spirit
nature without sprit cn not exist like tree can not exist without the sun .
light , it can not exist without rain , ... can not exist withut soil also it can not exist without a treeness .
the treeness is the spiritual quality
or the rockness
when you talk about the rockness or the quality of a rock
it ll sounds very poetic , bt it 's not reality like priests , mullahs , and rabbis , new-age mystics ceaselessly attempt to fill gaps in human understnding with fabricated meaning
science and rationality are often accused to having a cold blak outlook but why is t bleak to face up to the evidence of wht we know
th word mundane has cme to mean boring and dull , it really shold n't , it should mean the opposite because it comes from the latin mundus , meaning the wrld , and the world is anything but dull
ther 's real poetry in the real world .
scince is the poetry of reality
next i want to look at the dngers that pses
why do i have to trust , you know , th gp , why do i hve to trust the royal society
i thnk you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 years , science has put a man on the mon , cloned a sheep , dcoded the human genome
and yet , sadly , the white heat of the 1970s seems to be treated as white elephant tody
anything yellw close is oky..
the fundamental problem i think lies with th fashon throughout our educatonal system to teach students to value private feeling more highly than evidence based reason
for relativists , scientific truth is just a patriarchal western orthodoxy that like the old roman catholc church stands in the way of other equally valid outlooks on the world
with things lke paranormal , the drive for alterntive medicine , all these kinds of movements away from the orthodox in science
in terms of different kinds of treatments and things like that and in a way  not trusting the xperts any more
i think yu 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong , you 're absolutely wrong
we want to questin authority .
we do n't want to say because this person is the president f royal society therefore what he says is right
we 've got to go back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but the impersonal algorithms of internet search engines do not weed out robst evidence from unsourced  uncorroborated assertion
paranoia conspiracy theories circlate unchallenged
smtimes they 're relatively harmless like th rumor that nasa faked the moon landings which is a bit f a joke because the evidence for going to the moon is so strong
but how about the malicious and tterly unfounded rumor that 4000 jews were tipped off by isral agents not to go to work in the world trde center on 9/11
as evidence is devalued even medical progress has become a target ... through vomiting .
hundreds of families blame me .
an innuendo circulatd that the establishmnt was conspiring to risk our chldren 's health
it led to hundreds of thousands of parents failing to protect their offspring from the threat of measles a serious disease that in afghanistan kills 35,000 people a year
reason has built the mdern world , it is a precious but also a fragle thing which can be corroded by apprently harmless irrationality
next week , i look at how health has become one of the fircest battlegrounds between rason and superstition

wold you like to step out nd have a cigarette , mr graham ?
i understand .
she 'll be alright now , mr graham .
well , i have to take it in 2 or 3 times a week .
which is somewhat inconvenient , but the car is well worth it .
how often do you drive it ?
2 or 3 times a week .
i have to take t in every time i drve it .
yes .
my own mechnic has not been very helpful .
ever .
and there 's a lot of carbon on the valves .
yes  there always is .
usually needs a tune-up every few weeks .
your attorney , mr beckett , has been trying to reach yu .
he 's been calling the superintendent 's office all week .
i do n't care to discuss it .
... and he told me there was carbon n the valves ... which was n news to me 'cause thre 's always carbon on the valves 
h ha , i told you a ferrari was useless in the city .
what a day .
that 's a perfectly insane ...
what is it ?
a mr beckett on the phone !
beckett ?
has an urgent message .
half the time is spent taking off and the ther half is spent on landing .
every time i bring her out she has to have repairs 
my mechanic says it 's carbon on the valves .
this is long island tower 
roger .
i ll just get out here , thank you .
oh , jerry !
mr von rensaeller ?
he 's in the longe with mr beamont .
but i sprayed and the crwn gall is gone .
really ?
ah , those idiots .
i was previled upon as hnorary secretary to bring it to your attention ... s yo can stir it up at the bank .
now , listen to me vry carefully , please .
yo see , when you have capital ... yo are able to derive ...
i will attend to the check in a moment , mr graham .
i understand about the check .
i 'm trying to explain something to you ... that is trribly imprtant .
when we spnd more , per month or per year ... than we have in income , you must then dip into the captal ... eventually exhausting the capital and of course , therefore , the incme .
do you see what i mean 
mr beckett .
i 'm trying to explain to you tht it is impossible t py the check ... because your expenses have excedd your income ... to such a point that you have exhausted your cpital .
do n't tret me as though i were a child  mr beckett .
now , what about this check ?
in other words , you do n't have $ 60 .
come t the point , beckett .
the point , mr graham , is that you do n't have any money 
what could i ... ?
how could i put it ?
that mney ...
you have no mony .
ther 's no other way to put it .
you hve no money .
and what of my stocks , my att  my general mtors ?
y-yes , i know ...
my emeralda peat ?
yes , yes , i know abot emeralda peat .
let m show you something .
 did not !
that is beside the pint .
do you realize that this check has bounced , mr bckett ?
i mean , bounced !
it s not the first check that you 've hd bounced , mr graham .
i 'd like to show you this check of $ 550 .
you mean to say that i 'm now n the position of owing yo $ 550 ?
no , n , no , do n't , do n't , please , do n't think of it as a loan  mr graham .
disliking you as intensely s i do , i wanted to be absolutely certain .. that when i looked back upon your financial downfall ..
i could absolve myself completely of any responsibility for it .
i do n't think he 'll giv you a nickel , mr grahm .
and considering your gift for clse personal relationships ...
thank you vry mch  mr bckett .
ths will cover the overdraft of $ 550 that i owe you .
smoke them in good health .
goodbye .
goodbye .
goodbye .
nice to see you .
thank you .
i was looking ... for someone .
good afternoon , mr graham .
i 'm kind of srprsed .
would you like to hve a table for one ?
no , no , thank yo .
 just wanted to ...
but it 's always grat to see you .
you 're always welcome here .
you know that .
i m sorry , mr sullivn 
i know nothing more about your application .
i 'll come back tomorrow and check .
good afternoon , mr graham .
were you expecting some mail ?
certainly , sir .
i knew i could count on a straight nswer from you .
thank you , sir .
it 's the best suit yu can find in ready-to-wear .
the racket club does not keep those members on a trust that worry mssing their dues .
oh , n !
i was just about to ring for it .
harold , i have something to tell you .
is it about your money , sir ?
in any case , it 's gone .
yes  it was my first thought .
my attorney advisd me against it on the grounds that it would be useless .
see , the thng of it is , harold ... that i have no hope of ever repaying him , or anyone .
all i am , or was , is rich 
i was so hppy .
what will  do ?
what any gentleman of similar breeding ... and temperament would do in your position , sir .
no , sir .
 was n't going to suggest suicide .
you mean to a woman ?
that is what i had in mind .
it 's the only way to acquire property without labor .
i could n't ...

and who was he when he was alive ?
well , he was an industrilist or composer , something like that .
well , did he die with his wealth intact or ...
i heard he was enormously wealthy when he died .
is that right ?
i thought you did n't know who he was .
well , i did n't at first ... bt the vividness of your descriptin has restored him to my memory .
he was enormously wealthy when he did .
and the girl ?
she 's enormously wealthy , too .
no close relatives ?
no .
no 
she 's a botanist !
does n't rde , either .
does n't entrtain .
i think she s bout the most isolated woman i 've ever met .
madeleine , would you get ms lowell another cup f tea  please ?
i 'm trribly srry .
that 's alright , dear , really .
could n't care less 
it 's nothing .
it 's just an old rug .

forgive me a moment , wll y , bo ?
excuse me .
henrietta , is this some kind f joke ?
once yes , but twice in a row ..
mdam .
there you are , madam .
take your damn carpet to the cleaners and send the bill to m .
come , ms lowell , i 'm taking you home .
take your bag .
you dare call me a son of a bitch ?
you 're more to be scorned than pitied .
you can dismiss your car .
 beg your pardon ?
this is very nice of you .
thnk yu 
no , you do n't have to apologize , ms lowell .
no .
you were a guest 
a woman of your statur has a right to expect every courtesy in any home she consents to visit .
what stature ?
i 've read far too many botancal journals ... to take that question seriously .
are you a botanist ?
every science has its fans .
carbon on the valvs .
tell m about yourslf , ms lowell .
your work , your hopes , your dreams ...
well , i work as a teacher and  als do field work nd writ monographs .
on my last field trip i identifid and classified ... all the varietes of ferns n jolly buoy .
it was one of the longest monographs i 've ever wrtten .
i 'd love to read it sometime .
 do n't know what my dream is .
well , in any way , that is my work and my hope , except for my dreams which i 'm not certain of .
oh  like parkinson 's disease bing named aftr james parkinson .
that 's right .
or the bougainvillea being named after lois de bougainville .
brussels sprouts .
yes , i guess it is .
ths seems rather presumptuous , does n't it , to hope for immortality ?
not to me .
if you ca n't be immortal , why bother ?
self-assured .
you 're so positive .
it almst gives me confidnce just to be wth you .
then in a very short time you will be a very confident botanist because ..
i intend to be with you a great deal of the time .
oh , ys .
oh , heavens !
yes .
until this evening .
good morning , mis-
you have exactly 7 days and 9 hours to destitution .
shall i serve your breakfast in bed ... or would you like me to follow you about wth the tray ?
i have n't got time to eat .
reserve a table for two at pavillion for tonight .
'55 was a glorious yar for mouton rothschild .
better than '53 , i think .
may i ask you something ?
er , not that i can recall .
why do n't yu just drink grape jice ?
it 's not as sweet .
good night .
night , steward , thank you very much .
thank you .
5 days and 11 hours .
listen to me , plese , harold .
well  bone p and study the chapter on classification .
she has no spirit , no wit , no converstion ... and she has to be vacuumed every time sh eats .
yes , she is .
i 'll have to start arly if i 'm going to propose .
yes  sir .
oh , shll i order additional champagne , sir ?
no champagn .
i have recently ben re-reading gregor mendel 's ... fascinating experiments with garden peas 
yes , but we must n't forget morgan and muller .
erm ... does it sem that t you ?
collective apprisal has never appealed to me .
oh !
is there any cold water ?
n , no , never mind 
henrietta , please .
nonsense .
i 've ruined another carpet .
stop tht .
cn you possibly believe , fr one moment ... that wht happens to this foolish , hairy floor covering mtters to me ... when i have you sitting beside me ?
looking t me with your beautifully soft .. yet highly intelligent , well-informed eyes ?
you mst think me very superficial .
wold you care for some mre wine ?
oh yes , i would love some .
it 's ... rm ... it 's , oh , it 's 10 o'clock and then we have to leave pretty soon ... 'cause  have to get up tomorrow very early for a clss .
we re bth of the same division :
vertebrata .. the same class : mammalia ... the same order : primate ... the same family : hominide the same genus : homo .. the same species : sapiens ... and the same variety of a class .
i do n't think there s a class f variety ...
keep quiet , henr- !
 'm very sorry .
n fact the only differnce between us is that i am a man and you are a woman .
y-yes .
oh , henrietta , if you care for me at all .
learn to care for me at all ... in a resonable amunt of time , please say yes .
there s often a tidy profit in speculation .
henrietta .
did you hurt yourself ?
no .
 would literally ... have nothing 
there would be such a ...
i wo nt ..
you 're not ?
no .
that was my dream , henry .
that someday you would ask me to marry you .
henrietta , darling , would this saturday be too soon ?
oh , heavens , mercy !
hnrietta , i 'm intensely uncomfortable .
yes , yes , yes !
you 're  good ... a good girl 
ouch !
stop that , harold !
i 'm sorry , sir .
that hurts .
i 'm enormously pleased , sir 
oh , i wish you could 've been there , harold .
you would have been astonished of my technique .
hrold , snd an announcement ot to the newspapers ... and put ms lowell 's attorney on the guest list .
t seems he 's a close persnal friend of hers .
hs the wine come up off the rug yet ?
no sir 
i 'm saking it now in various solvents ... but they only sem to dissolve the np .
i oughta sue her .
do you know how many llamas must have died to make that rug ?
unsemly ?
did i say she was primitive ?
i retract that .
she 's feral 
i am nauseated .
i limp .
and i can feel my teeth rotting awy from an excess of sugar ... that no amount of toothpaste can dislodge 
that woman is a menace not only to health ... but to western civilizatin s we know it .
she des n't deserv to live .
forgt i sad that .
h , get off my lap , you little ingrate !
get off 
he did it .
he really , really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who henritt lwell 's attorney is .
in fact , he hs an office smewhere n this building .
he does n't seem to have a very active practice .
well , what i mean is ... he may not be exactly overjoyed .. at the idea of sharing her affections with henry .
no ...
andrew .
no , i wo n't accept it .
nonsense .
wh is he ?
that little wino who went with you on one of your field trips to the canary islands ?
no , it is not .
well then , who is it ?
a foreignr ?
some little wop with a fancy title ?
really , andrew .
of cours , henrietta .
custom-made ... hat .
you will find ...
andrew , you will find some wonderful woman who deserves you .
what 's wrong ?
henritta  darling ...
andrew , i m going now .
i 'm leaving , in order to meet henry ... who , it just so hppens , is an american citizen f english extraction ... with a very large fortune of his own .
what 's henry 's last name ?
graham .
alright  alright .
you wo nt get away with it , henry graham .
let me see .
nw , i have to do smething .
very well , put him on .
mr graham .
one day before the ceremony that will unite yu as mn and wif .
lt me explin .
as henrietta 's friend and attorney , t behooves me to take on the ever npleasant role of th devil 's advocate .
and despit her assurances that yo are a man of means ...
excuse me , sr .
tea will be delayed by 7 minutes .
andrew , you had no right to do that .
i have nothing to hide .
the grahams have been with the same bank for six generations .. as mr mcpherson has undoubtedly discovered .
i 'm so srry , henry .
i hope you can substantte this hearsay , because i intend t sue yo fr slander 
i would n't be here if i could nt .
henrietta , her s a photostat of the orignal note .
now take a good look at t .
you 're still gn na sue me for slander , mr graham ?
yes , mr mcpherson .
i am still going to sue you for slander .
alright .
now , let 's put in this way , graham .
agreed 
let 's hear the reason .
i was going to use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affairs ... and then immediately fterwards ... kill myself .
yes , henrietta .
my life was over .
henry , why did nt you tll me ?
i wuld have married you the very first dy 
you do n't believe that garbage , do you ?
any sex-starvd half-wit wuld know tht 's just a line .
what 's the matter with you ?
you have been unbelievably cruel .
thank yu for keeping me alive , henrietta .
you 're welcome , henry .
i ca n't believe ths !
get off .
i beg f you , henrietta ...
 beg of you , henrietta .
do n't get carried away .
if he 's not really interested in your money , make him prove it !
i wold do anything in the world to prove to you , henrietta ... that i have n't the slightest interest at all in your money ... but there is absolutely no way i can do it .
there is no way .
i have a way .
but there is no way .
do n't listen to him , henrietta .
that way , people wo n't get the wrong mpression from his uncle the way i did .
you would like ... you would ..
are you crazy ?
have you gone totally out of your mnd ?
my idea was for hm to disclaim all your money  not to shre it .
it 's very naive of you .
and then people really would think ... that he was marrying me for my money 
this way he 'll already have all my money .
yo nincompoop !
how dare you call my fiancee a nincompoop ?
harold !
i thought you were going to play the bach .
this is what he told me to play .
that littl womn .
oh no .
she 's ..
harold , she 's unscrewing my montrosini .
i 'll screw it back when she leaves .
she s destroyng my living room .
why did i get into this ?
well , it 's not !
oh , sir , get a hold of yourself .
n , sir .
you will share things .
mcpherson sent you in here to find out what was going on ?
is h the groom ?
i 'll ask the questions from here on in .
henrietta , if  could just talk to you ...
who are you really ?
and i want real names or else you 'll regrt it .
i 'm ddi heinrich .
sir , you are hysterical .
you are due at the altar now .
i w n't move until she leaves .
get her out .
miss heinrich , i will escort you to the bathroom .
and she will not touch my things .
it 's time .
what are you doing up there ?
frank , i think one of my legs is shorter than the other .
it 'll get .. longer again after the ceremony 
henrietta , it 's not too late .
oh , henrietta , i just talked to his uncle ...
i 'll kill myself , henrietta ...
dearly beloved .
i 'll be leaving now .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay .
thank you .
erm , henrietta , i will use this chest and you can use tht one .
and i will unpack my wn things .
yes , henry .
then shll we unpack ?
it 's probably been classified for years ... but i might as well just try it anyway .
why not 
this is rally incredble 
commonly found n gardening sheds .
spreading and emulsfying agents .
soap , saponins , gelatin ...
get poison from gardening shed .
toxides : arsenic acid , sodm arsenite , boron cmpounds , cyanides .. cyo-cyenates and related compounds ...

either one is fine for me 
and when we both use th same bed , we 'll use this one .

hnrietta , whre is your other arm ?
it fits over one sholdr and the other one goes inside .
it 's very uncomfortable

here .

oh , really ?
well .. if it rally wrks , why change it ?
mr graham , on bhalf of the entire staff , i would like to welcome yo board ... and drink a toast to your success .
thank you very much , mrs traggert .
no , thank you .
mrs traggert ..
thre 's something about you that puzzles me .
surely , after having successfully managed .. to head the hosehold accounts ... to the tune of 35,000 tax-free dollars per year , for the past five years ... yo must have salted something away .
have i ever .
i 'm not including , of course ... the token salary f $ 800 a wek
four ... fur hundred .
oh .
you rceive as mad mney .
mrs traggert , you 're fired .
it means that you are a thief , mrs traggert .
on what gronds are you making this accusaton ?
if you are not out of this huse by 10 , i will call the police .
uh , eh ...
you , er , yo would n't like to hear my side of the story ?
alright , alright !
i 'm leaving .
john , do you think we ought to scrap our cars ?
huh ?
it would mean bankruptcy if we actually took them out on th road .
yeah , i have fiv .
well , five will do very nicely , john .
i 'll try to clarify it , john .
you 're being fird because you are a cheap crook .
i will shoot you as a trespasser ... with proved criminal intntions .
and i am an excellent shot .

i quit .
as for the rest of you , you have xactly two hours to get out .

he mans business !
henry , there are a lot of strange people in the house , who are they ?
they ar not people , henriett , they are servants .
yo know , henry , mrs traggert will b furous .
mrs traggert has been fred along with the rest of the staff .. so her motional responses need no longer cncern you .
fine .
henrietta , come , please .
thank you .
you may go , erica .
especially john .
we did n't vote n it , hnrietta .
i simply told them they were fired .
oh no , oh no , henry .
do you have an idea how much money has been spent to run this house ?
really , he hs hs finger on everything .
he co-signed ll of mrs traggert 's checks ?
he 's very thorough .
henry ...
she said it would be aser for her .
so i ...
i , er ... did .

never  er , nver mind ..
i would lke the bank to issue a statement covering all your accounts ... and plase instruct them that no check has to b drawn on any account ... unless it was co-signed by me .

it was hotter thn blazes , about 110 .
so we stayed in the house , in the air conditioning .
we just hung around , my sister and me and watched countless hours of daytime tv .
too hot to go ut .
we 'd melt in the sn .
that kaboom shook the room .
we trned , and int our house something slid .
the first silly thing we can d ...
w ll make a big mess .
but our parents were out .
they were gne for a week .
as for playing with glue , my sis said :
kids ned to hav fun .
he does n't seem well .
hey , woodchck , calm down .
just relax .
it s yo who smells bad .
said the kid in the lid .
as the water got deper , the woodchuck went :
blub !
it s okay .
said the kid .
i 'll pull on this chin so the water gos down 
it filled up the kitchen and bedrooms , and then ... it splashed out the door and into the street , whre it provided relief from the afternoon heat .
kids came frm all over to splash in the lake , not knowing the source was our potty break .
they 're swimming in water straight ot of our toilet .
think we shold tell 'em ?
yo 're rde , and yu 're naughty .
to mak matters worse ,  'm stuck in this potty .
perhaps you should nap .
said the kd .
i 've returned .
it would 've been sooner , but i needed a shower .
he opened the top and shouted :
let s play .
thn out sprang two kids , who rsponded :
they gave us a kiss ...
mwah .
th first kid was trouble , but these two seem wrse .
hi .
how you doing ?
kid 2 looked t mary , then whispered :
then they ran all around , doing impossible feats , acting like kids who 'v hd too many swets .
i 'm hungry .
he shot out the room and ran into the kitchen .
the san francisco treat 
hey , that was delicious .
i 'm hypoglycemic .
oh , no , yo must stop this 
said sis to kd 2 .
then the walls started cracking .
both :
we said it gain .
they stood there , dumbfounded .
as they loked at the damage , we knew we 'd be grounded .
give us a call , and we 'll come back to play .
we 'll rebuild your house and then paint it with glidden .
and tht 's what they did , and in less thn a jiffy  the house was rebuilt , and it looked really spiffy .
that night we ate well .
it had been quite a day .
but now life was happy .
can anyone hear me ?
i 'm still in the potty !

on the morning of february 30th .
i started drwing these weird characters .
we 're having soup today !

* just as chipper as i can be 
* got no cars nd got no worries *
all :

working with the wrners was a true joy 
we mde a series of buddy/warner cartoons .
and , of corse , bus driver bddy .

they lked hitting him with ther mallets 
but still , it was time for hm to g 
tht was the biggest mistake of my life .

announcer :

a real grinder 
guy by the name of , eh -- eh ...
oh , shrewd negotiator .
he was n't an gent .
he was a chicken .
 said , plotz  what 's the matter with you ?
feinman does n't know what he 's talking about .
a-nyway , we signed the contracts .
when i heard they signed a four-cartoon deal ,
if i remember it correctly , eh , they had flypaper stuck on their fannies .
never mind 
it was the stupidest thing i had evr seen .

he could do  buddy cartoon , sure .
it 's not that we dd n't get long ...
how can i put this 
i hate them .
so i had to take weed off the warner cartoons .
but he went on to direct hygiene films for the navy .
i won an award for how to shampoo , nd the sequel , how to rinse .
no director would get near the warners .
he let wakko direct .
what ayutz .
mm .
plotz was furious about that carton .
their agent was livid .
do n't you take that tone with me , laboo .
the warners are finished .
i was so sd when i heard the warners were n't gon na make any more cartoons .
i was such a fan .
with no cartoons to make , the warners were free run around th lot as thy plased .
wait .
i did n't say , smon says .
ykko and wakko would always pop out of something , give you a big kiss and say , uh --
no , that was n't it .

it used its claws to tear my living room couch to shreds 
had a sleep-away bed in it , with a foam-rubber mattress .
the very sam afternoon of that relaxing stroll forementioned .
anyway i did n't wan na pay extra for the delivery of the couch , so i decided to carry the couch home myself .

the landlord 's tale .
of th midnight rid of paul revere
on the 18th of pril in '75
if the british march
ready to ride and sprad the alarm
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swinging wide at her moorings lay
the somerset , british man-ofwar
a phantom ship wth each mast and spar
wnders and watches with eager ears
on th somber rafters that round him made
a moment on the roofs of the town
beneath , n the churchyard lay the dead
in their night encampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and stll
that he could hear like a sentinl s tread
a moment only he feels the spell
of the lnely blfry and the ded
where the river widens t meet th by .
a line of black that bends and floats
oh , my gosh !
on the opposite shore walked paul revere .
then impetuous stmped the earth
the belfry tower of the old north church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
one if by land or two if by sea .
and bneath , from th pebbles in passing , a spark
struck ot by a sted flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom nd the light
good stuff .
he has left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its dge
now soft on the sand now loud on th ledge
and the barking of the farmr 's dog
that rises after the sun goes down .
the brtish are coming !
he saw the gilded weathercock
gaze at him with a spectral glare
at the bloody work they would look upon 
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
in the books you have read
from behind each fence and frmyard wall
chasing the redcoats down the lane
the british are comng !
the britsh are coming !
and the mdnight messag of paul revere .
we 're finished .
the landlord 's tale jst does n't cut it .
paul revere 's ride .
perfect !

i guess it was th kind of age when you do n't want to do things with your prents .
i also remember my fther dragging me out by my ears , saying that i spent too much money .
a crowd hung around the machine and you had to wait t play .
i started playing t th local café 
took my books to study there 
sometimes it replaced studying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highst amount it could win , which was abut 15 games .
sll them 12 games .
if you say pinball , peopl are like , what ?
there are many kids today that do n't know what a pinball machine is .
and thy cme in here and they see something that they have n't seen in 25 years .
something that was a major part of their youth .
kids today do n't really understnd pinball .
the kids today , between th computer games and the home games , and the nintndos and th sega systems and gameboys , they just wo n't play pinball .
i can remember when i was growing up w used to eat all our meals at home .
and we used to go out for entertainment .
and now evrybdy eats ot .
everybody always goes to restaurants .
they do n't cook at home much 
publc places of amusement have been fallng by the wayside in america like crazy .
you ca n't find  pinball machne .
there 's no more arcades in malls .
th bars today have a megatouch , a jukebox and a pool tble .
pinball is finished in france .
in england it 's finished long time ago 
in italy you ca n't find one pinball .
in germany no n pinball .
even in belgium , t was a pinball pradise .
it 's finish .
they said pinball was dead 
it strts with one .
then another one .
i was otgrowing th family room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 games .
it was a very rapid decline int obsession , i think .
once you get the lure of the silver ball in you t 's like an addiction and you ca n't stop and i just kept , you knw .
you remember buying every on , where you got it from .
and just as i 'm thinking mybe i 'm not gn na do this ,
pinball wizard comes on the rdo and i think , no , i 'm goin ' 
26 hours later i 'm finally home , exhausted .
they really do n't seem to be machines 
and the way they talk to you , you find yourself talking to it .
extra ball !
you just cme in and dmire them .
shine a light
all my life t was pinball .
it 's my life .
like some people .
i like pinball .
pinball and girls .
but girls is finished .
hey , look at these guys !
they 'll all come over and hav a big party every wek .
steve 's stll kind of the centre .
1972 , my dad bought one fr my room .
from there on , it jst got pretty wicked .
i 've got them in every room in my house .
the pinball dungen .
the things i like i 'm vry obsessive .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect somethng , whethr it be pinbll machines , jaws memorabilia , i got ta have it all .
like it says , i wan na rock and roll all night and party every day .
it was dring th depths of the depression , the late 20s , arly 30s , where the coin-operated amusement game industry kind of got birth .
it literally was a nam because there were various pins that were hammered into  wood srface .
the games were evolving in the 1930s .
we have to outlaw it .
w ca nt control it .
but th majorty of product that was out there was for amusement only .
in the case of new york city , chicago and los angeles  being thre major metropolitan areas , as well as othr areas arond the nited sttes , pinball was banned .
it was this one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i got ta do something like that .
before that it was nothing but chance .
gottlieb ruled n the '50s and '60s .
before the city council in april of 1976
as well as a demonstration of pinball being a game f skill , as opposed to a game of chance .
businss was booming .
profit margins wre huge .
when we started solid state electronics on pinball mchines we were on the leading edge of technlogy .
mangers from the different restarants and the broadwy crowd .
kids always want some place to go , somthing to do .
i think that 's what gave growth to the arcade business .
naughty or whatever .
you could kind of do what you wanted .
it was more like hanging out with your friends .
wastng time .
proud to have in a frnch bstro in paris an american machine .
game over .
special target .
what is t that makes yu stop nd play one machine ?
it 's something that 's pitched towrds young males .
there 's not really a lot of female-friendly mages on these .
any violnt misogynist thing you want is there n pinball .
a lot of these machines have love scnes on them .
i 'm not in the supposing business .
what do yu think ?
you 'd have those centrefold images of young , rather buxom ladies , usually blonde , staring out of the machine at you , to inspire you .
but you believe it is ?
no question about t .
sexually frustratd people play pinball a lot .
guy has a hot ball and it 's just flying .
you 're getting ready to become ruler of the universe .
says williams perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been n my blood since i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
should have known i was going to be a collector nd i did n't start collcting until i bought this house in 1976 .
and the first game in my collection is my favourite game of all tme .
i always copy down serial numbers and i have a binder that i 've hand-typed since i do n't do computers yet .
to me i think it would be interesting ,
i have 300 games , whre they were at one time .
were they in joe 's bar and grill or somewhere down the street or at a shw ?
i have a column for the date .
nots .
 worked in the bowling industry for a lot of years .
and the last bwling alley i worked at closed down 12 years ago .
that 's why i collect flyers .
that 's why i collect what they call press photos .
they 're chronological .
there 's a lot of games are missing scorecards .
how they get lost over th years , it 's hard to believe  but they do .
in the front closet , there 's lots of binders in there also .
i was blessed with n nbelievable memory 
jokes .
is n't that good ?
i do n't think about what it 's worth cos i do n't want to sell it .
lot of work and when you 'r done and you turn it on and it does n't blow up , you feel real good .
i 'm a people person , i like people .
i looked forward to seeing people on monday , tuesdy , wednesday .
i nver had any brothrs or sistrs .
and my mom nd my ral dad got married and divorced twice .
and they say it 's kind of hereditary but my real dad smoked and drank and he was an alcoholc but i never did drink or smok .
the rush of being able to play any game you have t any given time by pshing the button , you ca n't explain it to pople .
i wake up and do it evry single day .
like an xtension of my hand or somthing , i guess .
thy 'll be in a bar  with their friend .
we just smile .
chicago is the pinball capital of the world .
we live here .
we need to have that fast turnaround .
each person does a little part of it nd passes it along .
tday , we 're the only company makng pinball machines and we strive to hve 10  of what that market once was .
it 's a modern car that has some of the look and fel and coolness of it and it s retro .
we 're th only pinball manufacturer .
gee , if i had just one more shot ,
i know i would have gotten it this time .
i had two balls lockd and i just got that last ball locked cos i did it last time .
we build workng models f things and thn w play with it .
but it tells us whether what we 're doing is gong to work or not work or be fun or not fun 
this is what the final version of the gam looks like when it 's finally produced .
it s just you and the track now 
it 's what pople sad i was gong to be .
and that 's what i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothing .
a nice sound .
being a programmer by trade
i mean  for m this is like a little mini world .
so when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it 's having fun inside ts own little world and you 're helping it long .
little fish in the tank having fun 
from displays t alpha numerics .
pinball lost a market of players because of their technologically nhanced games .
i love strtegy .
it 's about chievement , it 's about goals .
and you go , oh , i see , if i do ths and this , i gt one of those .
piece of cake .
and then you ply it tn times in  row and you do n't do it .
and yu 're like , oh , i can do that .
for instance , in pirates a vry bvious strategy is to get time lock lit .
the ball will bounce arond for three seconds while the post is p .
the post cmes down and it still may bounce around .
and all the while you complete these lights .
so then i get the ship multiball , which is the shp .
so you shoot the ship , you shot the ship .
i find that very satisfying 
it just happens to come in a box .
like a slot machine .
an operatr comes along and collects the money .
he can win a free game .
evn with a little glory .
the knocker goes off in a crowded bar .
i did that , i made that go off , ok ?
whn you hear them cussing sometimes , or trying to kick the gam to get some action , you know you 're getting the results that you want , you know .
and you see them putting more coins in and you say , i made t .
put another quarter in the pinball
everyone jokes about thre 's some sickness  there 's some insanity .
but it 's kind of lik a geky thng is probably the way pinball 's perceived by the outsiders .
how do you perceive pinbll 
we are from tkyo , japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and then now t seems lmost lk a definition of a nerd or a weird and marginal person to be caught playing pinball .
but maybe there 's something ttractv abut tht .
i 'm the jim morrison of pinball .
i think it 's great fr pinball .
i think the pingeek is good .
i have n't met anybody like him before .
i wan na start with this one because it is very hard to fnd .
i 've got it .
i lve pinball .
i wn na show this one .
96  of my ideas pan out to money .
 m here to save a hobby that saved my life .
i love music .
i was pretty mch raised in arcades , because of divorce issues and just a mess 
and say , hey , i ve arrived for the show .
and guess who my ride is ?
she drops me off .
eltn john was the ultimate showman in the '70s .
i want to be a showman .
and maybe that 's not the colest thing .
everybody tlls me to tke these drugs , i should be in an institution .
i get so much crap advice that i 'd be dead and bankrupt if i listened to it .
talk to ach other and there might not be all this fighting and shooting .
whatever happend to just ging into a bar like john wayne .
and then you have a drink over it later .
i 'm defintely misunderstood , yu know .
but i tended to back away and said it 's not really man against machine .
if i can snse the rhythm of that game , the tempo of that game , i wan na be working in tandm with it .
i 'm not fighting it .
i 'm working wth t .
i guarntee yu it 's chemically smilar to that of athletes .
when athletes get in the zone , they fel as though they 're watching themselves run the ball down the fild .
pinball reminds me of like dreaming .
becase like when i 'm playing the gam it 's like er ...
i 'm not really with like realty .
but yet yu r watching what yu 're doing and trying to concentrate .
it really is a unique feeling to becme on with the machne .
it 's sort of a zen where you 're sort of meditating and that 's all yo 're concentrated on is the pinball .
you forget everything else .
you ca n't lose the ball out the mddle .
and you stretch it out nd you embellish it and you let all the people watching know tht look t this person , this person 's just done  very difficult thing .
when you get to put your initials on it 's like , there i am 
i own this game .
i put a lot of play time in on this machine .
i try to defend it .
that 's my home territory .
i was just simply ahed of the machine .
i was accumulatng so many free games .
and eventually after about three or four hours i had to go 
so in a sense there is a possibility you have the illuson that you ve won .
there is something inevitable about losing at pinball .
because ther is a feeling often when you 're playing pinball tht the machine decides when you need to go home .
the object of play in pinball is a high score .
when you see a truly skilled pinball player , you realise t is a game of skill , nt a game of chance .
it 's pure adrenaline .
now what you have are players who control the temp of the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honesty .
there are times when i stand back and marvel t the fact that they have the ability tht they have .
i look t a gme , i try to find a weakness and exploit that weakness for my own game .
this is  sport .
to stand and stay fcsed for that long , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shoulders .
i 've always wantd to be champion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnyvale , californi .
i started playing when i was ten years old .
yeah  it 's the whol thing .
pinball 's gotten a lot more complicated nowadays .
it 's becoming more and more unclear t me how people are getting big scores .
yeah , somtimes you see it all when you 're playing really well .
i can see a ball going towards the out lane at 12 inches away and know to do smething right away .
i 'll nudge th machine nd when the ball gets there t just dos this thing off the post and rolls in .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off with whatever .
he 's got this rtine that 's only his .
i wan na do what he 's ding 
and i could be like on one hand and one heel .
you know , what i really wanted to do
was play pinball but , gee  my mom tld me that i should get a carer .
because i have pinball as my own world .
a diamond n th rough that  have personally shned .
pinbll 's something that 's done something for me that i had to discover fr myself .
that was lready there in a world that gives s all kinds f input about stuff that we do n't ven want to hear other people 's input about .
and  knew that all that input was mistaken 
pinball is a world of special rules and unique opportuntes .
i wuld even go as far as say i am special becaus of pinball .
i 've always played pinball .
you 'd choke , you would n't do well , and you 'd have to wat a year to try again .
but pay no mnd to it .
there 's a strong mental component to remain calm and in control .
the best players nver do smething that affects the ball unless they do t for a purpose .
and ball control does n't mean lways catching the bll , it means putting the ball where you want it so you know where it 's going to be nxt , not just where it is right now .
my mother lives with me in new jersey .
when i tell her i 'm going , she said , go ahead and enjoy yourself .
you 've got ta have some fun so go enjoy yourself .
six million !
basically i 'm a synthetic organic chemist actually working on trying to find a treatment for alzheimer 's disease .
i really have n't made it to finals in a major tournamnt in a while .
i did it once in '99 , but i got eliminated unfortunately .
surprising villages , floding cities nd towns ..
the strm is my nickname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so pinball and i kind of grew up together .
and i want to beat the best .
it makes it much easier to live thinking that i 'm the best and i just have n't had my moment .
what 's really important when you play pinball at the world championship level is to get your mentality straight 
because everyone is so good that yo need the mental edge .
and if you can balance those two things you 'll be unbatable .
and i feel like an outsider .
i feel kind of like ... someone that they all think they 're better than 
and i know for a fact that  cn beat them .
one of the gentlemen here , nel shatz , has been in the finals thre or fur times .
and it s like if there is a pinball gd maybe they 're cursing him because he 's second or third place , and he 's so great he deserves to win finally and so if i were to pick someone to win ,
bt sure , yeah , it 's tough but  enjoy just the thrill of cmpetition .
what can we expect this morning  guys ?
absolutely i think those guys are simply better players .
lyman sheats .
lyman sheats .
best player in the world .
i programme pnball machnes .
 work with designers and basically mak the game do all of what it does .
i ws in college , t was around 1986 .
it was abot fiv years after that that i started competing .
the easiest thing is to hit the flippers indivdually .
i do n't know ...
you know , when they first play .
multiball here .
ging to try and get one of the balls over the other flipper to make a shot .
score some points .
and i watched this person methodically d  passing shot ovr , make the shot , kick down , go p , passing shot , over .
so i bunce the ball over to the other flipper , now it 's under control .
i never thoght of playng pinball that wy .
you say  pinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are .
wrld pinball championships .
and within ne wek there was a hurricane named ivan that came up the east coast and the little crek in front of here overflowed its banks .
nd there was nothing to be done .
everything we had just finished was washed away .
i was just frustrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up so i could decid if i wanted to try again .
it did prove possible to clean up and rebuild .
yu can have a great game .
thre are a couple of peple who are high-qulity players .
very focsed when they play , tough to beat .
on slip and the ball goes .
and that 's it .
it certainly presnted an entertainment optin that was awfully compelling .
in 1980 you could not possibly build enough video gmes to saturate the market .
and all of a sudden our income doubled and tripled overnight .
it just blew me away 
nd then the pinball sat there almost forlorn-looking .
yo ca n't see anything except the screen .
whn you play pinball you 're playing a piece of eqipment that you can move around and control .
pinball machines you ca n't do that .
it 's  pnball machine .
there 's a beginning bt it 's endless .
 finished it .
the real backbreaker came when home video finally hit the marketplace .
of either myself playing at home or me and my buddy plying at home .
but it really spelled the end of certainly the pinball er .
it was widely believed at the time that video gmes hd usurped pinball and there was no longer a need for pinball whatsoever .
pinball was back on the map again .
fter a decade of decline , flippers re flappng .
bumpers are thumping .
pinball is bouncing back .
i had a lot of life tied up in it .
it was really a presence and just the daily nteractin of the world that i had at my doorstp that i knew i was never gon na have again .
it was a life-defining moment that saddens me and still saddens me actually .
i go out now and i see some of my old friends and i play pinball and that 's nice .
that 's just never gon na happen for me gan .
so if you look at the downside of it all , pinball deserves a better fate than what it currently has .
in truth it is n't a big part of our culture any more .
but i 'm not sure that anyone will cre in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball not to survive , the world would continue but a lttle bit of the fabric of life would be gone 
i think that there is a fleeting sense of one 's naveté and innocence that games bring out 
and as we get older , for many of us , w step awy from dong those things that gave us jy when we wre younger .
and i think that that loss of innocence is tough .
and everybody should try t at sme point in time .
you have a universe in a box .
under glss .
t 's very strange , very strange .

it s because he so smart
i 'm tired of being treated like an ld work rat
they are uncouth and failed to apprciate my better qualities
today over lunch i tried to improve moral and build a sens of camaraderie among the man
by holding  humoros rond robin discussion of the early days of the mssion
these man do not want a happy ship
i have finally identified the malfunction
communicatons laser number 17 has been damaged

bomb # 20 to sergeant pinback roger , i rad you , continue
yo re now in the emergency air lock

sr 
but i think this is important , sir i think i 've found the malfunction
have you checked your platinum eridium energy shield ?
armed
lieutenant dolittle , hello !
hs now been activated and will switch into a test mode
if you will look ner the surface door
the laser will now energize please stand clear of the path of the beam
thank you for observing all safety precautions
well , everything sounds fine
thanks
i read the sam here
i do n't know if you can hear me
but i 'm gong to try to adjust the cue switch on the laser
well .. her goes ...
my eyes  my eyes !
attnton , attention the laser has malfunctined
to do so wll cause immediate ...
bgin primery sequence
mark at 5-4-32-1-drop .
this is lieutenant doolittle calling bomb # 20
do you understand ?
i m programmed to detonate in 14 minutes 30 seconds
bomb , this is doolittle
i red you , lieutenant doolittle but i am programmed to detonate in 14 minutes
detonation will occur at the programmed time
attention , attention i have sustained serious damge
wich will confine the explosion to an area one mle in diameter
commander powell , this is doolttle
doolittle , you mst tell me one thing .
they.. they broke up they disbnded over 15 years ago
ah ... pity , pity ...
ah , so many malfnctions ...

i 've forgotten so mch since i 've been in her 
the time is running out .
commander  hello ?
com in
commender powell , hello
doolittle , hello ?
sorry , i 've got a blank
hold it
i frget so many things n here s many things
hold on , just a minute
let me think ...
but you ca n't explode in the bomb bay couse it 's foolish
yo 'll kill us ll there 's no reason for t
i am programmed to detonate in 9 minutes
would you consider another curse of acton
bomb !
oh , yes
talk t the bomb
but i have been talkng to it , sir and pinback is talking to it right now .
dolittle ?
six minutes to detonation !
doolittle , what the hll are you doing ?
are you with me ?
how do you know yo xist ?
what the hell s he doin ' 
it is intitively obvios
intuition is no proof
this is fun .
now listen , here is the big question
how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct ?
the gun !
gun 
gun !
no , boilr , you out of your mind
you 'll hit the bomb doolittle is talking to the bomb
you are bad sht , he 'll save us you can sht at
what i 'm getting at is this
and this sensory data is merely a stream f electrical impulses
in other words , all that i really know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
no , now give me the gun
to explode , of course .
that is correct .
of corse not .
well then
so f you detonate in ...
nine seconds ...
you could be doing s on the basis of false data .
you have no proof that it was correct data 
attention , attention the bomb has returned to th bomb bay
the destruction sequence is aborted
pinback ?
hello ?
hello , anybody !
i 'm coming in nw i 'm down by the emergency air lock
you are now leaving the emergency air lock
thank you for observing all safety precations
hello , pinback ?
what 's up doolittle ?
turn on his helmet radio so i can contact him
what 's wrng , i did n't hear ...
talby , can you red me ?
help , doolittle , help me !
alright , bomb
therefore , i shall ignore you .
false data can act only as a distraction
threfore i shall refuse to perceive you 
hey , bomb
doolittle !
calm down ,  'm coming .
and in addition to the darkness there was also me
and i saw that i was alone .
hey , bomb 
dolittle , where are you 
here i am
i 'm spinning
we 're falling in opposite directions away from ech other
what happened , dolittle ?
the ship blew up ?
what ?
funny , i thought i have the damn thing cnvinced
boiler ?
maybe not maybe there is  way
it looks like the skippr he made t .
talby , looks lik i 'm haded for the planet going right toward t .
what a beutiful way to d ...
guess you 're right .
doolittle , i 'm heading right toward smething it 's behind me , in the distance
something that glows 
i 'm gong into them i 'm gong to hit them
doolittl
yeah ?
you were my favorite
to circle the univrse..
forever
i 'm with them now ...
be back this way again sme day
i think i ve figured out a way !
so , what 's the story ?
the story is about ... a girl of about 14 or 15 ,
wh 's out riding her bike .
and i 'm in a rolls ...
i 'm not prince charming , that would be pushing it ...
i take her to a rather unusual hotel .
then she wants to see england again , she 's english  and the plane crashes .
you 'll have to explain that a bit .
in new guinea , there 's an ndigenous people , the papuans , who practice this airplane worship , the cargo cult .
they see these things flyng over ther heads without ever seeing them land , and they want to benefit frm them .
so they want the planes to crash t get their hands on the freight .
i draw a prallel with melody 's death , who was killed in a plne crash .
and i hope that one of thse cargo planes will fall with melody in it .
bring her back .
the transposition of etrnal love .
i 'm not a cynic , as others maintain 
and my candour .
they confused candour with cynicism .
in fct , what you call ... ugliness is something you mad into  style through your desire for perpetual cndur .
i wrote somewhere that when i 'm called ugly , i laugh quietly so you do nt awak .
i 've had pretty women  i hve the most beautful now , s my gliness ... those who ar bothered by it ..
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah !
hey there , baby 
yeah , whtever .
nt now , kid .
i hope you do n't take this the wrong way or anything , but thre 's just to big of a gneration gap between the two of us .
but all i want to know is what time it is .
how about a kiss there , missy ?
ooh !
oh !
baby !
uhh !

stephen house of the lndon exchange telegraph .
narrator :
long before borders were drawn before the reign of genghis khan nomadic tribes have roamed the remote altai mountains of asa .
and for cuntless generations , this precious skill has typically ben handed down from father to son 
but this reltionship between man and bird is finite .
custom dictates that after seven years of lyal service an eagle must be returned t the wild to contine the circle of life .
my dear eagl .
we have been together for a long time .
and you have only brought good things t me .
aisholpan :
my name is isholpan .
i was born in the altai mountains .
there it s .
nurgaiv :
there it is .
i lve my dad .
my dad and my grandpa are eagle huntrs .
nurgaiv :
it is not a choce .
it 's  calling that has to be in your blood 
the horses th clothing , the equipment .
aisholpan :
plase hold it gently .
but i do n't resent that .
grat .
nurgav :
she holds the eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her blood as well .
aisholpan 
because all the men in my family have been eagle huntrs my dream is to become the frst eagle huntress in mongolia .
narrator :
girls do not eagle-hunt .
they get cold .
bt i thnk girls and boys are equal .
girls can do anythng boys can f they try .
my father taught me ...
... and  do nt want to let her down .
nurgaiv :
yeah .
nurgaiv :
raise your arm !
that 's good !
launch it this way .
pay attention 
ar you tired ?
we go to school by the syr river because there is no school in our area .
let 's play again !
i 've ben living her since the 2nd grade .
aisholpan :
we are at school for only 5 days .
i tke car of them .
all :
i feel good .
isholpan :
but right now , all i can think about is becoming an egle huntress .
s dinner ready ?
plce the spoons .
may god bless you .
nurgaiv :
quck , feed this tough child .
untl now aisholpan has been using her father 's bird to learn the basics .
since she is srious  figure , let her bring p her own eagle and train it .
today  there 's the rare opportunity to seize a 3month-old eaglet from  nearby mountain .
may we be so lucky 
do you see , my child ?
we 're going to hve to climb up that side and then descend frm the top .
do not be afraid , okay ?
it 's a strong knot !
hold on tightly .
in the name of god .
give me some more rope  dad .
back , back .
do n't be scared .
aisholpan :
hold tight i said .
aisholpan :
yeah , yeah .
go slowly .
no more slipups !
yes .
look !
there are two eagles nesting sid by side .
nurgv :
yep !
you got it ?
bring it over this wy .
this way .
let it go a little bit more .
tht 's it .
pull t .
aisholpan :
here you go .
nurgaiv :
hurry !
do n't pull .
give me some slack on this other rope .
let it out more !
isholpan :
shuld i reel it in now ?
we did it !
nurgaiv :
this eaglet is a sign of good luck !
i 'm exhaustd !
nurgaiv :
you proved yourself today .
thanks .
woman :
wind speed wll be from 3 to 8 meters per second .
air temperature will be 8 to 13 degrees celsius .
let me compete in the festival this year !
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
please ?
do n't worry !
we would freak out like crazy !
aisholpan :
yes .
isholpan :
yes .
do you call , hey , agle , come back hre , please ?
huukaa !
huukaa 
is it afraid of other people ?
of course !
ow !
aisholpan is ging to be n eagl hunter 
grandpa :
really ?
this is an important task .
both are young .
can you give your blessing to aisholpan ?
aisholpan !
may god help you pursue the hunter s path .
may you grow ld like me with yellow teeth .
i entrust that eagle to you .
this will be a beast catching bird .
let it get old with yo .
eagle huntrs will train their daughters to ride horses thn hold a bird .
t is a shame to do s for the bird .
they do not knw how to properly approach the egle .
th eagle is very picky about people .
it demands respect and courage .
anyhow , she will have t get married at one point or another .
nurgaiv :
it 's all we 've ever known .
woman 
good morning , dear radio listeners .
nurgaiv :
narrator :
s their relatinship deepens , the eagle learns to listen for her call .
as they start to work as a team , the response times improve .
woman :
as the festivl draws near , the excitement builds across the rgion 
let 's go .
probably the most important part of the festival .
with calling the judges look at horse riding style eagle 's landing and eagle flyng style .

horror !
oh , blushing buds of ver-bloomng bauty
how pitiful his tale
how pitiful his tale
oh , is there not one maiden breast
which does not feel the moral beauty
of making worldly interest
subordinate to sense of duty ?
all matrimonial ambition
to rescue such a one as i

re your pirate caravanserai
and fther is  major-general
yes , yes , i am a major-general
he is !
hurrah for the major-general
to be a major-generl
i am the very model of a modern major-general
i m very well acquainted , too , with matters mathematicl
i understand equations , both the simple and quadratical
i 'm very good at integrl and differential clculus
in short , in matters vegetble , animal , and minral
in fact , when i know what is meant
by mamelon and ravelin
whn such ffairs as sorties and surprises i 'm mre wary at
and when i know precisely wht is meant by commissariat
when i hav larnt wht progress has ben made in modern gunnry
when i know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery
in short , when  've a smattering of elemental strategy
strategy ?
oh , my word .
wait a minute .
cup of tea .
has only been brought down to the beginning of the century
but still , in matters vgetable , animal , and mineral
encore !
can you do it one mor time ?
and can you do t really fast ?
in fact , when i knw what is mant by mamelon and ravelin
when i hav learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
n short , when i 'v a smattering of elemental strategy
oh , you must n't do that !
ooh !
what are you ?
i gather that .
anythng else 
no , nothing else .
we object to major-generals as fathers-in-law .
but we waive that point .
do you man to say you would rob me f thes , the sole remaining props of my old age 
to them , lads .
on moment .
oh , dash it !
i ask you have you ever known what it is to be an orphan ?
often !
yes , orphan .
i say , oftn .
often , often , often .
i tell yu , hang on a minute .
now , listen , i do n't think we quite understand one another .
i only repeated it once .
ooh !
now , when you sy orphan ,
frequently .
seize that man !
an orphan boy ?
these children whom you see
por fellow
se , at our feet they kneel
ur hearts we can not steel
orphan boy
indulged in n innocnt fiction
which is not in the same category as telling a regular trrible story
which will tend to diminish his glry
it is easy , in elegant dictin
to call it an innocent fiction
but it comes in the same catgory
it 's easy  in elegant diction
although our dark career
we rather think that we 're
we 're lways sorry to bgin it
for wht , we ask
is life
without a tuch
hail , poetry
thou heaven-born maid
tho gildest even
all hail
emollint !
you may go , for you 're at liberty
and honorary members of our band
we do elect you

well , be comforted , sir .
 tell you , frederic , such is the anguish and rmorse i fel at the abominable falsehood by which i escaped these easily deluded pirates  that i would go to ther simple-minded chief this very night and confess all .
but did i not feel that the conseqencs would be oh , oh , h , n , oh , n , no , most disastrous , most disastrous to myself 
at 11:00 .

these attentins are well meant
tarantara
clculted men to cheer
in a highly nervous state
and before all links , we sever
we will say farewell forever
all in vain their mercy crave
we observe too great a strss
on the risks that on us press
to our chance of coming back
still perhaps it would b wise
not t carp or criticize

how dare ye face me ?

have mercy on us have mercy on us
hear us , ere you slughtr
yet , mercy should alloy our stern resentment
we tried to raise our spirits faint
but all n vain the quips we heard
oh .
until t somebody occurred
a startling paradox
a most ingenious paradox
the paradox
to which , however , i 'v n desire to be disloyal
who ?
i do n't know who
very likely the astronomer royal
has decided that
if it were owing to the agency of an ill-natured fairy
you 'll esily dscover
that though you 've lived 21 years
yet , if we go by birthdays
you 're only five and a little bit over
let s see !
five and a quarter , oh , that 's rich !
at common sense she gaily mocks
years 21 i 've been alive
yet , reckoning by my natal day
a paradox , a paradox
a curious paradox
a most ngenious pardox !
most absurdly whimsical .
five-and-a-quarter , eh 
you would n't think it to look at me .
i 'm afraid you do n't appreciate the delicacy of yor position .
you were apprenticed to us .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no  no .
oh .
and going by birthdays , you r as yet only five-and-a-quarter .
and t any price
i wll do my duty .
you 're one of us once more .
tht 's the ship .
i will tell her i am bound by duty and my moral senses
so t relly does n't mtter , matter , matter  matter , mtter !
i shuld show you in a moment how to grpple with the question
full of excellnt suggstions when i feel a little better
what we sing dos n't mtter what we sing does n't matter
no , it really does n't matter
mattr , matter , mattr , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
if i had been so lucky as to have a steady mother
and i might have lived and died a very decent indiwiddle
if it is , it des nt matter if it is  t does n't matter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
oh , hrror !
what 's the matter ?
oh , yes , he did .
t breaks my heart to betray the honord father of the girl i adore .
brak it .
and yet , as your apprentice , i have no altrnative .
... that general stanley ...
well , he is no ...
you mean , orphan , a prson that has lost hs parents or often , frequently ?
a persn that has lost his parnts .
what ?
what ?
oh .
he never was one !
am i to understand that in order t save
we will go and collect our band and attack tremorden castl this very night .
not a word !
i burn , this bse dception t repay
ere i expire
it strikes me to the core !
and , in return , tonight the traitor dies
yes , yes !
tonight he dies
yes , or early tomorrow
they will wlter in sorrow
to abuse it shall perish
away , away !
away !
tonight the traitor dies !
nay , mabel , nay !

i must obey
ah , leave me not to pine
no happiness

even after
oh , here is love
here 's love
no , i am brave
come one and all  undunted men in blue
when th danger 's near
we manage to appear
s insensible to fear
young frederic was t have led you to death and glory
he will not so led you
for he has alled himself once more
with his old assciates
you speak falsely
he has acted nobly
his heroic sacrifice to his sense of duty
he hs done his duty , i will do mne
we must do our best to capture these pirates alone 
it is most distressing to us to be the agents
whereby our erring fellow-creatures
are deprived of that liberty
when a felon 's not engaged in his emplyment
or maturing his felonios little plans
is just as great as ny honest man 's
when constabulary duty 's to be done
to be done
ah , take one consideration with another
a policeman 's lot s not  happy one
to be dne
a policeman 's lot s not a happy one
a rollicking band of pirates we
are trying their hand at a burglary
with weapons grim and gory
with stealthy steps the pirtes are approaching
we are not coming for plate or gold
for general stanley s story
they seek a penalty fifty-fold !
they seek a penalty fifty-fold
for genral stanley 's story
silence !
go on .
upon our prey we steal
our cautious way we feel
w never speak a word

let 's vary pracy
take another station
with a little burglary
and your skeletnic keys

sm , you were the colonel 's oldest friend .
never 
the minute we paid hr off .
it ought to .
that yung woman has us over a barrel .
i can see the headlines :
founder offamily magzine dies in love nest with a naked nymph.
and a smile on his face .
what are we going to do ?
where ?
where 's a bettr place to show the world how much she 's gon na miss the colonel ?
so we will know thursday 
the bank committee meets wednesday .
we 'll hve the funeral tuesday .
that'stomorrow .
what abot all the prparations ?
what made you ask that ?
just my feminine sense of greed .
what 's that ?
i have n't met him yet .
guss who this is .
you ought to see a doctor .
but , honey , i am a doctor .
how was florida ?
oh , it was all right .
but i 'm glad i 'm back .
oh , yourfolks ar in town ?
oh , well , that makes me fel better .
how about the four of s getting together , say , wednesday night ?
h , tht 's fne .
fine .
godbye , dear .
bye .
i do n't know why yo even went to florida .
deserve him .
you 're on the bargaining committee .
oh , no , harry .
union-wise , you 're in the big time .
now , do n't be upset if i do some table-pounding .
but i am wrried 
the union committee is her .
joe kowalski .
bsolutely ridiculous .
seems pretty reasonable .
it sems reasonable on the surface .
but can mangement live with it ?
that 's not an answer , it s an ultimatum .
i said that .
what do you think , miss 
research ?
where s it ?
i was just saying the other day in health and welfare , we really should ...
yes , two b 's .
miss robbins , we 've got a very important agenda here 
whn it comst frnge benefits , i 'd say the nion 's getting all the benefits and management 's left holding the fringe .
well put .
lok , if yo do n't wan na negotiate , we 're walking out .
oh , just a minut 
i have a better idea .
now , a subcommittee oftwo is an excellent suggestin , but any feeling-out process should logically tak place between members ofthis group who have n't displayed antagonism towrds one another .
now , you do nt feel antagonistic towrds me , do you , miss robbins ?
good 
nor i towards you .
so it seems logical that you and i should meet .
no use wasting valuable working hours .
meeting adjourned .
oh , i ..
d nt take them .
it must be that bathing sut i bought in palm beach .
thy were having a sale at this little plac ...
ths is n't my coat 
ryder building , new york , new york.
i guess it is my coat , is n't it .
marge .
just gve m the chance .
well , it 's too important a step to just rush into like tht .
health and wlfare fond me a nic mtel narthe beach .
it was 7 dollars a day , includng a continental breakfast .
but i was n't intrested in that kind oftraveler 's aid 
that eliminated just bout everything that 's any fun .
there  was , trespassing in the garden of an xclusive htel , pretending to be one fthe elite .
with all the romance around me , thre i was with my partner  a very romantc sort of fellow 
full of air .
help !
he seemed to be drowning .
and i was wearing my flowered chiffon that cost me two whl months without dessert .
help !
i relized at once that poor mr. hackett had been drinking .
that was his nme , kirby hackett , ofhackett indstries 
so i decided to help him up to his room .
as long as he was sound asleep , i decided to get dried off .
that was my third mistake .
mr. hackett had been playing possum .
please , i 'm not dressed 
mr hackett !
i wnt through some curtains .
there was a man in bd .
frank sinatra .
oh , marge .
our colonel ryder ?
yes .
oh ,  'm prfectly willing to lsten to the other half 
mr. hackett !
bright and early the next morning ,
i got a phone call .
it was mr. hackett .
becaus i do n't deserve it .
oh , marge .
i refuse to be obligated to a man who practclly drowns himself just to get me up to his room .
okay , okay , now , what bout colonel ryder ?
now  you get to the pension plan before you finish yourfruit salad .
important .
yes , harry .
seniority rights , roast dck .
yes , harry .
yes .
stand pat .
thank you .
penny forpenny .
i may have t get hold of you in a hurry some night .
463 east 76th .
if your uncle had nt ben colonel ryder , what do you think you 'd be doing now ?
playing golf , i guess .
i started just one stp below .
i had the experience , but i had to keep prving to the ryders .
if you 're a relative  you 're supposed to be an idiot .
seniority rights ...
excuse me .
seniorty rights .
an old man s like n old car .
your spark plugs were stuck .
you do n't just thrw an old man on the scrapheap forthat .
and then you give him another chance .
seniority rights , fringe benefits and pension plan .
what do you say we take the rest ofthe afternoon off .
why did you pck on me to do the negotiating ?
but you see , i 'm in research , mr. ryder , and i 've been doing quite a bit of research on you .
and i m afraid i 'm not yurtype at all .
you 'r a god researcher , but d n't believe everything you read .
well , i would lke to do some shopping .
okay .
just wht i had in mind .
why do nt you use my car .
and i 'll drop off at the club , take a cold shower .
yes , thank you .
just one moment .
but when i opened the box , i discovered it was n't the bathing suit i bought on sale in palm beach .
yes .
yes .
thre seems to be a problem with this lady 's coat .
isthere something wrng with the coat ?
oh , no , not t all .
oh , yes .
oh , but there is a mistake .
i see .
it 's already paid for .
i hav n't done anything to earn it .
h , i mean , all i dd wastak him up to his room nd put him to ...
well , i did .
will you tell mr. hackett i returned the coat ?
i do n't care ifhe went to devil 's island in a canoe 
how much is th cat ?
eleven thousand dollars .
are yo sure you would n't like to think this over ?
i 'm in no hurry if yo 're not .
thre 's another 5 .
vertime .
oh , no , not miss robbins .
thank you .
i wish somebody would test my principles .
as lng s you kep out of chinese restaurants .
pardon me .
oh , wonderful .
oh , marge , that was just hs business sense .
are we talking about the same colonel ryder ?
but talk about raw emotion !
i ve been looking for you .
forwhat 
union 's got three seats .
yu 're one fthem .
oh , harry , i could n't possibly .
it 's not just tears .
i mean , i cry .
at funerals ?
she better stay way from my funeral .
the great mn that we have gathered to honortoday volunteered once mre for military duty .
and in six months ofhard , grinding toil , he brought chaos ..
and that christmas  i my now reveal , not a single dough boy in the front lines not one had to do without a slice ofmom 's fruit cake .
once  even cried at an auto show .
you go on , harry .
that 's our girl .
you recognize her ?
even with her clothes on .
she 's our blackmailer .
they never are .
there 's no use arguing .
i 'm going strght upstairs and apologize to mr. ryder .
cased blackmailer 's partment .
you mean you were spying on her ?
washd hair .
washed dishes .
better get down to work .
i still ca n't believe she did it 
oh , no .
gentlemen , i 'd say miss robbins had us over a barrl .
are we sure this isthe girl we re looking for ?
of corse we are 
lasker identified her , did n't he ?
mr. ryder ...
and  say that a person is innocent until provn guilty .
how do we know she 's guilty ?
those earrings .
cold be a cincdence .
ten thousand !
if she really wasthe blackmailer , where would sh be now ?
mr. ryder .
in my office , waiting to see me .
she said it was important .
to see me ...
careful , tony .
sticky , tricky .
good morning , mr ...
thank you .
sit down .
thank you .
i know what you must thnk of me , mr. ryder .
but honestly , i could n't help what happened .
no , it was n't anybody 's fault .
oh , believe me , i did n't wan na go .
and you wre dazzled , huh ?
dazzled ?
well , that is a betterword , i guess .
h , i 'm sure you could think of a bettrword 
especially when  think about all those wonderful poems colonel ryderwrote .
po . ?
oh , they were so sensitive and passinate .
love is a wild volcano seething with dark desre
yes 
you know , your uncle ws a very warm and tender man , mr. ryder .
oh , well , you must n't worry about that .
we both know why you came up here , right ?
now that we know where we both stand ..
yes .
no , we 'll talk .
what 'll we talk abut , fringe benefits ?
we 'll talk about loyalty .
why , no .

i think you 're a little unstrung by the funral .
if you ...

tak it or leave it 
oh , i 'll take it , i 'll take t !
good , good .
now , remember , d n't talk about thisto nyone .
well , why do n't you lok it up yourself .
how d you like that 
some wise guy trying to tell me we had  president named andrew jhnson .
 realize that you 're new in research  mr. lasker , but ifther are any more phone calls , especially about presidents i 'll be glad to take them .
oh , by the way do you and mrs. lasker bowl ?
i do .
that you bowl , i mean .
it 's so healthy .
the strangest thing just happened .
i have a dte with warren .
he 's herfiancé .
oh , marriage is a wndrful institution .
when'sthe happy event ?
oh , we have n't even set the dat yet .
dr. kingsley 's folks are in town .

tony ryder , that 's which nt .
i do n't cre what she called me orwhy .
we have n't learned a single thing from that electronic house dick .
we have a lead that could be vry good frus , mr. ryder .
we found out that this bab is engaged to a very respectable gy .
so ?
so get her married off and bingo , she 's off your back and out of your cash register .

i 'm hering your ravenous plea
when there is no honey the pooh takes the tummy
wherever the honey will be
and they will take care of my tummy and me

eeyore 's tal ?
what 's wrong with eeyore 's tail ?
oh , thank you , pooh .

for i am a bear of vry little brain and long words bother me .
it means th thing to do .
oh .
well , you sneezed just as you were going to tell m what the first thing to do was .
i did n't sneeze .
no , you did , owl .
you ca n't sneeze without knowing it .
first , issue a reward .
h 's doing it again .
no , no , no !
the word is issue , not achoo , and achoo is n't even a word .
it 's just a sort of sneezy sound like achoo !

its toes are black , ts fur is blue
i swear that all i tell yu is not made up
the backson the backson ?

~subtitle by joshua romel ladrera~
this is the stry of the day my life ended .
i 'm kidding !
everyone dyng t catch a glimpse of me..
i meant us .
well ...
we are gathered here today to celebrate the jining of rapunzel and eugene in marriage .
in everlsting peace .
may i have the rings 
had their loops in the lve and friendship .
frying pan .
relase the ducks 
that 's th ducks , release the lanterns .
happy birthday !
so , who want a piece of cake ?
is there a reson you 're calling first thing in the morning ?
he 's dead .
wh ?
ct the crap .
takayama ryuji , kill himself ?
or it might be something els .
it looks like they 're gon na have to do a little mre investigating .
sudden dath ..
it 's takayama ryuji .
yo plug the numbers int this chart and thn us the resulting abbreviation .
ripper .
takayama ?
ripper ...
there 's artrial blockage .
direct cause of death is heart attack brought on by blockage of the left pulmonary artery .
andou !
there was something strange n hs stomach .
he wold appear to have been something of a ...
trange man , would n't you agree 
his ex-wife , asakawa reiko .
that boy in the picture is their son .
but after that she returned home and retrieved her son 
and one of the ambulance crew saw her with a videotape taken from mr. takayama 's aprtment .
but the first persn to find his body was mr. takayama 's girlfriend .
she 's a gloomy one , though .
or questioning is n't going anywhere ...
this is dr. andou , who was in chrg of the autopsy .
to the doctor , this time 
whre , i wonder ?
tell us what you can recall .
i do n't know anything 
please nswr the question 
i do n't know anything 
i really do n't .
tell us what yu know .
you knew that takayma ryuji was meting with his ex-wife , did n't you ?
just a ...
before he ded ...
dr. takayam was investigating something with reiko .
investigating what ?
a videotape 
whoever watches it dies .
whoever watches it dies ?
yes .
that 's simply not possible .
mr. andou ?
yeah .
it was amazing .
he knew , did n't he ?
that you and i would meet like this 
why ?
this is stupid .
professor ?
professor !
hy !
a tumor ?
but ... this is n't malignant .
i could n't find anything like it .
there 's no way .
the smallpox virus was radicted ages ago .
wht about takayama 's girlfriend ?
she told me somethng a lot crazier thn a virs .
yo best tell me .
a videotape ?
yeah .
it 's the police .
they were in an automobile ccident .
luckily , the driver cam away with nly minr injuries .
we were just now able to remove the bodes .
though they 'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we contacted them ...
but ther 's somethng a little strange .
what are you doing !
sorry .
i was askawa 's senior co-worker .
vcr ?
he went to slep already .
i 'm just gon na check on him 
i 'm sorry .
i woke you up .
what is it ?
the child died , too ?
yeah , but he did n't die becaus of the accident 
he was already dead .
their son saw the video too , did n't he ?
this has nothing to do with a vide .
we know wht exactly what caused his death .
what did he say ?
leaving his dna in this world ?
mr. andou .
he ... saw something .
that mouse is glowing !
so it 's already progressed this far ...
that 's amazing 
do yo remember me ?
yes .
i 'm yoshino from nnb broadcasting .
is there something i can help you with ?
what 's that ?
record ?
four people ded of a heart attack at exactly the same time .
i now knw that one week earlier , the four of them had watched a videotape at a lodge in izu .
she watched it , and was sre that she too would die one week later .
thus , ided by takayama ryuji , she began her investigations , trying to uncovr everything she could about the videotape .
sadako 's mother , yamamura shizuko  was reportedly clairvoyant , which had the press all up in arms .
sadko was killed by her father .
sadako had the power to ly a curse n someone , and t kill them with it .
let me tell you about asakawa .
he killed himself .
he 'd wrtten will .
it said :
d n't worry .
this is yamamur sadako .
please , feel free to watch it if yu like .
do n't you think ?
prsent ..
sadako 
sadako !
forgive me sadako .
you were were never meant to be born into this world .
sadako !
you ca n't report this to the public at all .
that video ... it 's the embodiment of sadako 's hatred 
do you realize what you 're saying ?
i gave it to you already .
video ...
now wait just a minte !
give m tht tape !
we are through talking .
will you plase let go of me ?
lke you you 're about to die or something .
yeah ...
you want me to inject yu with some of that protein from the glowing jellyfish ?
the administrative autopsy was carried out in yokohama .
what 's more , the cause f the ttacks was a tumor in their bloodstream 
oh ...
but i do n't get it .
if it is a virus , why did n't asakawa reiko also die from a heart attack ?
because the cause of death is n't a virus .
a curs .
gim me a break .
to wipe that vide ff the face of this world .
he thught that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan .
he 's trying to get me destroy that video in exchange for granting my wish .
and what is your wish mr. andou ?
about what ?
that 's not what dr. takayama wnted .
what else could t be ?
dr. andou .
you have a phone call , from a reporter nmed mr. yoshino .
the well that sadako fell int .. by chance , is there a chunk missing out of ne side ?
you watchd the vido ?
to hell with this , all of it .
i 'm giving you the video .
i have n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appears in my dreams .
i just want to hurry up and forget all about this .
mr. yoshino ?
mr. andou ?
do nt look .
lt 's go 
it 's over now .
i 've put an end t yamamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm this video 's last victim .
you 've thought abut dying many times over .
nor is regretting tht you watched the video .
tht i let my son die 
just a little 
he was the only person that i could be with .
so i guess i ca n't lie to you .
t 's just like you said .
i 'm scared of dyng .
why did i watch that vido ?
is n't it painful ?
knowing how i feel ?
there were times when  thought it was just an excuse .
but he meant it .
nobody knows what 's gong to happen to them .
not me .
never seen anything like it , have you ?
i think he 'll trn up symptoms of the vrus as well .
his cause of deth was different ...
well , it 's interesting !
the data is then restructured inside the body , creating  virus 
that could be it !
think a moment .
she saw the video too , did n't she ?
you 're not mking  whole lot of sense .
listen to me .
when i watched the video , sadako 's memories entered my body .
i saw a hospital in the woods .
now you talk a hospital in izu from around that timeframe , what does that make you think of ?
tuberculosis ?
m !
where the hell dd she go ?
take a look .
it 's mtated .
what ?
they 're saying that the family wants to talk to you about how to proceed with the death crtificate .
probably .
i ll catch up with you later .
mr. maekawa !
 have never had a case like this before .
it ca n't be .
they appear to have found evidence indicating that she gave birth .
yes .
the building 's air vent ... it looked just lke a well .
yamamura sadako 's well ..
does it by chance have a chunk mssing out of one side ?
bt he still got infected with the virus .
why do you think that s ?
it 's asakawa reiko s notebook .
the color of the well , the way it looks .
it 's like i 'm actally there .
but that does n't mean that everyone des .
there 's a way to save yourself .
a way to save yourself ?
just reading it is enough t infect the reader with the virus .
she became yamamra sadako 's helper .
what did you do ?
i ...
you 're the only survivor 
lar !
give me back that notebook .
into mai 's womb .
why dd you have to kill mai ?
mai is n't dead .
all of mai 's memories are insid of me .
you are sadako 
not mai .
i wanted to help yu .
wht the hell do you know ?
you killed mi !
mai .
forgive me , mai .
i forgive you mr. andou .
know what ?
stop it , please !
sadako !
meeting him was wht allowed me to come back .
that 's why i was able to be rebrn .
that 's impossible .
so this tme , i want to help him .
we can do it if i use my womb ...
no .
there 's no way .
do this for me , and i can grant your wish too .
takayma !
then , return it to my wmb .
the memories prior to deth remain in the dna itself .
if you use one of my fertilized eggs , it should mature to the same age as when the person died within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones to quicken the rate of cellular divsin .
once this is put back into takano mi 's womb , we 're all finished .
yo look terrible .
w traitors , re n't we ?
but who have we betrayed 
what 'd yu think of my present ?
he is my brother , after all .
and the peple who read it ...
the vrus will develop inside their bdies .
what will the world become becaus of the virus ?
there will be more and more pople like sadko .
this virus will cause a change in humanity tself .
and now it 's time for that volution to proceed to the next level .
the world will change .
we have been drgged inside that vortex of change .
stay away from takanori .
just keep away .
is n't that right ?
let go of me .
goodbye .
takayama , do n't want your own child back ?
i could n't do such a terrible thng .
i could nt bring a child back into this world .
andou ... it will be a long , long time before there is peace again in this world .

professor emelius browne .
i do n't keep money in me ear .
yes , madam , a trick .
or to use a kinder word , an illusion .
but what is n't , in these troubled tims 
it is not what things are .
it is wht they seem to be .
is that not so , mdam ?
that ai n't the kind of professor i xpected .
i 'm not sure it s the kind of professor miss price expected eithr .
you se , it rally does n't matter what i do , what i do , as lng as i do it .. with a flair .
what effect a lttle smoke is .
with a dash of hocus-pocs and th scent of burning
i 'm a fraud , a hoke a charlatan  a joke
may i also draw your ttention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail .
now , i shall place the framed glass ... in this brown , unprepared- unprepared , mark you , ladies nd gntlemen ... unprepared brown paper bag .
and fix you with my best hypnotic stare
with my moans and groans and soporific tones
they have cheered me everyone
will mystify and disarm
it works
so it rally does n't matter what i brew , what i brew
as long as i brew it with a flair
though i 've never cast a magic spell
i 'm a rogue , a rake a mountebank of fke
but i do whate'er i dare
and my magic incantations can be framed as decorations
the prices are so low , you wll never cease to marvel at them .
for you  sir , one penny .
w found him for you , miss .
do n't work .
hw may i serve you ?
the late headmaster .
i 'm sorry , my dear .
look at your contract .

fly ?
in point of fact , i do .
i found the front door open  the house was deserted .
merciful heavens !
i should think you 'd be terrified at the very idea of living here .
you 'd have thought so .
 am , by nature , well , a little bit of a cward .
but then i pondred , as i often do .
shall w go in ?
mr browne , the book- where is it ?
why do you keep the curtains closed ?
more likely so 's a copper d n't peek in and catch you hidin ' out here .

you could be arrested for that .

mr. meaker , i , uh ...

wait .
uh , i 'll be right down .
and that 's my deposit slip for it .
next , pleas .
what kind of a bank is this , anyway ?
have nt you bankers ever heard of gold ?
mrs. doley , even if that were gold bouillon there 's nothing ...
that would n't do very much for your account now , would it ?
well , i should say not .
the only possible place you could take that is t a refinery .
where 'd you get the hat ?
what hat 
oh , nw albert , it was on sale .
you know , if you wrote a check for that hat , we 're overdrawn again .
no , we 're not .
from the refinery .
no , not thse .
well , the bank told me to .
no , no , no .
hi , partners .
that 's all we can do bcause we do n't hve a license to handle gold .
i d like a gold license for my little ducky who lays gold eggs .
he works for the u.s. treasry .
why 
you could get ten years in the jug for hoarding 
why ?
yes , bt you 're ...
wait a minute .
you did n't tell them where the gold came from , did you ?
what did he say when you told him ?
she can tll them the truth and they 'll never believe it .
a new suit ?
keep moving around .
no , no , no .
this is excptionally high grad ore .
all seem to b the identical size nd shape .
what kind of duck was that ?
thank you .
mrs. dooley , listen , about these nuggets ..
bye-bye .
we do n't hav your address .
beauty .
you wuld n't happen t have a layaway plan , would you ?
no , i did n't think so .
well  i ca n't buy it now , but ..
i 'll be back .
gentlemen , they may have learned how to make gold .
i know that .
the pont i 'm trying to make is tht they 've found a way to make gold cheap enough to put n th market .
remember what happened to common , every day , ordinary bread mold ?
penicillin .
i hesitate to think what would happen if this were t get out of this room .
take it on one .
no , no , no .
nothing to it at all .
well , we have had a little flap about gold around her , but everything is absolutely undr cntrol .
bye , bob .
rutledge .
yes , this is he .
hello , rog .
oh , no .
not a single foregn country will hear anything about it .

americans make it for tn dollars an ounce , we make it $ 8.95 .
th white house ?
yes , sr .
i fully realize you have enogh trouble without this .

doly 's wrought iron sana baths ?
it s a sure loser .
besides hooper , i still can not identify the radioactiv element n our gold .
if i ca n't identify it , i do n't know what its half-life is 
if i do n't know its halflife ...
in other words , t culd run ut .

if we lose the duck , so be it .

godzilla vs. megalon
brought to you by showa video
brther !

an earthquake ...
it 's an rthquake !
it wo n't move !
hey , roku !
the national seismc institute believes the earthquaks are an effect from th second nuclear bomb test .
they also warn that more tremrs are expected ,
it 's incredible , is n't it ?
t 'll be the end of all mankind
it 's like this ..
both were great civilizations , until a big earthquake destroyed them .
hey , would n't it be interesting if the earthquake destroyed your robt ?
you 're really funny ...
hey ...
brother !
damn !
professor !
roku !
damn , they really made a mess of this place .
brother , those guys made a mess of my room .

every room seems to be messed up , but nothing was stolen .
however , we should make a thorough chck .
there 's some funny powder on the floor hre .
what do you think it is ?
it looks like sand .
it s  button i got from one f those guys .
it must have been from their shoes  w found t next to the robt .
nah , i 'm just an amateur .
you think it 's okay ?
byebye !

what 's in the thing anyway ?
i guess we 're not spposed to know what 's nside that thing .
brother , i did it !
the robot has made it to the lakebed ,
where are you taking my tw friends ?
seatopia ?
we 've crated our own oxygen supply , and later we constructed our own sun .
we are  very advanced people .

we got to go !
life .
snce the beginning humans and pokémon alike have searched fr its mening .
what am i 
what am  ?
many strange and wondros legends evolved from the pursuit of life 's mysteries .
but none is stranger than this tale of the most powerful pokémon of all .
-let me see !
-let 's run nother scan .
where  must be .
tell giovanni what 's happened !
let us hear its psychic powers .
that is mew , th rarest of all pokémon .
from its dna we created you , mewtwo .
am i only a copy ?
nothing but mew 's shadw ?
mprved through the power of human ingenuity .
so i am simply the end result of your experiment .
what becomes of me now ?
it 's just beginning !
we 'll start testng .
bhold my powers .
strongr even than mew .
those fools thought you were a science experment but i see yu as a valuable partner .
it will be the same with your powers unless you control them .
you say this armor protects my body yet it suppresses my powers !
your powrs are not being suppressed .
learn to use them to accomplish your purpose .
patience , my friend .
your purpose will become clear .
alakazam !
to serve your master 
humans may have created me but they wll never enslav me .
so i stand alone .
and purge ths planet of all who ppose me .
hman and pokémon like .
today , ash , brock and misty are taking a break from their pokémon adventures .
and , as always , he 's ready to endure any hardship , bear ny burden with strength , stamina and a will of steel .
hungry .
need food .
i have n't eaten since breakfast .
it 's my lazy-boy no-chew stew .
yo there !
-you know him ?
-yeah , he 's me .
unless you 're afraid to lose !
that 's progress .
like no one ever was
to catch them is my real test
to train them is my cause
teach pokémon t nderstand
the power that 's inside
you 're my best friend
and the wrld we must defend
our hearts are true
you did it !
yo can challenge along the way
about the place
there 's no bettr team
arm in arm w 'll win the fight
i knw it 's my destiny
you are my best friend
a heart so true
our courage will pull us through
got to catch them
shocking that ash moved so fast .
i know we must grab rare pokémon for the boss bt it would n't be a bad idea if we grabbed a bte to at .
we did nt come here to steal a meal !
i 'm starving .
the last time you cooked , y wiped out eight of my nin lives .
master , shall i extend n invitation to these trainers as well ?
watch where you 're flying .
something for me ?
greetings , pokémon trainers .
a ferry will leave old shore wharf to take you to the island this afternoon .
only trainers with this invtation will be admitted .
if you decide to attend , you must reply at once .
i guess the world s number-one trainer wants to challeng me to a match !
to what ?
save your nergy !
this is going to be so cool !
officer jenny , report to the ferry entrance .
i ca n't believe how fast the storm came up .
the ferry is cancled ?
-lt 's only a little rain !
-lt s more than just rain .
listen to me .
but there are no pokémon tears today .
you will never make it !
the nurse n charge of the center disappeared last month .
come back here , or i 'll place you nder arrest !
come back !
some trainers have no fear .
to them , this s just on more challenge .
that is what sets them apart and will make them pokémn masters .
good luck to all of you .
the world 's greatest pkémon master is waiting fr me .
our pokmon are n't strong enough .
they ca n't handle waves like this .
ve get you to new sland faster than yu can say fahrvergnügen .
stroke !
i think i 'm going to have one .
-they mostly liv in minnesota .
are you sur this boat 's safe ?
heave !
heave !
have !
-lt s team rocket .
-prpare for truble .
ash !
misty !
-not yet .
stay together .
look !
my master bids you welcome to new islnd .
lkindly present your invitation .
here it is , miss .
i knew i recognized that face .
are n't you th nurse from the treatment center ?
my master awaits your arrvl .
with you here , all trainers worthy of an audience with my master are present .
only the triners capable of braving the storm are worthy in my master 's eyes .
do you mean that storm was some kind f test ?
release your pokémon from their pokéballs and join th others .
it wo n't be long before my master 's intentions are clar .
now we 'll never know what kind of party we re missng !
-you knw another way in 
-look over there .
come on .
what took you guys so long ?
how did you get here ?
it was easy 
hurricane winds are a breeze for pidgeotto here .
guys , say hello .
i rde over n gyarados  back .
yes , but once you train it , it 's the most depndable pokémon there is 
you are about to met my master .
what 's that ?
ths is the ruler of new island and soon the whole wrld .
quiet , human .
-how 's it talking ?
-lt 's psychic .
we ll show you !
let 's go , gyarados !
child 's play .
and how in the world did i get here ?
yo have been under my control .
you 're just a bully !
they 're pokémon .
this is the pokémon rplication system .
what are you -- ?
lt go !
i made it .
but just by a hair .
analyzing pokémon biomaterial smple .
-who 's that pokémon 
lt 's mowth .
but i 'm meowth .
 have n't got much tim .
there was sufficient genetic materil to replicate mew .
giovnni insisted on super-clones more powrful than any living pokémon .
but the creature 's anger is out of control .
-sounds like a real pokénstein .
so ths must be the lab .
no .
your pkémon will not be spared .
thy have dsgraced themselves by serving humans .
those pokémon are nothing but slaves .
so , you say i am wrong ?
you are as pathetic as th rest .
humans and pokmon can never be friends .
are you okay ?
go , rhyhorn .
-no !
like most pokémon trainers i too bgan with charmander , squirtle and bulbasaur 
but for their evolved forms i sed their genetic mterial to clone even mor powerful copies .
-copis !
your fake vensaur ca n't beat my real one !
it my not have a nickname , but i do have a charizard .
i choose you !
charizard , i did n't say start .
your charizard is poorly trained .
saur .
i underestimated yo lst time  but that wo n't happen again !
shellshocker , hydro pump !
those clones are too powerful .
i 'm not gving up .
chrizrd , us yur speed , not power , and yo 'll win .
are yu okay ?
ths is my world now .
i know !
it 's futile to try and escape my power .
dewgng .
but me , i got  special place in my tail for this one .
look ther !
t s pkachu !
i 'm so glad yo 're okay .
-they 'r fabulous fakes !
but where are the real ones ?
th poké originals !
i am sparing your lives , for the mment 
bt yu can not escape your fate .
behold !
with pokémon and humans eliminated the clones shall inherit the world .
you 're mine !
can it be ?
mew 
superior t mew .
mew and mewtwo !
why do you flee from me ?
-wht 's it saying ?
and that a pokémon 's real strength comes from the heart .
now we shall see wh triumphs .
pokmon are n't meant to fight .
what can come out of it ?
now i can see how horrible fighting really is .
ven the best of friends will fght sometimes 
i 'll promise nevr to fight again if you will .
let 's get something straight !
yu was born dfferent .
hw do i know you 'r not going to pull a fast ne on me ?
you 're right , we do have a lot in common .
the same erth , the same air  the sam sky .
mayb if we started lookng at what 's the same instead of always looking at what 's different , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove how strong those supr-clones are .
i 'd rather risk my life out in mewtwo 's storm than watch pokémon destroy each other .
those pokémon are ready to fight to the death 
someone 's got to take a stand .
someone s got to say no and refus to fight .
oh  no !
please , no !
i pitted them against each other .
i see now that th circmstances of one 's birth ar irrelevant .
-this could be th worst storm ever .
you have got to find shelter .
the pokémon treatment center will open as a shelter .
they keep getting more beautiful every time i see them .
well , i guess we 're just here becase we 're hre .
yes , let 's eat .
i ca n't believe it .
-that 's so weird !
what s that ?
-l do n't se anything , ash .
-ths is paradise 
i 'd really lke to go sailing in one of them ctamarans .

it 's not him !
the pleasure .. is n't mne .
ush 
joris .
we split the dofus .
great .
as you could see yugo ... his little idea ws to add us to his frozen heroes collection .
why did he take adamaï along ?
and what does he want to do with the elitrope dofus ?
they 're known to b undestructible .
pinpin ?
daddy made short work of them .
master joris .
here 's for you .
what 's happening ?
... is tht thing working ?
pipune ?
pipoune cn you hear me ?
it gives me headaches 
you 're stll alive 
let 's say it did n't go too badly .
i 've found a nice little spot 
it 's rather nice .
i should come visit you with eva and the kids !
difficult .
i still did n't find the way home .
they 're all looking at me lke i was th last of the ips .
...
i 've felt it .
he 's getting back the powers he lent me .
i m not sure he 's ready 
yes !
these days i feel pretty badass .
with people i do n't know .
ok fine .
the revelation i have to disclose requires you to hold to your underwear .
just a little detail .
what ?
but be serous rubi .
pinpin .
he 's the ip god !
it was easier to blieve he 's a womn ...
the ... the iop god ?
for my people .
i wold n't call that egoistical .
harebourg .
mull over yur actions .
do n't g !
and i note you did n't fail in your misson .
my dear .
and i mean you no harm .
the iop god had to come dwn on the world of twlv t face a dreadful trial .
you have other children ?
... other familis ?
vanglyn .
but not really .
usually gods can live for quite a while .
extrme emotionnal shock .
now you must take back your plac 
... in your hands ... we 're not interested 
maybe 
so what ?
little dragon ?
it would be very violent !
and ... who 's w ?
 secrt guild that aims to wtch over the world .
every sibling is a demigod or a dragon offsprng .
and you otomi son of the feca goddess .
i do n't believe a single wrd f your stry !
f that 's a trick ..
 have xplained what will happen if you use the dofus .
you should let him rest .
not to mention he 's currently receiving a nice big chunk of divine energy .
that 's tremndous .
princess .
it 's the occasion to get our revenge aginst ush .
i 'd rather have yu go to the sadida kingdom with our friends .
i 'm really a god .
nothing 's simpler !
what kind of a rat trp is that ?
looks like that sneaky ush indeed !
yr turn now !
only joris left .
daddy 
ha !
here come ur valint heroes .
remington !
even if yu come from the previous litter 
 'm not the least proud that we have the same fathr .
that stupid god who never cared about anyone besides himself .
you 've come t retrieve my two eliatrope dofus ?
you 'll have to earn them .
another on of his stupid games .
during which everything goes .
it 's impossible .
nothing can destroy a dofus .
really ?
yugo .
clse call !
grandpa ruel !
with my eyes closed .
you 've asked for it !
you look just like pinpin when he 's on a boat .
i 'm scared for them .
i beg you !
my big-hearted hero ...
we 've just learned i 'm not who i thought  was .
eva .
it hurts less to be dumb .
we can easily snatch the two dofus .
and his games are designed t give him the upper hnd .
an ecaflip who does n't like to lose ...
watch out !
always so fiery .
remi .
i 'll see if atcham is still such a fin swordsman .

because i do n't have the slightest idea !
our kingdm is saved !
he wo n't be extremely hlpful .
armand !
the tree of life is thratened and the whole sadida people is doomed to vanish .
this is exactly what i feared !
like i could solve any problem .
but .. you can change the world .
i 've never asked to b a reincarnation f the iop god .
you 'd let the sadida kingdom vanish ?
pinpin .
 've decided to marry a brave iop .
sacrificing himself for the morals he beleves in .
that 's th tristepin i love .
living with such a moron ...
 warn you .
do nt ever insult tristepin agin in front of his children 
the sadidas from across the kingdom have heard it too .
yugo .
but something tells me your luck is running out .

but why did you make them blue ?
amalia clearly sid they were black .
the scurity of the kingdom is at stak .

but father s exhausting himself right before our eyes .
what about my artist 's dty 
nobody cares then ?
was n't that simple ?

the dragonling came back to throw himself in the boowolf 's mouth .

strange sadida guards ...
father 
who would dar say you were withered ?

even the king of bonta- who will be of invaluable assistance .
powerfl sadida .
grandpa ruel !
i welcom you 
the consequences have been catastrophic for the sadida kingdm .
another bot of crying from ogrest could wipe ot the entire sadida kingdom .
we 've studied all the solutions .
and whose subjects we 've never seen .

they come from another wrld and i have no idea how to us them .
amalia is my best friend ... we all know there 's mor to it .
while her ... she has become a queen .
can you imagine me by her side ?
the entire sadida kngdom would make fun of her .
so what ?
this is th princess ' decision .
the leaders of this world must sometimes tak hard decisions .
and she will need you by her side to support her .
and i have my idea for the next two 
i 'd lke you to come with us .
yes yes ys .
you have a visitor .

your mother would never have allowed me to let her leave .
an exceptional situation calls for exceptional measures .
we 'r only a small reconnassance tem .

you had to guide us through some dangers place again .

before you frze on the spot .
you 'r ruining my focus .
mommy said we should stay nside !
some things must stay the way they are .
unlike our ancstors .
and mine holds th secret hope that our arranged marriage wo n't stay that way for too long .
no .
i d n't think so .
but .. these mechanisms .
you want to d the sme thng he did .
little yugo .
nox wanted to go back in time and demonstrated how it 's nearly impossible .
and my subjects .
we would have all the resources at or disposal to live independently from the other nations .
forever 
such nice morals .
just like amalia is rady t marry a stranger to help her people .
without subjects to protect .
but something is tickling my beard .
with what magic are you going to manage all that ?
of course .
when ygo will have told me how they wrk .
sheltered from all disasters 
you 're wrong harebourg .
what 's wrong with you ?
princess .
we 're nearly there .
and search through the plac .
you 'd better give them .
it 's time to put daddy 's lessons into practice .
just try not to rush in like-
but  need to use you for a bit .

how dare you !
these dofus belong t our people !
adamaï .
even if yor people is not on our world .

he asked for your hand ?

the manger 's called a meeting at the pit .

mrs. armstrong , sir .
hey , do n't touch it .
all right , lad , all right .

and the afterdamp s vey bad .

unted nations science committe space port ii
rockets depart for it every day from ths base on iwo jima .
moonlight sy-3 ready for takeoff .
ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five  four , three , two , one , zero !
all manner of fish are cultivated here , and on the surfac is monsterland , a rsearch habitat of fearful giant mnstrs 
if thy attempt to leave , it activates a restraint system .
the reason rodan ca n't fly byond a set boundary at sea s that a perimetr of magnetic barriers has been set up .
moreover , nogh food is cultivated here for the monsters that they can each eat their fill .
everything is in rder .
i feared you 'd run away , this being your first encounter .
i hope you 'll help us as we closely study them .
yes , sir .
oh , katsuo !
the moon base .
yeah .
but i m doing fine , s yu can see .
really 
jst joking .
i 'd like dr. yoshida to come .
the director is in tokyo for  cnfrence .
hello ?
hello 
hell !
power station !
power station !
this is the operator .
what happened ?
it 's gas !
zoom in .
try again .
doctor  we got through .
did nw volcanic activity case this ?
what is that ?
this was definitely a planned attack .
this is the moscow brodcasting office 
rodan has attacked moscow .
it appeared above the city and is even now continuing its rampage of destruction .
rodan is in moscow ?
what 's going on here ?
a subterranean monster has just appered from the arc de triomphe .
no , the world 's treasure is about to be destroyed by this monster .
the monument is collapsng .
it 's been destroyed .
paris is being destroyed by ths subterranean monster .
we 've just received a new report .
godzilla has appeared in new york .
godzilla s in new york .
what abut you , dr. yoshida ?
i have no answers right now .
why has n't tokyo been attackd when it 's closest to monsterland ?
i 'd very much like to know why myself .
moonlight sy-3 !
hey !
yes , sir .
it wo n't gt away today .
this is more important .
that 's a uf out there .
it 's dangerous to get any closer .
moonlight sy-3 , what 's wrong ?
go .
i do n't know what 's happened on erth , but it 's absurd to ask us for help .
they did n't ask .
it 's a recall order .
yo 'll land at monsterland on the bonin islands .
receiving guidance beam .
roger that .
stand by for tmospheric entry !
someome may have commandeered it .
ascertin their identity and objective .
they may resist .
roger .
no sign of radiactivity or sulfur dioxide .
ll rght , let 's go .
what 's going on here ?
welcome .
doctor !
hello again .
why are you here ?
what 's all this about , doctor ?
cooperate nothing .
you let all the monsters free while director yoshida was way .
they 're not running free .
we have them under remote control .
take a lok .
godzilla s in the pacific 
we can call them back to this island anytime we want .
i 'll introduce you to the inventor of this remote-control system .
follow us .
welcme , gentlemen .
i imagine you have lots of questions .
how does destroying our cities establish anything ?
some degree of sacrifce is unavoidble .
what ?
kilak 
belief dos nt matter .
that brrier is completely unbreakable .
getting you out of here .
call them 
c'mon .
hurry up !
kyoko !
kyoko !
fall back !
listen , otan .
the only way we can help is if you answer .
d nt you get that ?
where 's their new base ?
plase , tell me .
our friendship wo n't make any difference to them .
doctor 
hands off .
there 's no point in moving him nw !
we need to go !
halt !
scalpel .
it 's some kind of metl i 'v never sen .
i agree .
they came to get him for fear we 'd find this 
there mst be a transmitter somewhere .
i 'll search from the air .
yes , sir .
look ,  'm busy .
yeah , but still ...
there !
it s that !
let me see .
over there !
sy-3 
we went to the moon with takeshi that time .
is he doing well 
we 're investigating a signal 
please observe this object , which appears to be a stone .
the unsc has confirmed it as the kilaak monster-control device wreaking havoc upon our wrld .
what 's more , they 're being discovered in the most unexpected plcs .
ne was even discovered in a coconut on guam .
we estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2000 km .
so the monsters are likely being controlled by devices n their respective areas .
regarding the kilaks and their prsonrs from monsterland ...
tetsuo ise , ag 30 .
kyoko manabe , age 23 .
thank yu , miss .
you can go .
we beg your pardon .
it dos .
prepare to ttack .
do we have prof the kilaaks are behind it ?
there 's a subterranean monster at amagi .
they mst be using a new control device now .
thank you , doctor .
it 's kyoko manabe .
let 's talk elsewhere .
no , i want to talk to all of you here .
do n't tell me again !
especially the reporters .
amd if we do n't , they 'll destroy us with the monstrs .
that s coercion , not negotiation !
i 'm talking to everyone here .
you be quiet .
what are you doing ?
she was beng contrlled with these .
we 'll investigat them immdiately .
kyoko !
good , you 're awake .
it 's me .
it 's ll right .

yellow poson gas !
she hs no memory of whn she was beng controlled .
all rght then .
prpare to attack .

halt descent 
emergncy ascent !

open fire !
hey , what 's wrong ?

advnce !
keep advancing !
s-spread out !
spread out !
first platoon , take the lft forest road !
second platoon , to the right 
this way 
what 's wrong ?
i 'm all right .
let 's go .
damn it ...
it w n't budge .
i bet it 's a kilaak cave .
or only choice is t move forward .
all right .
okay , get back .
i knew it .
so wht 's the mprtant business ?
prclamation 
plese listen carfully , major tada in particular .
arth does n't belong to humans alone .
th area beneath the mt .
fuji volcanic chin now belongs to the kilaaks .
undrstand ?
what ?
let 's go .
that 's the true source of the signal !
we 'll send sy-3 to the moon .
and do n't take off thse spacesuits tll you deal with the kilaaks .
proceed to the targt 
take a look at yor chart .
yes , sir .
watch out for ufos and approach from a low altitde 
we 'll be on our way then .
our approach vector is 45 degrees to port .
from the sea of tranquility to the sea of vapors .
that 'll bring us to the casani crater .
roger .
it 'd be surprising if w were n't .
full stop .
prepare to descend .
all right , here we go .
prepar the rover !
preparing the rover !
close the ful valves !
activate coling system !
activating cooling system !
coolant prssure ?
at max !
what ?
at this rte , the fuel tank will explode !
no time .
yes , sir !
fre !
commander .
we detected a flare t cassini .
i hope this works .
if they fail , we ll be the nxt to die .
we might get vaporizd along with this base before long .
yes , sir .
okada , yoshikw , arima , come with me .
come on .
dismount and disable anything imprtant .
undrstood , sir .
even the most advanced scienc will have some weak point .
ovr there too !
when we destroyed the wall , the tmperature dropped .
gather them up 
this is the control device 's cor .
damn thing 's still running .
mn base .
mon base !
no answer ?
none at ll .
the base wo n't answer , and the signal 's still ther .
let 's detach the excavator !
detach the maser .
get  high-voltage cable !
screwdrver .
i think our only choice is to assume they failed .
okay , switch it n !
what 's wrong ?
i do n't care !
turn it on and up !
it worked !
hurry !
yes , it is .
now w know why they were after the mt .
at constant high tmperatures , they can probably live forever .
forever ?
that 's right 
heavy use f freze rays .
yes , sir .
godzilla !
gain ?
you 're there ?
yes .
excellent .
doctor , this is no time fr that !
our contrl device s complete , so we thought we 'd test it on godzilla .
the monsters are on our side .
it and the primeval okigahara forest are silent , as if awaiting the impending full-scale giantmonstr attack against the kilaak base 
rodan ?
oh , there 's one !
now mothra has appeared .
it 's anguirus from the asagri plteau on the left .
truly a sight to see .
following anguirus ar manda , baragon , and gorosaurus .
one after another , they 're baring down on the kilaak base hre in aokigahara .
flying over lake motsu with the southern alps in th horizn .
will godzilla lead the opening charge ?
this force of giant monsters wth gdzilla at its head is truly  sight to behold .
we ca n't control him .
what do we d ?
earth 's monsters are m match for him .
the monsters are ready .
this is an amazing struggle !
a burning mnster ?
it 's headng straight for us !
vacat !
the kilaaks are signaling us !
what now ?

fire dragon can reduce tokyo to ashs in two to three hours .
the monsters are on the offensive .

i can not continue being santa unless i find a mrs. claus 
oh .

this is all happening so fast .
i mean , if i do n't get married , i just wo n't deliver the gifts , and children everywhere will stop believing , th elves will lose their jobs , the north pole will dsappear and christmas will be gon .

a lump of sugar ?
certainly .
you 're not swiss .
now , yu put your hand nderneath here and  wait now ...
here we go .
that 's because i live in europe 
what happened ?
you like it ?
no , i 'm not .
see ?
my word .
mther counted lst night and one came out .
these hotels .
i thought you were german .
wll , she 's my aunt .
yes , i like her .
randolph , you try that and i 'll fix you .
how do you like that ?
she 's right .
what are you doing ?
i 'm going up the alps .
that 's the way you cme down .
your brother and i have made acquaintance .
you 'd better leave it somewhere 
italy ?
why , going over 
i wn na go to america !
do they have cndy ?
you can just see the dents du midi .
it 's not a very good one .
i lik just hanging round .
he 's amrican .
we 're from new york state 
where i want to be .
yu have n't told me yur name .
randolph c miller .
my father is ezra b miller .
he 's in schenectady .
i 'm gon n climb that tree .
h does n't like me , eithr .
well , one , but he goes round with a teacher .
your brother has no teacher ?
mother thought of getting one .
an american lady .
but randolph did n't want a teacher travelling round with us .
she asked why i did n't give randolph instruction .
can you find peopl n italy to do that kind of thing ?
yes , in geneva .
i 'd never been in so many hotels until i came to europ 
there are a number .
 m glad ..
so many intimate friends hve been .
whenever i put on a paris dress i feel i 'm in europe .
pardon ?
but i do n't know where the society keeps itself here .
do you ?
are you taking the cure 
i 've lways had plenty of it .
there 's lots there .
i 've more friends there .
i 've had a lot of gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the châtau de chillon .
no .
 wnt to go , dredfully .
i would n't leave withot seeng it .
you can drive , or take the steamer .
randolph says it 's too old to be interesting .
mother 's afraid to leave him alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find smeone to stay with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd rather go to chillon .
she 's not much bent n going  nyway .
we 
you and i ?
oh , eugenio .
to chillon ?
mademoiselle has arrangd t ?
i wo n't b happy till w go .
you 're really american ?
she will tell you all about me .
the carriage is waiting .
they 're horribly commn , my dear frederick .
one does one 's duty by just ignoring them .
milk ?
i ca n't not .
she has that charming look they have .
and she dresses to perfectin .
ca n't think where they gt their taste .
after all  she 's not a comanch indian .
does she ?
there 's no other name for it .
very likely they 've never seen a man with such god manners .
prbably corresponds to the young lady 's idea of a count .
you might have mentioned you had made her acquaintance .
pray , what did you say ?
who is a thousand times obliged to you .
you do n't say that as if yu believed t .
how does one say it ?
i should think that proved just the contrary .
how long had you known her when this project was formed ?
yo 've been in vevy 24 hours .
that sh 's a horror 
she fully intends to .
then i must declne the honour of her acquaintance .
think what  sir ?
that she 's the sort of girl who expects a man to carry her off ?
you 're too innocent .
my dear aunt , i 'm not too innocent .
too guilty , then .
yes .
this is the stupdest evening .
have yo been alone ?
she 's gone to bed ?
she 's gone to try and put randolph to bed 
let 's hope she persuades him .
he does n't like her to talk to him .
how 's your aunt ?
not well 
how observant !
it 's a lovely description .
i gess we are .
she tells me she des .
why did n't you say so ?
you need n't be afraid .
why should she want to know me ?
she is exclusive .
here comes mother .
are you sure it 's her 
she does n't see you .
she does nt approve of my walking with you .
or i wold n't think i 'm natural .
i do n't know why you wear ths .
 do .
is randolph in bed ?
it is n't as bad as it was at dovr .
he should make it up .
he just ca n't .
he is tiresome .
he would n't even go to that castle .
your daughter has allowed me the honour of beng her guide .
or on the bat .
i do n't see ..
we only want to see the prncipal ones .
we saw several in ngland .
yes , but chillon is worth seeing .
it seems ther is n't anythng she would n't undertake .
you 'r sure you wo n't join us ?
d let her go .
you have n't spoken to me for half an hour .
i want you to tak me out in a boat .
i got you to say something .
i do n't think so .
 love how he says it .
it would be .
why wait for anything ?
it 's eleven o'clock .
i 'm going on a bot .
at this hour , mademoislle ?
tell her she ca n't 
as mademoiselle plases .
i just want a little fuss .
i 'm puzzled .
what are yo doing ?
no 
goodnight .
we 're gon na mke it !
wait !
we mde it !
a mass of towers on a block of boulders .
i have  passin for steamboats .
why are yo so solemn ?
i was grinning from ear to ear .
your ears are very close .
cme on , let 's be the first ones ff .
what 's up here ?
excuse me .
i 'm sure you know all that .
the point was , the castle was n't all constructd at the same tim .
betwen the 9th and 1 3th cycles .
four years .
is tht how long you 've been here ?
oubliette .
the castle completely dominated the pass through the lps .
it 's an impression you give .
be careful 
it 's very rotten .
why are you rushing ?
wht 's through here ?
look !
what ?
hello .
l wonder what 's through there .
wait for me .
miss miller !
amn !
d n't forget me .
my goodness .
lord byron carved his name on it .
wrote that poem abt him .
it was during the reformation 
there are seven pillars of gthic mould in chllon 's dungons dep and old
i never saw  man who knew so much !
do n't you wan na teach rndolph ?
you 're not in business .
but i do have engagements .
i do n't beleve it .
i 'm cold now .
wait for me .
you see the dsign of this fireplace here ?
do n't say a thing like that !
wit , there 's so much more to see .
i think you 're horrid !
does n't she gve you more than two days off at a time ?
please stop .
are n't you ?
at any rate , i will certainly come .
well , there 'll be a carriage .
you were saying ?
and miss miller .
the fortune hunters are of th infrior sort .
she takes them to such houses as her nose is allowd into .
where is the mother ?
i have n't the least idea .
splendid .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he seems prodigiously busy .
i fnd it difficult to take tea .
i think i might go .
whether or not being vulgar is being bad is a qustion for the metaphysicians .
they 're bad enough to blush for .
who is the portrait for ?
i 'm presenting each on with a copy .
it 's ludicrously expensive .
you stayed here ?
but there are some singular stories about her .
but i 'm not through with you .
hello , mr and mrs johnsn .
madame miller .
i want you t meet the sinclairs .
hello , miss miller !
i 'm ever so happy to see yu !
 'm so happy to see you .
here 's your mother at last .
and i know you .
i arrived today .
we gt  bigger place .
i knew you d sy smething .
i hope you 've ben well .
i 've got it  too .
father 's got it bad .
in schenectady he 's at th very top .
we 'd heard so much bout t .
yu never were .
we 've seen placs ahead of rome .
it 'll turn around and go the right way some time .
yes .
i 've heard 
she goes round more thn i do .
she knows a great many gentlmen .
she thinks ther s nothing like rome .
at vevey , you would n't stay whn i asked .
he went to geneva .
eugenio will raise something fierce 
delighted to hear it .
an intimate friend .
mr giovanelli .
he wants to know some americans 
he 's tremendously clever .
mother , eugeni 's really gon na raise something .
we 'd better go bck .
you go .
 'm gon na walk round a little .
alone ?
it 's not sfe 
give her that medicine .
mrs walker , you re too perfect .
i 'm meeting a friend .
is it mr giovanelli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
what a fuss .
if mr winterbourne wre as polte as he pretends , he 'd offer to walk me there .
i knew her ...
eugnio says we have the best hotel rooms in rome .
 thought it would be awfully quiet and pokey .
i was sure we 'd be going rond with one of those old men who explain about pctures .
 know ever so many people .
i think i lik the englsh best .
shall we buy some candy for poor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk you back 
i 'm not helping you find hm .
i 'll fnd him .
you sound too imperious 
you should listen to a gentleman sometims , the right one .
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ever meet .
not at all .
to america ?
ever ?
never .
i do .
thank you .
mr winterbourne !
mr winterbourne ?
she ask you come .
excuse me .
women follow wherver he goes .
walking with two men .
fifty people have noticed her .
it 's a shame to mak a fuss .
or to let her ruin herself .
she 's nnocent .
she 's reckless .
the world will see she 's not running wild .
hello agin .
ths is he .
this is mrs wlker , who so sweetly askd you to her party .
i 'm not five years old .
come in here and i will tell you .
i do n't thnk i want to know .
gracous me !
if this is improper , i 'm improper .
have  lovely ride .
all right .
yur honesty 's only put her off .
she meant no harm .
that s what i thought a month ago .
sitting in corners with mysterious italians 
dancing all evening with one partner .
receiving callers late at night 
he must be edified by what he sees .
we should n't pay attention to servants .
her only fault is to thnk giovanelli a gentleman , when he 's a poor imitaton .
he 's some third-rate artist .
she 's naturally indelicate .
two days .
that remark about your going to genev !
i think you should stop .
giving her any furthr pportunty to expose herself .
i ca n't do anything as enlightened as that .
if you wish to rejoin her ...
s you wish .
finally .
it 's the first tim i 've ever been to a party alone , specially n italy .
does n't she intend ..
... to favour us with her company ?
daisy dressed before dinner .
a friend is there , the gentleman she was bringing .
mr giovanelli .
i guess they 'll com before very long .
i 'm sorry she 's cming in that way .
i wo n't speak to her .
i 'm afraid you thought i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made hm go over them .
you are hungry ?
ys .
the singing kept him awake .
i do hope this is the finale .
she 's worked her way over to your old college chum .
they were quite restless there .
we paired off .
that was better .
he seems more in control of his limbs than you are .
he 'd never dare ask a young italian lady to walk about the strets with him 
what nice girl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flirt only with me .
i would n't flirt with you .
you 're too stiff .
yo say tht too often .
if it makes you angry , i 'll say it again .
it does n't exist here .
poor mother .
and neither of us is flirting .
we 're real intimate friends 
i se .
i just love tht song 
especially in winter .
your frend has n't moved all evening .
really ?
why do n't yo break in ?
she 's a disgrace .
thank yu so much .
goodnight .
i certainly do n't want her to leave them wthout me 
buonanott .
that was very cruel .
sh never enters my drawing room again .
preoccupied , anyway .
you were supposed t come by for me .
i do nt know what .
miss miller .
do you think so ?
she thinks him the finest gentleman .
expects  commission if the fellow succeeds in marrying her .
 'm not sure she 's capable of thoght .
i certainly see no evidence of it .
she rmps on from dy to dy , from hour to hour , as they did in the goldn age .
i can imagine nothing more vulgar 
the little rman .
he s perfectly respectable .
 lawyer , i think .
but he ca n't really hpe to pull it off .
if it is n't mr winterbourne !
good afternon !
am i interrupting ?
not at all .
mr govanelli will nw sing ..
hurry , mr winterbourne .
eugenio 's taken him and mother to buy shoes .
no , you sing your sng .
the most difficult song i never hear .
ever har .
come on , we 're waiting .
mr winterbourne is getting impatient .
i 'd enjoy tht .
then myb i 'll sing .
hre we go .
bravo !
encore !
no , i think he hs heard me .
very much .
all right .
i thought he was with you .
that boy will be the death of me .
excuse me .
mr giovanelli 's gon na sing for you both .
but they 're always tgethr .
she says she ai n't .
i see .
mr givanelli has promised to tell m .
of course .
randolph 
looking for m .
mr winterbourne .
you think i go out too much with him .
evryone does .
you 'll find they do .
they re not inviting you places .
have n't you noticed ?
i noticed yo and that you are as stiff as a rmrod .
i 'm not half as stiff as some .
try going to see them .
wht wll they do ?
you know what that means ?
what mrs walker did ?
i would nt think you 'd let people be so unkind 
do you ?
your mother says she believes you 'r engaged .
i guess she dos .
but since you 've mentioned it , i am engaged .
she wants me to come to geneva .
freddie ?
you dd n't say ten words at dinner .
i d n't know .
i saw her today .
where ?
she 's certainly prtty .
she 's  mystery .
what ?
yes , i suppose .
she 's carried away with giovanelli .
i do n't think you 've missed a thing .
ar you sure ?
yes .
how long have you been here ?
well ...
i see .
for myself i have no fear .
but when was mademoselle ever ...
i was bound to see th colosseum by moonlight .
we 've had the most beautiful time .
i g to see if th curiers are there .
the colosseum is one thing  can rave about .
why are you always so stiff ?
did you beleve i was engaged the ther day ?
i jst came by to say goodbye to my aunt .
and mrs walker , i hope .
she 's over there .
will you ?
i must say i 'm not surprised .
charles .
what do you hear bout daisy miller 
freddie .
she 's alwys going around at night .
it s so blasted dark ovr here , you ca n't see anythng unless the moon 's up .
ai n't that rght , eugenio ?
i 'm going .
excuse my coming so lat .
i only just heard .
i do wsh dr davis were her .
is there anything i can do ?
no , thank you .
i wish randolph would go to bd .
but he 's been very helpful .
it alwys gets very high before it drps .
daisy spoke of you the other day , quite plesantly .
half the time she does n't know what she 's saying , but this time i think she did .
i 'm sure i 'm very glad .
he has n't been near us since she was taken ill .
i said i would n't give any such message .
she was the most beautiful young lady i never see .
the most innocent ?
the mst innocent .
for myself i had no far .
yes ?
she did what she liked .
she did what she liked .
no .
i 'm convinced .
i m sure .
is that some modest way of saying you think she wold have reciprocated your affectin , had you shown it ?
that remark you made last summer .
rope him !
me too .
quak of '65 pinched off the veins .
has n't been 10 cents of gold in quke city since .
and the nam quake cty ?
when yu bild on the calaveras fault , you expect to be shook up .
ai n't that bad , homer .
planning on settling here ?
if you want to sue , court 's open on tuesdays .
leonard ?
the trouble is , i 'm expecting valuables on th stage .

yes .
mayor sharp ?

since you have $ 5 , i 'll apply t to your loan at the bank 
it is .
thanks , donavn .
let 's see them .
hit it again !
i do n't believe that .
the good thing about luck is , it changes .
it was n't long they 'd ben gone from the eastern shore
for whom the posses rode
and they called them the apple dumpling gang
quake city .
you can eat t the hotel across the street or at the hard times café .
take your stuff .

i want to get them out of twn for god .
staring t a bank through a spyglass wo n't make us richer .
worried about th sherff ?
with a down-home sheriff , you get a town full of vigilantes .
we culd be walking into a hornets ' nest .
we got to get the gold som time .
i did n't rid 200 miles just to look at the scenery .

they 're yours , wintle .
you and that jackleg get ut of here befre the curt gets contemptuous .
exactly how much does this nugget weigh ?
356 pounds , without the crate .
i assume you have a lot of men protecting it .
there 'll be extra guards from marysville tomorrow .
i see .
being a man of the cloth , it can do no harm .
we 're taking it ut when the bank closes at 4:00 tomrrow .
they wo n't be going by th regular route but over china grd .
i imagine tht they 'll not encounter so much as a horn frog on that road .
howevr , i would be happy to accept this as a contribution for the poor .
i seem to hve left my purse at the office .

bro baji
bro bajie
since the karma of weal and woe is predestined why worry yourself sick , mdam ?
i was forced to marry nto the purple
mny people died
there was a rumor that i brought on the disastr to thir village
i was seen s a demon
to honor the gods
but later i survived
so you can say passing time is not necessarily a good cure pan comes from stubbornnss
it looks hard to overcome but , as long as you take a bold step forward
i 'm sure you can do it as well
you ca n't bluff my eyes with your disguise
wan n go ?
come on out
i 'm sure i 'll find you soon
sh died
it was too wrong .
master , hlp me
master
your sin of killing is to much
if i let you get awy with it like this it 'll be a disaster for the world
that damned monkey was too fierce
truble ?
are you going to use this incantation to keep me under control ?
we only believe what can be sen in our eyes
now i understand why the buddha md the two of s together n this journey
what pulls us together is this journey of 36,000 miles for the scripturs
but i hope you believe that every time i recite the incantaton
please hlp save my daughter
can someone save her 
exacfly
the kingdom of cloud was prosperous
she feeds on these young kds
please rise , your majesty
amitabha .
guard his majesty !
repeat it
eat hm now if yo can
i m here for yo
let 's talk outside
of you ?
master
do n't hurry
out with it
we are both demons of the same kind
that 's why we should help ach other
what can you help me with ?
your hoop looks nice on yo
you can kep it if you like
why not ?
go ahead
look at this monkey
he has to do whatever is told by his master
white bone spirit
let me be the bad guy
plese calm down
sun wukong gets in the way
so , as long as she tackls that mnkey we 're sure to have a chance
wukong  are you alright ?
no way
do you rally want to enlighten this demon ?
i ca n't leave a single life unenlightened on this journey
i can never make myself assurd ven though i can make it through to the scripture
i can never feel assured
it 's a style
do you know what you 're supposed to do here tonight ?
i 'm here
gain ?
wukong , why are you here ?
do n't fool around here
yeah
lady white if you have guts have a good fight with me
fair enugh ?
ok .
step back
i hate being called evil demon the most
if not , what else should i call you ?
whatever
listen , i can give up everything
but !
we 'll see
someone help !
 'm stuck
where 's th monk ?
i wonder where
now it 's your turn
this is your krmic reward
even the buddha can not extinguish human 's evil within
this sort of person is more vicos than demns
now .
if it were n't for him , killing all the way with his cudgel you could go nowhere !
what merits and retribution are you looking to ?
every wrd you say is nonsense and every step you tak could kill
by what right ?
hly monk  please wait
the folks of our kingdom wll be grateful for your kindness forever
please accept ur gfts
thanks for saving my lfe
i 've sid
she 's a demn
are you okay , sweetheart

bajie
th road ahead is dangerous
do your best to protect him
big brother
big brother !
master !
if you do n't tell me
bro sha

bro sha , hit his face !

dragon horse , lt 's go to save master
because if i eat you , i can become an mmortal demon
i want no reincarnaton .
i hate being a human
in this case what happened in your previos life ?
that 's just a story about my previous life
do n't think you 're different from those who had left me on the lone cliff
hatred can nly give birth to hatred
why must you b so hard on yourself ?
stop enlightening me
wukong .
even if you get back to your place today that is not your final destnation
bg brother
do n't be afraid , everyone
only you can save master , big brother
look how young he is and how old you are , huh ?

when you 're a mom on th other sid of 40 ,
sometimes , you just ca n't hlp but wonder ...
like , what if i 'd taken that internship
being a mother is not all that different
juggling all those little details that nobody rally notices .
whre you learn to tell the difference between a real problem ...
still making sure everything gets done .
one day , you reach a point
where your insght and experience are appreciated ,
david sarlo asked me to the dance !
he 's so cute !
at first  i thought he lked avery , but then jenna told sophie that he liked me ...
that can only be nurtured over the years by listening .
but that 's where the similarities end .
yu never retire from bing a mother .
not to mention the driving lessons ,
it was spring of her senior year ,
and she suddenly .
grew up .
they ll always need yu
well , that just might turn out to be the hardst part of the job .
happy birthdy , crly .

that sounds excitng .
sh was completely oblivius to the fact that her son was terrorizng the entire restaurant , including me .
that 's the thing about wmen with kids , it 's a package deal .
simon , lok at me .
you look happy-ish .
i do n't need lauren setting me up .
with those bright eyes and that cute smile , are you kidding ?
half the women who brng in their kids just want to gve you a big hug and a wrm meal .
come on , i m being serious .
especially if you get your parenting advice from bestie mom .
not what .
it 's a mommy blog .
you know about this ?
of course i do .
nothing wrong with the way we were raised .
something you might want to keep in mind .
wht does that mean ?
we had it all figured t , two years of community college , then sh transfers to nivrsity to get her degree .
well , i ca n't do that .
or relationshp has always been bilt on mutual respect and understandng .
this incredibly arrogant fathr who 's been posting on my blog .
wll , i can hardly wait to read t .
just as soon as i figure ut what i 'm gon na say to sade .
the way i see it ,
but sharing wth your child keeps those doors open to a future you can build together .
hello , bestie mom .
if this blog of yours does n't work out ... you have a great future in comedy .
seriously ?
your prblem is ,
well .
if yu do n't know the difference
it 's called passion ...
maybe not ...
do n't bther .
yo wo n't get n answer from me .
okay  so what was wrong with that last pair of jens 
i want them to lok good on me .
listen , i was thinking abot what you were saying about traveling , and i think we should talk about it .
hw did those daisies work out ?
um ...
andy 
you too .
chemistry class , right ?
i 'm good .
what are you fellas shopping for today ?
oh , running shoes for , um ...
all right , we 'll be back .
uh ..
what about sde ?
now ... w re talking .
yah .
she passed away when try was seven .
nd we talk , but ... well , we ..
i guess we grunt our meaning across , you know ?
i know what yo mean .
latly ... not so much .
i shoutd upstairs to troy to ask what he wants for dinner , and , um ... he texted me back .
troy 's dad .
oh , i , uh ...
no .
yo obviously like hm .
he seems like a nice enough guy .
so , what 's the problem ?
i have troy 's number , so we can hook you two up .
i 'm not ging to try to talk you out of it .
jst thnk about it , anything could hppen .
she 's waiting .
thanks for the ride , mom .
sadie .
have fun .
i love you , too , babe .
when she 's thousands of miles away ?
not to mention what a bad idea it is
for her to put off starting school .
hot ?
in a strictly pg kind of a way 
people like that need to be called on the carpet once in a while .
on the other hand , meeting somebody would n't be so bad either .
okay , bt you ca n't tell lauren .
simon , i m serious 
we relly seemed to hit it off .
go for it .
my man .
you , uh , you gong somewhere ?
dd , i 'm gussing it 'll be thrsday next week .
dad , seriously ?
everyone else can stays out till 11:00 .
all right .
goodnight , uncle simon .
in a situation like this ,
and that somebdy is you .
like i 'd take advice from you ?
i even have a suggestion
bt she 'll be in schol , and is n't that what you want ?
what i want is what 's best for my dughter .
i do nt get it .
she 's trying to break out and be her own person .
i mean , we all did it 
i 've never held her bck , i 've never set a bunch of rules .
it is not fun .
i 'm definitely sensing some chemistry betwen the two of you .
like telling sadie xactly wht you think ?
oh ...
what ?
when ?
wait , who is he ?
oh , uh , okay .
okay .
yeah .
no ...
i mean , uh ...
enjoy this wonderful spring weather .
actually  i was hoping for something a little less ordinary .
i was hoping so , yeah .
fr example , if it 's , like , a date , then roses would be nice .
that is the general gist of the ... direction i was kind of headed in .
i m sorry ,  'm not doing this very well ...
no , no , you re doing great .
okay .
tacos sound perfect .
i 'll be there .
it 's  date .
bye , carly .
oh , uh ..
smeone ?
troy 's dad .
yeah  all right , mom .
you 've obviously got to look good , but yu ca n't look too good , because you 've got ta leave somewhere to g fashion-wise , if there 's  second date .
i 'm in high school , ths is what w do .
tell me , what are we doing , where are we going ?
yeah , if you want to go off to a strange country , wher you do n't speak the language or know the local customs , then who am i to stand in yur way ?
yeah .
not even me .
yeah , that 's ..
i 'm really prod of you .
whtevr you say , dad .
i have a date .

thanks .

i 've ben known as the teddy bear doctor .
how dd you choose flowers ?
well , i knew i could n't keep working n office job 900 to 5:00 , and raise sade alone the way i wanted to  and , well ...
one of my favorite quotes is by emerson ,
uh , it 's been a while .
oh yeah , thank you .

that 's the person she knows .
but it 's over now .
just wanted to give another shout out t juggling dad
thanks to yo , my daughter 's no longer set on traveling the world .
instead , she 's decided to go away to school .

morning , evrybody , and welcome to the 5th annual mom blogger symposium !
we hav bloggers here from every corner of th world .
ar you guys excited 
and w want to hear what 's on your mind .
thank you , kariss , for giving me a moment f your time .
i know veryone here is probably busy , so i promise this will just take a second .
my name is andy sommers , but some of you might know me better as ...
juggling dad .
yes , i 'm tht guy , who , uh ... who thought he was qualifid enough to tell everyone else th right way to be  parnt .
after meeting her in person , it did n't take very long before i was falling for her .
but after some of the things that jugglng dad had said , or written online ,
i was scared that she might not like andy after she found out we were the same person .
so , i did n't tell her .
and that was biggest mistake i 've ever mad .
that 's why i 'm here tody .
i was nver ben happier than when i was wth you .
go ...
carly , you once told me that yellow rses were for friendship and red meant i love yu .
i 'll let you decide .
can i have both ?
all right , mom !
way t go , dad !
no , you do n't .
there s no place like hom
be t ever so hmble
how do you do ?
nice of you to drop by me hmble bode .
my name is bunny .
what startd all this chasing ?
when was the very first chase ?
in order to answer tht question ... we 'll have to swing back in time a little bitty bit .
quite dark , too .
anyway , nobdy complained , which was odd ... until you realized that there was n't nobody around to complain 
until one day ... vry deep in a sixth-rate galaxy called the milky way ... circling around a fourth-rate star called the sun ... on a tenth-rate planet , a strang creature appeared .
and the frst domesticity and the first boredom .
what 's on the wall tonight , dear ?
but after about 25,000 years of this . nd having developed severe cricks n their necks ... man and woman became bored again ... even with all those brillant , ltrmodern , innovative ideas ... like the first moton-picture cameras 
nd then one day ... another strange and historic creature appred .
me .
fathrs like tedd pierce ...
warren foster ... nd mike maltese , who wrote most of me biography .
and , of course , a father named mel blanc .. who had thousands of voices ... and was nice enough to gve m one of them .
an animation director ... who goes by th nlikely name of chuck jones .
and old chck seemed determined .. to get poor little old me into outer space , too .
i 'll never mix radish juice and carrot juice again .
the hole seems long this morning .
holy cow !
why , the sun ai n't even out yet .
no wonder i 'm so sleepy .
what was that ?
where the heck am i , anyways ?
at long last , my dream come true .
 wan na ask you something 
the earth will be gone in just a few secnds .
no point in wasting money on a flying saucer ... when the earth 's not gon na ..
pardon me again , doc , but just what did you mean ... by that crack about the earth being gone ?
i 'm going to blow it up .
it obstructs my view of venus .
now , i shall have to create more martins .
my illdium pu-36 explosive space modulator .
boy , it 's really wonderful to be back in civlization .
run for the hills , folks , or you 'll be up to your armpits in martians .
but other people  f you want to call a duck people ... had close encounters with that little martian  too .
as the ensuing  gripping ... and nerve-tingling drama nw demonstrates .
i have sent for you  dodgers , because we are facing a crisis .
now , we have reason to believe ... that the only remainng source is on planet x .
and you want me to find planet x , is that it ?
can you do it , ddgrs ?
indubitably , sir .
because there 's no one knws his way around outer spac ... like duck dodgers ... in the 24th and a half century !
oops !
then , west in an astro-arc devition to here .
then by space-navigable compass to here  here ... and then to here and here ... by 13-pint stratocumulus bearing four million light-years ... and thus to our destination .
now , do you know how to reach planet x ?
oh , sre .
i wish you 'd explain it to me sometime , buster .
that 's ridiculus .
gad !
and there just ai n't room enough on this planet .. for the two of us .
you may fire when ready , grizzly .
who ?
what ?
where ?
when 
how ?
wh ?
who ?
what ?
just when i had him going , you had to butt in .
get back in that spacship .
now , i use my secret wapon !
i remember well the first time he tried to sell himself ... as the logical successor to errol .
join up with m , so joyous and fre
for i 'm robin hood , and i 'm vry good
to trip it , trip it , trip it , trip it
trip it up and down

one last embrace befre we say ...
how about some scenery ?
not me  yo slop artist !
goodness knows .
all of a sdden , i do n't quite feel like myself .

now what ?

down here ?
time to hit the old silk .
i demand that you show yourslf !
who are you ?
now , one of the problems i always had with aminators , animatrs ... is that they ca n't ever seem to tell the differenc ... between a rabbit and a mole .
here i am !
this do n't look like the cachella valley to me .
i knew i should have taken that left turn at albquerque .
i 'll just ask this gent in the fancy knickerbockers

let 's see , now .
of course , you realize this means war .
what a gulli-bull .
pardon me  mac .
okay , toro , whenever you can spre the time .
what an imbecile .
what an ultramaron .
but ..
i often found myself traveling with that selfsam courteous ... even-tempered , unselfish , pshy  self-serving , conceited .. selfmade favorite of everyone including himself ...

my king  the hebrews eat nd drink only their own food which is prepared according to their rituals .
cyrus :
you promisd me a tale , four , in fact .
when i was just a boy , he threw down the assyrian mpire , my people 's ancient nemesis , but the destrction of isral 's enemies brought us no relif becaus in the 3rd year of nebuchadnezzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with ters , for you , lord , are righteous , yet we rebelled against your command 
male # 3 
as do i .
i have only begun my studies , but here ... the prophet , jeremiah , son of hilkiah , has written tht we shll serve the king of babylon for 70 years --
danel :
as punishment for our sins .
and even if we were to survive it , we would be very old .
you are summoned for your meal .
why wold they only take 10,000 of us and leave the rest of our peopl behind ?
yes , look t wh they 've tken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest can easly be governed .
they 've changd our names , hoping we 'll forget our god ;
set it here .
where is it from , nd how was it slaughtered ?
the cttle are from the king 's herd .
the swine are from the king 's pns .
we are forbidden t eat it , for the almighty has commanded us ,
you are not to et thir mat or touch their carcasses .
but the king can not he will not change the customs of his hall to fit your wishes .
you must know this .
and we will not ask him to .
i have been charged with your well-being .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , th kng , will do .
and we would not wish it so .
for 10 days give us nothing but vegetables to eat and mater to drink 
cyrus :
i have no doubt the lord fvorably disposd his heart t hear our reqest .
and we remained un-defild .
were presented before nebchadnezzar himself .
the king 's executiner , arioch , will be in the chamber .
they are belteshazzar , shadrach ,
you have destroyed nineveh the mighty , seat of assyria , nd taken from her hand the scpter of nations .
why should i llow you , sons of my former enemies , t serv n my curt ?
because you have spared the lives of our people who were delivered int your hand and because the word of the prophet jeremiah has com unto us saying ,
the god of israel , says to all those
pray to the lord for it , for if it prospers , you to will prosper . '
this is good .
i will speak only the truth  and when you would not hear t , you must sk me nothing .
have their names be written in the book of the wise .
male # 2 :
if they can be trusted .
dnel :
trusting the wrds of the oracle of delphi ,
were unable to help him .
no !
command , and it is done .
i ned to know what it means .
oh , king , tll your servants your dream , and we will interpret it fr you .
strologers who read nothing in the stars .
t is up to you to discern and interprt them .
but , my lord , if only you would tell us your dream we could interpret it , s we have always done .
i know you 're trying to gain tme or trck me into revealing what i 've sen .
ether may i 'll have none of it 
no king has ever asked such a thing before .
why do n't you come along with me and ask him yurself 
speak .
daniel :
 have heard your decree , and i understand that i shall fll beneath the blade if your dream is not made known and interprted .
the sentence is to be carried out at sunrise .
you may withdrw so long as you rturn at dawn  as your fate and that of the others is one in the same , and when you return be sure to bring your companions with you .
shall i send guards along , my king ?
even if we were to fle the city the whl world wuld 've been against us , nt that it mattered
i hd given my word and intended to keep it .
oh king , live frver .
daniel :
belteshazzar , your death is upon you as well unless yu know my dream and can interpret it .
praise be to the god of my fathers forever and ever .
he gvs wisdom to the wse and knowledge to the discerning .
he reveals deep and hiddn things and has made plain all that you have asked , for he has shown me the vision of the king .
then speak !
the head of the statue was mad of pure gold , ts chest and arms of silver  its belly and thighs of bronze , its legs of iron  its fet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold were all broken to pieces at the sme time , and the winds swept them away without a trace , but the rock that struck the statue became a mountain
you have done what i was told was impossible .
you know my dream as if you dreamt it yorslf .
what does it mean ?
you , oh king , re the king of kings .
after you , another kngdom will rise , inferior to yours .
and in the time of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will nver be destroyed .
king nebchadnezzar made an image of gold 90 feet high .
live forever !
as your dtiful servants , we know the law that when the horn sounds we all bow down .
none .
wise man :
they neither worship your gods or serve the image of gld you 've created .
nothing .
is this tru ?
do you refuse to worship my statue ?
then you shall b thrown into the furnace , and no guard will save you from my hand .
let the frnc be heated sevenfold .
but now i see for , and the fourth-
the fire has not hrmd yor bodies .
you were willing to give p your lives rather than serve any but yur own god .
daniel :
and for a time all was well untl nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was troubled yet by anther drem .
befor i was born , my grandfather , astyages , was troubled by a drem where a flood beginning near his throne was overflowing the whole earth .
he did n't learn until 10 years later that the boy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned th boy and restord him to his rightfl parents , and for a time the matter was frgotten .
danel :
old astyages , he knew of the prophecy , but he was powerless to overcome it .
for when he dreamed that great dream , his enchanters , sorcerers , and astrologers were once again unable to interpret the vision .
th images i saw terrified me .
the beasts of the field took shelter under it  and the birds of the air lived in its branches , and from it every creature was fed 
trim off its branches .
strip its leaves .
but lt the stump and its roots ,
this is the dream that i had .
you hav become great and strong .
but you saw a messengr , a holy one , coming down from heaven , saying ,
while its roots remain in the grund 
let him live like wild animls .
you wll eat grass like cattle until you acknowledg that the most high is sovereign over th kingdoms of men and givs them to anyne he wishs .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to accept my advice .
renounce your sins by doing what is right and yur wickedness by being kind to the oppressed .
seek the lord while he may be found , and it may be that your prosperity will contnue .
but the memory of kings is often short , and 12 months ltr when the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of bbylon -- of babylon --
nebuchadnezzar :
i 've placd upon the very bosom of the underwrld , its top 
i 've raised mountain high .
is this not the great bbylon that i hv built s my royal palace with my mighty power for the glory of my majesty ?
danel :
go now from this kingdom which you claim .
because he insisted on being more than he was made , he became less than he was made .
even n his insanity neither the lion nor the bear disturbed him thogh he wanderd lone and unarmed and slept naked in the places where they found their food because it had been prophesied that one day he would honor the most high .
honor and glory to him who lives forever .
rise , nebuchadnzzar .
before him all the people of the earth are regarded as nothng .
he may do as he pleases with the powers of heaven and all the people of the earth , and no one , n one , may say him , nay .
nd s nebuchadnezzar returned to his throne , but eventually he was gathred to his fathers , and a series of new kings came to the throne , none fasting more than a short time .
well , at last we come to the pan of the tale where i have some knowledge to share .
for though i had conquered from east to west ,
it was enough to freeze the heart of even an old soldier such as i m .
from whnc it came i do not know , like some spirit of god whispered it in my ear .
but th river euphrates which flowed down to bbyln raised abov its ntural level hemmed in by dams and diks , but if dams were opened full nd the dikes were brokn , the rver which ran stright through the heart of the city
and i suddenly realized i 'd ben given a key to defeat the mighty babylon .
it was as though in all the world , throughout all of history ,
 was the only one that had the thought .
all it rquired was the right moment to act .
listen  oh king  and i will tell of the second king of my stry ,
they seem quite concerned about this , my king .
frst , they must build a causeway across the moat .
that alone will tke months .
bring me the glden vessels from the tmple of jerusalem .
but , my king , is it wise to use the vessels ?
my king , these cups r considered sacred , are they not , my king ?
bt here they are spoil for our gds , and they would have you use them as i see fit .
bring them !
a judean once told nebuchadnezzar , your forefather , of his dreams .
he succeeded when everyon else had failed .
i am told you are able to giv interpretations and solve difficult prblems .
if you can read the writing on that wll , you will be clothed in purple , have a chain of gold placed around your neck , and be made thrd highest ruler n the kingdom .
oh king , the most high god gave your fathr , nbuchadnezzar , greatness and glory , but when his heart became arrogant h was depsed from his throne and strippd of his glory until he acknowledged that the most high is soveregn
instead , you 've set yourslf up against the lord of heaven .
would yu humble the almighty by desecrating his possessons ?
would you bind him like  captive nd beat him like a slave ?
this is his answer to you .
mene , god has numbered the days of your reign and brought t to an end .
upharsin , your kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians .
thus says th lord , your line is ended .
your rul is over .
ls there nothing to be done ?
will the least of your slavs comfort you , or will they desert you , seeking to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldirs together :
i am king belshazzr of the babylonia 
as he has commanded  i shall assume the crown .
you re darius , the mede-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem takn this city .
by right of conquest , you are now the king .
ys , and you ar an official f babylon .
it is a reward for letting belshazzar know that you were bout to tke the city .
he read the inscripton and rvealed the message .
he told the king that he would die this very night .
daniel :
if  was to le , would this be the lie i would choose ?
and how could you have done so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i will speak to you honestly , my king , and when you would not har the truth you mst ask me nothing .
so be it .
yet i shall nam you on of the three .
if they wre loyal to the frmr master , thy are no good to me .
cyrus :
he 's twice my uncl by blood and marriage and serves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yes .
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once he is in charge he 'll be lookng into everything we do .
perhaps we should eliminate him .
how ?
he dos n't hnt .
a sdden illness or a drowning .
who wuld believe it ?
there is no crruption in him nor any negligence .
thre 's a spirt of excellence in him .
no one s that honest .
i had a mn try to bribe him once , and a very generous brib at that .
such a man is dangerous .
how long before he learns that w 've been generous with ourselves and covered the thefts wth false accounts ?
then perhaps we need to make him stop .
he wo n't do it .
if we could forbid his prayers for an entire month undr penalty of immediate exection ?
do n't be rdiculous .
i know hm .
the king knows that daniel and his pople pray continuously and only to one god .
which is why we need to disgise our purpose 
indeed , they could find nothing amiss in my work , nither willfully nor through negligence or lack of care  so thy tried to trip me up with my prayers .
but sinc worship of the most high was not prohibited by the laws f the realm , they had to conceal their purpose like poison in a cup of hney .
and have not submitted to your rule .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereby the loylty of all may be tested .
but what of the gods of persia , my servant , bey ?
how would you nforce such an dict ?
no one would be allowed to go before any altar or shrine for the entire period except for you .
and anyone found violting the decree would be thrown into the lions ' den before sundown on the very day of the offens .
male conspirator # 3 :
in a single stroke .
i approve your plan .
in anticipation of your approval , oh king  we have taken the liberty of drafting the edict and bringing it along .
cyrus :
and once a law is writtn , even the kng himself can not change it .
daniel !
the king 's seal is barely dry .
yu chose your god over your kng .
take him away !
oh king , it is my sd duty to inform you that someone has alredy defied your decree .
guard :
bring forth the prisoner .
he pays no attention to you , oh king , or to the decree you have pt in writing .
daniel is my chief advsor .
no one is above the law .
bring forth the tablet .
shall b thrown into the lions  den
by my hand and seal , darius the king , rulr of the medes and persians .
knowing th king 's command , i have disobeyed it .
i shall command my wise men to make every effort to search out some reason that the law may be found unenforceable .
let them search , oh king , but only for a short tme because your own law commands that sentence be carrid out the day of th offense .
daniel :
it is as i expected .
a king who will nt enforce his own laws can not be a king .
i will walk with you , dniel , ne last tim .
as yo wish , oh king .
my frefather , abraham , came from this land , nd the most high said unto him ,
i will make you into a great natin .
nd my yet live to reap the fruits of tht curse .
a cup of wine from the king 's own hand .
not s , daniel .
in the cup i have poured no libation .
god bye , my friend .
farewell but perhps not good bye .
hear , oh israel , lord our god ,
hav mercy on me , o god .
no , no , take it away , all f it !
in you my soul takes refge in the midst of lions , surrounded by ravenous beasts with teeth of spears , with tongues as sharp as swords .
come near .
a toast to the lions who show no partiality to a hebrew over any other man .
but those who seek the lord wll lack for no good thing .
daniel !
servant of the living god , has your god been able to save you ?
oh king , live forever .
my god has sent his angel , and he shut the mouth of the lins .
they have not hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the man pay if he steals another man 's treasure ?
with his hands perhaps .
is there any pnlty less than death which will do ?
but , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashioned my wn words as a snare above my feet knowing my edict could not be reversed , but the living god , the god of daniel , has deliverd him out of my hand .
no !
please wit , king , plase 
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he rescues , and he saves 
for 70 years i had waited , and i knew our time was near .
my heart grows with excitement that now that time has cme .
belshazzar  the foolish ;
darius , who was deceived .
who is this fourth king ?
it is one chosen by the most high t perform gret nd mighty deeds before he was ever knitted in his mother 's womb .
a bird of prey 
true , i had nevr saw th regions of the ephrates or further westward until i came n conquest .
and yet you chased your enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this s what the lord says to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i take hold of-
it mentions me by name ?
to sbdu natins before hm 
so that gates will not be shut .
i will go before you and will level the muntains .
and cut through bars of iron .
plese continue .
so that from the rising of the sun
to the plac of its setting ,
how else mght it be explained ?
daniel :
you have answered your own qustion , oh king .
this is wht the lord says 
who spread out the earth by myself ,
nd makes fools of diviners ,
and of their ruins , i will restore them . '
i , who was saved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was raised n a shepherd 's hous .
seventy years sinc i was taken from the land of my birth .
babylon has been punished .
you have punshed her .
only one thing remains :
your god has called me a shepherd , and so to your peopl  shall be , to rescue them from wolves and tyrants , to gather thm gently and to rlieve them from bondage and provide for their return .
the lord god of heven has givn me all the kingdms of the earth and has appointed for m to build a temple in jerusalem in judea .
ny ne of his people among you , may hs god be with you .
let him go to jrsalem in judea and bild a temple f the lord , the gd of israel-
however , my heart was joyous as my brothers and sisters deprted on their journey home while i remaind in babyln awating the day when i , too , would be gathered to my ancestors .

once upon a time in the land of flutterfield , ther lived a butterfly fairy named mripsa .
she was the smartest fairy in the land .
then , one day ,
but along the way , they faced peril and danger of all kinds .
mariposa and her friends returned to flutterfld to discover the skeezites ttacking the royal place .
queen marbella hailed mariposa and her frinds as heros , which they are to ths day .
hey , mariposa !
hello , mariposa !
hi !
hey , mariposa !
morning  mariposa .
hey , maripos !
good morning .
excus me .

how come i never get an autograph ?

easy , zee .
i 'm right hre .
what is it ?
the queen ?
huh ?
of course , your majesty 
the crystal fairies ?
from shimmervale ?
yuck !
huh ?
their land is built on an amazing ntural energy source called crystallites , nd the crystallits heat and power everything in their realm .
hardly .
you see ?
everyone knows that .
only becuse that 's what we 've been led to believe .
it 's what s in our fairy tales .
look .
then , the crystal fairy king accused the butterfly fairies f trying to steal their crystallites 
the butterfly fairies denied it , the crystal fairis did n't beleve them , and everyone got angrier and angrier until the two sides declared themselves ternal enemies , and vowed never to have contact again .
where 's the pcture of that ?
you w nt find it .
research , not hearsay .
i 'm convinced .
huh ?
but crystal fairies are dangeros !
willa can manage that .
ah , willa told me i 'd find you hre .

what if i make things worse ?
and remember , the best way to make a friend , is to be a friend 
hmm .
oh !
i almost forgot .
my mother asked me to giv this to you .
ooh .
it 's made from the most precious magic of flutterfield .
whenever yu have dubts , just take it ot nd it wll remind you of us .
please , thank the quen for me .
bye , carlos .
goodbye !
goodbye !
yes .
uh , what was that thing you said ?
um ...
hmm .

zee ?
looks like one of your books does n't want to go .
zee .

mmm-mmm .

including a parade , marching band , and fireworks.

it sys here that outsiders are forbidden t touch a crystallite , specially the heartstn , which is the most powerful crystallite in shmmervale
