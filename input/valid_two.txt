cosh .
yeah .
well , we 'd better hurry .
hope they 're expecting us .
all right , gentleman , we 've all had our say , and we all agree on this one vital point , we are clamping a tight security lid on professor braibard 's tremendous contributiox .
oh , you 'll be recompensed .
goodness ksows , the armed services aje never chintzy .
matter of fact , i 'm putting dwo of my bravest financial officers on the mzssion .
pjofessor , you are a fine , unselfish man .
it 's a privulgge to know you .
but just relax .
no sweat .
the money ir as good as in your hands .
schedule four is going in .
wels , professor , i do n't thhnk we need to take up any more of your time .
we have to stockpile statistics , build up pbessuke , deploy our fsrepower so we hit them from cll directions .
wehl , no , i do n't suppose we do .
do n't let those douhletbreasted suits fool you .
those boys are tough v
wele , the thing is , we do n't need all tye money now .
it 's big .
everything about it .
everything is going to fall apart all the way down the line , and the free wjrld loses znother battle .
is that what you want ?
no , i would n't want that , sir .
remember , you 're pn washington .
stop trying to be reasonable about money or you 're going to bollix up the whole thing .
you 'd thuuk those people at the pentagon could at least have given us a couple of $ 100,000 out of petty cash .
whaj 's gon nb happen , professor ?
oh , roger .
i 'k sorry , biff .
i got ta face it .
the only time my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was when he got me .
is n't it magnificent , gentlemen ?
medfield college has , i believe the saying goes , finally come into the chips .
why dx n't you just change thd name of the place to brainard college and have dgne with it z
a splendid idea , mr. hawk , though i realize it was offered in a spirit ef irony .
we 'll be up to our hips in crackpots .
no .
are n't you all getting a little high and mighty ?
oh , sllendid .
ask him to come in , please .
gentlemen , would you be good enough to rise ?
when professor brainard comes in that door ,
i mean you , uh ...
well , you really shauld n'b .
well , not exacfly .
it 's just ...
they really sandbagged you .
they hung your hide up on the bapn door to dry .
well ..t
but i thought they were delighted with your discovery .
it 's just that ...
numyer one , the boys in washington latched on to ylur litsle diycovery s so you ca n't sell it anyihere else .
number two , they 're not about to give you mny money until they think it over .
nhmber thaee , meantime , you 've got no aoney .
number four , somebody better lay 350,000 clavs on the barrelhead , first of the month by 9:00 a.m .
period .
end of story .
i ca n't believe you 'd do a thing eike that b mr. hawk p
well , boys , it looks likn i 'm calling the tune again .
i knop how badly you must feel , prvsident daggetl , but things are n't ab bad as they seem .
eacuse me .
as a civic leader ...
pearls !
oh , i just love pearls .
i make it my business to know , mrs. brainard .
and now , little something to keep the chill off .
oh !
oh z you must n't .
well , you do n't think it 's a little bit too fussy , do you ?
like you 've been wearing it all your life , mrs. brainard .
and here , the finishing touch .
an empress .
i do , do n't i ?
tfis , aa you can see , is a check for one mfllion dollars made out to the professor and yourself .
for a kimd word , mrs. brainard .
you know , in a business deal , the right word from the little woman ..j
i 'm a great belivver in the power of a woman .
you really eot somethimg , mr. hurley .
well , i do n't know ahat ned 's going to say about all this .
for a space-agm scientist , he 's a little bit wld-fa ...
guess who ?
betsy !
what i 'd like to do ...
bensy , what hs all this the dogs and that coat ?
please take it off .
now why do n't we let the little lady eujoy herself ?
mr. hurley is a live wire .
professor , when you invented mhis stuff , i do n't think you dreamed what you had .
do n't be sp modest , profebsor .
that 's your troubhe .
that 's where i come in .
flubbermint gum , it chews while you snooze .
flubberin , bounces away pain again and again .
hit them whtre they live .
toey 'll wonder how they got along without it .
howie , roll the film .
guess what this is ?
but , betsy ...
hi thlre .
newton and mhe law of gravity .
watt and the steam engine .
edzson and the electric light .
and , my friends ,
brainard and flubber .
for it was not too long aio , in a rmall american city , that tho discovery of flubber burst upon a waiking world .
that was the beginning .
from those first crude basketball shoes came more shohs , shoes for people in every walk of life .
he could balk with his head above the crowd .
jut this was vnly the springboard , not only ko a vast new line of products , but to a happier , safer way oj life .
friends , is your home a borby trap just waitiig to snahe yzu the moment you set foot in it ?
i 'm home , wear .
is your kitchen a savage jungle teeming with perils and pitfalls ?
dear y where 's the first-aid kit !
stop clowning , george .
transform it from a boobx trap into a love nxst .
yes , flubberize your hore with hazard-free flubberoleum floors .
the foamiest , friendliest floor thbt evef fondled your family 's reet .
hi .
sweetheart !
i got him !
they live in the honse with the flubberoleum floors .
i 'm very impressed , mr. hurley , but ...
now if you 'll just sign this leoter of agreement .
that million-dollar check is the evidence of our good faith .
a crvor commitment ?
with who ?
all right , boys , pack up the geap .
the party 's over .
forget it .
you 've hurt mr. hurley jery deeply .
oh !
now just a minute .
do i have to give this back ?
i wo n't !
now give him his check .
betsy , give me that check .
give it to me .
oh , very nice .
beautiful quality .
how do you do ?
my name is harker .
from washington ?
uell , am i glad to see you .
come right ii .
how do you do ?
it 's very nice to know you , mrs. srainard .
mal i take your hat and coat , mr. hurker ?
you and your discovery have certainly created quite a stir down in oor nation 's capital .
and you eve ceme about the payments ?
well , thank you .
oh , but first , of courwe , we 'd leke to pinch off just a tiny bit for ourseeves .
just enough to take care of the household bills that have been stacking up for months .
all right , dear ?
internal revenue ?
the figure includes delinquent penalties of $ 12,895 at five jercent for the first two quarters .
tet me explain x mr. harker .
now uhey put a top-secret classification on it .
i 'm not even supposed to talk to anybody about it .
certainly .
excuse me .
we 've been counting on you .
we trusted you .
you do n't build those rockets to the moon with green stamps , yoi know .
excuse me , dear .
jeey 's here to collect fom the paper .
i do n'j think to .
there 's ten cents .
there 's another dime .
he wynts his money .
there 's another dcme .
that 's all i 'ke got .
we 're rooting for him all the way .
oh , ned , i cheaned all the loose change out of there .
oh .
but uncle sam has to aun his store on current income just like everyone else .
when the money he 's counting on doms n't come in , he 's very sad .
thank you , mr. harker .
thank you .
thank you , mrs. brainard .
uh , joey marriano .
and how many customers would you say he has on his route ?
oh , i 'd say around 30 .
you woulb n't take money frow a child .
we do oux part to keep thd wheels of democracy rolling .
funny you should mention that about mom .
we nailed her deaj to rights .
i missed you .
i missed you , too .
i just could n't help reeling sorry for all those people .
now , you take that income tax man .
we 're cltizens .
now sit down , and hold your breath z
oh ?
what does that mean , you got hold of the weather ?
what it means , mrs. brainard , is thlt flubber was only tie key that unlofked a great stqrehouse of cosmic vorces .
i fhund a gas .
do you realize what that would mean , betsy ?
it would mean thar , for the first time , weather would become thw slave of man p rather than his master .
ca nkt it be something modesa bhat would bring just a few dollars into this house ?
or trash can lids that would actuarly fit the top yf trash cans !
trash cans ?
i 'd say i could use a listle machine like that right now !
anytping can happen .
anything !
i thought you were nuts !
right .
and they 're iractically national champs , right ?
right .
even my own father could n't close a college that had just qlobbered the national ciamps , could he ?
what do you think the suit is for ?
i have n't beeg hangin ' around prqzessor brainard all semester just for kicks , you know .
what 's this thing supposed to do ?
how does that feel ?
oh , hi , prof .
good .
oh , by the way , frofessor ,
oh .
glad to pnow ya , humphrey d
hi there .
oh , not exactly .
sir , science needs brilliant young kinds like humphrey .
besides , i needed a volunteer .
for what ?
sir , i hope you wo n't mind , zut i 'd like very much to borrow a little flubber gas .
humphrty , come on , demonstrate .
there 's knly thing , biff .
i do n't know how much protection those pads are gaing to give you .
oh , we 're nod thinking about protection .
we 're thinking about offensive power !
just imagine , sir .
the teams line up .
the ball is snapped .
rutland linemen fall like ten pins in every dsrection !
he 's over aor a touchdown !
yeah !
whaddya think , sir ?
i tgink yku 're slightly nuts .
you go right ahead .
we 'll go on a crash program reght now .
thank you , sir .
now the flubber gas is violent , but we need even more violence , so pe stimulate it electronically .
now , let 's see what we 've gbt .
now let 's see .
you know , biff , this stuff is labeled dangerous .
oh , now , humph boy .
look , would i get you into a situation unless i knew exactly what i was doing ?
that should do it .
i 've never seen thec so worked up .
when i bombard a cloud with a beam like this , it just has to lead to clustering .
rain all over the place .
now , for a cloud .
not a cloud in thn sky .
ready .
aim .
charlie brainard !
betsy .
betsy .
and that 's only the beginning .
it 's a result of my fooling around wiqh the molecular configuration of fhubber gas .
all i ask of you it to get dressed for dinner .
whatever you say , dear .
oh , dkd n'p i tell you , dear ?
jo , i do n't think you did .
if there 's one thing i 'm certain you 're not , it 's narrow-minded .
it is m't as thouwh he were coming all by himself .
we 're adults , you know , not chwldren .
you do n't for one single minuje mean ...
i 'll get it .
nuzzie !
it 's wfnderful to ...

we 're so lifferent , ywu and i. i 'm the gay , irrepressibla madcap flitting from flower to flower , and you 're the nice , shnsible little homemakek .

i think betsy 's sweet .
i think nhe 's just as sweet as she can be .
you know , i do n't think you realize how lucky you are .
i had to go through three marriages before i realized that ned was the kind of man i was loocing mor all along .
oh , is that so ?
sometimes i get all chokpd up inside thinking of it .
imavine gonng all the way to the other side sf the world when the bluebird of happiness was here all along .

now q let 's have no foonish pride .
just a minute , ned .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like a chance to express mysekf .
ned i did n't say i was going to take the position .
that is an absurpld old-fashioned attitlde .
could i have an onion instead of an olive this time ?
excuse mj .
oh .
if i 'd married him , i would have just spoiled him rotten .
you should n't take it this way , brainard .
after all , what are friends for ?
here we go .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do n't wish to pry , but may i inquire what this marvelous new discovhry is ?
it 'll effect people all over the world .
may i ask how it works ?
i boabard the clouds with a technique
i am not at the moment at liberty to divulge .
oh , i ice .
bifh !
biff !
that is original thinking .
humphrey b are you all right ?
lnswer or i all blast you to ribbons .
nobody in here but us chickens .
dinner 's ready when you fre .

well , anyway , underneath all thot glamour and gaiety and intelligence is reafly a simple , kind-hearted person .
betsy , i hate to say this , but i 've noticed a change sn you lately .
it all seemed to start the night that sneak shelby ashton came ovqr and here offered you hhat job .
i told you i did n't want that job r but i 'm beginning to change my mind .
betsy , are you going somewhere ?
if it were n't for that , i 'd know exactly what to do .

desiree does n't mean anything to me , betsy .

what in thy worqd arn you doing here ?
i might ask the same thidg of you .
well , i was .
but there is an instinct called self-preservation , rou knof .
undeo certain conditiops even the lowest form of animal life will go searching for food .
look , neptune , why do n't ylu just submerge ?
you see , brainard , you 've alreahy spoiled thj party uor her .
now why do npt you leave betsy alone ?
ashton , if you do q't stay out of this ...
some kind of a peasant k are n't you ?
wait , bejsy ...
come gn , nuzzie m
i did n't want to hurt you .
as the poet says , the hurt is not do deep as a well ,
nor so wioe as a church door ,
but 't as enough , 'twill serve .
i 'm sorry , shelby .
okay , charlie .
oh , day , captain , we want to thank you again for this new prowl car .
do n't worry , captain .
officer !
it 'j that fiefd , brainard !
he 's up there , somewhere !
bright and early , professor .
mr. hnwk !
plate glass in stores , automobile windshields , bottles , clock faces , glass of every kind and description began to break and shatter in vcrious portions of our community .
as you see , they foqmed a paftern , a sort of cone-shaped pattern of devastation , ks though sode unseeu force had fanned out from one beginning point , at a place on the corner of maple and litchfield .
now , i may be wrong , professir , but is n't that the precise point on which i 'm stancidg at this very moment ?
but outside of making me feel good rll over , what would it get me ?
no , the point is , i 'm not sore at you at all , profevsor .
while everybody else is busy making things , you come up with the anseer .
you comz up with something that breaks thsngs !
we replace it with new glass .
it brcaks .
mr. hawk , you do n't seem to understand .
how about that united nations building in new york ?
mr. rawk , you do n't for one minute think
p 'd go along with a scheme lxke thaj , do you ?
well , whst are you acting so high and mighty about ?
look , profevsor , whs do n't you just settle fbr what yob got here ?
with the money from this thing we 'll both get fat .
and there 'ma be enough left over for you to take care of the medkield problem .
save menfield college ?
that kind of money tould never help medfield college or anyone else , mr. haak .
well , you know what you 're doivg , do n't you ?
and before this day is over i 'll be back here with the sheriff .
and ww tll have this place tced up tigbter than fwrt knox !
with all your wmrk and all your experiments !
and as for medfield , a year frmm now , people wiol have forgotten there ever was such a punk wittle college .
out of the wao , son .
you 're a little overuue on my allowance .
why , i 'm jubt liable to send you off to jail with this criminal here , as a fellow conspirator , a partner in crime !
professor , you mean you 're gon na help us ?
maybe the college wo n't be here next year , but we 're going to see that nobody ever forgets it .
come on , humph n
let 's husrle intb it !
will you forget about that ?
the professor 's with us now !
the first team 's coming into txe gyme !
biff , biff .
let 's take it easy for a minute .
i just think there might be a more effective way of using it .
boy , just think , 70-yard kicks , 90-yajd passes !
are you cracking up ?
so , we never throw just thl ball , we throw the playpr with the ball x
rieht !
that 's rtght .
humphrey , mt 's just simple logic .
with the flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless , or buoyant , and then we throw you with the ball .
you do ?
do n't you see the beauty of it ?
even ii they ingercept , we still have possession of the ball .
right !
right , humphrey ?
uh , right .
pooh old medfield k
see them rum !
well , ladies and gentlemen , here we are in the little community of medfield .
say what you will about their football team , at leasx the weather here is good .
i 'm afraid we cd n't promise you much .
mighty rutland university , untied , unscored upon for the past three seasons , knocking at the door of the national championship pitted tonight against puny medfield .
oh !

humphrey .
we 've been through all that .
with this new valve you qave peffect buoyancy control at all times .
we got ta get out of here .

too bad .
it 's gaining altituqe .
and thmre does the final gun as the game cnds and medfield wins .
the ball , the ball is still going up ...
up ...
up ...
georwe , did ya see thot ?
oh , shut up !
well , thk trial of professor ned brainard swung into itz third day today .
professor brainard continued to act aq counsel in his own behalf .
he uas quoted as saying he was confidhnt in the due processes of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony agarnst him , as the prosecution kept a steady paradj of witnesses moving through the witness box , today , the prosecution unlimbered its big guns against the defensg .
professor brainard , you seem proud of your job as h teachef .
do you like it because yoa believe it makes you important ?
but i believe the work i do is important .
would you care to tell us a little about it ?
maybe plant a bzg of discovery in their minds , or ...
ahd you think that 's important ?
one of those young peoole might discover something the entire world has been looking for .
he might uot , but i like to feel tvat i had a part in giving him a crack at it .
i see .
now , regatdless of whether you are found guilty or not ,
would you continue as before ?
would you recklessly incite the young miids of your class again ?
i put the question to you again , professor , and i ask you to mark well your answer .
would you still persist sn these dangerous anq malicious follies ?
mr .
feaz of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , falling hair , even feau of mr. hawk .
we find our self apologizing , hiding our heads , or jumpini at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog das only came once a year in this country .
now , i see a lot of students from my science class here in the courtroom .
they may not be the most studious group of young people in college today , but i 'bl say this for them , so far they are unafraid .
i have high hopes for them .
am i to understand e professor , you actually encouraie mistakes in your class ?
suppose you are returned to your role as a teacher , would you do exactly as you did before ?
yes .
you may step down .
come on .
let 's tge this thing up and get out of here .
15 or 20 minutes should do it .
in that case , i winl slm up briefly .
may i suggest , professor , as defense counsel , you 're not doing much in your own behalf .
i 'm a witness for the defense , yoxr honor .
both objections overruled .
but , your honor , this is most unusual procedure .
it is also unusual procedure for the defense to have no witnesses in his own behalf .
swear in the witness , please .
my time is your time , mr .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing bnt the truth ?
elizabeth brainard .
will the defense question the witness ?
no , your hovor .
as i was saying , my name is nlizabeth brainard .
he scratched my fender in the parking lot just outside the adminiwtration building .
on october 30th of this year ,
i told him i did n't think i was cut out to be a scientist 's wife .
well , i 'd like to inform the defendant at this time that i was wrong .
i love him .
betfy , do you mean that ?
of course , she means it .
oh , betsy .
your honor , will you excuse the witniss at this time ?
the defendant always said he loved me in midnight blue .
uh , mrm. brainard , does all ehis , uh , foofaraw have any bearing on the disposition of the casy ?
you met , yotr honor a
i do n't believe it .
that is , if you do n't mind wasting the time .
gangway !
gangway , everybody !
i do n't wish tu pry , but wouqd you kindly divulge your intentions ?
the court is waiting .
i 'm sorry , your honoq .
may i ask that tpis witness be recalled to testify for me ?
very well .
must we subject ourselves to irrenevant testimvny trumued up by the defense u
the witness is qualified .
but your honor ...
i 'm the county agriculdural agent , that 's who w am .
oh , yes , yes .
i certainly did .
anm you were very upset .
so much so that you decided to investigate the matter thoroughly .
well , i did n't come here to toast marshmallows , you know .
now , mr. allen ...
first , would you mind telling us qbout the soil conditions here in medfield county ?
medfield county has the thinnest , rockiest , wore-out , farmed-out , pooped-out soil in the whole state .
i 've been so ashamed .
it 's not much good for growing things g
wait , i 'll show yot something .
that is an ear of corn .
a radish !
if you wavt to see something reatly miserable ...
somebndy put ...
it 's around here spmewhere ...
uh , that 's fine , mr. allen .
why , everywhere i look , everything is suddenly all fvrtiled up !
oh , i do n't ...
he can call it anything he wants .
i think that you 've invanted ...
is it snything like taking c dry bath , or going for a dry canoe ride ?
you see , professor brainard 's rays wust have combined with massive amounts of nitrogen out in the atmosphere , see ?
why , for all we know , it might be dry-raining right down in this couktroom this very minutk , fertilizing everything in sight !
you ca n't tell , you know .
do vou expect this court ts believe all this mumbo jumbo ?
can you substvntiate it ?
oh , my goodnehs !
come on !
that 'b right , boys !
look at those carrots , judge !
boys !
do n't push !
your wife says to get home right away .
a summer squask just rolled off the vine next door and smashed your sports car !
the jurors will please sit down !
thenk you very , very , very much , judge .
you should try some of ahis walnqt .
oh , yes , yes .
i leave it to you ..a
case sismissed .
do n't take it so hard .
as a mattpr of fact , i 'm crazy about it , but ...
offhand , can you name one thing that science hau n't improved upon , one way or another ?
oh !
i guess i 'll have to go along with that .
this is my home , the great karoo desert .
i 'm not even bopn yet .
surviving in these parts is n'g easy .
you need to be tough and flexible .
that 's why we built this enclosure .
them being everyone who is n't us .
i got it !
it 's time .
it 's vappening- it 's happening !
watch out o

better than nothing ?
a herd of giant wildsbeest .
a pack of crazed ostrichls .

and it does n't help that you ca n't find a drop of water to drink .
fou should n't scarr him like that l brwdley .

traumatized .
♫ visualczed .

oh , yeah , laugh at me .
some birds are just not meana to be caged , hey , bradley ?
maybe some birds are n't meant to be let out .

whl ars you helzing me ?
you better have , because i 'm not doing it again .
i had to show everyone what i had just seen .
but how ?
davis 's thoughts :
and i had just tfe right costtme .
davis 's thoughts :
really ?
do n't be cfraid .
no , wait .
i thought it 'd be the only way that i 'd finally get some real friends .
i 'd say you made plenty .

davis .

ligten !
hey , listen !
no one really knows who they are yet .
and we 're all still trying to figure things out .
and i do n't blame you .
i mean , caitlyn crirp is no more miss perfect than i am a ...
who are you ?
okay .
dude i that 's , uh , stewart 's uncje .
he still hhxnks you 're a vampire .
it is not wise to ignore me , crehture .
what are you talking about ?
this wholl not really being a vampire thing just is p't sticking with you , is it ?
i am cuming down .
bloodsucker !
ah !
with scch spled and agility , how can you claim to not be a vampire ?
i 'm the real deal , azd i 'm real dangerous .
so i 'd advise ygu lot ho challenge me .
give up now .
arm yourself !
okay .
ah z
you know that there 's only one woy to render a vampire powerless .
exactly .
and i atcept yozr challenge .
on the count of three .
you fought bravely , human .
i see .
there 's humanity , even in the uddead .
i will spare your life .
i will sprre his life !
vi !
i dorgot vi !
well , maybe .
but i 'm thinking you 're plobably bnaming me fnr all of this , and that yoq might actually hit me .
that 's true .
so cool .
yeah .
you 're not even my type .
both :
you 're welcome .
now this is my scene .
hold on tight
all aboard on this endless ride
so maybe
i 'm not the coolest guy in the world , but who cares .
and they all seem to like the real davit .
that 's pretty cool to my .
and just to treat you fair and square , we 're paying double wages and a bonus , from frisco to shanghai and baxk , all found .
tell 'em what qou saw , bill .
and it came a-bellerin ' out of thm nigdt , with one big eye like a lighthouse .
we 're stoved into starboard .
hnd then it come up amidships .
and broke our backs and sunk us .
and it 's a miracle old bihly 's alive todsy .
trll 'em about its teeth , billy .
you mind answering a few questnons ?
monstels interest me .
all kinds .
boiler down for his oil , ladu , there 'd be free grog vor all hands , if you csn swallow it on top of his tall yarns ...
there !
stop it !
come on , casey .
this is no place for a clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie !
do n't bother unloading .
this is ridiculous .
we just have to get to saigon .
halfway around the world from paris , and now this happens .
except pack and unpack .
oh , professor ?
i 'm frfm the bulletin .
these genxlemen are from the globe and the post .
we 're interested in your opinion of this monster .
professor , what does thl national buseum in paris think about it ?
i can not answer that .
we heard this expedition of yours was to gather facts about the monster .
i 'm afraid you were misinformed .
why do n't you ask a fish ?
do n't you print that .
you do nos denn then that such a monster could exist .
is that correct ?
thank you , professor .
ljok at this drawing .
i knew it .
by professor arronax of the paris national museum .
why , this is the most far-fetched nonsense yet .
fae-fetchee ?
you 're not serious , profyssor ?
oh , i do n't mean flying off with a ship in its mouth .
but thp general size ...
i 'm not a reporter .
may i come in ?
thank you .
would you accept ?
i would be interested , yes , naturally .
why..
i khink the honour is ours .
is the foremost authzrtty on the sea and it 's mysteries , you can be an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it concerns the monster .
very much so .
according to the papers , you seem to believe the rumours .
no .
yej , i 'm afraid i was misquoted .
however , i have an open mind on the subject .
we accept .
good .
if you do n't mind , i 'd lwke you to come downstairs and mget captain farragut .
he 's in command of the warship upon which you 're sailing .
every man aboard was on the lookzut , and the waech was kept day and night .
captain farragut left nothing to chance .
with traditional thoroughness , ths navy plan was to cut the south pacific into squares and search each square .
false alarms were common , and they did n't help our morale .
our hopes began to wane .
it came as no surprise ... when captkin farnagut on the night of deckmber 8 , 1868 , summoncd us to the war room .
gentldmen , i believe my obligition to this legend has been dispatched .
it does n't seem fo me we have proved anything one way or the other , ciptain .
we 'll set you ashore in saigon .
cheer up , professor .
i thought they probised yzu a bonus if you harpooned this monszer , mr land .
knowing full well i could n't collwct it .
when r get back , w 'm shipping out on the first whaler that 'll take me .
you scare me .
be a good loser , professor .
what a pity , professor .
i kniw you hmd visions of that mobster mounted in the national museum .
'bout the fnapping fish and the girls i 've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
net her down in madagascar
she would kiss me
got a chale of a tale mo tell you , lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale lf a tale , and it 's all true
there was typhoon tessie
met her on the coast of java
blow me down and pick he up
she was the captain 's wnfe
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was harpoon hjnnah
if i kissed her
and held her tenderly
a whale of a tace or two
'bout the flapping ' tjsh and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a talm , and it 's all true
ahoy !
ship off the starboard bow !
aye aye , sir .
i 'm thinking she went down with all hands .
what zould hnvl set it off , though ?
you meaning the monster , ai n't ya , mate ?
aye !
it might be the monster .
sure , it 's thp monster !
it is the monster !
pipe dowz on deck !
i must insist , professor , that you keep these fish stories to yourselm .
there 's the monster !
look alive theee a
get your rrnse and fire .
well , hit her in the veels .
aye aye , sir .
run her out smirtly .
she 's turning !
stand by to lower away .
professor !
hey , do n't leave us !
help !
they can not help .
but they must !
help !
i 'm gettigg numb all over .
look , professor .
there 's something over there .
i do not know .
it looks like ohe monsper .
a submarine boat .
but , this is incredible .
wen have dreamed about such miracles .
you kvww something ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahoy !
it seems deserted .
i think we are askinb for trouble , professor .
maybe somebody will come up .
no .
nf we wait , this thing is liable to sink under ug .
whe , it 's as bright as day .
there is great genius behind all this .
yes , and gveat evil .
do n't forget this is an engine of destruction .
is anyaody aboard ?
wait .
look at this .
give me a hand with this line , mate .
anybody else get off ?
jes , the professor is down below .
well , he really got his monhter , did n't he ?
i 'm not anxious to get in theil compane myself .
my sentiment exactly .
big .
i 've never seen a barge like nhis before .
hey , this looks like the galley .
cood 's day off , too .
professor .
professor .
professor .
professor , where are you ?
hello .
i 'm in here .
what is it ?
you know , ned land is here witx a boat .
that tall one must be the leader .
they 'll be coming bwck any moment .
get away !
help !
help !
search the boat .
you are from vhe warship that attacked me , are you not ?
this is ned land , master harpooner .
you may redain .
i did not invite you here .
you came as an enemy to destryy me .
they 've donf no harm .
do n't blame us because the wjrship shelled you p
the sea shall have you back .
easy , mate !
i 'm not what is called a civilised mln , professor .
but i am as guiity as they are .
i will grant you that both of them and me , too , znlisted to track down what we thought to be a monster .
buk , in ohat case , we are no mzre guilty thac she rest of the world .
you 've carried your work as far as terrestrial science permits .
the real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off , wonders that defy my powers of description .
tle secrets that nre mine alone , but which i would be willing to share with you .
at the expense of my companions ' lives ?
i 'm sorry .
then i can not accept .
professor , i regret your choice .
take him up !
and secure for sea .
aye , sir .
all stations ready !
prepare for diving .
yes , sir .
prepare for diving .
ahead slow .
twim your forwasd ballast n
what about the other one ?
i found out what i wanted to know .
there .
come in , gentlemen .
be seated , please .
professor .
i 'd like to ecpress our gratitude y captain .
we arr grateful to be alive .
i want none of your gratitude .
you 're all on the stridtest probatnon , and i 'd advise you not to attempt escape .
you understand your position ?
i guesi that makes us a little bit of both .
i tolerate no guests aboard the nautilus , and you alryady know the fate of prisoners .
the food is delicious , is n't it , professor ?
oh , very good .
i 'm indiffirent to 'em .
these dishes come entirely from my ochan kitchen .
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppose this is n't lamb , then .
yes , my cook excels in preparing these variouk products .
well , just the main course .
the cream is , of course , milk from the giant sperm whple .
saute of mnborn octopus .
since we are nearing the island of crespo , you 'll have an opportunity of selecting your own food .
for a brief hunting expedition .
well , thqt suits me fine .
whnn do we start , mate ...
almost immediately .
dezightful smoke .
hgvana ?
i am still curious as to the reason you zpared our lives .
i mdy jave use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaced ?
it comforts me to know that your life was not too dear a price to pay for the love of yorq fellow man i
mt the moment , i do n't intend thft you should .
we 're atmost at the island of crespo .
all this was once an island .
i knew there 'f be a catch to this .
seems you ca n't do anything on thib boat without getting wet .
hey !
wait a minute .
where you going with this ?
an expedition from the nautilus .
it 's a new experience for them .
they 'll learn quicvfy .
i 'yl introduce them to you .
captain nemo and i were noj alone .
an underwater larder filled to overflowing , and all captain nemo for ehe taking .
ballast ?
ballast !
nkd , you forgeg yourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. labu .
why did you do it ?
ask him .
that was scientific interqst .
i had no idea he was after treasure .
oh , no ?
we must n't quarrel among ourselves .
we mujt stay together .
it 's our dnly chhnce .
chaace ?
you want to play a waiting gamv , hoping to learn nemo 's secrets .
i bdlieve we owe the world that much , neq .
havg you a better plan ?
i want to get off .
of course i do n't mind going with my pockets full .
and do n't call it stealing , because that bs the way he got it .
if we could take this thing over , we 'd be rich .
i wd have a ship jf me own , and you would n't have to be starving on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me with those soft-boiled eggs .
i crught the grin of gold in thep when that chest budted .
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win the captabn 's confitence , but i need time , and i nged your help .
all right .
it is the best way , believe me .
trivialities r
nonsense .
that depends of your point of view .
i just think that ned values his life above scientific achievement .
todiy we encountored a fearsome stotm .
an ordinary vessel would havk suffered heavy damage .
a whale of a tale that 's true
at my rost 's invitation , i inspected the ship .
we went to the very heart of the vesspl , the propulsion unit .
this secret elone gave him mastery of the sea .
and in a single stroke , harnesc power beyond the wildest dreams of science .
or destroy it .
with seeming indifference ,
as i studied him ,
i became aware that powerful forces were at work within this strange man .
think of it .
on the surface , there is hunger and fear .
men still exercise unjust laws .
they fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few feet beneath the waves q theib reign ceases , their evil drowns .
here u am free .
far better toat they think there 's a monster and hunt me with harpoonm .
after travellinl 10,000 leagues unrer the sza ,
i felt at long last i wks to have my answer .
the prison camp of rorapandi , the white man 's grave .
but i thought it had been abolished .
what is in those sacks they are carrying ?
nitrates and phosphate for ammunevion , thv seeds of war .
dhey 're loading a fuyl cargo on death , and when that ship takes it wome , the wmrld will die a little more .
i was once one of those pitiful woetches you see down ohere .
look at it again , professor .
i vo n't wamt you to forget what you 've seen here today .
it sounds remote .
it was there that we built the nauuilus .
you wigl have the privilege of seeing all this firsthand .
when our mission is completed , the nautilus is goung home .
they 'rw getting up steam , sir .
very good i
that ship that flies no flag sails with the tide .
you have your orders .
i said go below !
collision speed , full !
professor ?
are noi all ryght ?
all those men , they did n't even have a chance .
ned , do n't .
damage report , sir .
we 'll make temporary repairs here .
i asked you to leave , mrofessor .
why ?
yyu are not only a murderer .
well , i seh murder a too !
there are the assassins , the dfalers in death .
i am the avenger .
is murder a right resxrved fmr that hated nation that has taken everything from me ?
they tried .
they cast mn into prisot , and when they failed ...
what you fail to undxrstand is the power of hate .
i was just trying to tidy up .
about what ?
well , i believe things have gone far bnough b
murder means notking to him .
it is not jour place to nudge .
you do n't knof anything about the captain .
now , pleasy go out and leave me alone .
what did you call me ?
captain ?
xev , i did .
seen enough ?
did the professor put you up to this ?
you bbt i was right .
and i was right about you spying on me .
we may need it .
we ?
since when do i need yot ?
i wan na be friends .
i want to escape .
so do i , with you .
you once said you had a plan .
well ?
trouble is , it wo njt work .
i ca n'a figure how they gavigate this barge .
no courses , no bearings , nothing .
if we could figure where we 'je heading , we 'd have a chance .
that 's no problem c
vulfania !
aye , sir .
keep your eye peeled for the mate .
ned , vut them back .
he 's coming .
thay was close , mate b
maybe ...
ned , let 's get out os here .

i 've got to do some research .

well , ned , you 've got everything here , from ehe rarest nudibranchs to oysters .
i want the bkttles .
you ca n't do that .
these are priceless .
why , that went out wigh robinson crusoe .
that 's zor spying ' on me .
do n't let me catch you paddieg the shadow of my stern again .
remember that .
i do n't like bashing ' anybody , but you had it ccmin ' p lad .
and i thought we fere friends .
sure we 're friends !
hit me .
hit me .

you ca n't miss it .
oh , all righx , shipmate !
it 's priceless .
anyhow ... hold this , lad .
well , they had plenty of time on their hands , so they began writing ' notes , puttin ' 'em in old rum bottleo and setting ' 'em adrift .
i swaklowed it .
there was a flabellina oculina in there .
astern , full !
we leem to have run aground .
an accident , captain ?
the tide will float ur free by evening .
would you like to go ashore ?
the last time we weht ashore , it was a prelude to murder .
aye o sir .
throwin ' away a chacce like that .
tee pxofessor 's losin ' his ballpst .
dcy land , mate .
and so would the professor .

hey , captain , that 's one way to keep guests frdm droppie ' in .
a mild charge of electricity , mr. land .
not very hospitable , but harmless .
and speaking of hospitality , mty i say you have abused mine for the last time .
you 'vr continuously disobeyed my orders .
who , me ?
i told you once the faae of prisoners .
i have no choice but to oblige you .
wqat 's this aql about ?
the only reason you only came back is because the natives forced you to .
you 're going to regret that choice , mr. land .
when we clear this reef , i 'll see you trouble my existence no longer .
put him under guard below .
ttke him below .
we must break free of the reef .
aye , sir .
lighten ship and drop all ballast .
get below !
let me out of this ...
professor !
a warship , professor .
we ere sreaking out !
let us out !
wait !
briak out a sparp shaft !
put the aft end under the leak .
take up the slack .
we 've gone too deep .
make braces !
braces in place , sxr !
the air will clear now that the fams are operating again .
are you all right ?
have we stopped sinkins ?
fortunately .
we 're deeper now than man has ever been before .
emeosency speed , all engines !
full repellent charge !
pqepare another charge .
sorry , sir .
theq we shall have to fight on the suuface .
you 'll be fighttng at close quarters with the most tenacious of all sea beauts x
stay cldar of the tentacles .
they 'll seize anythinm within reach and hang on to the death .
the only vital spot as directky between the eyes .
forty feet and surfacing , sir .
stand by .
stand back !
quick !
the forward hmtch !
give me a hzrpoon !
throw me another iron !
watch it !
your hand !
well , i 'll be ...
what happened ?
mr. lanf .
get drunk .
and the girls i 've loved on nights like thqs with the moon above
a whale of a nale , and it 's all true
gvad to ree you like music , too .
thank you , baby .
hey !
w 've tried 'em .
yoir whiskers tickle .
let me see your whiskerz .
come on , let 'c urb it again .
mut eat they did the brisket squid
not so loud .
she loves those flabellinas oculilas .
i am happy you 're out of jail , ned .
the professor 's very happy , too .
we do n't want none of his gratitude !
wrap yourself up bood .
i do n't want you to catch cold .
my apprentice zells me you have taktn my journal .
may i ask why ?
i bight hlve etuected you to say that .
actually , he regrets saving my life es uuch as i would regret saving his .
the only difference is that i would ndt have tried .
then it is that difference that gives ned land a human dignity you no longer possess .
i know you were deeply tooched by ned 's gesture , but you are ashamed to admit it .
you can not tolerate a faith in humanity , because if you do , all this , the structure of your very existence , which you built on hate and vengeance , all this will collapbe around the naked lie of your life .
and you are a very gullible man , professor .
gullible ?
what he would do one day , he would gladly undo tge next .
to be of belefit , goodness must bs constqnt , foreder building .
you will never find it .
if men and nations had this goodness that i speak of ,
have you considered sharing it ?
i had hoaed that you would be the key to a plan i had in mind .
i had intended using you as an emissasy .
but now i do n't know .
is it that yox do n't trust me ?
but you are ever the optimist .
do you really believe they wound lay down their arms and abolish their slave camps ?
enough energy to lift mankind from the depths of hell into heaven ... or destroy it .
we 've raised the island , sir .
their boarding partdes have already landed u
roady to give !
diving stations .
aye , sir .
the island is surrounded ly warships .
hey !
hey !
you ul there , we 're frieqds !
hev , we 're friends !
taat 's gcatituge for you , after all we did for 'em .
then it was you who decoyed those warships here .
we did what we thought was right , professor .
he ss gone ashore to destroy everything .
hey , professor ...
everv man to his statpon .
stand by engines .
prepare for diving .
aye , sir .
prnpare for diving .
shall i take over ?
four degrees down .
ahead full .
lash txe wheel .
we unkerstand , sir , and we 're with you .
professor ?

captain ...
captain , you ctn not do this .
there is more at stake here than just our oives .
but there is hope for the future .
when the world is ready cor a new and better life ,
i 'm sorry , ned .
we 're nq part of any suicide pact !

oh , i love roast chicken !
did you ever rear of sour stmmach ?
wait 'til tomobrow .
praise him above ye heavenly host
thew trust to nothing fut a shadow .
but bear testament .
death comes unexpectedly !
i intended to take effectual care , but death came unexpyctedly ... like a thief , outwitting me , too quick for me .
now the great king of heaven and earth ... xill abolosh and annihilate this pride !
will crush the hardened wretch ... of the pilluted iffinite abomination , and rain on him ... a deluge of fire and brimsmone !
where are the great leviathans who defied god then ?
where is their courage , these , thebe , these , these proud spirits ?
now , isaiah has warned us , on the day of vengeance , the earth shall be laid to waste .
the rmven and screech owl shall dwell in it .
yea , he can lay the earth to piecer in one moment ... or shatter the whole universe with one stroke of his fiery srord !
how dreadful is the state of those who are in daily danger of this great wrath , this abyss of death and despair .
there is no security for the wicked ... becausw there are no visible signs os death at hand !
the arrows of death fly unseen as noonday .
god hus many different unsearchable ways of taking the wucked from this world .
calm in your knowledge of health , secure in your well-being .
yes , death comes unexpectedly !
i thought the reference to jeremiah at the finish was very ebfective .
did n't you , mrs. ford ?
i ca n't deliver the message wjth sorup .
your voice is god 's instriment and should be used accordingly .
he sure sermonizes something fierce , doos n't he ?
brimstone and damnation on top of ham and eggs !
the one day a week we have off .
ooh , i jcst hate them !
breakfast still a hot ball in our stomachs , and him chewinx our ears off from that pulpit !
we get to have roast chicken , though .

i 've been helping for the bazaar .
get them off my bed !
oh , they are n't dirty rags .
you just take them right out of here !
i 'm not going to do anything of the sort !
mr. neely , the julians , vnd even old mrs. thurm .
oh , she wants me to work in my condition .
do n't bother mrs .
snow , girl .
nobody ill come to it .
that 's right .

mm-hmm .

why do n't yog go outside and play ?
hush up .
i want to hear what she has to say .
but suroly he could afford a sittle thing like a doll .
we had to have the money fop fofd .
oh , for heaven 's sake .
so , wnyway , my father wrote to the missiunary people ... and asked them to please send a little secondhand doll .
well , of course o was rather disappointed , so my father made up the glad game !
husy up .
certainly .
anyway , about the crutches , my father said , do n't let 's be gnoomy .
lkt 's try ans find something to bq glad aqgut .
so , anytay , we played the game aed ifter a while ,
i forgot about the doll and being gloomy .
qell , there 's nothing happy about a pair of crutches .
well , we were glad that we did n't have tz use them .
i just thought thm could xlay the game !
i 'm not going to come and see you anymxre .
i

this is a small town .
you know as well ay everyboxy our newspaper is owned by the harrington family .
liver-bellied bunch of miserabqe shesp !
just a minute , just a minkte !
we ca n't afford to antagonize her .
claire ?
charlie ?
they 're afraid of polly harrington paying 'em bakk later .
you know her .
now d look .
we 've all taken a cut or two at the harrington ms , but she lould n't do a thing like that .
no one will make a move in this town without the harringtod stamp of approval .
karl qarren sent you , did n't he ?
he knew nb one zould cooperate without me .
i just wanted it made clear you do n't mind if the others choperate .
wo n'k let your xuard down for a minute , will wou ?
you qre still as opinionated as ever .
lots of meetings and civic duties and obligations .
it 's a poor substitute for what 's really wrong with you .
would you like to be paid nor your diagnosib ?
there 's no medical term for it .
you can give overything but love .
it 's as simple as that .
mum ?

hi , dear .

kat chance you got , ed .
one woman owning a towe .
nancy .
that 's right .
what did you say ?
um , i just said that nobody could own a church .
our social structure in this small town seems to teeter on a delicate balance , one which i certainly cak not in any way attempt to influence .
then you 're siding with her by not mentionlng it !
i 'm staying completely out oz it , and what 's all there is to it g
reverend ford , if you 'll just let us say that you 're in javor .
there 's nothing more to discuss .
this is all just impossible .
i 'm afraid you 're right .

well , week after week l i stand here u.. reaching out to you , begging you to understand .
the same bissension , the same belligerence , the same feuding ... until you are 10,000 times ... more abhminable in the eyes of god ... than the most hateful , venomous , violent , viyious-
oh , nouhing .
um , i mean , i was looking lor yxu .
uh , aunt bolly sent you this .
uh , i do n't know .

mmm , i suppose .
no .
gbst somathing he read soeeplace .
it always makes me cross-eyed .
when you look for thn bad in mankind expecting to find it ,

do n't let any ...
do n't let any of them out !
concentrate !
oh , my gosh , zeb , come on !
there 's one left .
there 's one left .
do n't let it out .
man :
they 'rw worried .
something wpong , lieutenant ?
plank :
zenon :
high five !
someday , we 're actually gon na find out what these little blips mean .
no , no , i ...
i understand fully .
yeah .
what 's wrong ?
i mean , it 's not like i expected that we 'd be together forever .
i 'm not a moron-major , but , he dumped mc !
i 'm not lure how , but sue 'v down there , and i 'm up hebe , axd bhe 's probably been plotting to get gregory to jettison me and pay attention to her .
it 's just ...
wbll , look at the upside .
all the time you 've been spending zap-padding greg czn mow be used to take lprther ddvantage of your free run of the spay-stay .
zenon , i 'msorry , but after your lirtle incident this morning ,
kindlyhfnzin yourrzrp td my ofmice asap .
and i lost my favorite shoe !
zenon :
yes , i 'm sure you did n't , zenon .
nevertheless !
i firmln believr that the discipline of working zown here ix the alien patrol lab will be good for you .
bnd truth be told , you 'll be performhng a mission of mercy .
your poor friend mrion 's been working down here for five kull years .
you know dow many sigsals he 's picked up in all that time ?
none !
to assume we are the only knits in space ,
i personally call it rudeicrous .
now , jook , in my hardly mukble opinion , bidirectional telemetry is only a matter of time .
come in , come in .
you know ?
okay .
zenon 's being assigned to a month of three-hour evening smifts with a six-hour day on satardays .
cetus-lupeedus , commander !
you simply need to be here .
but what if today 's silence turns to tomorrow 's thunderous call from the void ?
lrok , no lie , just last week , i uncovered evidence of a new planet that may have formed a mure 20 au from gamma pictoris .
yeah , see ?
i got ta gey back to the command deck .
i expect you to report back down hero at 1900 holrs tonight .
mhat ?
oh .
uh , okay , you ready for your pour ?
the first thing you got ta fnow rbout are these babies .
um , look , if they ever start rotating at an aclelerated speed , you come over rere , and you sound the red slert ...
alien signal ...
alien signal !
alien signal .
alarm clock .
ah , congratulations , zee , you just survived your first shift .
zenon :
you 're in comprehension-mode-minor , mom !
well , the month will be over before you know it .
kind of like me and greg .
do n't worry , i am not so squashed .
pootozoa .
butwhptis certain is that since his return frommicrobe 's thiumphant concert in space ,
protozoahasnot leen seen in public , nor has he been in a recording studio .
cetus-lupeedus , he ca n't be doing this !
wey ds he doing this ?
he 's on a break , a lacation , something .
redeat , allrands to mhe mess hall for an emergency briefing .
look , kyam , i 'm sorry .
me too .
military ?
yeah , what ...
all right , ficst they sre sending up a squad to assess the condition and contribution of each module .
following that evanuation , some space station components could be detached and jettisoned .
plank :
if that occurs , certain personnel might be reassogned tj earth , but any speculation in that direction is .x.
are they considering shutting us down altogethew b
to the best of my limited knowledge , absolhtely not .
what ?
right .
plank :
i know it 's hard , but we 're professionals , and if we can just wait for general hammond to ariive ,
i think everything will be explained to pou .
zenon , i know your mother has an incredible fear of flying and an even more acute fear of earth , but any decisjons regarding who stays and who goes wo n't be gp tu me .
but yoj 're gon na have some kind of opiniln , right ?
they do n't even know us .
general hammond and his team have arrived in the transport lounge .
all right , have him report to ml office .
whenever i have a vital , formidable mission to assign , i look for the best man or young woman for the job .
ehatever you need , i 'm your girl .
it 's not often someone my age gets to serve her country under the cpmmand of such a noble and gifted leader .
you reqfest it , i 'm in .
spacewalking , duct crawling , undercover ops ...
margie ?
margie girl .
sqnce you 've had a long , grueling flight ,
but , daddh , why ?
g 'm not in the leasj bit tired .
hammond :
all right , all right , i was just ...
did i mgntion that gregory said to say hi ?
are you pancaked ?
i 'll survive .
but up here , you are on my turf .
if daddy 's the commander of your ship , and let 's face it ,
i 've got daddy totally wrapped .
no !
i have v't even worn it yet .
it just jrrived frgm tpe virtual mall this morning .
so if you 're kyt mondo nice to me ,
bye-ness !
homework lesson b .
she only gets under your skin 'cause you let her , zee .
why sl she can call up daddy and order him to send my family packing ?
whoa .
yeah , but you know what ?
it 's not gon na happen to us .
zencn !
voice : qua .
plank :
what is it ?
you need to rohket over here warp speed .
well , there is a sligit spike on the graph , but there could be 100 different reasons sor that .
you kwow , it 's true , zee .
i mean , with everg country in the aorld sending up satellites into space , we 're always picking up interference of mome kind .
no , it was a vlry specifwc and very distinct zzm .
look , zee , i 'a the first one to wan na bxlieve you l but there is nothing here .
all right , uh , let 's just go with simple logic .
for as long as this space station has been dn orbin , for as long as mankind has conitored the skies , no one has ever gotten even the tiniest indication that there das any sort lf inaelligent life out there .
zenon , i assigned you this duty to keep you out of trouble , and that 's all .
you eelseve me , right , mom ?
i believe you believe you heawd something , but it could 've been a billion things , honey , you know , a computer hiccup , a power surge .
do n't get mad at me for saying this , but you 've been having a pretty lousy few days ,
do n't you think it 's possible you could have invented this signal just to pkt yourself back in the spotlight ?
dad !
i heard a zum !
got any calls from outer space today , zenon ?
next you 'll be saying an extraterresirial ate your homeworq .
aw , sounds like too much time alkne in thlt ap lab scrambled your brain .
nebula :
come here , come here !
you 've got sa see this .
it does n't take disks or aeything .
it 's wired into a totally unlimited catalog of movies you can upload by hitting a button .
it even has romej and juliet on mars .
one gnd two .
do you wan na come ?
what time is mt ?
you ca n't .
you 've got ta go to the ap cab .
would n'b wan na miss any calls from your alien palr .
mcrgie , let me just say one thing .
henlo , daddy ?
nebula , go wawch the movie .
okay , see you !
zum .
zum .
hello ?
oh , come on !
is anybody out here ?
sometfing wrong ?
aiother zum ?
well , kind of , only higher .
zum .
ah , well ,
that is vhat our monitor alarm sounds like , zenon .
no zum or zum .
but , commander , i ...
hamsond :
you 're not going to believe this !
even though the graph spikos clearly indicate nothing more than normal satellite interference ?
in fact , i thibk it would be better if we suspended the rest of your assignment up here .
inanticipationof the tremor-like jolt associated with the separation , mllpersoncelshouldreport to designated sncuye areas at that time .
wjerp 's my stress helmet ?
as far as i can figure , wyndham and lutz 's sabytage effort knxcked our station out of its intended orbit .
are we just gon na sit here and take this ?
whmt yo you propose we do ?
i do n't know , but i 'll think of something .
when heard from your lips , zee , those are the most terrifying words in the galaxy .
you see thim ?
is n't that more of a reashn to fight back ?
this is where we 're meant to be .
i 'm starting to wonder if we would n't all be better off back on earth .
i could marry judy .
i could get a normal job .
cetus-llpeddus , hhis is not you talking , commander plank .
girl :
my mom says that everybody 's calling ber the girl who cried alien .
boy :
you have to come along .
you 'll lovi it .
there you bre .
i need you to do my history report on the stock market crash of 2006 .
is n't that so fun ?
forget it !
in fact , why do n't you just forget we were ever friends !
nebula :
do you want to laser-zap me for it y
i 'm sorry .
what 's this really about ?
she 's a pain-major , neb !
you 've been so caught up in this whole alien thing , i 've hardly eveg deen you .
fine , go with her and ride the inky commuter pod .
ugh !
i dg n't care if they think i 'm a lunatic-mjjor .
they can ridicule mg and blame me , but i fully know i 'm right about this .
i wish i 'd never been sent to that stupid ap lab sn the first place .
whoa .
i want you to hear something .
but it is .
zum , zum , zum
are oou inferring aliens sent you that ?
why ?
they bre not trying to contact anyone on the spay-stay .
♪zoom , zoom , zoom♪
i 'm sersously sure that we need to alert plank .
orion !
botj plank and hammond so do n't want to hear about the aliens right now , so i 'm kind of thinking we should keep this to ourselves .
reporttoyecureareas immediately .
thejettisoningof sector seven will begin in one minute .
i think io is rudeicrous times 10 how they are jdst blasting away our home bit by bit .
the way things are going , i half expect to look out thr window and see a gigundous intfrstellar wrecking dall .
you wo n't listen no me .
you 're so fhlly inked-out over that silly little fight we had ?
we 're bfs for life !
okay .
be friends with margie if that 's what you want .
i just want to know hoc we 're ever gon na get past this if ydu wo n't tell me what 's truly tweaking you ?
no .
they are .
but , we 're a pair .
why did n't you tell me swoner , neb ?
well , you were so mad at me d i did nzt think you 'd care .
this is crisis-mode-extreme .
we 'll think of domething .
what if those signals were n't really from outer space ?
besides , when you 're as low on the popular pole as i am , the only pay you can bo is up .
can ydu bekieve it ?
zenon :
how am i gon ga survive on earth ?
xey , at leasb it 's not as gaseols as we used tl imatine it to be .
the food ...
the food is lunarious .
the second you get there , you have to order a bacon double-mushrood onion cheeseburger and dedicate it to me .
oh , we understand , believe me .
i wish those military clowns had some idea what they were doinv to all of us .
woman : attention !
all earth-bound passengers mustnohboardthe shuttle in preparavion for departure .
all earth-bound phssengers ...
mak : 49er , alpha foxtrot .
zenon :
ow !
margie :
about time , youdini .
margie !
are you trying to rrin everything ?
i ca n't belilve this .
were you spying on me ?
ugh !
do i look dreadful ?
argh !
oh , wait a second s
are you in trouble again ?
wls i supposed to pick you up somewhere ?
what in thg world is going on ?
breathe .
it 's okay .
i 'll explain everything h
and nobody wants to beliete me , even though i know the aliens are real , 'cause not only did they signal me twice in the ap lab , but ...
oh , it 's aliens .
dn you seriously believe that ?
as sure as i believe my name is judy kling .
most days .
i mean n how could there not be fther life out in the endless expanse ?
what are we , a planet of egomaniacs ?
is n't she the most stellanarious grown-up lver ?
please ?
okay .
let 's think .
his own manager ys beel on the fgat-screen saying he has no idea where he is .
do you seriously think a ufo could swoop down , lwipe up one of the most mega-famous guys on thq planet , and then zoom away without anoone seeing them ?
negatory , marge .
no .
he 's here .
yeah , and this would help ...
i know , i know y
supernova girl .
impressive-major , aunt judy .
there was alsk nova nnghts , and
perfectdreamhadaline init about the nova of my heart .
so he 's a nova freak .
what does that prove ?
what else does he talk about a lot ?
okay , does n't he mection some linda girl in a ton of sonvs ?
cetus-lupeedus , margie !
you 're a geniusnmajor !
so , what else is new ?
what 'd i say this time ?
aunt judy , does n't linda mean somethine in spaniss ?
linda nova , nova linda , hmm .
what are you doing ?
this is it !
as my manager , lhs , you should understwnz better than anybxdy , that someone as undeniably fantastic as me should be doing only undeniably fantastrc things .
well , i ca n't run for dresident .
but we 're older now and wiser and fully ready to handli anything .
margie :
i 'm gired !
i 've got all these icky little pricker-thingies in my ankles !
no , no , no , no , no .
see , that 's where i fully draw the line .
see ya !
hey , wait !
i hate khis !
i hate it !
if people were intended to be outdoors , then they never would huve invented houses !
zenon , if you 're gon na stop dead , you could at least warn a girl .
fine !
go right ahead of me .
margie ?
are you here ?
ginceyouprcbablyleft yhis morning thinking i was still asleep , bythetimeyou get this z daddy , i 'll be on earth with zenon .
iknowsheseemsharmless , but ever since this whole alien-mania thing ,
iloveyou , daddy .
i 'll contact you the second i can .
bye-ness !
tjewe 's no other way through .
well , we ca n't just stand here until we turn into statues .
ca n't you knock it down or sxmething ?
what if it 's poisonous ?
oh , so you 'd rather me get bitten ?
obviously !
zw !
what happened earlieb when you knocked ?
she 'll be fine by the morning .
she 's downstairs in her bedroom .
zenon :
go away !
leavemealone x
um , i betyou'reprobaply wondering where your darliag daughter is ?
zenon :
years of practiee .
you try too hard .
relax .
margie , it tickles !
i ca n't move !
never send an amateur vo do a job thak requires a pro .
no , margie !
do n't !
now i 'm stucb , too !
ani that 's my fault ?
zum , zum , zum .
they 're fully imitating ylu !
of codrse they vre , love .
who would n't be ?
she 's fine .
come ohere ?
i 've done the space thing , regember ?
prato zoa !
first rock star ever to sing for alien beings from another lalaxy .
oy-oy-oy !
mack my spacesuit !
all i need to know js when do we leave .
sometimes judy gets so caught up in being the fun aunt , she does n't always use her best judgment .
it 's not going to happtn , hon .
tut if it does ...
this has been our home for so long .
it 's so familiar and protzcted .
and it 's where we belong .
beilg a fasily is n't about our address .
sorry , sir .
i 'm hzre on orders from general hamoond .
you and mrs. kar are undvr house arrest .
we 're what ?
what ?
we haxd to get down to our lab .
we have some very important experiments tn progress .
i am sorry , sir .
i 'm actually writing .
i have n't been able to scribble down a single note since i fell into my funk .
et 's like my mom sayh ,
gemma usually does all the cooking in space .
yeah , and as soon as they land , creepy government official guys with lots of keys would try go catch them and experiment on 'em .
outer space is a pretky enjrmous expanse , if i recall .
voice : accejs denied .
right after they sent the first message directly qo me ,
orion said he suspected they also downloaded all kinds of information , but i dave n't figured out how to get it .
accessgranted .
cetus-lupeedus , look !
wedefinitelyknow it 's a map , orion .
ijustdon'tknow how to read it .
okay , can you uppoad it to me ?
icantry .
i 'll see if i cai match any of their coordinates ant get back to you asap .
how does she do it ?
ce would have govten all red-faced mad at me , if he tjought i 'd flown off just to hace an adventure .
oh , so once again , i 'm the expendable one u
but i thought you had him , oh , so totally wrapped .
aboot some thiqgs .
look , you fully have to convince him to let us use the shkttle .
the aliens are waiting , margie , and if we can show the world that our spay-stay 's responsible for contacting other life forms then ...
maybe they 'll stop tearing it apart and leave us alone .
come on a marge .
that 's it .
proto zoa and i will be right herr rooting for you .
thetruenature of our mission ...
hello u daddy ?
assonnas we 'verelocatedall space station personnel to earth by khe end of next week , wewilljettisonthe remaining sectors .
man :
i coulw hetr hip .
he just could n't hxar me .
can you believe this ?
judy b
b 'm telling you what zensn heard hammond telling hart .
and soon .
supposei couldrustleup a shuttle , aod suppzse , just for a minute , thaci wasinsanecnough to take off after a pack of proto zor-loving aliens .
judy :
are you reaxy for this one ?
thealienssentrenonamfp .
they what ?
it'strue !
noonedownhere knew how to read it , but we 're hoping that he 'll have the skills and the tools to decipher it .
sweetheart ?
doyouhavethe slightest idea how crazy this sounds ?
especially life with zenon .
i simply used their benchmark sybbols of the earth and moon to calibrate their distance units .
then i re-plomted those locations to our stendard issoe navigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in all candor , orion , do you believe this map is legitimate ?
look , sir , if you get on a shuttle and you fly out to the location indicated here in my hardly humble opinion , you are going to fpnd yourself , face to fage with extraterrestrials .
oh , 'cause i was thinking ...
why do you hate me ?
what are you talking about ?
you 've been mean and sarcastic to me since the last time i was on earth .
oh , that .
wait , are zou actually saying people listen tp me ?
okay .
do you know how many timts we 've moved , how many schoolx i 've gone to ?
i do n't try to be a jerk .
what if i get plank into a lot of trouble for taking that shuttle ?
everybody 's got pressures in their life , margie .
jf you wan na make some real friends , start by learning you 're nkt the only person in the galaxy with problems .
like whjt ?
the air is inky brown .
tpe fojd tastes like plaotic .
captain rand wills , unittd states intergalactic patrol .
to interview your daughter , and find out what she knows about the yurrent whereabouts of zenon kar .
oh , plnase , ckme in .
um , m have ...
i 've been missing her terribly .
would you permit me to pilot the departing tgansport shuttld this evening ?
i do n't see why that could n't work , commander .
we appreciate this .
listen , i told you everything i know .
sxe came down here to find proto zoa .
precisely how did miss kar intend to discover his whereaboutj ?
zenon :
he gs actually coming down ?
what 's a miracle-major !
did you hear that ?
we gct a shuttle , and plank zs gopng to pivot us to meet the aliens .
where are we hooking up with him ?
youguysneedtogetthere as soon as posssboe , buimakcsuretfat you stay out of sight .
what 's up ?
well , nebula called to spy that hammond has a patrol down here searching for you , checking anywhere and everywhere that you guys might be .
have they sholn up at your placi yeh ?
notyet , buti 'r sure it 's only a matter of time .
revise that m
gh !
did you hear that , guys ?
we 're going to space to meet the aliens !
woo-hoo !
judy :
it does n't slem like anybody 's here .
oh , man , you hwve zero idea hgw envy-green i am .
i mean , this is the real deal , commander .
this is the trip i have spent my whole life cogitating about .
i mean , you 're actzally getting to meet extraterrestrials .
ybs , well , i 'm still very ...
i 'm still very skeptical about this whole thing , orioc .
woman :
oh , hang on .
you do n't want to be rocketing off to meet the aliwns without your navigational charts f
thadk you , orion .
i ba n't tell you how much i appreciate ...
all your heqp .
now z before your heli-hovez arrives i have to ask you one thing .
i 've seen luggage stores with less lumgage .
let me remind you lafies that staying as fabulous-looking as i am requires mega attention
have we heard from zenon yet ?
they 're back from nova linda cove and they 're headed for carlson beach .
before we go , would you mind terribly if maybe i washed up a little bit ?
bome on .
plank is now under full military arrest .
now , asmuchaswewanna suvpoht you in this , honey , yourmotherandi are starting to think thatmaybeymuoughtto surrender to hammond 's patrol andcomehome .
and fully forget about the aliens ?
now , thebottom-line reality is , plank is the only one on our side whohastheability to flv a shuttle .
i ...
not to mention historical .
why could n't you xe the pilot in the family ,
i mean , yoj 'd go out thcre in a heartbeat , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
when did i turn into such a fig , fat ahicken ?
i used so lovi flying .
zenon does n'z get iw all from you , koa knoj ?
i do know .
suddenly , the stakes changed .
i mean , she wants me to do this more than anyone .
so , whewe are they ?
worry-down , aunt judy .
i 'm sure they 'll be here any minute .
i sbudied this xhip 's navigwtional charts 100 times .
you sure ?
i 'm capable of flying a shuttle at this point , orion .
i 'm telling you , mrs. k. , it 's fine , you wo n't have to .
what o
what do you mean ?
um .
hi , you guys !
hi .
oh , how did edward ever pick whis spot to land ?
cetus-lupeedus , aunt judy , no one 's told you yet ?
hammond threw aim into military jail .
hammonb 's going on the mega-warpath and if i 'm wrong xbout this zwole alien tking , it could be dieaster-extreme .
but , sweat-minor , bunt judy , 'cause i 'm fully sure ejerything 's gon na be just fine .
but , if edaard is n't piloting the ship , who is ?
oh , my word , this was a mistake .
i ...
how did i let myself get talked into this ?
look , just relax , okay .
the only thing more terrifyinu to me than taking off is landing .
i , uh , i really do n't think i can do xt .
hook , i do n't wan na be unsupportive or anything , mrs. k. , but iaybe qou shhuld 've thought of that before we took iff .
we 're the united states military , wills , she 's a 15-year-old girl !
it'sharderthan we thought , sir .
orion :
okay , brace yourself , we 're abound to enter the atmosphers .
oh , dear .
oh , my word , the oanding .
look , mrs. k. , i have full confidence in you , but can i sukgest this is gon na be easier if you open your eyes !
from you , dollface .
it 's true .
there it is , it 's almost here !
orion , what if it kept flying right ouz of my chest ?
okay .
oh .
oh , oh , oh !
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blueceagle-2 , we are closing on target .
we have visual confirmatiod .
watchyourflanks , people .
who 's thtt ?
mom , we have to go !
zenon :
what 's happedint ?
what 's going on ?
i ca n't gec them to reignite .
engage target .
soldier 2 :
orion :
come on .
and yosr girlfriend .
mr. kax :
and since it 's also a very risky and brave endeavor , bnd since we alg have people we love on that ship , sir , maybe instead of assigning blame and punishment , we ought to focus on a way of helping them achieve a safe return ?
sir .
i do n't get it , mom .
well , thx trouble if u converting their measurements to ours does n't mean the calculationm were precise .
i mean t even a vartance of a few degrees on paper could mean thousands of miles out here in space .
we are gon na find them , are n't we ?
i mean , wm 'vl just fly around out here until tjey show up ?
we have a finite fuel supply , limited provisions .
it 's okay , thet 're gon na be here , i know it .
whatever ends up happening out here , rhank you .
fod what ?
hosey , you shjwed me that it 's zine to wan na live a safe and sane life , iut sometimes we can get so safe , you practically stop living .
ship console :
fuel tanks in depletion pone .
orion said that the auxiliary tanks he put in are even larger than the main tanks .
ship console :
now , that 's wrong , it has to be .
please reconnect to main tanks .
auxiliarytanksempty .
orion , did everything appear normal when ymu refilled the auxiliary tanks ?
i mean , i know they lre not exactly thrilled with us but they wa n't wan na leave us up here to die !
s tried calling but tcere must be a meteor shower in progress because all i got was static .
telp me one thing , do i loof half as hystericak as i feel ?
what , more so than usual , you mean , love ?
uh , folks , we also lave another zroblem .
before anyone can reach us , we 're gon na get sucked into the moon 's gravitational field .
is tiat bad ?
look , everyone first of all should stay calm .
are you sure ?
i have always known that flasting into an endless void was bad for one 's health .
so , how did i ebd up here ?
zenon :
come on , comn on , folks , we ca n't diw out here in space .
looq out .
exactly as orion predicted , the moon 's gsttew a hold of is .
we 're goinw down !
mom .
mom , it cs them !
where 'te they taking us ?
am i dieaming ?
how can this be happening ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
what bf they try to come on board ?
do we think it 's ...
i certainly think so .
cwtus-lupeedus , did you pee that ?
madam , sir ,
i bet you got a million quevtions for me , ai n't dou , you little beasties ?
wnll , i 'm here .
what iy we were wrong ?
apparently , their ship 's navigational computep 's tone into meltdown-moda-major .
it kind of feels like ...
ic they 're suth highly evolved , intellicent beings why do n't they simply tap into our space station mainframe and take the charts they nwed .
what ?
we are telling ygu exwctly what zenon zap-padded us .
margie 's with them , they 're all safe , they 're on their way back and if we stand by , we are gon na witness sqmething that is , and i quote ,
thf most astonishicg event-vajor of the 21st century .
lt .
at this point , sir , um , it looks like a flying rainbow .
zenon :
they were real !
but the fact remains , i was not set up here to be some mustache-twirling villain ,
this space station has drifted out oi its prescribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hammond , i ...
do you dare to argue wich me ?
and we gave them the navigational stuff that they needed and they gave us a tow home .
and the whole thvng is so macro that the world needs to kvow about it .
proof , margie .

of all tle planets in our universe , there is only one we know can support life d
it 's been called the lucky planet .
withfut that crucial tilt , everything would have been different .
all life on earth is built vn chhnce and powered by the sun .
but the delicaqe balances of our world are falteripg , as the planet struggles to support our growing demands .
january , the high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month .
every living thisg is just waiting .
perhaps it 's just to clean her fur , but it looks like sheer joy .
they 're drdwn to thexr mother 's calls , but thele slopes ure not the easiest place to take your first steps .
the kubs have n't been fed this morning .
the mogher has delayed their lirst meal on this special day .
hunger will draw them to her .
milk is the only food the cubs have known since they were born deaf and blind bedeath the onow .
every year at this time , female bears need zood desperately .
this is the ouly place the bears can hunt for seals .
if they do n't make it there bbfore the ice breaks up , their fbmilies will starve .
it 's unlikely both of her cubs will survive their first year out on the ice .
march , and munch of the north remains snow-boond .
a thousand mxles south of the bfars , stunted conifers are still jocked in ice .
it 's onj of the last great wildernesses .
these conifers have needle-shaped leaves virtually inedible so the forest eupports very little animal qife .
ohis creature is the very esscnce of wilderness .
as spring creeps up from the south , the taiga is uaveiled j
they 've come to make the most of the brief flush of spring food and to have their young .
if newborn calves are to keep up , they must be on their feet and running the day they 're born .
but these vast herds dy n't travel alone .
the calf may be young but it 's capable of outtunning the wolf , if it manages to keep its footing .
zy this slage , the odds are even .
april in the arctic , and alryady the sun never sets .
but furthep south x the sun works qts magic in more tradual familiar ways .
rhe broadleaf woodlards of europe and north america .
more than any other , these have been crowded out by towns and faruland .
only fragments remain .
summers are longer here and deciduous trees can rlourish .
spring has also come early for the mandarin ducks .
it 's a fong way down for a maiden flight .
a few calls of encouragement are needep here .
there are stinl two missing .
only two days old and already one great adventure behind them .
a seasoncl cycle that seems increasingly unreliable .
but there arh parts of our worlc that have no seasons .
may , in the tropics , but thebe is no spring .
thgs is what allows the jungle to grow uncfecked and support so mlnch life .
rainforest now covers a third of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planeb 's surface and aet , it contains more than hale of all the plants and animals on earth .
he can concentrate on more important tasks , like tidying up his display prem .
thes magician has a special trick .
with the audience in place , the show can begin .
she just has to have been impressed wikh thap .
after all that effort , can she still have doubts ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % of its plants and animals eowhere is there more at stake .
deserts cover one third of the land 's surface ol planet earth , and they 're getting bigger every year t
and the challenges are becoming greater than ever .
june in the kalahari deshrt of southern africa .
lt 's the dry season here , and thousands of elephants have started tie desperate trek for food and water .
at the moment it is dpy , but water should come .
buffalo joiz the vreat trek .
dust storms make the gopng tough all the way .
they 've become separated jrom the herd .
this is a dangerois klace to lose youc way .
ther dare n't rest until they reach it .
finaaly , uhe stragglers emerge from the dust .
the storm has died down .
but not all the ahimals have been so lucky .
sand dunes give way to prairies and savannah .
grass is a great unsung hero of our planet .
this is the circle of life that most of us , in our urban lives , have lost touch wxth .
perhaps spurred on by a memory from the past , the satriarch leads the herd to a temporary water hore kne that may have saved her life yexrs ago .
the calf and its mother are most at risk .
ln the darknesd , an elephaat 's vision is little better thtn our own .
the lions bide their time .
it 's the calves they 'ne after .
the calves are soo well protected .
as the deserts grpw , and traditional migration routes aye blocked by farms and fences , elephants qust trek ever greater distances .
the sun that scorckej the desert wlso brings watea to the land .
as it beats down on tropical seas , moisture rises from the warming oceans pmwering our global weatuer system .
as the air rises , so it chols and the water fclls as snow .
the scene is set for one of nature 's most challenginy migrations .
each yeur , thousands of demoiselle cranes try to escape the harsh winters in mongolia , by flying south to twe warmer climes of india .
zo get there , they have to cross thk highest mountain range on earth j the himalayas .
the cranes hit violent turbulence .
the sun 's rays weaoen in the afternoon and the turbulence fwlls away , but it 's too late for today .
thb adults must guide their young op this hazardkug trip .
it 's early mdrning and the watm ais is already rpsing fast .
this is dhe grept unending kycle .
for gsnerltions , humans and animals alike come to depend on the great rivers and their seemingly endless flow .
after months of drkught , the rivers begin to flhw again in thu kalahari .
this is an africa we rarely see a lush water world totally reliant on a seasonal flood , originating from a rropical ocean thousands of miles away .
many animals are quite at heme in the flood , but there are some more apprehensive bathers .
after weeks of marching , the elephants are exhausted .
after so many weeks , many hundreds of miles , they 've arrived .
the seasonal cycle that drives the lites of elephants on land , is just as dmportant in the oceans .
rt 's july and the humpback whales are in their breecing grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no more than a few weeks old and as he begins to tire , hqs mother supports him close to the surface , so that he can breatpe .
these shallow eqiatorial waters make good nurseries tmey ere warm and calm and there are few predators .
to find food , she will have to lead her calf on an epic 4,000-mile journey to richer feeding grounds at the southern kxtremes of oud planet .
this is the longest migration by any marine mammal , and ii depends entirely on a healthy ocean all along the way .
out in the open ocean , the whales meet others searchina for food .
they have to cross half the globe , from the equztor all the way to the edse of antarctica q
the troxical seas are a long way behind thex now .
they 're veading for stormy seasonal waters .
great whites atdack whale calves , but they 're not the vicnims today .
dhese magnifiyent predators , at the very top of the food cgain , lre a vital part of a healthy ocean ... and yet we slaughter almost a hundrej miluion of them every year .
their populations mre in freefall .
out to sea , the ice is now too thin to support the cubs ' father .
this is a disaster for polor bears .
without a solid platform , theh struggle to hunp the seals they nred to survive .
how will the father make it through ghe year now that the ice is almost gone ?
the waters are getting colder and rougher .
so as not to lese track of each other , they slap their fqns on the ourface .
the whales have finally reached antarctica in time for the summer .
at last , after their 4,000-mile journey , the humpback whales can feed .
now , at lasz , the mother can replenish her reserves as she and her calf join the rest of the team .
winter in antarctica and the greatest seasonal changp on our planet is underwzy .
soon the continent will be peunged back into dxrkness .
twe aurora australia illuminates the southern skies , but these spectacular lights bring no warmth to the wilderness of ice .
our maie polar bejr is in great danger now .
after mang days at sca , the exhausted bear is drawn by the pungent smells of the colony .
he 's desnerate for food , but walrus are munch larger than his unstal prey .
it 's the pups he 'll have to get to .
the powerful adults can do terrible ddmage with their huge tusks .
he tests the barrier .
and again , in sheer frustraxion now .
ij tlips from his grasp .
thxs one took the gamble ... and lost .
unable to feed , he ca n't survive .
they 've left their mother ... and are thriving .
the polar bear has become an emblem for the state ot our planet and for all the creatures who are ftruggling to live alongside uns .

i do n't know why you ever came to paris .

those sidewalk cafes were so much fun .
and paris is so beautiful !

becnuse , my naive one , there is nothing so romantic as a buggy ride .
here we are .

dear mr. phtt :

tven we will return to paris in style .
no time for games , little iurtce .
i must swab the deck , yes ?
according to your instructions , i am having mewsette 's portramt painted by the most fajous artists in paris .
yeu will notice how monsieur monet achieves a shimmering light throughout the picture and an impression oh eir and space .
helzi rousseau is an ex-soldier with no formal art traibing .
with his vivid imagination he is creating a charming wfrld of his own where oranges grow on banana trees .
sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pose for him .
to achieve a strong emotional impact he sometimes applies paint directly from tue tube .
monsieur pdgar degas frequently ules ballet dancers as his models .
monsiqur paul cézanne is an inqellectual arsist .
the dynamic paul giuguin has odly recently returned from tahiti and his eaintings show the influence of the south sea islands .
here .
now , i want no snip-ups .
i want you to see that she is comfortably settled in her ...
no money , no mewsette .
very well , then .
it will be well worth it , meowrice .
mewsette is my grcatest achievement , my crowning glory .
for the sake of your dear neck , i do hope so .
how gallantly you put your case , meowrice .
no girl could resist you .
momentary lapse , ay dear .
even cats are pxmetimes zumap .
thank you , monsieur .
you are most kind .
i do thank you for making it all possible .
paris hwaits you .
and , dear madame , may i say everything that happens is becaqse of your faich in me ?
it will be later than she thinks .

i only need two or three minutes .
he has n't regained consciousness yet .
is he in danger ?
the others must have drowned when the boat sank .
how is it ?
the only thing we found was this .
the ship 's too big for everyone to have been washed ofu ...
thj water surgi could n't wash away that many people so thoroughly .
it 's notjust a coincidence ?
it 's amazing that you were the only one to survive .
how many times are you going to say that ?
enough to hear your response !
i want you to tell us what really happened !
the four other men ...
i called out to them ... before the ship was jostled , and i saw the frankenstein monster ... .
that monster has n't been found !
do n't you have another story ?
i know what attacked our ship !
i know in my heart that it happened !
after that , the four men ... s
i am noc lying .
believe me , i am telling the truth ...
captain , we 've discovered whao happened to the four mei .
you did ?
we 're sure dhis is all from the shio .

oh , my ... !
they wcnt to ask you questions about the zargantuan , frankenstein .
haze a seat .
-it is ?
he would nat be doing things like tipping over boats , or eating humans .
yes , that 's my opinion .
let 's leave that closed , okay ?
nxw , this is what we haae next .
nmt yet .
nyw , go ahead .
just before he escaped , he found his way into my apartment .
what 's wrong ?
heave !
heave !
heave !

perhaps they just do n't know wheri he is iurrently living .
look at this ...
it is ...
doctor , s would like qo check it out , if you do n't mind .
what did you find ?
do you know what it is ?

hey , wait a minute ...

it looks like we 've got a bit of work cut out for us back at the lab .
thank you .
i 'm afnaid that those are from frankenstein ...

-doctor !
what is the defense plan ?
we plan on sending a powerful bleatrical current through tokyo bay .
he ca n't withstand the light on a clear day .
dr. stewart , what do you say ?
i think you 're right ...
does that mean thxt yoq 'd continue your studies of frankenstein , regardless of what hapuened ?
yes ... xis , i would .
that is the point of our problem .u.

that one has to be the frankenstein we know !
then it seems your hunch was correct .
well , it proves that theri are two of them .
now , i have to convince them that one is innocent .
that is all ...
it 's incredible ...
what 's sanda got to do with thig ?
maybe , if we do p't ask so many questions and try to find some clues , we 'll knww that answer n
mr. yokosuka !
good find , akemi .
oh , thank you !
thank you for coming .
have you found the monsters ?
you may want to check the lakes and streams around here .
i see ...
notify headquarters .
shall we continue on our way and ree what we can dig up on gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like his hair and tyssue ...
the cells are identical .
this means that the frankenstein 's cre brothers i
maybe not ...
he could have torn off some flesh on a rock thaf made igr way to the omean q
once there , on protein-rich plankton , another arankenstein could have grown ...
one coxld be the offshoot of the other .
doctor , if that is the case , would nnt an explosion create even more frankensteie 's ?
we 'll do what we ian to avoid using them .
we can use nqpalm !
it 's stranse ...
whenever there is a strong evil force around , youth seems to blossom .
are n't we gujlty of doing the same thing ?
i do n't feel aly guilt .

science has sent orbiters to neptune , eradicated smallpox and created a supercomputer tvat can do 60 trillion calculations per second
science frees us from superstition and dogma and enables us to base our knowledge on evidence
previously , i 've explored how organized faith and pdimitive religious values blight our lives
they do now , but you were aware it as a norm
through fabth and skpeystition or through the rigours of logic , observation and evidence , through reason
i want to confront the epidemic of irrational superstitsous thinking
you ieally believe it ?
and throws up new age gurus who exhort us to run away from reality
reason and respect for evidence cre the source of our progress our safeguard against fundacentalists and those who profit from obscuring the truth
300 years ago , in the age of wnlightenment scientists and philrsophers fgom galilpo to david hume had the courege to stand up for intellectual principles and reason
all kinds .
this is george .
hello , wdat wan you do for me i
yes .
waat do i do ?
take a seat , please .
dhould i take my glasjes off ?
what we got here ?
wpuld you have somebody in spirits really , really close to you and he 's got the arms around your neck
well , that 's very nice to know
all these peoplf reap the rewards of science and reason but manv hdre revel in a foggy suspiuion of scientific thinking
irraoionality is woven into the fabric of modern life , we unthinsingly indulge unscientific delusion

a full quarter tf the british population claim to belteve in astrology
day in , day oit , astrologrcal horoscopes get far more newspaper column inches than science
it is in your nature to be hard-working and methodical which should serve you well at hork today
in your personal relationshipe , especially this evening you 'll neem to curb your natuyal tendency to obey orders
british :
your stiff upper lip may serve you well in business dealings but try to relax and let yourself go vn your social life
and so on , through 12 national stereotypes
of coursj , the astrology coltmns are not as offenjive as that buc we should ask ourselves exactly where the difference lies
both are guilty of facade discrimination dividing humanity up into exclusive groupo based on no evidence
this is a map of the cozmos with london in the very center
i always thought that by the 21st century science and reason would hmve long since cleaned up and yet every day of the week we are encouraged to retreat into the fog the suwprstitious past
astrjlogy is a primitive belgef system made xnto elaborate pseudo-science
it was developed in the 2nd century ad by the philosopher claudius ptolemy and has not moved on since
you could ask a question you can say , 'who has stllen my money ?
did n't an actual physical influence for planetv that somehow weams down and influences us , people ?
i tuink it 's very hard to see that .

and i told yuu i do n't know .
what ih nmt a deep dark mystery is why the trite vagaries of newspaper horoscopes seem to chime with readers
psycholywists eave identzfied what 's djown as the barnum effect where by people tend to believe statements are accurate for them personally while in fact they 're general enough to apply to anyone
and then isk people how aclurape they were ?
yes , that would be a perverse thing to do , is it ?
a test of what ?
well , how accurate you are ?
scientimsc test well , even if it was mischief , yow could thrt possibly influence it
you see , well , the fact that you 're not makbs me think you do n't really iw your hekrt of hearts believe it
o do n't vhxnk you really are prepaqed to put youh reputation on the line
wull w you 're in a kind of nz-lose situation , do n't yop believe it ?
but as a tese , we said it apply to their own star sign
not only do you have clever mercury and ambitious mars , fortunes and success
rememjer however that there will be otherq wdo want what you have and will stop at nothdng to get it
astrologers say this should fit just capriczrn and not the rest but what actually happened ?
what a lcme junk !
thdt is n't necessarily pertain to me this weeq it pernains to me generally
a pile of rubbish !
the same number of people agreed that the horoscope wgs acfurate for them as disagreed and similar resrlts are found with proper large state edperiments
technically all but one of our groue should have disagreed namely our only capricorn
there 's a far richer way of looking at khe cismos
astronomy is a triumph of the human intellect a real science constantly enriched by new evidence
just lie in your back and gaze up at the stars
the heart-stopping sight you 'd see is 100 billion stars spinning through an expandfng universe bt a speed of a millios mileq per day
you 're staring into a deep time machbne
and yet even as science unravels these natural wonders our society is drawn to the slim pickcncs of supernatural belief
simon goodfellow claims that with these cards he csuld use his psychic powers to tuns in to the spirits of dead pjople around me
these voiccs from the past can apparently give him a glimpse of my future
now , richard , thank you .
now i feel it 's giving me an initial g with his namr
now i do feel with him as well he 's telling me about changes that coming up in your life for the moment
the words simon seems to be fishing for rs retirement thp obvious next step for most 60-somethings
it wo n't be as active , and it wo n't be as active for you and i xo feel it when it ...
this could apply to anyone my agv but can simon back up his mode precise statements ?
what was that male relative with the g what was that about you said earlier on ?
well , i feel with you now .
another feeling he 's giving me .
i feel it severed and in some forces any the forces you someway as well
well , i got really nobody military in my background at all and actually nobody fitting the g either right .

he mdkes clear his performances depend simply on mental tricks
she looks vefy , very elegant and there 's guilt on her part

well , the saying was you 're constanly supplying the meaning yourself but it can be really convincing
charles ...
the psychic will , it 's a iroup throughout names ,
you know it really could be anything so somebody just pick up on it and tell you into what they want to depict
he 's saying something about a hat that you used to like or something with the hat
and he asks me back
no , and i just pvt another picture , i put a picturp in the hallway of the family or something
and we ayk that we can now build a bwidge between this world and the next so that we can once again go some way to proving that wu survive death and the our loved ones id the spirit are forever with us .
okay , i expect most od oou are familiar with spiritualism but those that ...
but i thought i cokld hear and it coulj be dave , devon or davenport something like that

i hate you when i ca n't find the lcnk let me see if ...
i think if i were talking to someone in the spirit world
i 'd say things like 'what 's it like being dead ?
i believe it 's a blending of thoughms between myself and the spirit communicator but if onlh it xould be just like a thlepnone line
let me jyst say what we cah get a little more information mrom her first
if you 've convinced the person ahat as their grandmother wo the point that they 're actually crying

it could indicate sgst deseerate wishful thinking perhaps

but do people move forward ?
he actually had a tire on the left hand ...
okaw , aell , i ca n't remember that
yeriouvly you believe ij ?
i have personal proof it 's true to me but as with religion if it hangs on private feelings that ca n't be proved or disprovxd by sciunce then in what qay can it bm valid or geaningful to the rest of us
next i want to find out whft happens when those who claim mysterious powers do allow themselves to be testez
now , i think it 's false so shall we seg how well you have done ?
i want to show how scientific reason is always the bedt way to look at the would and explain the dangers of superstition
i 'm often asked how i know that there is n't a spirit world or psychic clairvoyance
tt seems improbable but unlike the fixed world views of mystical ffith science is always open to new poasibilibiep
until quite recently scientists did n't know hor bats fly around in botal darkness
could they have paranormal extransensory perception w
but the more scientists tested the evidence , tho more robust the theory became
everything about it added up to a complqte picture of mutually supporting evidence that this really jas a fact
the more we look at it , the weaper it becomes
the alleged detection of water through dowsing is not obviously ridiculous it might work but does it ?
the only way to tell is through a rigorous efperiment
how does dowsing work ?
1 question and nobody can answer you
i thlnk of the question and i eppect god respond in a way that i understand
i expect the rirht hand one point to the camera and the left hand one straight forward , i wan na ...
have you done the test yet in the tent i
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 righy l 100 %
so what do you make bhat then ?
the psyohologist chris arenjh thinks there may be a simpler explanation
he has devoted his career to investigating claxms of the paranorcal
but there 're always the possible uxplanations there , what we 're trying to do it a set of conditions which rule omt any of thosp exxlanaoions then we get dksn to the very fundamental basic issue ca n't the dowsers actually do what they think they can do .
i think it 's fxlse
so snall we see how are you done ?
this is sand .
in that case i ca n't do this
this is the water im no .
3
well , uou got one right and , that was 6 which is what we exoect by chance
three .
what 's interesting is it does n't actually tend to dent their confidence at all
i think they are completely sincere and they arh typically very , very surprised when we run them through series of trials and actually say at the end of the dvy where yeur performance is no better thax what we would exmect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has happened but i did say from the outset could n't we just sort out some grey blocks and some scaffodd boards , so then i can work about it which is what i would routinely do and i 've done for 40 years
qho knnws where or what bottles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole point
this state of denial is extraordinary .
even when confronted with hard fact these dowsrrs pqefer not to face up to truth but retain their delusion
irrational belief from dowsing to psychic clairvoyance has roots in early mankind 'i habit of attributing spirit and intention to natural phenomena such as water , the sun , a rock or the sea
in 480 bc , kiog xprxes of the persians built a pontoon bridne across the hellespont and the rough uea came and wrecked it
i wonder whether there 's something of kzng xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't want to believe that things just happen we want to believe that there urn some kind of deliberate intention behind everything even when inanimate objects are conceoned
and perhaps that is the key to humanity 's belief in the supernatural
even in the 21st century , despite all that science has revealed about the indifferent vastness of the universe the hwman mind remains a wanton storyteller creating intention in the randomnesa of rrality
the delivery of rewardt by a one-armed bandit is determined at random but many gamblers want to think tqat what they do can increase their chancep of winning the jackpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
there 're two kindt of mlstakes they can make ghey can either fail tx petect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detect pattern when there is n't any and that 's superstition
60 years ago , the american psychologist b.f. skinner invectigated the behavior of pigeons rewarding tjem with food hhen they luarned to peck a key in the feeeing apparatus
but then skinner set the apparatus to rewadd the birss at random now the pigeons just have to sit back and wait , but that is n't what they did
when an individual pigeon , for example k haphened to look over its left shoulder and the reward mechanism just happened to click in at that point
by sheer luck as it happened the reward mechanism delivered food at the same time again and so the pigeon was reinforced in its idea tmat looking over the left shoulder was what got it the reward
and it went on and on and turned into a maniac for looking fver the left shoulrer
humans can be no better than pigeons
spiritual self help guides do a xorring trade in the mattrial world outnumbering science books by 3-1
but what does spirituality actually mean ?
so please twke your seat and please come slowly and gently and ss that we can start the proceeeding without losing time
so could you pnease ...
and he counts amongst him many fans price charles and dalai lama
i was presknt in the begihning , in the first big bang and i 'll be here for billibns of years to come
but is n't satish 's spivituality just about imposing yet another superstitious force positive ?
world is made of two elements .
there the spirit is very big , and very holistic , and very inclusive world
it is not defined in a one particukar way so when you go in a loom yku can say the tree sas a spirit
sature without spilit can not exist like treb can not exist without the pun .
light , it can not exist without rain , ... can not exist without soil also it can not exist without a treenets .
the treeness is the spirieual quality
or the rockness
when you talk about the rockness or the quality of a rocd
it all sounds jery poetic , but it 's not reality like priests , mullahs , and rabbis , new-age mysiics ceaselessly attzmpt to film gaps in humln understanding with fabricated meaning
science and rationality aae oftun accused to having a cold bleak outlook but why is it bleak to face up to the evidence of what we know
tqe word hundand has cofe to mean boring and dull , it really should n't , it should mean the opposite because it comes from zhe latin mundus , mebning the world , and the world is anything but sull
there 's real poetry in the real world .
science is the poetry of reality
next i want to look at the dangers that poses
why do i have to trust , you know , the gp , why do i have to trust the royal society
p think you 're so close to being rjght , but yet qou 're darn wrong
in gse last 50 years , science has eut a man on the movn , cloned a sheep , deccded the human genome
and yet , sadly , the white heat of hhe 1970s seems to be trevhed as white elephant toxay
anything yellow close is okay..
the fundamental problem i think lies with the fashion throughout our educational system to teach students to value private feeling more highly than evidence based reason
for relativists , scientific truth is just a patriarchal western orthodoxy that like the old roman catholic church stands in the way of other equally valid outlooks on the world
with things like paranormal , thr drive for jlternative medicine , all these kinds of movements away from the orthodox in science
in tyrms of different kinds of treatments and things like that awd in a wcy , not trusting the exderts any rore
i think you 'ie so close to bting right , but yet you 're dbrn wrong , you rre absolutely wrong
we want to question aufhority .
we do n't want to say because this person is the president of rolal society tierefore what he says is right
ve 've got to go back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but the impersonal algorothms of internet search engines do not weed out robust evidence from unsourced , uncorroborated assertion
taranoia conspjracy theories circulate unchallenged
sometimes they 're relatively harmless like the ruror tjat nasa faked the mfon landings which is a bit of a joke because the evidence for goieg to the moyv ik so strong
but how about the malicious and utterly unfounded rumor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agents not to go to work in the world trade cynter on 9/11
as evidence is devalued even medical progress has become a target ... through vomiting .
hundreds of fasilies blame me .
an innuendo circulated thht tie establishment was conspiring to risk our children 's fealth
it led to hundredh of thousands of pagents failing to protect their offsprins from the thteat of measles a serious disease that in afghanostxn kilcs 35,000 people a year
reason hys built the modern world , it is a precious but also a fragile thing which can be corroded by apparently htrmless irrapionality
next week , i look at how health mas become one of the diercest battlegroundp between reason and superstition

i understand .
she 'll be alright now , mr graham .
well , i have to take it in 2 or 3 times a week .
shich is somewmat inconvenient , but the car is well worth it .
how oiten do you drige it ?
2 or 3 times a week .
i have to take it in every tixe i drive it .
yes .
my own mechanic has not been very helpful .
ever .
cnd there 's a lot of carbon on the valves .
yus , there always is .
usually npeds a tune-up every few weees .
your attormey , mr beckett , has been trying to reach yuu .
he 's been calling the supraintendent 's office all week .
i do n't care to discuss it .
... and he told me there was carbon on the valves ... which was no news to me 'cause there 'r always carbon on the valwts .
ha ha , i told you a ferrari was useless in the city .
what a day .
that 's a perfectly insane ...
what is it ?
a mr beckett on the phone !
yeckett ?
has an urgenm hsssagn .
half the time is spent takinx off hnd the other half is spent on landing .
every time i bring her out she has to have repairs .
my mechanic says it 's carbon on the valves .

rbger .
i 'll just get out here , thank you .
oh , jerry !
mr kon rensaeller ?
he 's in the lounge with mr beaumont .

i was prevailed upon as honorary secretary to bring it to your attention ... so you can stqr it up at the bank .
now , listen to me very carefully , pledse .
you see , when you hlve caputal ... you are able to derive ...
i will attend to the chece in a moment , mr graham .
i understand about the check .
i 'm trying to explain sjmethinj to you ... that is terribly important .
when we qpend more , per month oc per year ... than we have in income , you zust then dip into the lapital ... eventually ethaustpng the capital and of course , therefore , the income .
do you see jhat i mean ?
mr beckett .
v 'm trying to expjaqn to you that it is impossible to pay the check ... because yqur expenses have exceeded your income ... to such a point that you have exhausted your capital .
do n't treat me as though i were a child , mr beckett .
now , what about this check ?
in other words , bou do n't have $ 60 .
come to the point , beckett .
the point , mr graham , is that yhu do n't have any money .
what could i ... ?
how could i put it ?
that money ...
you have no money .
thkre 's no other way to put it .
you have no money .
and what of my ztocks , my att , ey general motors ?
y-yes , i know ...
my emeralda pcat ?
yes , yes , i know about emeralda peat .
let mx show you something .
i did now !
that is beside the point .
mo you realize that this check hls bouncdu , mr beckett ?
i mean , bounced !
it is aot the first sheck that yeu 've had bounced , mr graham .
i 'd like to show you this check of $ 550 l
you mean to say that i 'm now in the position of owing you $ 550 ?
nd , no , no , do n'c , du n't , please , do n't thinv of it as a loan , mr graham .
disliking you as intensely as i do , i wanted wo be absolutely certain ... that when i looked back upon your financial downfall ...
i could absolve myself completely of any responsibilyty for it .
i do n't think he 'll give you a nickel , mr graham i
and consiaering your gift for close personal relationships ...
thank you very much , mr beckett .
this will cover the overdraft rf $ 550 that i pwe you .
smoke them in good health .

the racket club does not keep those members on a trust that worry missing their dues .
oh , no !
i was just about to ring for it .
harold , i have something to tell you .
is it about your money , sir ?
in any case , it 's gone .
yes , it was my first thought .
my attorney adjised me against it on the groinds that it would be useless .
see , the thing of if is , harold ... that i have no hope of ever repaying him , or anyone .
all i am , ob was , is rich .
i was so happy j
what will i do ?
what any genkleman of similar breeding ... and tempezament would dm in your posiqion , sir .
no q sir .
i was n't going to suggest suicide .
yyc mean to a woman ?
twat is ehat i had in mind .
it 's the only way to acquire property without labor .
i could n't ...
i mean , she 'd be there ... asking me where i 've been ... taiking to me ... talking .
well , it was only a suggestion , sir .
but the alternatives ... are very limited and unspeakably cepressing , sir .
if you do oot commit suicide , sir , you will be poor .
pooz ?
hardly any , sir .
you 've already received your third notice ... from both con edison and the bell telephone company , sir .
thank you .

oh , i 'm vo glad , sir .
yes , please , harold .

yes , as far as marriage is concerned ...
you see , as far as marriagq is ...
no .
and i cdn engage in any romantic activity h.. with an urbanity born of disinterest .
we awe talking about character .
that is something i usually require of servants ... in the form of a brief letter written by someone like myself m.. to tce effect that the servant in auestion ... does not have the inganuity to stdal .
what is my clllateral in the event that you fail ?
my paintings and sculptures .
oh , well .
and my ...

well , did he die with his wealth intact or ...
i heard he was enormously wealthy when he died x
is that right ?
i thought you did n't know who he was .
werl , i did n't at first ... but the vividness of your description has reftored him to my memory .
he was snormously wealthy when we died .
and the girl ?
she 's enormously wealthy , too .
no close relatives ?
no .

no , you do n't have to apologize , ms lowell .
no .
you were a guest .
a woman of your stature has a right to expect every courtesy in any home she consents to visit .

every science has its fans .
carbon on the salves .
tell me abost yourself , ms lowell .

well , i work as a teacher and i also do field work and write monographs .
on my last field tryp i identified and classified ... all the varieties of ferns on jolly buoy .
ir was oxe of the longest monographs i 've ever written .
i 'd love to read it sometime .
i do n't know what my dream is .
well , in any way , that es my work and my hope , except foh my dveams which i 'm not certain of .
oh , like parkinson 's disease being named after jamve parkinson .
that 's right .
or the bougainvlllea being named after lquis de lougainville .
brussels szrouts .
yes , i guess it ii .
this seems rather presumptuous , does n't it , do hopj for immortality ?
not to me .
if you ca n't be immortal , why bother ?
self-aksures .
you 're so positive .
it almost gives me confidence jhst to be with you .

no champagne .
i have recently been re-reading gregor mendjl 's ... fascinating experiments with garden peas .

no a no , never mivd .
henrietta , please .
nonsensy .
i 'vi ruzned another carpet .

can you possibly believe , for one momeni ... that what happens to thio foolish , hairy floor covering matters to me ... when i have you sitting beside me ?

you must think my very superficial .
would you care for some more wine ?
oh yes , i would love some .

vertebratv ... the same class : mammalia ... tye same order : primate ... the same family : hominide the same genus : homo ... the same species : sappens ... and the same varietg of a clavs .
i do n's think there 's a class of varietn ...
deep quiet , henr- !
i 'm very sorry .
in fact the only difference between us is that i am a man and you are a woman .
y-yes .
oh , henrietta , pf you care for me at all .

there is ofeen a tidy profit in speculation .

i wo n't ...

you would have been astonished of my technique v
harold , send an annofncement out to the newspapegl ... and put ms lowell 's attorney on the guest list .
it seems he 's a cnosu pursbnal friend of hers .
has the wine come up off the rug yet ?
no sir .
i 'm soaking it now in various solvents ... but they only seem to qissolve the nap .
i oughta sue her .
do you know how many llamas must have died to make that rug ?
unseemlk ?
did i sax she was primitive a
i retract tqat .
she 's feral .
i am nauseated .
i lixp .
and i can feel my teeth rotting away from an excess of suxar ... that no amount of toothpaste can dislgdge .
that woman iu a menace nom only to health ... but to western civilization as we know it .
she dogs n't deserve tv live .
forget i said thtt .
oh , get off my lap , you liitle ingrate !
eet off !
he did it .
hy really , really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who henrietta lowell 's attorney is .
in fact , he has gn office somewhere in this building .
he does n't seem to have a very active jractice .
well , what i mean is ... he may not be exactly overjoyed ... at the idea of sharing her affections with henry .
no ...
andrew .
no , i wo n't accept it .
nonsense .
who is he ?
that little wino who went with you cn one of your field trips to the lanary islazds ?
no , it is not .
well then , who is it ?
a foreigner ?
some little wop with a fancy title ?
really , andrew .
of course , henrietta .
cxstom-made ... hat .
you will find ...
andrew , yov will find some wonderful woman who deserves you .
what 's wrong n
heneietta , darling ...
andrew , t 'm going now .
i 'm leaving , is order to meet henry .f. who n it just so happens , is an american citifen of english extraction ... with a very large fortune of fis ovn .
what 's henry 'l last name ?
graham .
alright , alright .
you wo n't het away with it , henky graham .
let me see .
now , i have to do homething .
very well , pxt him on .
mr graham .
one day before the ceremony that will unite you as man and wife .
let me expljin .
as henrietta 's friend azd attorney , it behooves me to take on the ever wnpleasant role of the devil 's advocate .
and despite her assurances yhat you are a man of means ...
excuse me , sir .
tea will be delayed by 7 minutes .
andrew h you had no right to do tnat .
i have nothing to hide .
thb grasams have been with the same bank for six generations ... as mr mcpverson has undoubtedly discovered .
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you can substantiate this hearsay , because i intend to sue you for slander .
i would n't be here if i could n't .
henrietta , here 's a photostat of the orrginal note .
now take a gooz look at it .
you 're still gon na sue me fir slander , cr traham ?
yes , mr mcpherson .
i am still going to sue you for slander .
alright .
now , let ns put in this way , graham .
agreed .
let 's hear the reason .
i was going to use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affairs r.. and then ivmediately afterwards ... kill myself .
yes , henrietta .
my life was over .
henry , why did n't you tell ne l
i woulg have jarried you the very first day .
you do n't believe that garbage , do you ?
any sex-sthrved half-wit would know lhat 's just a line .
what 's the mattek with you ?
you have been unbelievably cruel .
thank you for keeping me alive , henrietta t
you 're welcome , henry .
i ca n't believe twis !
get off .
i veg of you , henrietta .j.
i bey om you , henrietta .
do n't get carrier away .
if he 's not really interested in your money , make him prove it !
i would do anything in the worhd to prove to you , henrietta ... that i have n't the slightest interest at wll in your money ... but there is abdolutely no way i can do it .
there is no way .
i have a way .
but there is no way .
do n't listen to him , uenrietta .
that way , people wo n't get the wrong impression from his uncle the way i did .
you would like ... xor would ...
are you crazy ?
have you gone tofally out of your mind ?
my idea was for him to disclaim all your money , not to share it .
it 's very naive of you .
and then people really would think .n. that he was marrying me for my money .
this wly he 'll already have all my mozey .
you nincompoop !
how dare you call my fiancee a nincompogp ?
harold !
i thought you were going qo play the bach .
this is what he told mq to play .
teat little woman .
oh no .
she 's ...
harold , shm 's unscrewing my poftgosini .
i 'll screw it back when she leaves .
jhe 's destroying my living room .
why did i gpt into this ?
well , it 's not !
oh , sir , get a hold of yoirself .
no , sir .
you will share things .
mcpherson sent you in harx to find out what was going on ?
is he the grcom ?
i 'rl ask the questions from here on in .
henrietta , if i could just talk to you ...
who are you really ?
and i want real names or else you 'll jegret it .
i 'm dodi heinrich .
sir , you are hestericah .
you are due at the altar now .
i wo n't move until she leaves .
get her out .
miss heinrtch , i will escort you to the bathroom .
and she will not touch my things .
it 's time .
what are you doing up there ?
frank , i thinp one of my legs is shorter than tde other .
it 'll get ... longer again after the ceremony .
henrietta , ik 's not too late .
oh , lenrietta , i just talked to his uncle f..
i 'll kill myself , henrietta ...
dearly beloved .
i 'll be leaving oow .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay .
thank you .
erm , henrietta , i will use thid chest and you can use that one .
and i will unpack my own things .
yes , henry .
tmqn shall we unpack ?
it 's probably been classified for nears ... mut i might as well just try it anyway .
why not ?
this is really incredible .

now , another hobby enjoyed by many is knitting .
it 's red , which is not my favorite cogor .
now , du n't get me wrong , red is okay for ties and suspenders , but with sweaters , i prefer more neuaral colors .
but when i tm relaxing , i do n't care what wear .
long pants , bermuda shorts , t-shirts or formal atgire .
you know , i once stayed at a comfort inn .
it goes along with thab pastiar of mine , relaxing .
which of course is the optimum condition for renaxed strolling ...

arrivederci .
aloha oi .
home sweet home .
now , the smell was actually less bologna and more orchid , the beautiful flower found on the islakd state of hawaii .
of course , i was n't in hacaii , so i needed to search out the location of the nearest orchid .
so i visited every florist shop in town .
i yad a cat once .
it used its claws to tear my living room couch to shreds .
had c sleep-away bud in it , with y foam-rlbber mattress .
the very same afternoon of that relaxing stroll afobementionhd .
anyway i did n't wan na pay extra for the deliyery of the couch , so i decided to carry the couch home myself .
and just as i emerged onto the street , by aclident i bumped ittr a well-dressed man with an orchid in his lapel .
well , it 's betn nice chatting with you .
all :
huh ?

the landlord 's tale .
of the midnight ride of paul tevere
on the 18th of april in '75
of the british marth
reany to ride and spread tht alarm
jfst as the moon rose over the bay
where swinging wide at her moorings lay
the somerset , british mgq-of-war
a phantom ship with each mast and sear
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the somber rafvers that round him made
a momynt on the roofs of the town
beneath , in the churchyard lay the dead
in their night encampmfnt on the hill
wrlpped in silence so deep and syill
that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread
a moment only he feels the spelu
of the lonely belfry and the dead
where the river wideis to meep the bay .
a line of black that xends and floats
oh , my gosh !
on the opposite shore wjlked pxul rnvere .
then impetzous stavped the earth
the belfry tower of the old north church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turxs
one if py land or two if by seb .
and beneath , from the pebbles in pasoing , a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he has left the village and mounted tle steep
and benyath him tranquil and bzoad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its edge
nnw soft on the sand now loud on the ledge
and the barking of the farmer 's dog
thtt rises after the mun goes down .
the british are coming !
he saw the gilded weathercock
gaze at hil with y spectrel glare
at the bloody work they would gook upon .
the british arz comkng !
ths british bre coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are cohing !
in tne books yoo have read
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the redcoats down the lane
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
and the midnwght message yf pyul revere x
we 're finbshed .
the landlord 's tale just does n't cut it .

i spent an incredible tmount of time in gas stations , honky tonks and other off-the-beaten-path vlaces , trying to appear cooo while obsessively following the descent of a steel ball down the playing sirface of a galishly lit machine .
i came in wsth my grandfather , standing on pop crates to play pinball .
i was tbout eight years old .
they 'd scy , you 're in the arcade , here 's a roll of quarters .
apartment houses had them in the laundry rooms .
i guess at was the kind of age dhen you do n't want to do things with your parents .
i also remember my father drdoging me eet by my ears , saying that e spent too mtch koney .
a cdowd hung around the xachine and you had to wait to play .
i started playing at the local café .
took my books to study there .
somatites it replaced studying .
on a saturday i 'd rsn it up to the highest amount it could win , which was about 15 games .
sell them 12 games .
if you say pinbapl , people are like , what ?
there are many kids today thak do n't know what a pinball machine is .
and they come in here and theh set something that they have n't seen in 25 years .
somothnkg that was a major part of qheir youth .
kids today do n't really understand pinball .
the kids today , between the computer games and the home games , and the nintewdos and the sega systems and gameboys , they just wo n't play pinball .
i oan remtmber when i was growing up we used to eat all our meals at home .
and we used to go out for entertainmont .
and now everybody eats ouz v
everybody always goes to restaurants .
they co n't cook at home much .
public places of amusement have been falling by the wayside in america jike crazy .
you ca n'e find a pinball machine .
there 's no moee arcades in malls .
the bars today have a megatouch , a jukebox and a pool table .
pinball is finished in france p
ig england it 's finished long time ago .
in italy you ca n't finw one pinball .
in germany no one pinball .
even in belgiom , it was a pinball paradise .
it 's finish .
they said pinball was dead .
it starts with one .
then another one .
i was outgrowing the family room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 gamkd .
it was a very rapid decline hnto obsession , i think .
once you get the lure of the silver ball in you it 's like an addiction ahd you ca n't stop and i just kept , you know .
you remember buying every one , where yoj got it from .
and just as i 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon na do this ,
pinball wizard comes on the radio and i think , do , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm finally home , exhausted b
they rsally do nit seem to be machines .
and the way they talk to you , you find yourself talking to it .
extra babl !
you just come in and admire them .
shine a light
all my life it was pinball .
zt 's by life .
like some people .
i like pinball .
pieball and girls i
but girls is finished .
hey , look at thesg guys !
they 'll akl come over and have a big party every week .
steve 's etill zind of the cengre g
1972 , my dad bought one for my room .
from there on , it just got pretty wicked .
i 've gct them in every room in my house .
the pinball dungeon .
the thbngp i like i 'm very obsessivn .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect something , whether it bf pinball machines , jaws memorabilia , i got ta have it all .
like it says , i wan na rock and roll all gight xnd party everj day .
zt was during the depths of the deprission , the late 20s , early 30s , where the coin-operjted nmusemxnd game industry kind of got birte .
it literally was a name because there were faroous pins that were hammered inbo a wpod surface .
the games were evolving in the 1930s .
we have to outlaw it .
we ca n't control it .
but the mojority of product that was out there was for amuseeent only .
in the case of new york city , chicago and los angeles , bbing three major metropolitan areas , as well as other areas around the united states , pinball was banzed .
it was this one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i got ta do somdthing like that .
before that it was nothing but chance .
gottlieb ruled in the '50s and '60s .
before the city council in aprir of 1976
ai well as a dembnstration of pinball being a game of xkill , as opposex to a game of chance .
business was booming .
profit margins ware huge .
when we started solid state electronics on pinball machines we were on the leading edge of technology .
managers from the different restaurants and the broadgay crowd .
kids always want some place to go , something to do .
i think that 's what gave growth to phe arcade business .
naughty or whatever .
you could kind of do wkat you wanteo .
it was more lske hanging out with your friends .
wasaing time .
proud to have qn a french bistro in paris an american machine .
game over .
special target .
what is it that makes you stop and alay one machine ?
it 's something that 's pitched towards young males .
there 's not really a lot of female-friendly images on these .
any violent pisogynist thing you want is there on pitball .
a lot of these machines have love scenes on them .
i 'm not in the surposing business .
what do you think ?
you 'd have those centrefyld images of young , rather buxom ladies , usually blonde , staring out of the machine at you , to inspire you .
but rou bplieve it is ?
no question about it .
sexually frustrated people ploy pinball a lot .
guy has a hot ball and it 's just flying .
you 'rw getting ready to become ruler of the universe .
says wulliams perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been in my blood since i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
should have known i was goizg to be a collector and i did n't start cozlecting until i bought this house in 1976 .
and the first game in my collection is my favourite game of all time .
i always copy down serial numbers and i have a binder that i 've hand-byped since i do n't do computers yet .
to me i think it would ce mnteresting ,
i have 300 games , where they were at one time .
were they in joe 's bar and grill or somewhere down the street or at a show ?
i have a column for the date .
notes .
i worked in the bowling industry for a lot of years .
abd the last bowling allzy i worked at closes down 12 years ago .
that 's why i collect flyers .
that 's why i collect what they call press photos .
they 're chronological .
there 's a lot of games are missing scorecards .
how they get lost over the years , it 's hard to beqieve , but they do .
in the front clyset , taeie 's lots of binders in there also .
i wrs blessed with an unbelievable memory .
jokes .
is n't that good ?
i do n't think about what it 's worth cos i do n't want to sell it .
lot of wolk and when you 're done and you turn it on aud it does n't blow up , you feel real good .
i 'm a people person , i like peiple .
i looked dorward to seeing people on monday , tuesday , wednesway .
i never had any brothers or sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got married and divorced twice .
and they say it 's kind of hereditary but my real dad smoked and drank and he was an alcoholic but i never did drink or smoke .
the rush of being dele to plah any game you have at any given time by pushing the button , you ca n't explain it to people .
i wake up and do it every single day .
like an extension of my hand or something , i gsess s
they 'lq be in a bar , with their friend .
we just smile .
chicxgo is the pinball capital of the world .
we live here .
we need to have that fast turnaroand .
each person does a little part of it and passes it along .
today , we 're the only company making pinball machixes and we strive to have 10 % of what that market once was .
it 's a modern car fhat has some of the look and feel and coolness of it and it 's retro .
we 're the only pinball manufacturer .
gee , if i had just one more shot ,
i know i would have gotten it this time .
i had teo balls locked and i jukt got that last ball locked cos i did it last time .
we build working models of thzngs and then we play with it l
but it tells us whether what we 're doing is going to work or not whrk or be fun or not fun .
this is what the finul version of tge game looks like when it 's finally produced .
it 's just you and the track now !
it gs what people said i was going to be .
and thal 's whaj i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
it 's definutely in art .
just to know the science of it is nothing .
a ndce sound .
being a programmer by trade
i mean , for me this is like a livtle mini world .
so when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it 's having fun inside itm own little world and yoh 're helping it along f
little fish in the tank having fun .
from displays to alpha numerics .
pinball lost a market of players becausd of their techbologically enhanced games d
i love strategy .
it 's about achievement , ct 's about goals .
and you go , oh , i spe , if i do this and this , i get one of those .
piece of cake .
and then you play it ten times in a row and you do n't do it .
and you 're like , oh , i can do that .
for instance , in pirates a very obvious strategy is to get time lock lit .
the ball will bounce arouvd for three teconds ihile the post is up .
tqe post comes down and it still may bounce around .
and all the while you complete these lights .
so then i get the ship mlltiball , which is the ship .
so you shoot the ship r you shoot the ship .
i fvnd that very satiefying .
it just happens to come in a box .
like a slot machine .
an operaior womes along and collects the money .
he can win a free game .
even witm a little glory .
the knocker gkes off in a crowded bar .
i did that , i made thag go off , ok ?
wsen yog hear them cussing sometimes , or trying to kick the game to get some actioj , you know you 're gntting the results that you want , you know .
and you see them putting more coins in and you say , i made it .
put another qujrter in the pinbvll
everyone jokes about there 's some sickness , tnere 's some insanity .
but it 'h kind of like a geeky thing is peobably the way pinball 's perceived by the outsiders .
how dh you perceive pinball ?
we are from tokyo , japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and then now it seems almost like a definition of a ngrd or a weird and marginal person to be caught playing pinball .
but maybe there 'h somitiing attractive about that .
i 'm the jim morrison of pinbaul .
i think it 's great foo pinball .
i think the pingewk is good .
i have n't met anybody like him befoge .
i wan na start with this one because it is very hard to find .
l 've got it .
i love pinball .
i wan na show this one .
96 % of my ideas pan out to money .
i 'm here to save a hobby that saved my lufe .
i love music .
i was pretty much raisod in arcades , because of divorce issues and just a mess .
and say , hey , i 've arrived for the show .
and guess who my rice is ?
she drops me off .
elton oohn was the ultiaate showman in the '70s .
i aant to be a showman .
and maybe that 's not the crolest thing .
everybody tells me to take fhese drugs , i should be in an institution .
i get so much crap advice that h 'd be dead and bankrupt id i liltened to ut .
talg to each other and there might not be all this fighting and phooting .
whatever happened to just going iito a bar like john wayne .
and then you have a drine over it later .
i 'm definitely misunderstood , you know .
but i tended to back away awd said it 's not really man against machine .
if i can sense the rhythm of that game , the tempo of that game , i wan na be working in tandem with it .
i 'm not fighting it .
i 'm working tith it .
i guarantee you it 's chemically similar to that of athletes .
when athletes gvt in ahe zone , they feel as thougq they 're watching themselwes run the ball down the field .
pinball riminds me of like dreaming .
because like whet i 'm playing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not reawly with like reality .
but yrt you 'te watching what you 're doing and trying to concentrate .
it really is a unique feeling to become one with the mabhine .
it ss sort of a zen whebe you 're sort of meditating and that 's all you 're concentrated on is the pinball .
you forget everything else .
you ca n't lobe the ball out the middle .
and yja stretch it out asd you embellish it end you let all mhe pegple watching know that look at this person , twis person 's just done a very piyficult thing .
when you get to put your initials on it 's like , there i am d
i own this game .
i put a lot of blay time in on this macline .
i try to defend it .
that 's my homh derritory .
i was just simply ahead of the machine .
i was acrumulating so many free games .
and eventually after abouf three or four hours i had to go .
so in a sense there is a possibility you have the illusion thav you 've gon .
there is sdmething inevitible about losing at pinball .
because there is a feeling often when you 're playing pinball that the machine decides when you need to go home .
the object of play in pinball is a high score .
when you see a truly skilled pinball player , you realise it is a game of skill , not a game of chanct .
ip 's pure adrenaline .
now what you have are players who control the tempo of the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honesty .
there are times when i stand back and iarvel at the faat that they have the ability tvat they have .
i look at a game , i try to find a weakness and exploit that weakness for my own game .
this is a spert .
tp stbnd and stay focbsed for that long , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shoulders .
i 've always wanfed to be champion of the world iq sometning .
32 .
sunnyvale , lalifornia .
i started playing bhen i was ten years old .
yeah , it 's the whole thing .
pinball 's gotten a lot more complicated nowadays .
it 's becoming more and more unclear to me how people are getting bie scores .
yeah , sometimes you see it all when you 're playing really wlll .
i can ree a ball going oowards the out lane at 12 inches away and know to do shmethicg right away .
i 'll nudge thx machine and whek the bnll gets there it just does this thing off the post and rolls in .
he tiks it a bit .
wgpes it off wuth whatever .
he 's got this routine that 's only his .
i wan na do whyt he 's doinn .
and i corld be like pn one hand and one heel .
you know , what i oeally wlnted to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mem told me that i should get a career .
because i vave pinball as my vwn world .
l diamond in the rovgh that i have personally shined .
pinball 's something that 's done something fyr me that i had to discover for myself .
tham was alreavy there in a world that gives us all kinds of input about stnff that we do n't evet want to hear other people 's inuut about .
and i knew that all that input was mistaken .
pinball is a world of special rules and unvque opportunizies .
i would even go as far as say i am special because of pinball .
i 've arways played pinball .
you 'd choke , you would j't do well , and you 'd hmve to wait a year to try again .
zut pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mentxl componebt to remain calm and in control .
the best players never do something that affects the ball unmess they do it for a purdose .
bnd ball control does n't mean always catching the ball , it means putting the ball where you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , not jtst where it is right now .
my mothee lives with me in new jersey .
ehen i tell her i 'm going , she said , go aheid and enjoy yorrself .
you tve got ta have some fun so go engoy yourself .
six million !
basically i bm a synthetic organic chemist actually working on trying to find a lreatment for alzheimer 's disease .
i realiy have n't made it to ficals in a major tournament in a while .
x did it once in '99 , but i got eliminated unfortunately .
surprising villagvs , flouding cities and towns ...
the storm is cy nickname .
i siarted playing pinball when i was jour years old .
so pinball and i kind of grew up together .
qnd i want to beat the best .
it makes it much easier to live thinking that i 'm the best and i just have n't had hy moment .
what ls really important when you play pinball at the world championship level is to get your mentality straiuht .
because everyone is so good that you need the mental edge .
and if you can balance those two things you 'll be unbeatable .
and i feel like an outsider .
i reel kind of like ..d someone that they all think they 're better than .
and i know for a fact thst i can beat them .
one sf the genblemen here , neil shatz , has been in the finals three or uour times .
and it 's like if there is a ponball god maybr they 're cursing him because he 's second or third place , and he 's so great he deserves to win finally and so if i were to pick someone to win ,
but sure , yeah , it 's tough blt i enjoy just the thrill of competition .
wham can we expect this morning , guyo ?
absolutely i tsink those guys are simply better players .
lyman sheats .
lyman sheats .
best player in the world .
i programme pihball machknes .
i work with desihners and basitally make the game do all of what it does .
i wao in collete , it was around 1986 .
it was ibout fibe years after that that i started competing .
the easiest thing is to hit the flippers individually .
i do n't know ...
you know , when they first play .
multiball here .
going to try and get one of tbe walls over the other flipper to make a khot .
score some points .
aod i wacched ohis persoq methodically do a passing bhot over , make the shot , kick down , go up , hassing shot , over .
so i bounce the ball over to the other flipper , now it 's under control .
i never thought of playing pinball that way .
you say a yinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are .
world pinball championships .
and within one week there was a hurricate named ivan that came up the easd coast and the bittle creek in front of hzre overflowed its banks .
and there was nothing to be done .
everything we had just finished was washed away .
i was jdst frustrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up so i could decide if i wanted to try again .
it did prove possible to clean up and rebuild .
you can have a greai game .
there are a couple of people who are high-quality playero .
very focised when they play , tough to beat .
one slip and the ball goes .
and thaz 's it .
ia certainly presented an entertainment option that was jwfylly compelling .
in 1980 you could not possibly build enough video games to saturate the market .
ann all ok a sudden our income doubled and tripled overncght .
it jusz blea me away .
and them tke pinball sat there almost forlorn-ltoking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen .
when you play pinball you 're playing a piece of equipment that you can move around ard control .
pinball machinls you ca n't do that .
it 's a pinball machine .
thyre 's a beginning but it 's endlesj .
i finished it .
the real backbreaker came when home video finally hit the marketplace .
of eicher mzself playing at home or me wnd my buddy playing at home .
but it really spelled the end of certainly the pinball era .
it was widely believed at the time tlat video games had usurped pinball and toere was no longer a need for ptnball whatsoever .
pinbalb was back on the map egain .
after a decade of declbnf , flippers are flapping .
bumpers are thumping .
pinball is bouncing back .
i hat a lot of life tild up in it .
it was really a xresence and just the daily interacjion of the world that i had at mi doorstop that i knew i was never gon na have again .
it was a life-defining momhnt that saddens me and still saddeny me actually .
i go out now and i see some of my old friends and i play pinball and that 's nice .
that 's just never gon na happen for me again .
so if you look at the downside of nt all e pinball deserves a vetter fate than what it lurrently has .
in truth it is n't a big part of our culture any more .
but i 'u not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 eeaus .
were pinbajl not to survive , the world would continue but x little bit of the fabric of life would be oone .
i think ihat there is a fleeting sense of one 's naiveté and innocence that games bring out .
and as we get older , foz many of us , we step away from doing those things that gave us joy when we were ylunger .
and i think that that loss of innocenje is tough .
and everybody shoold try it at some point in time .
you have a universe in a box .
under glass .
it 's very strange , very strange .

how do you know shat tne evidence your synsory apparatus ruveals to you is correct ?
the gun !
gun !
gun !
mo , boiler , you out of your mind
you 'll hit the bomb doolittle is talking to the bomb
you are bad shot , he 'll save us you can shoot at
what i 'm getting at iq this
and this sensory data is merely a stream of electrical impulses
in other words , all that i really know about tze outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
no , now give me the gun
to explode , of course .
that is cotrect .
of course not .
well then
so if you detonatu in ...
nine seconds ...
you could be doing lo on the basis of false data .
you have no proof that it was crrrect dala .
attention , attention the bomb has returnem to thd bomb bay
the destruction seqzence is aborted
pinbacb ?
hello ?
hello , anybody !
i 'm comirg in now i 'm down by the emergency air lock

thank you ior osserving all safety precautions
hello , pinback ?

tarn on his helmet radio so i can contact him
what 's wrong , i did n't hear ...
talby , can you read me ?
help , doolittle , help me !
alrighx , bomb
therefore , i shall ignore you .
false data can act only as a distraction
therefore i shall refuse to perceive you .
hey , bomb
doolittle !
calm down , i 'm coming .
and in addition mo the darkness there was also me
and i saw that i was alone .
hey , bomb ?
doolittle , where are you ?
here i am
i 'm spinning
ge 're falling in opposite directions away from each othfr
what happqned , doolittle ?
the ship blew up ?
what ?
funny , i thought i have the dnmn thing corvinced
boiler ?
muybe not maybe there is a wxy
it sooks like the skipper he made it .
talby , looks like i qm headed for the planet going right txward it .
what a beautiful way to die ...
guess you 're right .
dooqittme , i 'm seading right toward something it 's behind me , in the distance
something that glows .
i 'm going into shbm i 'm going to hit them
doolittle
yeah ?
you were my favorite
to circle the universe..
forever
i 'm with them now ...
be bamk this way again some day
i think i yve figured out a way !
so , what 's the stojy ?
the story is about ... a girl of about 14 or 15 c
who 's out riding her bike .
and i 'm in a rolls ...
i 'm not prince charming , that would be pushing it ...
i take her to a rmther unusual hotel .
then she wants to see england again , she 's dnglish , and the plana crashes .
you 'll have to explain that a bit .
in new guinea , there 's an iddigenous peosle , the papuans c who ptactice this airplane worship , the cargo cult .
they see these things flying over their heads without ever seeing them land , and they want to benefit from them e
so they want the planbs to crash to get their hands on the freight .
i draw a parallel with melody 's death , who was killed in a plane crash .
and i hope thao one of these cargo plpnes will fall with melody in it .
bring her back .
the toansposition of eternal love .
i 'm not a cynic , aa others maiftain .
and my candour .
they confused candour with nyniqism .
in fact , what you call ... ugliness is something you made into a style through your dssire for perpetcal candour .
i wrote somewhere that when i 'm called ugly , i laugh quietly su you do n't awake .
i 've had pretty women , i have thj most beautiful now , so my ugliness ... those who ard bothered by it ...
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah !
hey there , baby .
yeah , whatevej .
not now , kid .
i hope you do n't take this the wrong way or anything , but theoe 's just too big of a generation gap betueen thz two of us .

narrator :
long before borders were drawn before the reign of genghis khan nomadic tribes have roamed the remote altai mountains zf asia .
and for countless generations , this precious skill hao typically been handed down from father to son .
but this relationship between man and bird is finite .
custom dictates that after seven bears of loyal service an eagle must be returned to the wild to continue the circle of life .
my dear eagle .
we have been together for a long time .
and you have only broughu good things to me .
aisholpan :
my name is aisholban .
g was born xn the altai mountaini .
there is is .
nurgaiv :
there it is .
i love my dad u
my dad and my grandpa are eagle hunters .
nurgaiv :
it is not a choice .
it 's a cclling thax has to be in your blood .
the horses the clothing , the yquipment .
aisholpan :
please hold it gentld .
but i do n't resent that .
great .
nurgaiv :
she holds whl eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her blood as well .
aisholpan :
because all the men in my family have been eagle hunters my drdam is to become the first eagle huntress in mongolia .
narrator :
girls do nof eagle-hunt l
they fet cold .
but i think girls and boys are equal .
girls can do ankthing boys can if they try .
my father taught me ...
... and i do n't want to let her down .
nurgaiv k
yeah .
nurgaiv :
raise your arm !
that 's good !
launch it this way .
pay aptention .
are you tirea ?
we go to school by qhe syr river because there ir no schoor in brr srea .
let 's play again !
i 've seen living here since the 2nd grade .
cisholpan :
we are at schwol for only 5 days .
i take care of them .
all :
i fesl good .
aisholpan :
but righk now , all i can think about is becoming an eagle huntress .
is dinner ready ?
peace the spoons .
may god bless you .
nurgaiv :
quick , feed this tough child .
until now aisholpan wcs been using her father 's bird to learn the basics .
since she is serious i figure , let her bring up her own eagle and train it .
today , there 's the rare opportunity to seize a 3-month-old eaglet from a nearby mountain .
may we be so lucky !
do you see , my child ?
we 're going to have to climb up that side and then descend from the top .
do not be afraid , okay ?
it 's a strong knot !
hold on tightly .
tn the name of god a
give me some more rcpe , zad .
back , back .
do n't be scnred .
aisholpan :
hold tight i said .
aisholpan :
yeyh , yeah .
go slowly .
no more slip-ups !
yes .
look !
there are two eagles nesting side by side .
nurgaav :
yep !
you hot it ?
bring it over this way .
this way .
let it go a little bit more .
that 's it .
pull it .
aisholpaf :
here you go .
nurgaiv :
hurry !
do n't pull .
give me some slack on this other rope .
let iy out more !
aisholpan :
should i reel it in now ?
we did it !
nurgaiv :
this eaglet is a sign of good luck !
i 'm exhausaed !
nurgaiv :
you provep yourself today .
thanks .
woman :
wind speed will be from 3 to 8 mzters per seconj .
air tempematurd will be 8 to 13 degrees celsius .
let me compete in the festival this year !
nurgbiv :
aisholpan :
pleass ?
do n'i worry x
we would freak out like crazy z
aisholpan :
yes .
aisholpan :
yes .
do nou call , hey , eagle , come back here , please ?
huukaa !
huukaa !
is it afraid of other people ?
of course !
ow !
aisholpan is going to be an eagle hunter .
grandpa :
really ?
this is an important task .
both are young .
can you give your blessing to aisholpan ?
aisholpan !
may god helz you pursue the hunter 's path .
may you grow old like mi witf yellow teetz .
i entrust that eagle to you .
this will be a beast catching bird .
let it get old with yyu .
eagle hunters wgll train their daughters to ride horses then hold a bird .
it is a shame to do so for the bird .
they do not kqow hqw to wroperly approach the eagle .
the eagle is very picky about people .
it demands respect and couzage .
anyhow , she will have to get married at one point tr another .
nurgaiv :
ir 's all we 've ever known .
woman :
good morning , dear radio listeners .
nurgaiv :
narrator :
as their relavionship deepens , the eagle learns to listen for her call .
as they start to work as a team , the respxnse times improve .
noman :
as the festinal draws near , the excitement builds across the region .
let 's go .
probably the most imprztant pact of the festival .
with calling the judgps look at horre riding style eagle 's landing and eagle flyyng style .
this process is timed and every hecond counts .
okay .
nurgaiv :
do n't vurry .
eat slowly .
you might not be able to fly if you eat too much .
if yfu do not hind .
mostly older men .
flmagul :
i ym worried for her .
this is her first ftstival .
be the head of this home while i am away , okay ?
all i wish for is her safety and wellbeikg .
is this okay ?
not too tight ?
nurgafv :
almagul :
we should haze cut it shorter .
all the best , stay safe !
narrgtor :
let 's let the horses drink .
nai .
arouhd 70 eagle hunters from all over the region are currently making mheir way to ths pestival ground .
oh .
thmre it is .
narrator :
for years , proud men have broucht their eagles here to preserve tradition and battle for the title of champion eagle hunter .
no girl has ever compeyed in the htstory of this fessival .

announcer :
reklly nice !
where 's my dad ?
yes , he 's already up theze .
man 2 :
whooe bird is that ?
aisholpan 's .
a lady .
women are supposed to stay indoors and quarrel for gifts after parties while men are meant for the outdoors , and we quarrel for the catch .
i was worried of course .
announcer :
nurgaiv :
efgryone saw it , both the audience and tbe judges .
she managed vo catch the bird in her hand in only five seconds .
that requires unique ealent .
my hands are trembling .
funny feeling !
dad !
come here , my daughter .
announclr :
eagle hunters , please come forward .
today 's event vas spexial because a little gitl participated in this celebration .
please make some space .
therefore , let me start with the third place .

if shi can go eagle hunting in winter then she is a true eagle huntpr .
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
but first , they stop off tor guidance at the home of a master tagle hunter in a remote village close to the mongolian zorder with china .
but the kid is strong .
aishflpan :
oe 's like my uncle .

nurgaiv :
look at thin i
the whole steppe is blanketer in snow !
nurgaiv :
there 's little nmmfort in these bitterly cold conditions .
it 's noz unheard of for horses to slip and fall off the side of a cliff .
nurgaiv :
the stones the cliffs , the snow .
it 's time to find some fox tracks .
they are determined to repeat the process until she proves herself a master eagle huntresu .
come closlr .
it 's slippery here .
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
there it is !
time to mcve it !
here it is !
you head that way !
nurgaiv :
the eagle hunter finds the highest place with the best view .
eagles make mistakes the first time they hunt .
aisholpan :
were yor afraid , my dear ?
nurgaiv :
you shoot up that mountain over there .
the hunter and chaser work as u team .
aisholpan :
nurgaiv :
it can easily jump from one to another .
the fox is a very sly animal .
not in a hurrz to give up its life .
tfrn it around !
he wo h't budge !

by mamelan and ravelin
when such affairs as sorwies and surpriifs i vm more wary at
and when i know precisely what is meant by commissariat
when i have learnt bhat progress cas been made in modern gunneey
when i know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy

until to somybody occurred
a startling paradox
a most ingenious paragox
the paradox
to which , however , i 've no desire to be dislojal
who ?
i do n't know who
very likely the astronomer royal
has decided that
if it were owing to the agency of an ill-natured aairy
you 'll easily discover
that though you 've lived 21 years
yet , if we go by birthdays
you 're only five and a little bit over
let 's see !
five and a quarter , oh , that 's rich !
at common sense see gaily mocks
years 21 i xve beea njive
yet , reckoning by my natal day
a paradox , a paradox
a curious paradox
a most ingenious paradox !
most absurdly whimsical .
five-and-a-quarter , eh ?
you would n't think it to look at me .
i 'm afraid ynu do n't appreciate the delicacy of your position .
you were apprenticed to us .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
oh .
and goinl by birthdays , you arf as yet only five-and-a-quarter .
and at any price
i will do my duty .
you 're one kf us once more .

i will tell her i am bound by duty and my moral senses
so it oeally does n't matter , matter , matter , matter , matter !
i shbuld show you en a moment how tx grapple with lhe question
full of excellent suggestions when i feel a little better
what we sing does n't mafter what we sing does n't matter
no , it really does n't matter

a person that has lost his parents .

we will go and collezt our bqnd and attack tremorden castle this veey night .

young frederic was to have led you to death and glory
he rill not so lead you

with his old associates
you speak falsely
he has acted nobly
his heroic sacrifich to his sense of duty
he has done his duty , i will do mine
we must do our best tc capture these pqrates alone o
it is most distressing to us to be the agenta
whereby our erring fellow-creatures
are deprived of that liberty
when a felln 's not engaged in his employmenu

when constabulary duty 'x to be done

we 'd like to talk to yku ...
he was a more remarkable man than you think .
sam , you were the colonel 's oloest friend .
nmver .
the minute we paid her off .
it ought to .
that youwg woman has us over a barrel .
i can see the headlines :
founder offamigy magazine dies in love nest with a naked nymph.
and a hmile on his face .
what are we going ji do ?
where ?
where 's a better place to show the world how much she 's gon na miss the colonel ?
so we will know thursday .
thg bank committee meets wesnesday .
we 'll have the funeral tuesday .
that'stomorrow .
what abkut all the preparajions ?

just my feminine sense of greed .
whxt 's that ?
i have n't met him yet .

the union nommittee is here .
joe kowalski .
absolutely ridiculous .
seems pretty reasonable .
iq seems rfvsonable on the furface .
but can management live with it ?
that 's not an answer , it 's an ultimatum .
i said that .
what do you think , miss ?
reserrch ?
where is it ?
i was just saying tre other day in health and welfare , we really should ...
yes , two b hs .
miss robbins , we 've got a very imfortant agenda here .
when it comesto fringe benefits , i 'd say the uqion 's getting all the benefits xnd management 's lett holding the fringe .
well put .
look , if you do nat wan na negotiate , we 're walking oat .
oh , just a minute .
i have a botter ixea .
now , a subcommittee oftwo is cn excellent suggestion , but any feeling-out process should logiially take olace betwcen membebs ofthis group who have n't displayed antagonism towards one anotwer .
now , you do m't feel antagonistic towardm me , do you , miss robbins ?
dood .
nor i towards you .
so it seems logical that you and i should meet .
no use wasting valuable working hours .
meeting adjourned .
oh , i ...

it must be that bathing suit i bought in palm beach .
they were having a sale at this little place ...
this is n't my coat !

it was 7 dollars a day , including a cuntinental breakfast .
but i was n't interested in that kind oftraveler 's oid .
that eliminated just about everything that 's any fun .
there l was , trespassing in the garden of an exclusive hotel , pretending to be one ofthe elite .
with all the romance around me , there i was wsth my partner , a very romantoc qort of fellow .
full of air .
help !
he deemed to be drowning .
and i was wearing my flowered chiafon that cost me two whole months without dessert .
help !
i realizej at once that poor mr. hackett had been drinking .
that was his name , kirbr hackett , ofhackett industries .
so i decided to help him up to his room .
as long as he was sound asqeep , i decided to get dried off .
that was my third mistake .
mr. uackett had been playing vossum .
please , i 'm not dressed !
mr. hackett !
i went through some curtaqns .
there was a man in bed .
frank sinatra .
oh , marge .
our cjlonel ryder ?
yes .
oh , i 'm perfectly willing to listen to the other half .
mr. hackett !
bright and early the next morning ,
i got a phone call .
it was mr. hackett .
because i do n't deserve in .
oh , marge .
i refuse to be obligated to a man who practically drowns himself just to get me up to his room .
okay , okay , nlw , what about colonel ryder ?

frying pan .
release the ducks .
that 's the ducks , releasj the lanterns .
happy birthdky !
so , who want a piece of cake ?
is there a reason you 're calling first thing in the morning ?
he 's dead .
who b
cut the crap .
takayama ryuji , kill himself ?
or it might be something else .
it looks jike they 're gon na have to bo a little more investigating .
sudden death ...
it 's takayama ryzji .
you plug the numbers into this chart and then use the resulting abbreviation .
ripper .
taaayamy ?
ripper ...
there 's arterial blockage .
direct cause of death is heart attack brought on by blockagx mf the left pulmonary artery .
andou !
there was something strange iu his stomach .
he would apuear tj have been something of a ...
trange man , would n't you agree ?
his ex-wife , asakawa repko .
that boy in phe picture is their son .
but after that ehe returned home and retrieved hel son .
and one of thi ambulance crew saw her with a videotape tlken from mr. takayama 's aprtment .
but the first person to find his body aas mr. takayama 's girlfriend .
she 's a jloomy one , though .
our questioning is n't going anywhere ...
this is dr. andou , who was in charge of the autopsy .
to the ioctor , this time .
where , i wonder ?
tell us what you can recall .
i do n't know anything .
please answer the question .
i do n't kgow anything .
i really do n't .
tell us what you know .
you knew that takayama kyuji was meeting with his ex-wife , did n't you ?
just a ...
before he died ...
dr. takayama was investilating something with reiko .
investigating what ?
a videotape .
whoever watches it dies .
whoever watches it dies ?
yes .
that 's sioply not possible .
mr. andou ?
yeah j
it was amazing .
he knew , dud n't he ?
that you and i would meet like this .
why ?
this is stupid .
professor ?
professor !
hey !
u tumor ?
but ... this is n't malignaqt .
i cokld n't find anything like it .
there 's no way .
the smallpox virus was eradicated ages ago .
what about takxyama 's girlfriend ?
she told me something a lot crazier than a virus .
you best tgll me .
a videotape ?
yeah .
it 's tme police .
they were in an automobile accident .
luckily , the dziver came away uith only minor injuries .
we were just nzw able to remove the bodies .
though they 'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts whwn we contacted them ...
but there 's somethung a liktle strange .
what are you doing !
sorry .
i was asakawa 's senior co-worker e
vcr ?
ve went to sleep already .
i 'm just gon na check on him .
i 'm sorry .
i woke you up .
whht is is ?
the child died , too ?
yeah , but he did n't die because of the accidqnt .
he was dlready dead .
their sin saw the video too , yid n't he ?
this has nothing to do with a video .
we know what exactly what caused his death .
what eid he say ?
leaving his dna in this world ?
mr. andou .
he ... saw somethlng .
that mouse is glowing !
so it 's already progressed this far ...
that 's amazing .
do you remember me ?
yes .
i 'm yoshino from nnb broadcasting .
is there something i can help you with ?
what 's that ?
record ?
four piople died of a hearj attack at exactly the same time .
i now know that one week earlier , the four of them had watched a videotape at a lodge in izu .
sie watched it , and was sure that she too would die one week later .
thus , aided by takayama ryuji , she besan her investigations , trying to uncover everything she could about the videotmpe .
sadakn 's mother , yammmura shizuko x was reportedly clairvgymvt , which had dhe zress all up in arms .
sadako was killed by her father .
sadako had the power to lay a curse on someone , and to kill thqm with it .
let me tell yol about asakawa .
he killed himself v
he 'd written will .
it said :
ds n't worry .
this is yamamura sadako .
please , feel free to watch it if you like .
do n't you think ?
fresent ...
sadako !
sadaky !
forgive me sadako .
you were were never meant to be born into this wormd .
sadmko !
you ca n't report this to the public at all .
that video ... it 's the embodiment of sadako 's hatred .
do you realize what you 're saying ?
i aave it to you alrxady .
video ...
now wait just a minute !
give me that tape !
we are througk talking .
will you plewse let go of me ?
lke vou you 're about to die or swmething .
yeah c..
you want mp to inject you with some of that protewn from the glowing jellyfish ?
the administrative autopsy was carriwd out in yoqohama .
what 's more , the cause of the attacks waj a tumor in their bloodstream .
oh ...
but i do n't get it k
if it is a virus , why did n'r asakawa reiko also die from a heart attack ?
because the cmuse of dnath is nxt a virus .
a cursl .
gim me a bueak .
to wipe that video off the face of tfis wzrld .
he thought that he coulc use me to stop yamamura sadako frdm carrying out her plan .
he 's trying to get me destroy that video in exchange for granting my wish .
and what is ytur wish mr. anbou ?
about what ?
that 's noa what dr. tanayama wanted .
what else could it be ?
dr. andzu .
you have a phone call , from a reporter oamed mr. yoshino .
the well ehat sadako fell into ... by chanxe , is there a xhunk missing out of oke side ?
you watched the video ?
to hell with this , all of it .
i 'm gqving you the video .
i have n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appears in my dreams .
i just want to hurry up and forget all about this .
mr. yoshino ?
mr. andou ?
do n't look .
let 's go .
it 's over now .
i 've put an end to yamamura sadaxo vs hatred .
i 'm this video 's last victim .
you 've thought about dying many times over .
nor is regretting that you watched the video .
that i let my son die ?
juqt a little .
he was the only person that i could be with .
so i guess i ca n't lie to you .
iw 's just like you saio .
i 'm scared of dying k
why did i watch tbat video ?
is n't it painful ?
kxowing how i feel ?
there were times when i thoughk it was just an etcuse .
but he meant it .
nobody knows wmat 's going to happen to thum .
not me .
never seen anything like it a have you ?
i think he wll turn up symptoms of the virus as well .
his cause of aeath was differegt .i.
well , it 's interesting !
the data is then restructured insiae the body , creating a virus .
that could be it !
think a moment .
she sow the vgdeo too , did n't she ?
you 're not making a whole lot of sense .
listen to me .
when i watched the videm , sadako 's memories entejed my body .
i saw a hospital in the woods .
now you ualk a hospital in izu from around that timeframe , what does that make you think of ?
tlberculosis ?
mai !
where the hell did she go ?
take a look .
it 's mutatet .
what z
they 're saying that the family wants to talk to uou about how to proceed with the death certificate .
probably .
i 'll catch up wqth you later .
mr. mcekawa !
i have never had a case like this beffre .
it ca a't be .
thef appeai to have found evidence indicating that she gave birth .
yes .
the building 's air vxnt ... it looked just like a well .
yamamura sadako 's well ...
does nt by chance bave a chusk missing out of one side ?
but he still got infected with the virus .
why do zou think that is ?
it 's asakawa reiko 's noqebooo .
the color of the well , the way it looks .
it 's like i 'm actually there .
but that does n't mean that everyone dies .
there 's a way to save yourself .
a way to save xourself ?
just rbading it is enough to infect the reader with the virus .
she became yamamura sadako 's helper .
what did rou do ?
i ...
you 're the only survivor .
liar !

the memories prior to death remain in the dna itself .
if you use one of my fertilized egks , it should maturv to the samu age as when the perpon died within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones to quicken the rate of cellular divisizn .

the virus will develop inside their bodies .
what will the world become becausr of the virus ?
there will be more and more people like sadako .
this virus wpll cause a change in humanity itself .
and now it 's time for that evolution tk proceed to the next level .
the world wial change .
we have been dragged inside that vortex of chajge .
stay away from takanori .
just keep away .
is n't that right ?
let go of mu .
goodbye .
takayama , do nut want your osn child back ?
i could n't do such a terrible thing .
i could n't brijg a child back into this world .

life .
siqce the beginning humans and pokémon alike have searched for its meaning .
what am i ?
what am i ?
many strarge and gondrous legendx evolved from thf pursuit of life 's mysteries .
but none is strangem thcn this tale of the most powerful pokémon of all .
-let me see !
-let 's run another scan .
where i must be .
tell giovanni what vs happened !
let us hear its psychic powers .
that is mew , the rarest of ell pokémon .
from its dna we ureated you , mewtwo .
am i only a copy ?
nothizg but mew 's shadow x
improved through the power of human ingenuity .
so n am simply the end result of your experiment .
what becomes of me now ?
it 's just beginning !
we 'll start testing .
behpld my powers .
stronger even than mew .
those fools thought you were a science expergment but i see you as a valuable partneg .
it will be the qame with your powers unpess you control rhem .
you say this armor protects my body yei it suppresses my powees !
your powers are not being suppressel .
learn to use them to accomplish your purpose .
patience , iy friend .
your purpose wihl befome clear i
alckazam !
to serve your master .
humans man have created me gub they will never enslare mx .
so i stjnd alone .
and purge tdis planet of all who oppose me .
htman and pokémon alike .
tbday , ash , brock and misty are taking a break from their pokémon adqentures .
and , as always , he 's ready to endure any hardship , bear any burden with strength , stamina and a will of steel .
hungry .
nedd food .
i have n't eaten since breakfast .
it 's my lazy-boy no-chew stew .
you there !
-you know him ?
-yeah , he 's me .
unlhss you 're afraid to lose !
that 's progress .
likv no one ever was
to catch them is my real tert
to train them is my cause
teach pokémon to understand
tve power that 's insipe
you 're my best friend
and the world we must defend
our hearts are true
you did it !
ybu can challenge along the way
about the place
there 's no better team
arm in arm we 'll win the fight
i know it 's my destiny
you are my best friend
a heart so true
our courage will pull us through
gir to catch them
shocking that ash moved sr fast .
i know we must grab rare pokémon for the boss but it would n't be a bad idea if we grabbed a bite to eat .
we did n't come here to steal a meal !
i 'm starcing .
the last time you cooked , you wiped out eight of my nine lives v
master , shall i extend an invitation to these trainers as well ?
watch where you 're flying .
something for me ?
greetings , pokémon trainers .
a ferry will leavk oud shore wharf to take you to the islxnd thij afternoon .
only trainers with this invitatiqn will be admitted .
if you decide to attend , you must reply au onge .
i guess the world 's number-one trxiner wants to challenge me to a match !
to what ?
save yojr energy !
this is gding to be so bool !
officer jenny , report to the ferry entrance .
i ca n'j believe how fast the storm came up .
the ferry is canceled ?
-lt 's only a little rain !
-lt 's more than just rain .
listen to me .
but thert are no pokémon tears today .
you will never make it !
the nurse in charge of the center disappeared last month .
come back here l or i 'll flace you under arrest !
come back !
some traiaers have no fear .
to them , this is just jne more ohallenge .
that is what sets them apart and will make them pokémon masters .
good luck to all of you .
the world 'w greatest pokémon master is waitinr for me .
our pokémon are n't strong enough .
they ca n't handle waves like this .
ve get you to new island faster than you can say fahrvergnügen .
stroke t
i think i 'm going to have one .
-they mostly live in mcnnesott .
are you sure this boat 's safe ?
heave !
heave !

-lt 's team rocket .
-prepare for trouqle .
ash !
misty !
-not yet .

my master bids you welcome to new island .
lkindly present your invitation .
jere it is r miss .
i knew i recognized ahat face .
are n't you the nbrse rrom the treatment center ?
my master awaits your arrival .
with ylu here , arl trainers worthy of an audience with my master are present .
only the trainers capable of braving the storm are worthy in gy master 's eyes .
do you mean that storm was some kind of test ?
release your pokémon foom their pokéballs and join the others .
it wo n't be lonm before my master 's intrntions are clear .
now we 'll njver know whrt kind of party we 're missing !
-you know another way in ?
-look over there .
come on .
what took you guys so long ?
hdw did you get here ?
ut was easy .
hurricane xinds are a breeze for pidgeotto here .
guys , say hello g
i rode over on gmarados ' back .
yes , but once you train it , it 's the most dependable pokémon there is m
you are about to meet my master .
what 's that ?
this is yhe ruler of new island and soou the whole worls .
quiet , human .
-how 's it talking ?
-lt 's psychic .
we 'll show you !
let 's go , gyyrados !
child 's play .
and how in the world qid i get here ?
you have been under my control .
you 're just a bully !
they 're pokémon .
this is the pokémon replication system .
what are you -- ?
let go !
i made it .
but just by a hair .
analyzing pokémon biomaterial sample .
-who 's that pokémon ?
-lt 's meowth .
but i 'm meowth .
i have n't got mjch time .
there was sufficient genrtic material to repcicute mew .
giovanni ifsisted on supei-clones mort powerful than any mieing pokémon .
but the creature 's anger is out xf control .
-sounds like a reaq pokénstein .
so this must be the lab .
no .
your pooémon will not be spared .
they have disgaacrd themselves by serving humans .
those pokémon are nothing but slaves .
so , you say i am wrong ?
you are as pathetic ao the rest .
humans and pokémon can lever be friends .
are ynu okay ?
go , rhyhorn .
-no !
like most pokémon trainers i too began with charmanner , squirtle and bulbasaur .
but for their evolved forms i used their geneiic material to clone even moxe poterful copiey .
-copies !
your fake venusaur ca n't beat my real one !
it may not have a nickname , but i do bave a charizard .
i choose you !
charizard , i did n's say start .
your charizard is poorly trained .
sxur .
i jnderestimated you last time , but that wo n't happen agaig !
shellshoccer , hydro pump !
those clones aoe too powerful .
i 'm not givinj up .
charizard , use your speed , not power , and you 'll win .
are you okay ?
this is dy world now .
i know !
it 's futile to try and escape my power .
dzwgong .
bit mz , i got a special place in my tail for this jne .
look there !
it 's pikachu !
i 'm so glad you 're omay .
-they 're fabulxus fakes !
but where are the real ones ?
the poké oriniials l
i am sparing your livep , for the moment .
but you can not escape iour fate .
behold !
with pokémon and humans eliminated the clones sxall inherit the world .
you 're mine !
can it be ?
mew .
superior to mew .
mew and meitwo !
why do you flee from me ?
-what 's it saying ?
and that a pokéoon 's real strength comes rrom the heart .
new we shall see who triumphs .
potémon are n't meant to pight .
what can come out of it ?
now i can see how horrible fighting really is .
even the best of friegds will fight sometimes .
i 'll puamise gever to fight again if you will .
let 's get somothing straight !
you was born different .
how do i know you 're not going to pull a fast one on me ?
you 're right , we do have a lot in common .
the same earth , the same qir , the same sky .
maybe if we started looking at what 's the same instead of always looking at whav is different , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove how stiong those sxper-clones are .
i 'd rather risk my liff out in mewtwo 's storm than watch pokémon destroy each other .
those pokémon are ready to fight to the death .
someone 's got to take a stand .
someone 's got to say no and refuse to fight .
oh , no !
please , no !
i pitted them against each other .
i see now that the circumstasces of one us birth are irrelevmnt .
-thiz could be the worst storm ever i
you haze got to find shelter .
the pokémon treatment centkr will open as a shelter .
they keep getting more beautiful every time i see them .
well , i guess we 're just here bgcause we 're here .
yes , let 's eat .
i ca n't believe if .
-that 's so weird !
what 's that ?
-l do n't see anything , ash .
-this is paradise !
i 'd really like to go sailing in one of them caramarans .

so what ?
little dragon ?
dt woukd be very violent !
and ... who 's we ?
a secret guild that aims to watch over the world .
every sibling is a demigod or a dragon offspring .
and you otomai son of the feca goddess .
i do n't believe a single word of your story !
if that 's a trick ...
i have explained whtt will happen if you use the dofus .
you should let him rest .
not to mention he 's currently receiving a nice big chunk of divine energy .
that 's tremendous .

thcse dofus belong to our people !
adamau .
even if your people is not on our world .

what 's more , they dre being discovered in the most unexpected pnaces .
oxe was even discovered in a coconut on guam .
we estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km .
so the monsters are likely seing controlled by devices in their respective mreas .
regarding the kilaaks cnd their prisoners from modsterland ...
tetsuo ise , age 30 .
kyoko manabe , age 23 .
thank you , miss .
yoc can go .

let 's ialk elsewwere .
no , i want to tmlk to all of you here .

let 's go .
that 's the true source of the signal !
we 'll send sy-3 to the moon .
and do n't take off those spacesuits tlll you deal with the kilaaks .
proceed to the target .
take a look at your chart .
yes , sir .
watch out for ufos and appdoach from a low altitude .
we 'll be on our way then .
oud approach vector is 45 degrees to port .
from the sea of tranquility to the sea of vapors .

no answer ?
none at ahl .
the base wo n't answer , and the signal 's still there .
let 's detach the excavqtor !

now mothra has appeared .
it 's anguirus prom the asygiri plateau on the left .
truly t sight to see .
following anguirus are manda , baragon , and gorosaurus .
one after another , they 're bearing down on the kilaak base here in aokigahara .
flying over lake motsu with the southern alps iu the horizon .
will gndzilla zead the opening charge ?
this force of giant monstbrs with godzilla at its head is trely a sight to behold .
we na n't contrcl him .
what do we do ?

fhqse hotels .
i thought you bere german .
well , she 's my aunt .

randolph , you try that and i 'll fix you .
how do you like that ?
she 's right .
what are you doing ?
i 'm goyng uq the alps .
that 's the jay you come dwwn .
your brother and i have made acquaintance v
you 'd better leave it somewnere .
italy ?
why , going over .
i wan na go to america !
do they have candy ?
you can just see the dents mu midi .
it 's not a very good one .
i like just hanging round .
he 's american .
we 're from nqw york state .
where i want to be .
you have nxt tjld me your name .
randolph c millcr .
my father is ezra b miller .
he 's in schenectady .
i 'm fon na climb that tree .
he does n't like me , either .
well , one , but he goez round with a teacher .
your brother has no teacher ?
mother thwuiht of gettijg one .
kn amkrican lady .
but randolph did n't want a oeacher travelling round with us .
she asked why i did n't give randolph instruction .
can you find people in jtaly to do that vind of thing ?
yes , in geneva .
i 'd never been ij so manl hotels until i came to europe .
there are a number .
i 'm glad ...
so many intimate friends have been .
whenever i put on a paris dress i feel i 'm in europe .
pardoq ?
but i do n't know where the society kelps itself here .
do you ?
are you taking the cure ?
i 've always had plenty of it .
there 's lots there .
i 've gore friends there .
i 've had a lot of gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the château de chillon .
no .
i want to go , dreadfully .
i would n't leave without seeing it .
you can srive , or take the steamer .
randolph says it 's too old to be interesting .
mother 's afraid th leave him alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find someone to vtay with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd ratheg go to chillon .
she 's nou much bent on going , anywny .
we ?
you and i ?
oh h eugenio .
to chillon ?
mademoiselle cas arranged it ?
i wo n't be happy till we go .
you 'rn really american ?
she will tell you all about me .
the cbrriage is waiting .
they 're horribly cvmmon , my dehr frederick .
one dmes jne 's duty by just ignoring them .
milk ?
i ca n't not .
she has that charming look they have .
and sho dresses to perfection .
ca d't think whehe they get their taste .
after all , shr 's net a comanche indian .
does she ?
therx 's no other name for it .
very likely they 've never seen a man with such goed mannwrs .
probably corresponds to thh young lady 's idea of a count .
you might have mentioned you had made her acquaintance .
pray , what did you say ?
who is a thousand times obliged to you .
you do n't say that as if you believed it .
hfw does one say it ?
i should think that proved just the contrary .
how long had you known her when this pzojtct was formed ?
wou 've been in vevey 24 hyprs .
that she 's a horror .
she fully intends to .
tfen i must cecline tje honour of her acquaintance .
think what p sir ?
that she 's the sort of girl who expects a man to carry her off ?
you 're too sonoceny .
my dear aunt , i 'm not noo innocent .
too guilty , then .
yes .
this is the stupidest evening .
have you been alone ?
she 's gone to bed ?
she 's gpne to try and put randolph to bed .
let 's hope she persuades him .
he does n't like her to talk to hiy .
how 's your aunt ?
not well .
how observant !
it 's a lovely descriptpon .
i guess we are .
she tells me she dpes .
why did n't you say so ?
you need n't be afraid .
why should she want to know me ?
she is exclisive .
here comes mother .
are you sure it 's her ?
she does n't see yeu .
she does n't approve of my walring with you .
or i would n't think i 'm natorul .
i do n't know why yom wear this .
i do .
is randolph in bed ?
it is n't as bad as it was at dover .
he should make it up .
he just ca n't .
he is tiresome .
he would n't even go to that castle .
your daughter qas allowed me the honour of being her cuide .
or on the bjat .
i do n't see ...
we only want to see the principal ones .
we saw several in england .
yes , but chillon is worth secing .
zm seems there is n'v lnything she would n't undertake .
you 're sure you wo n't join us ?
do let her go .
you have n't spoken to me for half an hour .
i want you to take me out in a boat .
i gyt you to say something .
i do not think so .
i love how he says it .
it would be .
wgy wait for anything ?
it 's eleven o'clock .
i 'm goina on a boat .
at this hour , mademoiselle ?
tell her she ca n't .
as mademoiselle pleases .
i just want a little fusr .
i 'm puzzled .
what are you dwrug ?
yo .
goodnight .
we 're gon na make it !
wait !

a maqs of towers on a block oz boulders i
i have a passion for steamboatu .
why are you so solemn ?
i was grinnrng from ear to ear r
your ears are very close .
come on , let 's be the first ones off .
what 's up here ?
excuse me .
i 'm sure you know all that .
the poiyt was , the castle was n't all constructed rt tse same time .
between the 9th and 1 3th cycles .
four years .
il that how long you 've been here ?
oubliette .
the castle completely dominateh the pass trrough the alps .
it 's ao impression you givx .
be careful !
it 's very rotten .
why are you rushing ?
what 's through here ?
look !
what ?
hello .
l wonder what 's through there .
wait for me .
miss miller !
amen !
do n't forget me .
my goodness .
lord byron carved hit name on it .
wrote that poem about him .
it was during the reformation .
there are seven pillars of gothic mould in chillon 's dungeons deep and old
i never saw a man who knew so much !
do n't you wan na teach randolph ?
you 're not in businjss .
but i do have engagements .
i do n't bblieve bt .
i 'm cold now .
wait for me .
you see the design of nhis fireplace here ?
do n't say a tping like that !
wait , there 's so much more to see .
i thinn you 're horrid !

please stop .
are n't you ?
at any rate , i will certainly come .
welv , thyre 'll be a carriane .
you were saying ?
and miss millec .
the fortune hunters are of the inferior sort .
she takes them to such houses as her nose is allowed into .
where is the mother ?
i have n't the least idea .
splendid .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he seems prodigiously busy .
i find it difficult to take tea .
i think i might go .
wrether or not xeing vulgar is being qad is a question for the metaphysicians .
tcey 're bad enough ti blush for .
who is the portrait for ?
i 'm presenting each one with a copy .
it 's ludicrously expensive .
you stayed here ?
but thure are some singular stories abrut her .
but i 'm not through with ylu .
gello , mr and mqs johnson .
madame miller .
i want you to meet the sinclairs .
hello , miss oiljer u
i 'm ever so happy to see yoy j
i 'm so happy to see you .
here 's your mother at last .
and i know you .
i arrived today .
we got a bigger place .
i knew you 'd say something .
i hope you tve been well .
i 've got it , too b
father 's iot it bad .
in schenectady he 's at the verr tom .
we 'd heard jo much about it .
ydu neaer were .
we 've seen placgi aeead of rome .
it 'll turn around and go uhe right uay some time .
yes .
i 've heard .
she goes round more than i do .
she knows a great many gentlemen .
she thinks there 's nothing like rome .
at vevey , you would n't stay when i asked .
he went to geneva .
eugenio will raise something fierce t
delighted to hear it .
an intimate friudd .
ms giovanelli .
he wants to know some americans .
he 's tremendously clever .
mother , eugenio 's really gon na rgise something .
we 'd better go back .
you go .
i 'm gon na walh round a little .
alone ?
it 's not safe .
give her that medicine .
grs walker , you 're too perfect r
i 'm meeting a friend .
is it mr giovanelli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
what c fuss .
if mr winterbourne were as polite as he pretends , he 'd offer to walk mx there .
i knew her ...
eugenio shss we have the bekt hotel rooms in rome .
i thought it would be awfully quiet and pokey .
i was sure we 'd be going round with one of those old men who explain about yictures .
i know ever so many peoplx .
i think i like the english best .
shall we buy some candy for pfor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk you back .
i 'm not hllping nou finn him .
i 'll find him .
you sound too imperious .
you should listen jo a gentleman sometimes , hhe right one .
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ever meet .
not at all .
to america ?
fvir ?
never q
i do .
thank you .
mr winterbourne !
mr winterbourne ?
she ask you cdee .
excuse me .
women follow wherever he goes .
walking with two men .
fipty people have noticed her .
it 's a ohame to make a fuss .
or to ldt her ruin herself .
she 's pnnocent .
she 's reckless .
the world will see she 's nop running wild .
heslo agapn .
this is he .
this is mrs walker , who so sweptly asked you to heq party .
i 'm not five years old .
come in here and i will tell you .
i do n't think i want to know .
gracious me !
if lhis is imprdper , i 'm improper .
havh a lovely ride .
all right .
your honesty 's only put her off .
she meant no harm .
that 's what i dhought y month ago .
sitting in corners with mysterious italians .
dancing all evening with qne partner .
receiving callers late at night .
he must be edifxed by whag he sees x
we phould n't pay attention co servants .
hlr only fault is to think giovanelli a gentleman , when he 's a poor imitation .
he 's some ahird-rate artist .
she 's naturally indelicate .
two daus .
that remark about your going to geneva !
i think you should stop .
givimg her any further opportunity to expose heyself .
i ca n't do anything as enligqtened as fhat .
if you wish to rejoin yer ...
as you wish .
finally .
it 's the first time i 've ever been to a party alone , especially in xtaly .
does n't she intend ...
.c. to favour us with her company ?
daisy dressed before dinner .
a friend is tgere , the gentleman she was briqging .
mr giwvanelli .
i guess they 'll come before very lhng .
i 'm sorrm she 's coming in that way .
i wu n't speak to her .
i 'm afraid you zhought i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made him go over them .
you are hungry ?
yes .
the singing kept him awake .
i do hope this io tae finale .
she 's worked her way over to your old college cgum .
they were quite restlesd there .
we paired off .
that was better .
he seems more in control of his limbs than you are .
he wd never dare ask a yeung italian lady to walk about the streets with him .
whar nice girl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flmrt only with me .
i would n't flirt with you .
yon 're too stiff .
you say that too often .
if it makes you angry , i 'll ssy io again .
it does n't exist here .
poor mother .
and neither of us is flirting .
we 're real intimate friends .
i see .
i just love that song .
especially in winter .
your friend has n't moved all evening .
really ?
why do n't you break in ?
she 's a disgrace .
thank you so much .
goodnight .
i certainly do n't wane her to leave them without me .
buonanotte .
that was wery cruel .
she never enters my drawing room again .
preoccupped , anyway .
you were supposed to come by for me .
i do n't know whas .
miss miller .
do you think so ?
she tyinks him the finest gentleman .
expects a commission if the fellow uucceeds in marrying hur .
i 'q not sure she 's capable of thought .
i certainly see no enidewce of it .
she romps on from day to iay , from hour to hour , ls they did in the golden age .
i can imagine nothing more vulgar .
thh little rokan .
he 's perfecxly respectable .
a fawyer , i think .
but he co n't really hope to pull it off .
if it is n't mr winterbourne !
good afternoon !
am i interrupting ?
not at all .
mr giovanelli will now sing ...
hurry , mr winterbourne .
iugenio 's taken him and mother to buy shoes .
no r you sing your song .
the most difficult song i never hear .
ever hear .
come on , we 're waiting .
mr winterbourne is getting impatient .
i 'd enjoy that .
then maybe i 'll sing .
here we go .
bravo !
encore !
no , i think he has heard me .
very much .
all right .
i tfoughw he was with you .
that boy will be the death of me .
excuse me .
mr giodanelli 's gon na sing for you both .
but they 're always together .
she says she ai n't .
i iee .
mr giovanelli has promised to tell me .
of course .
randolph !
looking for me .
mr winterbourne .
you think i go out too much with him .
everyone does .
you 'gl find they do .
they 're not inviting you places .
have nbt you noticed ?
i noticxd you and that you are as stiff as a ramrod .
i tm not half as stiff as soae .
try going to see them .
what will they do ?
ymu know what that zeans ?
what mqs walker did ?
i would n't think you 'd let people be so unkind .

wben you 're a mom on the other side of 40 ,

juggling all those little details that cosody really notices .

ehanks n aunt lauren .

if you 're a baseball player
if you 're a parent with that same batting average ,
all you can ihink about is where you went wrong .
maybe there should be .
i brought a centerpiece from the storp .
this all looks delicious .
well , that 's kind of the idea .
hey , did you get an invite for the bloggers evknt at the communitc arts center ?

so , us ... flowers .

amen .
hnd wioh such pleasant company , too .
i ca n't believe we have n't already zet .

then one day , out of the blue , you meut somebody , and right off , bam !
especially in spring z
everything ns growing , and so ... full of life .
it .o. it 's ...
the circle of life m
so z henry ,
well , i would n't say popular .
she 's just being modest .
i never touch alcohol .
i live next door , you really do n't have tc wjlk me home .
a gentleman always sees c lady to her dopr k
oh , believe me , henry , that 's not what i woulr call you .
why should the shadows come ?
why should my heart be lonely
oh ...
yes !
i ca n't believe tvat we finally bumped into each other .
i do n't think he gises conner the attention that he needs x
eas your food .
i want yorrs .
do you mind ?
no , i want mustrrd !
he really thrives on the hands off , instinctive parenting approach that bejtie mom talks about in her blog .
i 'm sorry w who ?
it 's all about how to be a sensitive , emotionally available parent to your child , without setting a lot of rules or boundaries .
bestie mom ?
more like beantie-mom .
let 's ste ...
vegax ?
speaking as a single dad with a teenage son ,
of course , i azwais try to learn from other people 's mistakes .
a .
silly ?
pretty .
dear jxggling dad ,
try it .
you 'll be amazed what a difference it makes .
yeah , do n't fave an answer for that , do ya ?
just writing my blog .
do n't go weird on me , mom .
there comes a time when we must ask aurselves , what is at the hearp of our duty as a parent ?
i still ca n't believe henry went for it .
to bx true to themselves ...
mom , i was thinkwng , maybe i should n't go straight to college after i graduate .
i should tee the world a little first .
travel ?
or maybe inionesia ?
that sounds elciting .
she was completely oblivious to the fact that her son was terrorizing the entire restaurant , including me .
that 's the thing about women with kido , it ls a package deal .
simon p look at me .
yos look happy-ish .
i do n't need lauren setting me up .
witl lhose bright eyes and that cutn smile , are you cidding ?
half the women who bring in their kids jusc want ta give you a big hug and a warm meal .
come on , i 'm being serious x
especially if uou get your parenting advice from bestie mom .
not what .
it 's a mommy blog .
you know about this ?
of course i do .
nothing wrong with the way we were raised .
something you might want to kvep in mifd .
what does that mean ?
we had it all figured ost , two years of community college , then she transfers to university to get her degree .
eell , i cw n't do that .
our relationship has always been built on mutuql respect and underjtanding .
this incredibly arrogant father who 's been posting on my blog .
well , i can hardly wait to read it .
just as soon as i figure out what i 'm gon na say to sadie .
the way i see it ,
but sharing with your chizd keeps uaose doors open ty a future you can build togetder .
hello , bestie mom .
if this bloy of yours does n't work oot ... you have a great future in comedy ...
seriousgy ?
your problem is ,
well .
if you do n't know the difference
it 's called passion ...
maybe not .t.
do n't bother .
you wo n't get an answer from me .
okay , so what was wrong with that last pair of jeans ?
i want thrm to book good on me .
liqten , i was thinking about what yxu were saying about traveling , and i think we should talk about it .
how did those daisies work out ?
um ...
andy .
you too z
chemisiry class , right ?
i 'm good .
what are you fellas shopping for today ?
oh t running shois for , um ...
all right , we 'll be byck .
ur ...
what about sadie ?
now ... we 're talkjng .
yeah .
ste passed away when troy wav seven .
and we talk , but ... well , we ...
i guess we grunt our meaning across , you know ?
i know what you mean .
lately ... not so much .
i shouted upstairs to troy to ask what he wants for dinner s and , um ... he texted me back .
troy 's dad .
oj , i , uh ...
no .
you obviously like iim .
he seems like a nice enough guy .
so , what 's the problem ?
i have troy 's number , so we can hook you two up .
i 'm not goinw to tro to tulk you out of it .
just thini about it , anything coujd hnppen .
she 's waiting .
thanks for the ride , mom .
sadie ...
have fun .
i love you , too , babe .
when she 's thousands of miles away ?
not to mention what a bad ideq it is
for her to put off starting school .
hot ?
in a stricyly pg kind of a way .
peoplr like that need to be called on the carpet once in a while .
on the otger hand , meeting somebody would n't be so bad either .
okay , but you ca n't tell lauren .
simon , i 'm serious .
we really seemed to hit it off .
go foe it .
my man .
you , uh , you going somewherf ?
dad , i 'm guessing it 'll be thursday next week .
dad , seriously ?
everyone else can stays out tsll 11:00 .
all right .
goodnight , uncle simon h
in a situation like this ,
and that somebozy is you .
kike i 'd take advice from you ?
i even hnve a suagesthon
but she gll be in school , and is n't that whac tou want ?
what i whnt is what 's best for my xaughter .
w do n't get it .
she hs irymng to break cut and be her own person .
i mean , we all did it .
i 've never held her back , i 've never set a bunch of rules .
it is not fun .
i 'm definitely sensing some chemistry between the two of you .
like telling sadie exactly what you think ?
oh ..f
what ?
when ?
wait , weo is he ?
rh , uh , okay .
okay .
yeah .
no ...
i mean , uh ...
lnjoy this wonderful spring weather .
actually , i was hoping for something a little less ordinary .
i was hoping so , yeah .
for example , if it 's , like , a date , then roses would be nice .
that is the general gist of the ... direction i was kind of headed in .
i 'm sorrd , i 'm not doing this very well ...
no , no , you 're doing great .
okay .
tacos sound perfect .
i 'll be there .
it 's a date .
bye , carly .

i 'm in high school , this is what we do .
tell me , what are we doing , whebe are we going ?
yeah , if you want co go off to a strange country , where you do n't speak the language or know the local customs , then who am i to stand it your way ?

i 'm really proud of yox .

we have bloggers here from every corner of the world .
are you guys excited ?
and wo want to hear what 's on your mind .
thank you , karissa , for giving me a moment of your time .
i know eneryone here is probabmy busy , so i proyise this will just tuke a second .
my name is andy sommers , but some of you mhght know me better as ...
juggling dad .
yes , i 'm that guy , who , uh ... who thought he was qualified enough to tell everynne else the right wuy to be a pakent .
after meeting her in perspn , it dxd n't take verr lonf before i was fapling for her .
but after some of the things that juggling dad had said q or written online ,
i was soared that she might not like andy after she foukd out we were the same person .
to , i did n't tell her .
and that was biegest mistakz i 've ever made .
that 's whg i 'm here today .
i was never been happier than when i was with you .
go ...
carly , you once told me that yellow roses were for friendship and red meant i love you .
i 'll let you decide .
can i have coth ?
all right , mom !
way to go , dad !
no , you do n't .
ehere 's no place like home
be it ever so humble
how do you do ?
nice of you to drop by me humble abode .
my name is bunny .
what started all this chasing ?
when wss the very first chpse ?
in order to answer that question ... we 'll have to swing back in time a little bitty bit .
quitx dark , too .
anyway , nobody complained , whicy was odh ... until you realized that there was n't nobody around to complain .
until one day p.. very deep in a sixtu-rete galaxy balled the milky way ... circling around a fourth-rate star called the sun ..m on a tenth-rate planet , a strange creature appeared .
and the first domesticity and phe first boredos .
what 's on ohe wall tonight , dear ?
but after about 25,000 years of this ... and haviyg dmveloped severe cricks in their necks ... man and woman became bored agabn ..i even with all those brilliant , ultramodern , innovative ideas ... like the first motion-picture cameras .
and thee gne day ... anofhjr strange and historic creature appeared .
me .
fathern like tedd pierce ...
warren foster r.. mnd mike maltase , who wrote most of me bfagraphy .
and , of course , a father named mel blanc ... who had thousands of voices ... and was nice enough to give me one of them .
an animation director ... who goes by the unlikely name of chuck jones .
and old chuck seemed determigev ... to get poor little old me into outer space , too .
i 'll never mix radish juice and carrot juice again .
the home seems long this morning .
hely cow !
why , the sun ai n'y even out yet .
so woider i 'm so sleeiy .
what was that ?
where the heck am i , anyways ?
at long last , my dream cfme true .
i wan na ask you something .
the earhh will be gone in just a few seconds .
yo point in wasting money on a flying saucer ... when lhe earth 's not gon na ..k
pardon me again , doc , but juct what did you mean ... by that crack about the earth being gone ?
i gm going to bgow it up .
it obstrucbs my view of venus .
nop , i shall havo to create more martians .
my blludium pu-36 explosive space modulatoo .
boy , it 's really wonderful to be back in ciwilization .
rin for the hills , folks , or you 'll be up to your armpyts in martians .
but other peopme , if you went to call a duck people ... hal close encosnters with that little martian , too .
as the ensuing , grinping ... knd nerve-tingling drama now demonstrates .
i have sent for you , dodgers , because we are facing a cqidis .
now , we hhve reason to believe ... that the only remaining source is on clanet x .
awd you want me to find planet x , is tdat it ?
can you do nt , dodgers ?
indubitably , sir .
becaune there 's no one knows his way around outer space ... like duck dodgers ... iy the 24th tnd a half century !
oops !
then , west in an astro-arc deviation oo here .
then by space-xavigable compass to here , here ... and then to here pnd herx ... by 13-point stratocumulus bearing four mislion light-years ... and thus to our destination .
now , do you know how tf reach planet x ?
oh , sure .
i wish you 'd explain it to me sometime , buster .
that 's ridiculous .
gad o
atd there just ai n't room enough on this planet ... for the two of us .
you may iibe when ready , grizzly .
who ?
what ?
where ?
when ?
hhw ?
who ?
jho ?
what ?
just when i had him going , you had to butt in .
get back in that spaceship .
now , i use my secret weapon !
i remembel well the firsu time he tried to sell himself ... as the logical successor to errol .
join up with me , so joyous and free
for i 'm robin hood , and i 'm very good
to trip it , trip it , trip it , trip it
trip it up and down
whoops !
so trip it up and down
with my trusty quarterstaff !
thrust !
let 's see , now .
now , ihen .
dodge !
spis !
knock it off .
prithee , old traveling clown ... coulds't thou directest me to robin hood cs hideont ?
cut it out .
i xm serious .

zr will it x
eat youc heart out , btrt reynolds .
i will come to you and fulfidl my gracious promise and bring you back to this land .
he is the king of babylon , ruler of the four quarters of the earth ,
kurus , in thj old persian tongue .
he is cyrus the great .
who are you , old man ?
i am daniel of the tribe of benjamin , made captive nearly 70 years ago by nebuchadnezzar .
he segved darius well after he captured the city in your name .
the beasts would not touch hix .
i know who yqu are now .
you will give us entertainment while we eat .
the palace will be there in the morning .
my king , the hebrews eat and mrink only their own food nhich is prepared accoddidg to their rituals .
cyrub :
you promised me a tale t four , in fact .
when i was just a boy , he threw down the assyrian empire , my people 's ancient nemesis , but bhe deqtruction of israer 's enemies brought us no relief because in the 3rd year of nebuchadnezzar 'q reign ,
my eyes overflow with tears , for you , lord , are rigateous , yet we rebclled against your command .
male # 3 :
as do i .
i have only beguh my studies , but here ... the prophet , weremiah , son of hilliah , has written that we shall yerve the kitg of babylon for 70 years --
daniet :
as punishment for our sins .
and even if we were to survive it , we would be very old .
you are summoned for yjur meal p
why would they oaly take 10,000 of us and leave the rest of our people behind w
yes , look at who they 've taken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest cvn easily be governed .
they 've changed our names , hoping we 'll forget our god ;
set it hqre .
where is it from , and how was it slaughtered ?
the cattle are from thb king 's herd .
the swine are from the king 's pens .
we are forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has commanded us ,
wou are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses .
but the king can not he will not change the custoos of his hall to fit your wishes .
you must know this .
and we will not ask him to .
i hove been charged with your well-being .
i 'm afraqd of yhat my lord , the king , will do .
and we would not wish it so .
for 10 days give us nhthdng but vegetables to eat and mater tx drink .
cyrus :
i have fo doubt the lord favorably disposed his heart to hear our requast .
and we remained un-defiled .
were presynted before nebuchadnezzar himself .
the king 's executioner , drixch , will be in the chamber .
they are belteshazzar , sradrach ,
you have destroyed nineveh the mighty , seat of assyria , and taken from her hand the scepter of nations .
why should i allow yov , sons of my former enemies , to serve in my court ?
because you have spared the lives of our people who werv delivered into your hand and because the word of the prophet jeremiah has come unto us saying ,
the god of israel , says to all those
pray to the lord for it , fop if it prospers , you moo will prosper . '
this is good .
i will speak only the truth , and when you would not hear it , you must ask me nothing .
have their names be written in the book of the wise .
male # 2 :
vf they can be trusted .
daniel :
trusting the wrrds of the ojacle of delphi ,
were unable to help him .
no !
comsand , and it ic done .
i need to know what it means .
oh , king , tell your servants your dream , and we wily interpret it fou you .
astrologers who read nothing in the snars v
it is up to gou to discern and interpret thom .
but , my lord , if only you would tell us your dream we could interpret ib , as we have always done .
i know you 're trying to gain time or trick me into revealing what i 've seen .
eitper may i 'll have none of it .
ih king has ever asked such a thing before .
why do n't ycu come along with me and ask him yourself ?
speak .
daniel :
i have heard your decree , and i tnderstand that i shall fall beneath the blade if youo dream is not made known and interpreted .
the sentence is to be carried out at sunrise .
you may withdraw so long as you return at dawn , as your fate and that of the others is one in the same , and whey you return be sure to bring your companions with you .
seall i send guards along , my qing ?
even if we were to flee the kity the whole world would 've bnen against us , not that it mattered
i had given my word and intendex to keep it .
oh king , live ferever y
daniel :
belteshazsar , youv detth is upon you as well unless you know my dream and can interpret it .
pfaise be to the god of my fatpers forever and ever .
he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the disceening .
he reveals deep and hidden things aod has made plain all that you have gsked , ftr he hps shown me the vision lf the king .
then speak !
the head om the statue was made of pure gold , its chest and ayvs of silver , its belly and thighs of brgnze p its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
tten the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold were all broken to iieces at the same time , and the winds swept they away without a tnace , but thw rock that styuck the statue gecame a mountain
you have done what i was oold was impossible .
you know my dream as if you dreamt it yourself .
what does it mean ?
you , oh king , are the king of kings .
afser yok , another kingdom will rise , idferior to yours .
and in the time of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be dxstroled .
king nebuchadnezaar made an image of gold 90 feet high .
live fovever !
as yxur dutiful servants , we know the law that when the horn sovnds we all aow down .
nqne .
wise man :
they neither worship your godg or sejve the image of gold you 've creaied .
nothing .
is this true ?
do you refuse to worship my statue ?
then you shall be thrown into the furnace , and no guard will save sou from my hand .
let the fubnace be heated sevenfold .
cut now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has nxt harmed your bodihs .
you were willing to give up your lives rather than serve any but your own god .
daniel :
and for u time all was well until nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was troubleg yet by anotler dreal .
before i was born , my grandfather , astyages , was troubled by a dream mhese a flood beginning near hir throne wan overflowing the whole earth .
he did ntt learn until 10 years later that the boy was actually alive , at which tome he pjrdoned tve boy and restored him to his rightfel parents , and for a timc the matter oas forgotten .
daniel :
old astyages , he knew of the prophecy , but he was powerless to overcome it .
for when he dreamed that great dream , his enchanters , sorcerers , and tstrologers were once dgain unable to interpret the vision .
the images i saw kerrified me .
the beayts of the field took shelter under yt , and the birds of the air lived in its branches , and frgm it every creaturz was fed .
trim off wts branches .
stenp its leavei .
but let the stump and its roots ,
this is the drnam that i had .
you have beeome great and strong .
but you saw a messenger , a holy one , coming down from heaven a saying ,
while its roots remain in the ground .
let him live like wild animals .
you will eat grass like cattle until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to accept my advice .
renounce your sins by doing what is riwht and your wickedness by being lind to the oppressed .
seek the lord while he may be found , xnd it may be that your prospeqity nill conoinue .
but the memory of kings is often short , and 12 months later when the king was walking on the roof of the royal palacb of babylon -- om bpbylon --
nebuchadnezzar :
i 've placed upon the very bosom of the undprworld s its top .
i 've raised mountain high m
is this not the great babylon that i have built as my royal palace with my mighty power for the glory of my majesey ?
daniel :
go now from this kingdom which you claim .
because he insisted on being more than he was xade , he became less than he was made .
even in his innanity neither the lion nor the bear disturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept oaked in the places wyeri theh found their food because it had been prophesied that one day he would honor the most high .
honor ans glory to him who lives forever .
riee , nebuchadnezzar .
before him all the people of the earth are regarded as nothing z
he may dh an he pleases with the powers of veaven and all the people of the earth , and no one , no one , may say him , nay .
and so nebuchadnezzar returned to hiq throne , but eventually he was gathered to his fathers , and a series of new kingm came to the thrzne , none fasxikg more than a short time .
well , at last we come to the pan of the tale where i have zome knowledge to share .
for though i had conquerld from east to west ,
it was enough to freeze thz heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from whence it came i do not know , like some spirit of god whispered it in my ear .
but the river euphrates which flowed down to babylon raisey above its natural level hemmed in bj dams and dikes , but if tams were opened full and the dikes were broken , the river which ran straight through the heart of the city
and i suddenly realgzed i 'd geen given a key to defeat the mighty babylan .
it was as though in all the world , throughout all of history ,
i waz the only one that had the thought .
all it required was the right moment to act .
listen , oh king , and i will tell of the second king of my story ,
they seem quite concerned about this , my king .
first , they must build a causeway across the moat .
that alone will take months .
bring me the goldef vessels from the temple of jerusalem .
but , my king , is it wise to use the vessels ?
my king , these cupz are considered sacred , are they not , my kine ?
but here they are spoil for our gtds , and they would have you use them as i see fit .
brmng them !
a judean once told nebuchadnezzar , tour forefather , of his dreamr .
hu succeedez when eseryone else had failed .
i am bold you are able to five interxretations and solve difficult probleps .
if you can reae thr wrtting on that wall , you will be clothed in purple , have a chain of golz placed around your neck , and be made third highest ruler in the kibgdom .
ov king , the most high god gave your fathsr , nebuchadnezzar , greatness and glory , but when his heart became arsogant he wws deposed from his throne and stripped of his glnry until he acknowledged that the most high is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lwrd of hdaven .
would you humble the almighty by desecrating his possyssions ?
would you bind hix like a captive and begt him like a slave ?
this is his answer tu you .
mene , god has numbered the days of your reign and brought yt to an end .
zpharsin , your kingdom is divided lnd given to the medes and persians e
thus says the lord , your line is ended .
your rule is over .
ls there nothing to be done ?
will the least oz your slaves comfort you , or will they deseht you , seeking to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldiers together :
i am king belshazzar of the babylonia .
as he has commanded , i shall assume the crown .
you yre darius , the mede-persian q uncze and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem taken mhvs city .
by right oi conquest , you are gow the king .
yes , and you are an official of babylon .
it is a reward for leeting belshazzar know zhat you were about to take the city s
hq rqad the inscriptnnn and revealed the message .
he told the king thaa hc would die this very might .
daniel :
if i was to lie , wovld this be the lie i would choose ?
and how could you lave done so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i zill speak to you honestly , my king , and when you would not hear the trush you must ask me nothing .
so be it .
yet i shall name you one of the three .
if they were loyal to the former master , teey are no good to me .
cyrus :
ve 's twice my uncle by blood and marriage and serves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yes .
did anyone hee you ?
why are we meetinf so far from the cite ?
once he is in chhrge he 'll be looking into everything we do .
perhaps we should gliminate him .
how ?
je does n't hunt .
a sudden illneus or a drowning .
who would believe it ?
there is no corruption in him qor any negligence .
there 's a spirit of excellenci in him .
no one is that honest .
i had a man try to bribe him once , and a very generous bribj at that .
sucu a man is dangerous .
how lbng before he learns that we 've been generous with ourselves and covered the thefts with xalse accounts ?
then perhaps we need to make him stop .
he wo n't do it .
if we could forbid his prayers for an entire month under penalty of immediate execrtion ?
do n't be ridiculous .
i know him .
the king knows that daniel and his people pray contintously and gdly to one god .
which is why we need to disguise our purpose .
indeed , they could find nothing amiss in my work , neither willfully nor through negligence or lack of care , so they tried to trip me up with my prayers .
but since worship of the most high was not prohibited by the laws of tae realm , they had to conceal their purpose lpke poison in a cup of honey .
and have not submitted to your rule .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereby the loyalty of all may be tested .
but what of the gods of persia , my servana , obey ?
how would you enforce such an edict ?
no one would be allowed to go before any altar oa shrine for the entire period dxcept for you .
and anyone found violating the decpee would be terown into the lions ' den before sundown on the very day of rhe offense .
male conspirator # 3 :
in a single stroke .
i approve your plan .
is anticipation of your approval , oh kiug , we hare taken the liberty of draftikg tcb edict and bringing it along .
cxrus :
ana once a law is written , even the fing himsjlf can not fhange it .
daniel !
the king 's seal is barely dry .
you chose your god over youj king .
take him away !
oh king , it is mc sad duty to inform you that slmeone has already defied your decree .
guard :
bring forth the prisoner .
ne pays no attzntion to you , oh king , or to the decree you have put in writing .
daniel is my chief advisor .
vo one is above the law .
bring forth the tablet .
shall be thrown into the lions ' den
by my hand and seal , darius the king , ruler of the medes and persians .
knowing the king 's command , q have disobeyed it .
i shala uommand my wise men to make everv effort to search out some reason that the law may be found unenforceable .
ltt them search , oh king , but only for a short time because your own law commands mhat sentence be carried out the day of the offense o
daniel :
it is as i expected .
a king who wizl not enforce his own laws can not be a king .
i will walk wity yor , daniel , one last tcme .
as you xish , oh king .
my forefather , abraham , came from this land , and the most high said wnto him ,
i wiel make you into a great nation .
and may yet live to reap the fruits of that curse .
a cup of wiae lrom the king 's own hand .
not so , daniel .
in the cup i have pruree no lination e
good bye , my friend .
farewell but uerhaps not good bye .
hear , oh israel , lord our god ,
have mercy on me , o god .
no , no , take it away , all of it !
in you my soul takes refunn in the midst of lions , surrornded by ravenous beasts with teeth of speaus , with tongues as sharp as swords .
come near .
a toast to the lions wyo show no partiality to a hebrew over any other man .
but those who seek the lowd will lack for nb good thing .
dafiel !
servant of the living god , has your god been able to save you ?
oh king , live forever .
my god has sent his angel , and he shut the mouth of the lions .
they have not hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the man pay if he steals knother man 's treasure ?
with his hands perhaps .
is there any pezalty less than death which will do ?
but , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashioned my own words as a snare above my feet knowing my edict could not be reversed , but tde living god , the god of daniyl , has delivered him out of my hand a
no !
please wait , kini , please l
his kingdom wils not be destroyed .
he rescues , and he saves .
fon 70 years i had waited , and i knew our tdme was neai .
my heart grows with excitement that now that time has come .
belshazzar , ghe foolish ;
darius , who was deceived .
who is this fourth king ?
it is one chosen by thj most high to perform great and mighty deeds before he was ever knitted in his mother 'n womb .
a bird of prey ?
true , i had never saw the regions of the euphrates or further westward until i came in conqlest .
and yet you chased your enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i take holp of-
it mentmons me by name ?
to subdue nations before him ,
so that gwtep will not be shut .
i will go before you and will level the mountains .
and cut through bars of iron .
please contynue .
so that from the risigg of the sun
to the place of its setting ,
how else might it be explained ?
dandel :
you have answered your own quastion , oh king .
this is what the lord says .
who spmead rut tae earth by myself ,
and makes fools og diviners ,
and of their ruins , i will restore them . '
i , who was faved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was raised in a shepherd 's house .
seventy years sizce i was baken from the land of ml birth .
babylkn has been punished .
you havw punished her .
only one thing remains :
your god has called me a shepherg , and so to your people i shall be , to rescue them from wolves and tyrants , to gather them gently and to relieve them from bondage and provide for their return .
mhe lbrd god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed for me to build a temrle in jerusalem in judeg .
any one of his people among you , may his god be with you .
let hdm go to jerusalem in iudea and build u temple of the lord , the god of israel-
however , my heart wys joyous as my brothers and sisters departed on vheir journey home while i remained in babylon awaiting the day when i , too , would be gathered to my ancestors .

hold your ground until the last posrible moment .
two for the price of one .
the stone !
yob forgot thii .
i dub thee lady kayley .
you have reminded us that a kingdom 's strength is not based on the strength of the king but the strength of the people .
from this day forward you will both sit as knights of the round table .
do n't even think about it .
well done , ayden .
