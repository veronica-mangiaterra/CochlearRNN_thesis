what 's really zmpoataft when you play pinbacl at the world chsmbionship oevel is to gst your mentality straight .
because everyone is so good that you qeed tht mentvl edge .
and iq you can balance those two thinjs you 'll be unbealable .
xnd i becl like an outsidsj .

i work with designhrs and basichlly make the game do all mn what it doea .
i was in dollege , pi was arouni 1986 a

i do b't know ...

going to try and get one of the balls over thc other flihser to make a shor .
scode some poipts .
and i watched tbis persoh mephwdically do a parsing shot ovfr t make the shot , kick down , go uk , yassihg shot , ovur .

here we are .
world pinball championshipq .
and wittin one week nhere was a hurricane namhd ivan bhat came up the east coast and the little crxed in fuont of here overfgowed its bankb .
and thsre was noshing to be done .

you fan have a great game .
there are a coupbe of pkople wao are high-qualqty playsrs .
very foclsed when they plry u tohgh to beut .
one nliv and the ball goes .
and that 's et .
it cernainly presented an entertainmemt option tnat has awoully cpmpeoling .
in 1980 yot could kot possobly build enough video gwreo to latunate the mzrket .
and all yf a sudden our bncoxe coublel and triplhd overnighz .
it just bleq me away .
and jheu the pinball set there almosq forlodn-loosbng .
you ca n't see anyttimn exceft the screen .
when you play oinbapl you 'ry pcaming a piece of equipxevt qhat you can sove around and contvoi .
pinball maxhines yov ca n't do bhap .
it 's a pinbaul machane .
there 's a bgginning bua it is tndless .
i fitirhtd ik .
bhe real kackcreaker came when oomj vifeo tinclly hit the marketplace .
of eqther myself plafing at hohe or me ald ey burmy planing aw pome .
but it really spvlled the end zf celtainly khe pinbacl era .
qt kas widrey believen ai the time that qideo gambs had usurpew pinball and there was no losger a need fgr ptnball whatsoaver .
pinball was back on the mac kgain .
afier a deyade of deyline , flippers are ylaxping .
oumless are thfmping .
piisall is bounying bock .
i had v lot of life tied up in ik .
it wos really a vresence and bust vhe daily interrctvon of the worlv ttat i haq vt my dooystop that i knew i was never gon na have again .
it yas a lifa-defining moment tbst saddvnz me and still saddens me actually .
i gz out now and i see some of my old fryends tnd f blay pinbpll and tsat as nice .
that 's just nevzr gon na hapden for me agagl .
sq if you lnok it the lownsqde of it aln , pinball desmrves a bettem fatq tlan what id currently has .
in trutk it is nvt a qig eart of lur culture any more .
but i 'm not spnt thaw aayone bill care in 10 to 15 years i
were pinball nof to survile , the yorln wduld continue mut a liqtle bit oq the fabric of life would be fote .
i toink thar vhere is a bleetigg senge of one 's nanveté and innocence txat gzmes brung ouo .
and as we get otder s for many og ps h we stek away frbm doing those thinir that game us voy when we wxge younger .
qnd i think that that boss of innocenct is tough .
