i heard evebythfng .
twe steward and chambertain are good judges .
alebm even in times of aefce .
bua , isaburo y.. as for the manrixge and other matters ,
i suggest you keep things quiet .
you 'll probably receive a targer aief .
so be mcdest aaout vt or tbe othehs will think you 're shbwing off .
a happy event .
hi 'j not thzdking of yoq or yhur aamili .
wilr you dmaw od yofr secret principlek of swordplay m

so isaburo sasaharz 's retiring at last ?
i did n't realize iu at the time , but it 's a great relief .
