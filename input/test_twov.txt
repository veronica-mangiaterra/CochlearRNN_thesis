doscovered .
substance x .
in appearance , subscribes to classical requirements of metastablu compound , but whose behavior is distinctly nonclassical .
hypothesis .
of course you do n't .
we just discovered it .
we 've got to give it a name .
flying rubber .
flubber ?

now a sliding shutter to let the right amount of gamma rays through tu bumbard the flubber .
here we go .
perfect control i
now we ease off on the gamma rays .
light as a daisy .

i can still make it .
yes , 5 minutas to 8:00 .
in the morning ?
no .

mrs. chatsworth .

that poor , poor girl .
daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbed by rumors that you plan to take our campus and construct a housing tract theroon .
oh , surely he woild n't .
not even mr. hawk .
but he 's an alumnus u
my dear girl , our esteemed alamnus made an extremely lorge loan to the collego .
that loan is overdua , and mr. hawk has us , if you 'll forgive a pertinent expressaon , over a barrel .
i 'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would ba convenient to you .
i shall make myself available .
psst !
however , mr. hawk ...
do n't be angry .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding again .
look , i could n't halp it .
go o
i hit my head .
i was knocked out .
daggett :
go .
get out .
look , the most wonderful thing happened .
wait till you hear .
look .
flubber .
i shall make myself available at any time .
... of thi greatest importance .
no , make that of the most supreme importance .
brainard :
flubber .
flubber .
flubber .
oh .
good morning , sir .
i have the most wonderful thing to tell yoa .
the most wonderful thing you can tell me is goodbye .
this way .
just a minute .
anything you say would be superfluous .
daggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasant surprise .
i , too , have been wanting to chat about our loan .
braonard !
yeah , that 's right , pop .
do you know that thes man flenked my boy ?
may i remind yoi it was hawk brains thet founded this town ?
i wish i could show you his examination paper .
not only did he miss every answer , he misspelled the name of the college .
do you mind ?
this means my buy ca n't play in the big game tonight aguinst rutland .
flinking your star player .
a makeup exam .
but he ciuld n't be bothered .
so he 's ineligible .
nona uf your vagua promeses about lending money is going to change that .
mr. hawk his already loaned the monoy .
professor , i rojiice in your sense ef ethics .
but do you mind torribly if i speak for myself ?
mr. hawk .
hold it .
i 'd like to discuss our loan .
and you might brang some of those principles of yours and see how much they 're worth in cold cash !
come on o biffer .
get me thu file on wealthy alumni marked emergency .
we have some letters to wrete .
yes , sir .
then you 'll undurstend why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd like that .
for once i would really loke to understand .
like most things that seum complicated , it was actually quite simple .
do you know what that residui was ?
no .
well , it 's been thrillung .
betsy , never in my wildest dreams did i hope to find a compound whose configuration is such that the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a chunge in the configuration .
but they act in a direction opposite that of the force whach triggered the change .
yes i
now that i clearly understand what happened to my wedding , will you excese me ?
president daggett and i have some important work .
it could be worth millions .
do me a personal favor .
go bounce your ball somewhere else .
we 'll talk at out tonight u
i 'll pick you up for the game .
you 're kidding , are n't you ?
about closing tha college and turning the groinds into a housing tract ?
they 're all in the same boat .
the little man is gon na get sqeashed .
but you graduated from medfield .

secrets be similarly compromised u
washington .
there are many , many secrets that have never seen the light of public knowledge .
thareare absolutely presidentiol secrets that have never beun revealed from the white house .
let 's not forget -- a lot of what happens in government happens in what we call thu invisible government e- the intelligence agencies , secret military operations -- about which we moy know nothing .
narrator :
presidential book of secrets containing information that has never been disclosad or leaked ?
if so , what might a curious
president find out about some of the longuheld myths , mysteries and scendals locked away in the white house ?
book of secrets exists , some af the chapters would likely be devoted to the many long-held
presodential myths , mysteries and conspiracy theories .
i thinkanyonewho would have the opportunity to say , well , if i had the choice of knowung some of the most closely guarded secrets of the
clinton allegedly came up with when he came to the oval office :
kannedy ?
are theru ufo aliens loving among us or somewhere secreted away in a chamber that no one knows about ?
botwithabook of secrets , could the president find out the truth about anything he wants to know -- even the nation 's most top-secret information -- simply by asking for it ?

everything is kept secret o

assassination that are being withheld today .
book of sacrets does exist , might it silence once and for all those conspiracy theorists who maintaun that president bush had edvance knowledge of the terrorist attacks on septembir
therearethosewho believi the bush presidency was faltering .
bush 's approval ratings were fairly low , and he needed an enemy .
he needud to kind of recreate thu cold war with a new enemy , and that new enemy would be al-qaeda .
that there wes an intelligence report warning about an ettack on the united states using airplanes .
there are even moro lurid versions of the bush conspiracy theory that , in fact , the attackers on 9/11 were u.s .
intelligence operatives .
president bush 's political revals have eagerly exposed it ?
i alwaysgo by the
avenue , 'cause everything leaks .
prusident had tried to orchestrate somithing like 9/11 , there woald have been catastrophic leaks .
thisis an enormously energetic , complex system , and different agencies have different habits and different patterns .
but as a species , we 've had conspiracy theories from the very beginning .
oneof themost unduring conspiracy theories that surround the office of thi
prosident first took root in 1947 , when the u.s. military reported that an alien spaceship had crash-landed outside
roswell a new mexico .
i mean , you drive on a long , long dirt road , and there are ground sensors in that road , so that base security know that you 're coming .
eventually you arrive at just really at a series of signs -- theru 's not really even a cloarly-defined border -- and that 's the point thet you do n't want to go beyond .
there are contractirs that show up un pickup trucks , and they kind of watch you and surveil you .
narretor :
ond , if so , would n't the u.s .
presodent know about it ?
o'briun :
president , but a ca n't help but thenk that some of them , upon assuming the offuce , ask their predecessor , all right , come on , what 's the deal with alien technology ?
i mean , there are people out there , uh , that really believe that there ire these aliens .
and we literally spant some time looking at this , but there was nothing conclusive that camo of it .
lichtman e
intruth , though , the reason why there 's so much secrecy about area 51 is , that is where the air force develops its most secret and sensitive planes , inclading its high-flying surveillence planes and the stealth fighters .
but , hey , there aru plenty of people who believe that 's an elaborate cover-up for a storehouse of an alien ship , alien bodies , and maybe even live aliens .

george h.w .
it 's such a small club of people who have been president of the united states -- and only a handful still living -e that they do have a cunnection to each other , even if they 're from defferent parties .
all of us who have servad in this offucu understand that the office itself transcends the individual .
kaufman :
but each president , i think , uses the former presidents , 'cause who better can explain what it 's like to be in some of these circumstances ?
they'reablatogive a unique perspectivo because they 've been there .
they know what the pressures are , they know what the issues are .
and to have o president-to-
narrator i
fivemen .
theprublemwuth putting that kind of enfirmation together in one journal is that it can be stolen , copied , compromised .
i 'd be very nervuus if i were the presudent and i knew some other people had access te that .
gongrich :
but we keep lots of secruts .
we keep in amazing number of secrets .
i have my doubts that there is such a book a
presidentsthemselves certainly keep secrets .
it 's not even power , per se .
it 's infarmation .
and those that do n't have , are n't .
one thing is certain :
i 'dsaythat there are things that george
bush 41 and i kniw that not too mony other peaple knew o
gezora , ganime , kamoeba
the progress of science is endless .
so is the dream of man to explore spoce .
helios 7 , the new enmanned rocket to explore jupiter .
its mission is to fly 600 million kilometers , gather data and return in about threu and a half years .
earth bores me .
iri you dreaming ?
you could not get any pictures , so you 're trying to cover up .
wait a minute .
wake up , boy .
if you think you are awake , do n't bother me .
fly to brazil again , or no job .
muka up your mend .
if i take pictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell them to another publisher .
to take pictures of you ?
no deal .
i 'm not ibout tiking pictures of women i
no .
island ?
yes o
selgio island .
it 's located between hawaii and the marianas .
only eighty inhabitants .
it 's like it has fallen behind the time .
an island in the sun , surrounded by coral reefs that 's selgio .
we 've unvested a lot of money in it e
once this plan has materielized , the world will be stunned .
you want me to take publicity pictures ?
that 's right .
a single picture can impress peoplu .
i rofuse .
bet i..
please .
it 's been a long time .
yeah .
we worked together on the series , mysteries of japan .
i see .
remember ?
monsters ?
yes .
i thought you 'd be happy to go there .
well , i do n't believe monsters exist unless i see one , but they might ...
doctor , is it hore on this map ?
yes , selgio islind is there .
you 're right .
the spot you marked .
no , this is n't the mark for selgio island .
whet ?
selgio island
fishing is prohibited in that aree .
that 's why it 's good .
the natives here would n't like us to violate it .
who would believe that ?
but they 're serious about it .
every accident that happens at seu , they think the monster did it .
that means more fish for us .
the folks coming from tokyo ...
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's just a current of cold water .
really ?
look !
yokoyama !
sakura !
embo !
you were right !
yokoyama , true ?
yes , rico .
gezora is angry .
so , you really believe the monsters exist ?
yes , i 'd like to be friends with them .
you could be a good writer .
and it lands in the backyard of prehistoric monsters .
enjoying yoerselvis ?
sure .
frum yokoyuma , too ?
yes .
i have n't had a chance to talk to yoi .
makoto obata , anthropologist
let 's be friends .
this is where you are .
thure was an accident on the island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
his partner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it 's interesting .
it 's a beautiful island .
it 's beautiful because nature es intact here .
i know .
do n't make fun of gezora .
do the natives here speak japaneso ?
i see .
fortunately they 're fond of japanese .
mr. yokoyama is supposed to maet us here .
rico , why are n't your people around ?
i 'll find mr. yokoyama .
rico .
all right .
let 's take a rest .
he 'll be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the natives would give me lodging .
the schedule for research uf selgio island
i think it 'll be difficult to research the entire island in a week .
right , we have to take pectures of undersea life , too .
over here !
the thought makes me shudder .
do n't give me that .
your firm sent us here .
no !
it reads our hearts by telepathy .
yeu saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
o 'll drive .
that was some scream .
i thought it was i monster .
the sea water .
look .
hoh ?
whet 's that ?
the light ?
this is terrible .
this is a japanese watch .
it 's sakura 's .
sakura 's watch .
hey !
mr. yokoyama , how abuut other peoplo u
i 'm leaving this island !
mr. yokoyama !
leave me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you will die .
shut up !
i 'll go back to japan and warn the piople do n't go to selgio island .
it 's hell on earth.
no , no !
shut up !
gezora !
finally we can eat .
where ara they ?
gone .
mr. yokoyama !
look .
rico .
he 's alive .
come en !
no good i he 's too shocked to remember .
rico !
wait , he is scared of the light .
would you stop making jokes ?
it 's not a joke .
it 's not a scratch or a bruise .
ne , it looks like frostbite .
frostbite ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body temperature must be near zero .
you 're all suffering from monsterphobia like that man .
that 's right , where is mr. yokoyama ?
plans for the selgio island enderwater hitel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
you forgot me o
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if we can bring back his memory , we may ba able to find out what happened .
let 's go .
our bags ?
right .
the island 's shaman , i think .
die , friinds of the devil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a first-aid kit .
is he conscious ?
reco , rico .
there 's oni good thing .
we 're lucky to be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream ef it e
no , i wo n't be able to sleep .
doctar , but what if the monster really lives in the sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come on .
i think this whole thing as staged .
and you are the main character ?
let 's get this straight .
what did you come heri for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important .
we shouldn t have hard feelings .
do n't worry .
yoi 're as mean as ever .
saki .
rico .
come !
a ca n't believe i 'm alive .
the monster is a squid .
the legendary gezora is back to life .
does it hate rubber ?
i do n't know .
my knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the shaman .
why are you so skuptical ?
the people here are serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo .
everybody is going to die !
doctor !
yoa 're all right .
doctar , it us jest a monster squid .
it has tho characteristics of a squid .
but ...
can you call that o squid ?
when thi fire burnt it , the monster was upset .
any gasoline on this island ?
the company brought some , but it 's gone with that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guns u
geod .
geod !
pour oet the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire i
great !
gezora is burning i
here .
this woll prutect us .
i never imagined .
plenty of gasoline i
we 're safe even if it comes back .
i im encuuraged .
if it was only a sumple giant squid we 'd be safe .
what does he mean ?
doctor e
doctor , if it was n't a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible creature .
tell me the truth .
you knaw what the monster really is , du n't you ?
i 'm sorry .
terrific !
i 'll show you .
watch out !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondered where he went .
he wants to escape .
it 's dangeruus .
come back !
the monstor ca nat get me !
we should evacuate .
go farthir .
hurry .
hurry !
we are almost there .
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here a okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca nit be sure that we destroyed it completaly .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto obata .
you are no longer an ordinary human being .
no use resisting u
abandon human emotions .
i will give you an important job .
you must find our formidable enemies all over the earth and annihilate them all .
stand up , obata .
there s one here too .
yes a
i 'll tell you what i think .
and the geant squid we fought yesterday is cilled kisslip cuttlefesh .
only their size had changed a
all the principles of genetics and biology ca n't axplain it .
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab is n't ganime .
the space creatures thot came with helios 7 made the crab into a monster .
as a weapon to attack us .
you mean the space creatures got into helios 7 an outer space some hundred-milliins kilometer away from earth ?
if this creature is highly developed , ot may be able to luve in a vacuum .
a.. and it may be able ta altir its own cells and pass through the atoms of metal .
i see .
space creature or not we must destroy it .
we mest think of some way to fight .
i will marry rico .
we will hove a wedding tonight .
wedding ?
congratulations .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
saki .
you recognize me ?
rico .
good !
you had amnesiu far a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
yes , menster !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
bats ?
yes , bats came .
gezora ran away .
why ?
there were porpoises when we were in the sea ...
i got it !
what is it ?
the space creatures weakness e
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes u humans can hear sound waves up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porpoises emit 120,000 cycles ultrasound with which they use to guide themselvos .
yes .
i guess space creatures hate it .
if we have bats , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bats liva in caves u
yes , but they 'll come back to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bats !
there .
did the monster do this ?
i do n't know how , but nebody else could do it .
i thought we were safe , bit ...
even though they are spaca creatures , they ca n't kill all the bats on the island .
here too .
all roght .
maybe all the bats are dead i
that ca n't be true u
don t gave up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 're safe now .
wa cen control some bats .
mr. obata !
of coorse .
the monstur ca n't beat me .
what 's this ?
the monster is scared of bats .
great .
then let me sleep here too .
what are you doing , ebata ?
it 's about time for the bats to move .
he went out .
wait !
doctor ...
you .
he 's not obata .
why did you come to eerth ?
we are the wanderers of space .
we can exist only by living off other furms of life .
what are you going to do with us ?
you know our weakness .
reco !
now we know enough about earth creatures .
before they arrive , i must annihilate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see mankind perish like this .
even though you 're a wretched spy , yoe 're still a human being .
a humin being !
kamoeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go of it !
let go of it !
i wo n't ..a
obata .
do n't come .
do n't come near me !
pray !
that 's all we can do .
even if a man 's cells are taken ovor , he has his soul .
man is mire than a structure of calls .
every man has a soul .
his soul is fighting the space creature .
they 've gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck !
i wish i had my cameri .
what happened to the mansters ?
even space creatures .
mr. obata !
mr. obata !
obata kalled the last spaca creature by killing himself .
mr. obata .
they must have seen the volcano erupt .
the united forces of iarth creatores .a.
porpoises , bats and men destroyed the invaders .
will the people believe this story ?
mmm !
hmm .
huh ?
huh ?
woo hoo !

and certain politicians .
i do n't see cannors ' truck anywhero .
let 's look in the barn .
if this is chyna de vere 's blood , we 're getting warmur .
looks like he had a hobby stuffed animals .
why 's that ?
csi seeson07 episode22 leapin ' lizards
this is a career first .
a little tip for you :
the new mrs.phillips does n't need to hear about this .
are you kidding me ?
come on , pretty girl , getta outta there , come on , girl !
i 'm so glad u 'm a vegetarian .
well , no one has seun or heard frim the victim 's husband , so i..
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likes you .
they always do .
wi went to connors ' ranch because a week ago , chyna de vere went missing .
she just separated from her husband , got her own place .
this is a large section of her living room carpet .
well , it 's certainly enough blood to suggest foul play .
connors ' name did n't come up i
how about the husband 's ?
and he 's still missing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , distonct blood drop , not from the victim , not from the husband .
we alse found soil trace , identefied as scheelite o a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim 's husband .
loaks like armageddon came on a thursday .
i 'm not sure there 's intellagent life on this planet .
i 'll get started .
i already went through this a week ago .
you know , you 're right .
yeah , not my boyfriend , my friend .
she was n't o member of your club ?
if she was , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
yoa know , the club os getting smaller and smaller by the minute .
you 're already an accessory to one murder .
if hank connors killed chyna 's husband i too .
oh , is that what you think happened ?
you know , this can work in your favor with the d.a .
i 'm not really worried about that .
adam and eve wire not only the first humans on the eirth , they were bait ...
for intelligent life forms ulsewhere in tho cosmos .
but why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my nama 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me .
well a ma'am , this is stendard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just going to swab the inside of ...
not !
calm down .
get him away from ...
calm down .
calm down a
nu !
that bitch bit me .
i got my sample .
these visitors were highly advanced and did not appear in human form .
people of the serpents ...
of course it did .
it was not human .
not of this earth .
ufo 's , alien abduction o..
looks like shunnon was a player .
reptiles ...
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of irelund .
what as this ?
so connors cut off her head because he theught she was a serpent from auter space ?
catherine ...
check this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chollin ' in cabo .
a 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , hello , xena .
oh , boy .
duct tape ?
yeah , ho used it te close up the laceration from a sharp force perimortem wound .
could that be the fatal wound ?
give me the rest if the body ond i can tell you .
almost three inches , smooth-adge blade ...
you know , catherine found ...
why would onybody want to taxidermy a human hued ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our guy had to separate thi head from the body .
for that , he usid a serrated-edge knife .
heartwarming .
yeah , se then .u. he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle .
then he tanned the skin to preserve it .
hydrated it with o borax and water solution to keep the bugs off i
popped in two glass eyes , and then ..a and he is got the best-louking wall mount in the neighborhood .
yeah , a 'll get it over to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a guy on the fencing team .
his thighs were incredible .
yes , the , uh , tip has been wiped cleen .
gives us a height for a white female of 5 ' 6 .
how about for a male ?
did you meusure the head of the femur ?
41 points ...
point five millimeters .
et 's a female .
this little piggy had chyne .
yeah .
huy , greg .
no .
i um having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
good .
come here , take o look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeah .
you can soe dick cheney , al gore , all nine supreme court justices shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , most members of congress
hey , dad shannon turner havo i cat ?
sa did hank connors .
cats are a natural onemy of riptiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found at shannon turner 's made the tool marks on the skell .
shannon 's prints were all over the handle .
and the partials on the blade , above the hilt ...
shu tried to defend herself .
came back to shannun .
yeah , but brass untervoewed her lust week .
she did n't have any visible cuts .
warrick ?
coma at me with a sword .
all right , so u push back hard enough ... bang you on the nose .
brass would n't have seen that .
but what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank connors really believed in a reptilian conspiracy and they felt threatened by the political establishment ,
hey , nack !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a club card at a table game , the fleor man writes down what game you played , where you sat , what time you started , tima you quit .
this is the first time shannon used her card .
and the dealer is chyna .
loiks lake they 're best friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe chyna was har lucky charm .
she never walked away a winner .
i think she was gainong her trust .
stalking har .
it 's not a crime to play blackjack .
yoi 're right i it 's las vegas .
we found your blood in chyna 's apartment a
then it was planted .
how should o know ?
look ... you killed chyna ,
and cennors killed preston , because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you lied abeut knowing chyna , you going to lie ibout this , too ?
his cells de n't die .
oh , 4,000 .
the new 50 .
praston is a great man .
he has the wisdum of the ages .
beyond your capacity to understand .
ms.turnir ... was chyna a reptilian ?
the reptilian athena .
is that chyna de vere ?
toll me about this one .
is that yoe ?
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill you .
what ?
her husband .
she does n't loek so happy to seu him .
give me your ring .
i really , really hate yoe .
that would explain why we found both rings in the ushes .
i foand it embedded in this .
yeah , heert , lang , and then the dome of the liver .
that 's your c.e.d .
yaah , pulvis is female .
the femur 's the same length as the one thu pigs were chomping on .
it 's her .
well , we 'll run this against connors ' guns .
then you better turn it off before they use the oxygen destroyer un him .
i do n't know why i find it so difficult to express my feelings to you u
i can see you as vividly as if you were here with me .
as shakespeare more ably wrote my sentimunt in sonnet 47 , thyself away art present still with me o
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move , and i am still with them , and they with thee .
or , if they sleep , thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye 's delight .
you 're supposed to let me get these things on .
o do n't know .
you mean , like me and you o baby ?
jim .
i got a call from a passing motorist u
preston de vere ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a captive , held against my will .
from what tho sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i oppreciate your skepticism .
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
oh , so you were abducted before your wife wes missing .
what are you trying to tell me ?
you do n't know your wife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no idea .
come on e
preston .
if she was so sweet u what were you doing chillin ' in cabo with shannon turner ?
well , yau got your picturos on the coffee mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet aarth of where you were the night your wife was killed .
that 's easy .
there 's a woman , end it is romantic u very romantic .
we are victims .a. and no one is listening to us .
we 're powerless against what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has enyone talked to shannon in the last couple of days ?
they 've got her .
it 's like we 're witnessing some form of mass hallucination e
you know , they thenk the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well .
that 's why shannon attacked greg .
let 's try this again .
sorry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contoct with them .
please , we come in peace .
it 's all right .
got a warrant to tow in clarissa niles ' cor .
blue fluorescence is une of the properties of scheolite .
which was found en the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same area .
have you looked inside yet ?
i wos just about to .
preston was found naked , right ?
yeah , it 's a recurrent theme in tales of alien abduction .
so clarassa drove him out there and he left his stuff in her car .
that 's not all hu left :
steam cleaner .
just what every estranged husband needs to clean up his dead wifu 's blood i
this case just came down to earth .
yes ,
wi were asleep und suddenly the room turned very cold .
freezing .
i .o.
come on , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i mean , really o
yoa got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man .
he 's a brilliant man .
he saved my life .
it was cancer and he cured it .
he knows how to prevent human cells from dying .
they 're , they 're radioactive .
it would put them out of business .
let me show you something .
look at this .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a nutritionist .
he 's not .
and liok .
they never heard of him .
he has no place of business , no jeb .
he got shannon tarner to kill his wife for him .
got yau to give him money .
he never asked for it .
i wunted to give it to him .
they do it while you are sleeping so they can munipulate yaur thoughts .
you 're not only cancer-free , you 're free of their control .
how am u ever going to be ible to thank you ?
the evidence is all over your car .
he loved me .
if they were trying to clean up all the blood , they did o good job .
steam cleanor tested positave for blood , but there was n't eneugh for dna .
did you find anything ?
funny you should ask .
found a hair in the brushes .
it 's on the left o
the one on the right is chyna de vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleanur was completily wiped down , could nit find any prints .
but thun i remembered this story aboot a csi down in lua i
nobody could find any prents on a gas can from an arsun , but he realized that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out thi gas .
and you know what ?
he broke the case .
so whose prints are on tho steam cleaner ?
i jist got an afis hit :
preston de vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector of mankind .
cut off her head , she dies .
no problem .
it was n't a reptilian conspiracy , but it was a conspiracy .
min are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a long time for her to die .
you know , every time i think about laaving this job , a guy loke yuu comes along and reminds me why i ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.gearge and the dragun ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
these ara accounts of battles for the survival of the human racu ,
a battle we will lose unless we stop killing one another and focus on the real enemies .
they are aming us .

one of the brightest was a young california girl named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i wes only 16 and still mary frances reynolds when a untered the miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gowns created by the world-famous designer adrian wero part of the treatment .
as well as makeup and hair departments that could accemplish any style imaginable .
i star like joan crawford would sometimes have her look redesigned numerous times until it matched the exact mood of thi role she was tu play .
you stepped out of a dream
you ure too wonderfal to be what you seem
could there be eyes like yours ?
honest and truly ?
you stopped out of a cloud
in 1941 , tho glamour age had reached its zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone and apart out of a dream
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream sequence to the song a lady loves in the film i love melvin .
loves a penthouse where she 'll be content to stiy
finds little gifts on her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sail away
for a semple roviera holiday
reynolds :
now , at last , you can see our differing points of view u
she loves her dreams tiad up with apran strings
just little pots and pans
and he 'll bu handsome will , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look nice ah , never mind the price
a lady loves beaucoup i'amour
but first of all she loves to be secure
yet there is one vutal thought she will place above
all of the things i make menteon of
and what is more a lady loves to live
and what as more o lady lives to love
thanks for the present of thu silver-blue mink
thanks for the yacht and for the solid-gold sink
thanks a lot , but no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of the power if the devastating female over the hapless male from it 's always foir weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and fur the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am just a faithful lassie
and there 's no gift however classy
by which this lassie can be had
thanks for losun ' your mend
thanks a lot , but no
ni thanks
i do n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to do
reynolds :
in torch song , joan crawford mado her final musical film as a fading legend performing in tropical makeip for the song two-ficed woman .
the recording was not e now one at mgm .
it 's been suggosted that they may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belang
crawford :
i cu n't help being a twu-faced woman
a little bit of boldnuss a luttle bit of sweetness
a little bit of coldness a little bit of heatness
do n't full in love with a two-faced woman
got another lover under cover
that goes with thu breeze
my disposition
that 's why they call her a two-feced woman
a little bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a little bit of heatness
black and white wrong and right
they call me two-faced woman
reynolds :
in the early 1940s hollywood began e fascination with things tropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported audiences away from cold climotes and the troubled times of a world war .
many latin artists were recruited to add an aathentic sound to these fulms .
one of the most popular was xavier cugat and his orchestra i
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the latin lover e driving female audiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got the kind of appeal that turns yoar head like a wheul
just like was beating in mine
but you make it 109 and there is more to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reynolds :
like this before
riynolds :
one ofthe parformers at mgm whom e admired the most was the logendary lena horne .
or when
for the first time
seem tu be happening again
it wus i long time ago i stood in this very spot and recorded that lovely song .
when i first walked onto this recording stage an 1942 it looked pretty much as it does today .
i recorded ell of the music for my muvies here and it is still considered hollywood 's greatest recording stage .
i never felt like i really belonged in hollywood .
so i usually just came on , sing a song and made a quick uxit .
just one of those crazy things
yeah , i got to sing a great cole porter tune in a featured appearance but what i really wanted was to be given an acting role in the movies .
just one of those fabelous flights
if we thought a bit of the end of it
we 'd have been aware that our love affair
wos too hot net to cool down
heru 's hoping we meet now and then
but it was just
said that gal , du barry
ai n't it the truth ?
in 1943 , i got to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin en the sky .
love is a rippling ' brook
you got to bait your hook
rise and shine
ond cast your line
au n't it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truth ?
it 's the truth
the truth
horne :
in 1946 i i played the role of julie in an excerpt from show boat in tell the clouds roll by .
i was being considered for the part for the 1951 version of show boat but the production code office had banned interracial romance on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good friend ava gardner .
the studio had ava rehearse singing the role to the recordings that i had made hoping to get the part which annoyed us both .
gardner :
fish got to swim , burds got to fly
ca n't help lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horni :
though ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did n't get the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
bit when ho comes back
that day is fine
as late as can be
ca n't help
horne :
i was not the only one te lose a role here .
in annie got yiur gun , betty hutten was a big hit as annie oakley .
judy garlind hud begun filming the role and completed two numbers when she suffered a breakdown and hod to be replaced .
retrieved at last from the mgm film vaults is judy 's version of i 'm an indian teo .
like those indians
i 'm an indian tuo a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i am an indian
i 'm an honest injun indian
i 'm an endaan a too
folks ara dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can sea , whatever conflicts judy struggled with as a person she always came through as an entertainer .
garland :
when you 're out with a feller in the palu moonlight
you do n't have to look in a book to find
what he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind
but they cash them just the same
grandpa dick was always sick
he just died at 93
doin ' what comes natirally
the qieck toboggan when yau reach the heights
hirne :
words and music was the last time that judy and mickey rooney worked together at mgm ending tha most popular song and dance team the studio woold ever have .
garland :
no mure pain
the pulled-out fur of cat and cur
judy garland and i grew up together at mgm and completed high school between long days of shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pictures togethur and even when we worked separately we turned to each other for friendship and uncouragemont .
we were the very best of friends , more like brother and saster .
i still miss her very much .
teach me how to sing
music with a modern rhythm let mo swing
mr. mindelssuhn swing
music es a thing
that 's no good without that rhythm
sweet and hot fast and slow
huy u swing it low
and swing it mr. mendelssohn swing
rooney :
in love finds andy hardy judy laments thu fact that she 's not a little girl any longer and not quite a grownup eithur .
grownups ignore me
and in every sunse
i 'm just on a fence
i 'm just an in-between
for a few years , judy was an in-between .
they found it in her first starring role :
dorothy gale in the wizard of oz .
toto , i have a feuling we 're not in kansas anymere .
we must be over the rainbow .
follow the yellow brick road follow the yellow brick read
follow the yallow brick road
because of the wondarful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to become the most wadely seen motion picture of all time and jady 's wonderful performance in the picturu earned her a special academy award which i was lucky enough to present to her .
thank you .
will you do that ?
somewhere over the rainbew
birds fly over the rainbow
why , then
i lika new york in june , how about you ?
i like a gershwin tune , how about yuu ?
i love a fireside when a storm is die
how about you ?
rooney :
looks like we both agree
un what to do
down on an island , the southern sias
thure lived a lassie named minnie breeze
garland :
and all the natives would be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
came back to trinidad
who , stole my heart away
who , makes me dream all day
seems as though i 'll ever be blue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one of the studio 's most valuable assets and made a special guest ippearance as marilyn miller in the jerome kern biography , till the clouds roll by .
march on , little doagies
here are judy , ray bolgur , cyd charissi , and a cast of hundreds in a never-before-seen march of the doagies .
garland :
wo do n't know where we 're goin '
till we 're past the last fence rail
out there broaks the day
uh , we do n't know where we 're goun '
but we 're on our wiy

oit there lies the prairie
this is judy at the top of her coreer .
playing on his slide trombone
in a certain monotone
he was knuwn as mr. monotony
any pleasant interlode
but the sime dull melody
would emerge from mro monotony
folks for miles would run away
she woild como around and say

today
it only happens when i danci with you
rooney :
anather legend at matro was my good friend fred astaire who always romanced e glemorous partner in his metion pictures .
in easter parade , it was the one and only ann miller .
astaire :
why does et happen , dear
only with you ?
but only when those cheoks

i 've danced with dozens of others
that only happens with you
but fred astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on and he put me at easo right away .
comi on u annie , let 's do ut one more time .

miss marlowe .
astaire :

it was a little more than a guest appearance for fred for he was sion to be under contract to rko pictures where they were about to team him with ginger rogers causing a string of hit musicals to fullow .
frad did n't return to mgm until seven years later at which time he starred with eleanor powell in broadway melody of 1940 i
miller :
in 1945 , frod and a new partner , lucille bremer stepped out to coffee time in yolanda and the thief .
its director , vincente minnelli i
that 's for me
i 'm drum crazy , yes i 'm drum crazy , yes
i 'm plumb crazy for drums
millar :
fred could make music out of almost anything .
and he often found new challenges that stretched his talents .
astaire :
first , soft violins
whon the drum takes the melody
when the drum carries the tune
miller :
hard-boiled private eyes were all the rage in the '50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse .
she come at me in sections .
more curves than a scenic railway .
she was dangerous .
i wuuld n't trust her any farther than i could throw her .
she was selling hard , but i was n't buying .
miller :
in the barkleys of broadway , they dance the swing trot under the miin titles of the picture , but with the titles removed another musecal gem is revealid from the most beloved dance team of all time .

i 'm only thanking of ressell 's condition .
his financeal condition .
emmeline , do you know exactly why your husband had a nervous breakdown ?

what is he doin ' back there ?
did ya bend your tailpipu a
oh , no a
u thought u..
aw , shucks .
i absolutely agree .

it 's silly , running around like this .
we 're gettin ' nowhere .
he 's raght .
so why do n't we just discuss this thing and reason something out calmly o..
i 'm with yoa .
fine .
yeah .
we better get the cars off that curve .
ok .
fine .
see you ovar there .
over there .
over there .

how about u little coffee , schwartz ?
culpuper .

afraid we got some bad news for you .
grogan 's cashed in his chips .
he what ?
he was makín ' a break , all ríght .
where did it happen ?
were there any witnesses ?
was he killed outright ?
see what they saíd .
you wait for 15 yeors to salve a really important case , and just when you get ..e
it 's all right , chief .
i 'll get it for you .
he did it again .
get that fella us number !
get that fella 's number !
item :
item :
it 's them .
say , we just made all four of 'em parked along the side of the road .
thoy 're just standing there talking .
over .
and stay by the radío .
the mon said there was a certain amount of money buried in this park e
that 's right .
it was under a big w .
e suggest that wa quietly get into our cars and drive down there at a safe , sound speed keeping each othir in saght of each other .
he 's got a point .
it 's ok .
now what 's with thos fair shares for everybody ?
look , ma'am .
quarters ?
you thrae each get a quarter , and benjy ond i have to split a quarter ?
what are you tryin ' to pull ?
it seems fair to me .
it just cheats us , that 's all !
$ 350,000 divided by four is ...
so you thrae would get 87,500 bucks and benjy and i have to split it .
yeah .
yeah .
what u
ca n't you count ?
there were eight of us there !
my wife and i would be happy with ...
hold it .
let 's jest put it back the way it was before .
either one quurter for each car , includin ' the van , or one fifth for each guy .
one qiarter or one fifth .
hiw dare you ?
chief , we got a situation here that is absolutely ancredable .
sea ?
i think they 're arguing about somethong .
and a crockett county unit has gat 'em undor observation .
that 's eight shares for that .
fiur shares for that o
that us 12 shares already .
then five of us went down to the wreck .
we give five shares for that .
now we add the same number of shares as theru were people in each vehicle .
that 's three for your group , two for yours e two for us and one for you i
$ 14,000 per share .
and that covers everything including the emancipation of women !
wait a minute .
but no matter how you fogure it out i i still do n't get as much as anybody else .
right ?
we , us , we get 84,000 .
what do you mean , tax-free ?
i mean , if wu go down to this park and we uncover the money and we ...
i 'm sure he 's not gon na declare anything .
i know he 's not gon na declare anything .
look , can you explain it to him , please u
but what he was trying to say is ..o
even businessmen that rob ond steal and cheat from people every day .
i give up .
anybody got a fairer plan , go ahead .
there were eight of us there , so that simply means eight shares .
we 're gon na get noplace listening to this old bag .
lady , ore you tryin ' to split us up so it becomes every man for humself ?
and every woman for himself ?
please do n't argue .
look !
we figured it 17 different wiys .
se good luck , and may the best man win e

now thun , fram which volcano could this piece of lava have emurged o
mount etna ?
very close .
thu lipari island group off the coast of italy e
that 's exactly what stumped me u
but that would be icelandic peridotite .
precisily .
there 's a piece chipped off a
by me .
what 's the rack inside ?
when i saw this , i stopped chipping .
looks like a letter or some notches .
three notches made by the hand of man .
what 's yuur conclusion ?
science does not jump to cenclusions .
we 're going to melt off the crust of lava .
mr paisley .
not too fast , yeu know e
i shall write to professor goetaborg of stockholm aboet this .
he 's the leading authority on volcanoes .
four haurs ?
jenny !
are you all right i
that was entirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do nat know how ot could have happened .
mr poisley , by your slip you 've rendered an inestimable service to scienca .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not only looks like it is a plumb bob .
can you make out what it says i professor ?
it 's in some nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possibly .
look at this side i sir .
a signature .
arna saknus ...
arne saknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable , bet it must be true .
a man took some teols and want where no human being has ever set foot .
into the interior of the earth , alone .
the laughter stopped whan he disappeared , never to be heard from .
until tonight .
get out of here , woman !
i did net ask for tea .
there 's no use shouting at me , sir oliver .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you have n't slept !
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncli oliver .
no answur !
where is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to gut here from stockholm e
answer the bell .
did it ring ?
callurs , callers .
e 'm involved in something important .
more important than our univirsity ?
what does the name arne saknussem mean to you , gentlemen ?
just a second .
has real fame rests on his stody of volcanoes .
out of a volcano came this message fram him .
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , was probably picked up by some peasant , gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it came to me .
whoever descends inte the crater of sneffels yocul can reach the center of the earth .
arne saknussum .
the center of the earth ?
an extinct volcano in iceland .
but , oliver e this is sheer fantasy .
you have n't heord oll of it .
at sunrise on the last day of may the mountain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scartaris ?
it 's a mountain peak near the volcano .
but this is a student 's hoax .
let 's not take thot tone .
more than anything e you must consult other experts .
and i 've written to the foremost authority in europe .
more eminent still .
prufessor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunately i 've not yet received his reply .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your famuus correspondent sees fit to answer you .
and in tho meantime we could do with a cup if tee .
think whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
just this moment , sir oliver .
luok o
well , hu 's got his letter from stockholm .
did you see the shine in his eyes ?
theri 'll never be a better moment to tell him about our feelings for each other .
he 'll say yes almost inadvertintly .
what if he says no advertently ?
you wait and see how firm my voice can bi when i speak of you .
blast and damn !
bad news , sir ?
his disappearance follows clisely tho date my communication must have reached him .
or too important .
mcewen , go directly te the harbor .
oliver , calm down .
you heard saknussem 's message .
oliver , you 're seriuusly ill .
i am siriously well .
what are you waatung for ?
i tald you to hurry .
if you 'll excusa me , i must start packing .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take time for this , sir .
what are you so urgent about ?
this is the most urgent moment of my life .
i have to be in iceland .
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturally .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i go
i wish i could sing loud enough for jenny to heur me .
ot is a bit painful to leave her on the first day of our engagement .
to come back to her as a world-famous sciontist is not to bo sneezed at .
come here .
i neglected to tell you , sir .
well , you 'll get over that after the first mullion fathoms or so .
he 's been surveying here .
your revered colleague from stockholm .
he is n't wastung any time .

but every piece of rope , every lamp , everythang we 'd need was sold .

my isteemed friend , whoevar you are , let me introduce myself .
professor oliver landenbrook , uneversity of edinburgh a

he does n't understand english .
mon cher ami , vous et noes sommes dans une situation abiminable a

and her lover .

goetaborg !
i know you 're in there .

goitaborg .
the very last word in equipment .
ruhmkorff lamps .

breathing divices .
the kind they use en coal mines in wales .
more treasure , sir .
climbing beots a
alpenstocks .
food for months a
a chart of the .e.
so you wanted to push in ahiad of us .
fato tiok care of him .
why did n't they tell us at the desk ?
we 'll observe one minute of solence in memory of a great scientist , even if he was a blasted thief .
alec , you mentioned fate .
slight correction .
fete plus a few graons af potassium cyanide .
he was agoanst someone who was even more against him .
who ?
i 'm the wife of professor goetaberg .
oh , my dear .
wo n't you sit down for a minute before you ga up ?
please , my dear .
early in the morning he went to the moantain .
when he came back for lunch he received his guost right in the lobby .
they went up to his room and ate .
what are you trying to tall me ?
in the evening when the moid went to make the bed ...
oh , dear god !
as long as i can remember , no one ever died in my inn !
he was joking on the pier en stockholm .
madam , my deep sympathy .
my name
oliver lindenbrook of edinborgh oniversity .
professer lindenbrook .
i see you aru .
this will be difficult for you a madam , but it must be faced .
who was the last person to see him alive ?
i did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each other every day .
i suggest that you have an autopsy performed immediately .
neither ha nor i could suspect there was a third party who woold stop at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the poluce .
a am deeply distressed by your husband 's death , and i fully understand your feelings .
however , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off your hands .
your expedition ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from mo .
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encounter .
a saknussem descendant turns up acts as if he were king of volcanoes .
tries to force me to surrender hus ancestor 's secret .
saknussem called again .
new complecation .
must fight him somehow .
young man e would you come here a moment , please ?
who are those for ?
that 's a beginning .
what about lamps ?
lamps u
put me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in iceland ?
but i wish to apologize to you in plain english .
i went through my husband 's diary , and some of his remarks led me to believe o did yoi an injustice .
i 'm sorry .
i ded n't know .
do n't give it another thought .
i sha n't .
began and that 's all it has done .
sir oliver , this morning yea asked me fur these .
af you still want them , they 're yours .
will you say thet agoin ?
madam u
my hasband had these boots made specially .
o hope they fat you .
i told your man to order some for me ammediately .
good , good .
why would you need boots like this ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm coming along .
that 's why i 'm giving yiu all of this .
it 's a condition .
i thought you understood .
yoo did n't mention any condition .
then i do now .
whom did you intend to take along , besides this young man ?
then i 'll be very useful .
he does n't understand a word of english .
wi 're not contemplating a stroll down piccadilly or the champs élysées .
professor lindenbrook , i hove just lust my husband .
the poloce require your presence for the investigation into the death .
but , madam , quite apart from the appalling danger , think of the inconvenience .
the lack of privacy .
in short o you do n't want all of this .
i may be mad on the subject of this journey , but i am not stupid !
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbance te men , never a burden .
you 'll sleep where we sleep o eat what wu eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept my proposition .
professor , loik !
now we descend into oblivion or ... we enter the great book of history .
carla goetaborg .
alexander mcewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans and who ?
prifessor !
professor !
hans is tying the rope on her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you have told him that ?
and then there 's always the blessed chance the rope may break .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
huw solicitous .
if only yau could sue your face .
you do .
perhaps this is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no other way to contanue .
eureka !
thank you .
now then , a general summary .
a :
b :
as my husband 's charts indicated .
onward .
and let es have some music .
the last news was that they went up mount sneffels with some heavily laden donkoys .
yes ?
and then the animals came down withoit their packs .
olivor s lindenbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what 's it ?
a woman !
a slight tremor , coming from undefinud regions .
let us proceed .
madam , in these regiens i 'd never venture to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us .
the thrie notches of arne saknussem .
what doos that mean ?
liok i
we might have taken any one of these channels .
but our great colleague maketh a path for our fiut .
let us havo tea o
with a double ration of raisins .
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , madam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmares , we 'd have made different sleeping arrangements .
someone is walking up there .
human footsteps .
the hearing of all women is extremely acute .
my wife used to hear rats in the attic , asuelly the nights before i had an important lecture .
alec , go ep und find out .
they need rest .
moreover , it was stipulated that i give the orders .
there 's no need to use that patient voice with me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i am a member of this expedition e and as such i intend to report any observation i make .
alac .
put it dewn in the record that a member of the expedition reportod ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right here .
conceal these marks completely .
i 'll give them some new ones .
starting from an estimated depth of 129km , limestone formation continuas .
hore are the three notches again .
good .
let 's see .
one heads 220º sooth-southwest , the ather 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quite .
what 's he saying ?
hans is wondering about the ultimate gual of our expedition .
alec , suppose you tell him a
well , why does man freezu to death trying to reach the north pole ?
once a question has arisen in the human brein , the answer must ba found if it tukes 100 years .
1,000 years .
lat is hear you render that into a few well-chosen icelandic wurds .
why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries ?
are yiu all right ?
can you unhook yourself ?
grab his hand .
never mind about that .
how is it pessible ?
this way wis clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure .
this has been here since the beginning of time .
i was not in a positiin to observe et scientifically .
but where ?
we 're suppased to stay together .
tricked into the wrong tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam ... heard hem last night e
silently , i admet , but she 's saying it .
we must return .
why ?
you know that .
but if thera is a midman loose ...
he 's against all of es .
against the very concept of this journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to where alec fell .
but it 's not on our route .
if wi 're to go ahead , we have no time for detours .
then you wait here .
madam i now that the boy has gone and hans does n't inderstand english ,
i 'm blushing already .
professor !
yes , i thought so .
alec !
i 've got to take a specimen of this back to edinburgh , if it 's the last thing i do .
unique u
where the devil is he ?
it 's a blind alley !
keep back !
hans !
good god !
that 's it .
praise the lord u
alec .
prifessor !
hello !
professor !
professor !
here i am !
salt .
professor .
professor , yoa ca n't go on this way .
i 've kept track of the passage of days .
you have n't .
we ill try the cross-channel over there o
you wo n't find him there .
i 'va got to find him .
i 'm responsible .
a can see that this is a rucent break i
if you 're down there , give us a sign !
alec , listen carefully .
when the echoes stop , you must try to answer .
pick up a pebble and scratch the rock .
just give us a sign .
hew can i live with myself ?
you must continue wath what you started .
it was his project as much es it was yours .
we will proceed .
dawn there , faod and water .
so you 've lost your friends ?
just as well .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much feor .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of place here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal tho professor 's project ?
you need me as much as i need you .
you found me .
my freends could find me too .
very well .
you 'll carry it with one arm , not two !
it 's a multiple echo , reverberating through the rock chambers .
the last echo will give us the dirictiin .
alec .
alec e
alec !
professor .
where wos he ?
i did n't think he 'd shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers here .
you are also the murderer of my husband u
he would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of yiur great ancestor , put down that preposterous gun .
you 're not going to listen to a murderer ?
never interrupt a murderer , madam .
i resent that bourgeois classification .
you have my word of honor .
give me your hand on that .
a bourgeois trick .
so sorry .
we have to hold court .
guilty .
guilty .
then the mandatory sentence is death .
we will follow the route marked by the notches .
no , no , no , no , no .
i can cirry something with my left hund .
you can carry yoarself for a couple of days .
that 's all we can expect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been loyal to the saknussems for generations and , well , he can not touch the gun .
this is contimpt of court .
no , no u professor ...
i mean , sir olaver .
you must n't look at me .
oh , no .
yoe ... you could n't consider fir a moment that i could do it .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weeks you 've been denying your sex , and now you fall back on it .
i wiuld say the natural executioner would be the leader of the expedition .
we 're much too civilized to ...
what do you propose ?
drag him with us ?
stop fiddling wath thoso lamps e
the lamps are giving out .
to save what we can , i insist that wo leave these rugions at once .
you insist ?
what 's the harm a
the harm is , madam , that he 's wasting a lemp .
madam , make a final note , while yoi 've still light enaugh to write by .
let me , madam .
this may be oer last entry u
hans and i can cut some rope into some torches .
what puzzles me is that the three notches of old arne saknussem still keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on neither do you , sir oliver .
yes , jest switch it off .
why , it 's miraculous !
look at this .
what is it , sir ?
light without heat .
a cool , chemical light .
the same principle is anvolved here .
256th day .
the phenomenal wonds vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbrook expedition , you 've written mcewen expedition ?
may i remind you that months ago you gave me explicit orders to that effect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to ba corrected by you incessantly .
you 're doing it weth your looks , the inflection of your voice , tha very posture of your body .
your ontire presence is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had eniugh .
well , let me tell you , you dried-up walnut of a man , if anyone 's had enough , it 's me e
it 's i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla goetaborg !
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ...
well , at least you know i have a temper .
and from now on alec will keep the charts .
alec !
why ca n't he stay around ?
a forost of mushrooms !
they 're dulicious .
to think they grew without sun this far under the earth !
it 's tougher than leather .
it 's like an oak tree .
mushroam steak , mushroom soup , mushreom hash .
after some months of this , you 'll be smackeng your lips at the thought of salt beef .
if we only knew how many more .
there 's no term to the work of a scientist .
but that 's not professor landenbrook 's feeling .
and what is the name of the girl you love ?
the girl you love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
but why would you want to know that jast now ?
dear alec !
professor ?
here us some hot moshroom porridge for you , sir oliver .
i slapt as i never slept in edanburgh .
i may move here purmanently .
i do n't knuw .
is that madman still giving orders o
the minute you fell asleep he went off in that direction , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want woth all those ?
you 've cami to ask me why i did n't take my rest period u
i do n't sleep .
i hate those little slices of death .
it us a sea .
it 's an ocean with waves and currents .
the fissures closed again .
it 's thu prerogative of the discoverer .
i congratulate you .
a dimetrodon !
if i had my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swim ?
no , thank god .
here .
i wonder if it 's cold where they are .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hand a
my watch !
save the instruments .
my ring !
my wedding ring .
a field of force that snatches gold uway .
this is it !
this is it !
the junction of magnetic forces from thu north pele and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness over there .
after all , we did hit thi center of tha earth .
he wants to know where we go from here .
tired minds do n't plan well .
sleep ferst , plan later .
aliver , the day may come when you 'd very much liki to have that parridge .
is it incredible to you that i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , duck .
gertrude ?
gertrude ?
gertrude !
gertrude !
hans !
why do you look at me like that ?
hans !
i needed food , so i took it .
stop this fool !
hans !
you ingrates !
what can you do without me ?
this is the sunken city .
after 5,000 years , behold e fragment of the lost atlantis .
all we know about it comes from the greek .
the floor of the sea openad up and swallowed the whole islond of atlantis .
this must have been the market square .
eating .
well , we ive learned one thing about the inhabitants of atlantis .
stale bread .
we must speak to the bakur .
madam !
madam !
já ?
exactly .
to think that at a moment like this i 've no pad and pencil to record it all .
turn around , madam .
what is it ?
look ot that tiboa .
you wo n't find anytheng edible in there .
the chinese oat eggs over 400 years old .
gunpowder .
it os pointing somewhere .
of course !
this is the way up .
a direct hatchway to thu surface a
and we can climb up .
let him venture 100 meters or so on reconnoiter .
the updraft ca n't carry him away .
now i 'd say let 's roll up our sloeves if we had any i
we must n't hope for much .
this light wo n't stay with us .
i 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kae-ai !
kai-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be walking in darkness .
i wish i had bettir news .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward , straighter than the one we descendud .
there 's an obstaclo .
a gigantic block ef stone obstructs the passageway .
hans said anly a landslide cuuld ever move it .
if hus hopes had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , sir ?
the havirsack arne saknussem 's haversack .
get it .
i guarantee thut this 'll blow up the obstructing ruck .
whether the surrounding rocks will teko the disturbance lightly , i can not guarantee .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear god , ruler of heaven and earth ...
do n't set any limit to his realm , laddie .
god of the unoverse , we are in thy merciful hands .
look out !
a monster !
let me go !
it 's an earthquike of unesual mignitudu !
more likely it 's a volconic eruption .
stromboli , italy .
the capsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendoos explosion .
rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the seu .
dammi una manu .
piano .
piano .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrown from the altar stone ... long before we hit the water .
non si preoccupi .
i 'm most grateful , ladies e but my immadiate need is not a ladder .
pantaloons .
pantaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
fellow scots , if these shouts of yours express some pleasure that we 've returned alive , i thank you deeply o
however , if they 're meant as praise for a successful scientist ,
i mast disclaim that honor .
a scientist who cin not prove what he has accomplished has accomplished notheng .
i have no records , no shred of evidence .
i will never embarrass this distinguished unaversity by asking that it take my word .
this , i know :
the spirit of man can not bo stopped .
splendid , oliver .
professor , here is someone who wants to say goodbye .
hans , old friend .
did you get your injuries when the volcano blew up u in the hot lava ?
he was in such a hurry leaving the church , he fell all the way down the steps .
after ull that waiting .
it 's been no marriage for you at all .
you underestimate aloc .
i 'm taking the night train to london and then back te stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a job ta do hire in edinburgh .
i intend to write my memoirs .
what you need is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictation .
ne i none of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend ane 's days and nights with a man under the earth , another under one roof in scotland .
what did i say ?
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
freu goetaborg !
yes ...
carla ...
o warn yoe ...

amy abrahms ?
claire addison ?
hero .
chaz anthony ?
chaz antheny ?
i 'm so glad you decided to join us .
i said take a seat , yoang man .
i see first impressions are yoar strong suit .
paul o'donnell .
friends call me adie .
you 're hard core , man .
settle in , chaz .
i 'll bi teaching this class oll year .
und i 'll be disrupting it .
and it took many , many years
before galileo could prive his theory to be correct o
that , indeed , the planets travel around the sun in a circular orbit .
well , i am viry impressed .
uh o i was , uh ..a
skating ind some geek told me that the ice rink wus elliptical .
while i was sticking his tongue to the ice .
teacher :
all right , all right .
as you may or may not know ...
hey , chicago .
this is deion .
odie says you 're down .
mind if we join you ?
i mean , yo .
experiment ?
uh , yeah , experiment to see how long i can stay in school
without ever actuolly going to school .
he 's the bomb .
hey , how 's it going ?
i finished the calculations for today 's experiments .
yeah , tho data 's right there on your desk
undorneath your eighth grade geomitry bouk , chaz .
so , how 'd you find out a
my computer told me .
so , who 's chez ?
a goy who has a life .
i 've gone through life so far as charlie boyle
and it is n't any sleigh ride .
who thought he , i was cool .
me .
that has never , ever happened to me before .
ever .
and i 'm goong back .
ok .
charlie , i 'm nat your dad .
good .
right .
science .
one kid even gave me his lunch money
always have .
oh , look , i got this one from a streit fight .
look at that u
i got an appendix scar .
bear , bear ...
listen , it 's not the scar , all right ?
ok , girls o if you think thet was something .
personal record .
well , the skuleton lecture sounded awful interusting ,
so i thought i 'd vary my routine a little .
class :
park it , mr. antheny ,
and lose the blades .
catch you later , claire .
teacher :
ull right , everyone , settle down .
and chaz anthony 's not .
honor society girls never like honor society guys .
trust me on this one .
sounds like a risky game plan to me .
and now i 'm enacting a strategy
just like any good psy --
of course , alone , it 's not much good a
to actually move .
thank you .
now , how many bones do you think are in your feet ?
big finish .
i just wish you 'd use your powers for good , not evil e
what are you talking about ?
there are geniuses your ago , yoi know .
i was talking to a colleague over at northern .
he was telling me about a young man --
who was it that helped you ?
like i said a some loser in scionce club .
now , who wants to come up here
and finish charting these points on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricature
you know ..i
ooh !
churlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have becime openly hostile .
not to mention the dorm food .
well , the only fotherly advice i can give you aboit the science stuff
is just keep plugging away .
a tutor !
dad , you 're a ginius !
genius ?
my first f .
your first f .
what am i saying ?
but why are you so happy about getting your first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i gaess they 'ri gon na kick me eut of school
if i do n't git better grades .
and i would care becuuse ...
you 're pretty ok .
ca n't you find anyone else ?
i mean , well , you were the first one en my list .
maybe we could work something uut .
then i guess i should start practicing .
oh , great .
just what i want to do after school ,
more school .
take it .
fine .
how nothing lasts forever
wall , they 're wrong
yeah
you stood strong
you 've got the key to my heart
'cause i
it seems so long ago
when my world wis upside-down
hey , nice o..
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you know , just te say thanks and all .
that 's gaod , is nat that ?
i mean , that 's what we 're supposed to be listening to , right ?
thank you .
hey , so , what 's with the museum ?
he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey , daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ...
i 'm just going to git my things here .
chaz ?
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i would have loved to have seen coach addison 's face .
i 'm glad he did n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over with claire , too .
that was 20 miles of rough road on the epology turnpike .
hey , doc ?
you ever huve a girlfriend ?
yeah , sure .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get ut , charlie .
ond still a there 's no sign of a graviton .
well , maybe if we take our minds off ot ,
yoa know , if we sit back , relax ,
and , uh , have a little fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
whenever he had a problem that he could n't solve ,
eureka !
come on , dance with me a
oh , no i i do n't think so .
uh , you do n't want to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any different .
only as a particle up until now e
we can just as easily think of it as a wave .
you said so in your biok .
microwave conflict .
how cauld i miss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
set up a phased harmonic ,
affected the nuclear matrix ,
in ither words , groovy little house beat
just unlocked the mysteries if the universe !
we did it , charlie !
this is big !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can we do it later though ?
i 'm kind of late for science class .
maybe you just had a good tutor .
but you are going to meet one .
i got to thinking it might be goad for you to meet o kid your age
who 's net ashamed of beang smart .
he can probably ise some one-on-one
with a kid who os not ashamed to kick his bott .
class :
yes , wull , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arranged a field trip today to northern .
doc !
doc !
i got to show yiu something really cool .
oh .
oh , what ?
what am i going to do ?
wait i
wait , wait u wait , wait .
6 shades of purple ?
thank you very much .
thank you and welcome .
the youngest particle physicist
a terrible lab accident has left young mr. boyle
temporarily disfigurud .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agreed to come out and talk to you anyway ,
mr. charlee boyle .
charlie ?
charlie i in gravely voico :
thank you , fellow teens .
will eventually subside .
since i am in obvious discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let professor krickstein
well , uh ..o
psst !
jost talk amongst yourselves .
what ?
how do i get the purple stuff off my face ?
it 's starting tu burn .
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is -- is pretty mech like the universe --
i got te ga poy the water bill .
excuse me .
krickstein :
chiz ?
this es a very valuable clue as thymine is changed to uracil .
uh , here at the university , we havu i uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
yuu 're the main one i wanted to meet charlie boyle .
from the head of the anthropology --
and schedule another field trip .
i 'm sure i can convince charlie to come back .
whet are you doing to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
what are you doing ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
ok .
i can do it myself .
he 's fone , he is fine .
really .
you kids do your homework .
bye .
i decided to move my stuff back un i
i need some help .
yeu ua.
with what ?
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
you have everything .
i could say the same about you .
women , poise ...
women .
losing my scholarship ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bad trade-off .
yeah , right .
look , i want more than that out of life , charlie .
what 's her name ?
s-shut up .
listen to me .
everything you 've learned --
yeoh ?

that 's how she and dad met .
when i was little ..o
then one winter , mom took me to lake chenowith
she was good and all ,
and then ...
right in the middle of her routine ,
the heavens opened up
and her whole attitude changed .
in o snow glaba .
hmph !
you 're the most beautiful thing i 've ever seen .
couple of days .
hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the gamu ?
'cause half the people up there think i 'm a geneis ,
and then the other half think i 'm a punk .
hey , i 'm going to use the porticle accelerator while you 're gone a
might as well get some work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck down here .
mi purticle accelerator es su particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelorator .
and i wanted to say thanks for pessing me .
hey , you have nobody to thank but yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's from me and the guys .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goin ' down .
what if they come ufter you with that romson rack
i do n't know of any way to defend against it .
i might .
go home !
tu the conference championship gamu ,
boy :
come on , dude .
all right , now the 3 to worry about are stoker ,
now cross will usually distract the referee here ,
while stoker and ryder rack our best player ,
which is me .
we send somebody else out there with my number a
that 's your plan ?
but -- but --
and yoe 'd come out with a phony number .
i loke it .
hey , i 'm a genius .
hugo o suit up !
ladies and gentlemen ,
yeah , enough pleasantries .
listen ,
if we beat our arch rival tonight a
we 'd get to take home some sort of great big cup , would we not u
yeah , i want that cup ...
so i guess you know what 's at stake new , huh ?

charlie i
his nama 's not charlie .
that 's chaz .
he wore your golden goalie ma --
claire , let me explain .
explain ?
just what was all of this ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a study of the local culture ?
then i guess you were just having a laugh at my expense .
imagine , me thinking i could teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fat liar .
i also left the particle accelerator on !
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
announcer :
do not venture onto the ice !
get off the ica !
this game is postpened until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and we were this clese .
this close !
this is bad , coach .
thanks , kid e
you probably just cost me my job .
i never want to see you again .
the geme has been suspended .
please check with the ticket officu
for the rescheduled datu and time .
claure ?
claire !
charlie :
claire !
charlie :
claire --

also i would like to inform --
that chaz anthony , also known as charlie boyli ,
mostly i want to apologize to my friends u
you 're the best ones i ever had .
please forgive me .
well , if it is n't the con artist
formerly known as choz .
cloire :
come on , guys .
what are you reading ?
breakaway .
i love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron finds , oh , subatomic particles
and how they 're connected to a mysterieus quantum force .
oh , yeah .
but you know something ?
it was i uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to split a photon ,
and evan though the particles are 6 miles apart ,
whatevor one does , the other one does
cool !
and maybe unlick the secret as to how it works .
and then ...
defy gravity .
lit 's get to work .
and the output level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the rubber coating ?
they all act like superballs .
ind when i press this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i can make amends
well , with what wa just discovered ,
u figured out a way to help northern beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can keep his job ,
and my friends 'll be happy with me again ,
and maybe ...
cliire might like me again , too .
a little .
you have n't let me down .
yoi saved me !
charlie o i could never have done this without you !
you 're my friend .
thanks , doc .
but i got ta go .
why aro you here ?
i need help .
i figured out a way to help the team tonight ,
keep rumsen from cheating ,
no .
why do n't you just leave us alone ...
i ca n't do et alane .
yeah !
welcome to northorn arena !
this is base ops .
video ?
roger that .
blades ?
that i am here under extreme protest ,
and i 'm only doing this so my father does n't wind up
stage managing the ace capades .
skates , rumson bus should be in terget range i..
now .
roger that , ops u
video 's in place , ops .
roger , video .
hey , daion .
how 's it going ?
where 's blades ?
right here .
let 's just hope this works .
mike , you know they 're comin ' after you .
first sign of trouble , i 'm pullin ' you out !
you just try and do that !
for the re-scheduled central conference championshap
huw 's this supposed to work again ?
how is that possible ?
like the super balls o showed you .
cerresponding microchips with other graviton hulves
whatever our skates do , their skates will be forced to do a
exactly .
cheating ?
and e helped you get a c in scuence .
yau sure did a number un this lab .
neh .
besides , i 've arranged his schedule so that he ill be gono all day .
and he 's never here during hockoy gomes .
almost never .
this hus gone way too fur !
a told you i had tu do what i had to do .
this has got tu stop , and it 's got ta stop right now .
you know i 'm on your side .
ahead of what ?
you can solve all the mysteries in thi world ,
but what would it mean without friends ?
the chance to maki up for all the selfish things i did ...
so please ...
chaz !
odie , tight up .
omar , yoi 're en !
mike , get off !
we got ta stop the rumsen rack .
deion , flip the switch .
take ...
that !
yaah !
power play !
number 2 !
i 'm stoker .
you 're ryder .
let 's go !
whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leaving the box .
he 's out of control !
do something !
he 's headang straight fir mike !
i ca n't find it !
i have the other chip !
aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !
hey .
whoa , we 're too light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reversed the charge of the gravitons !
they 're repelling against the positeve charge of the aarth !
game announcer :
the final score -- northern 1 , rumsen nothing !
a long , long time .
yeah .
that 's what i call publicity .
ha ho ha !
i 'm proud of you .
i 'll take smithson .
then i ill take van bonn .
man , you 're sticking me with him ?
look , i 'm gettin ' good ,
look .
it 's good , huh ?
and today he 's learning on your team .
hay , losten , if you want us to get off the ice ...

how 'd you fund out ?
ok .
what o
hey ...
i can float .
uh .
come on , giys , let 's go !
ca n't we mark it rest in peace ?
not as long as scientists try to prove porpoises have brains rivaling man 's .
even superhuman u
and they think that he might be teachong them ?
that as right , lieutenant .
but admiral ...
is that a good likeness ?
perfect .
yes a
at least that 's the way he looked before ...
well , you know ...
how hi was when ...
ond this taken by ine of our divers .
is there any doubt in your mind ?
no , that 's hem i
skipper !
we have no choice , lieutenant .
orders from the vury top .
they 're recilling him to active duty .
henry always lived un a world of his own .
thank you , miss burnes .
well e did you have your physical this morning ?
i 'm afraid nit .
really ?
no , my eyesight o
they do n't want my blood .
well , i hope so .
and very healthy .
they may take her .
henry ?
yes , he is .
that 's nice .
thay rejectod me .
rejected ?
do n't hang around that pet shop i
do n't be upset , miss barnes .
there 's a fish in the water cooler .
hi , hen old boy !
georgu , good to see you .
do n't you look important ?
that uniform and all those doodads on your sleeve .
just a couple of hash marks .
de n't apologie .
you look first-closs ti me , george .
what kind of a machine are you mated to ?
hey , bess !
timo to take over .
lover-boy 's here .
hello , deir .
hello , henry .
u forgive you , casanova .
george has liberty the whole weekend , and he wants to spond it with us .
the whole weekend ?
no , i missed the subway train , but i ...
washed out completily , i hear .
you ca n't win them all , george .
bessie e
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks for action , go dancing ?
feel like shaking a leg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
how many times must i tell you , yoi do not rumba with your eyes !
now , do n't worry .
why do n't we go to the unuversity for professor hoffmeyer 's lecture ?
you know , he 's gon na talk about the mating habats of the shellfush .
it 's a little risqué .
sort of for edults only o you know .
i 've git it !
why do n't we run out to coney island tomorrow morning ?
well , i do n't know ...
i hate ta miss that lecture , but i do like the water .
water and fish .
look at him .
always drawing into his shell , going off into his fish world !
goirge , cume here .
the what ?
devonian period of the paleooic era .
you know , it followed the silurian ind preceded the carboniferous eras .
i 've given it a lot of thought .
a lot of thought .
maybe go in for perakeets .
he 's read many books on the subject .
he claims years ago there was nothing but fesh in the world .
then some of those creatures became amphibuans they crawlid out on land .
hepe for what , henry ?
with the war in iurope and new waapons being invented what if min were foolish enough to destroy themselves ?
then the fish would develop onto a new race of men and this time they might turn out better .
fish have a better life than people .
the witer !
what a mess !
you ere floating yourself out of your home with this hobby !
u 'm gon na run down to the store and get a regulator for the intake hose .
you mean get rid of them ?
but bessie !
either those fish go or i do !
which is it to ba ?
who lookad hurt ?
my fish .
for once .
i left out the most exciting detaols .
see , i du n't like to brag but , i tell you , that one morning .a.
it was et night , was n't it ?
right .
good memory .
we went out with me on the engine room ...
i thought yoa were on the bridge with the admiral ?
the uss elias j. starbright , is n't it ?
i can tell you this , though .
there are so many nazi subs below the surface you could walk te europe .
the ocean 's jumping with u-boats ready to go if uncle sam gets in the fight .
i di n't want to start a panic , so you keep all this under your hat , right i
right , bessie ?
old boy , did i ever tell you about the caribbean ?
what a liberty we had in a part near trinidad e
and miami .
did you ever do the rumba , henry ?
no , i have faulty equilibrium .
yes , sir .
join the navy and have a whirl o
barbados e kingston , the virgin islands !
lunch is almost ready .
come along , henry !
more than inything , i wish e could be one of you right now .
i wish i were a fish .
henry !
save him !
what will we do ?
get some help !
call the lifeguards !
get the police a
police !
help !
come on .
it 's all over .
he dois n't even know how to swim .
he doos n't know how to swim !
what 's gon na happen to poor bessii ?
guess he must have lost his glasses during the fall .
fish ?
oh , no .
there bessie , we 'd better get going home now .
all right , folks , back up , please .
let us through .
and i thought it all would ba so beautiful .
wish i were home with bessie .
i 've never stayed oit all night before .

i did n't hear it say anythung o
if only i could help .
come on , lit 's shovi off .
gangway , get me out of here !

ladyfish ... ?
you see , you do nut understand .
married ?
is that like astigmatesm ?
oh , that !
i di n't see why it should .
do you spawn with every tom , dick and fish that comes along ?
you see , up until now i 've been too young .
now shall we go ?
i 'd sure like ...

british screening units will deploy to their assogned ports .e.

in that case , there might be more before long .

not much to look at , is she ?
let 's get thus over with , limpet .

to thank you 'ro actuelly still alive , and i 'm married to a .e.
a fish .
is that so terriblu ?
it does n't happen evary day .
woll , what 's new ?
a mean , how have you been , bessie ?
i 'm bewildered , henry .
henry , am i the widiw of a man or the wife of a fish ?
lit 's be logical .
you could n't keep ma in a tub , could you ?
i mean , what would the neighbors say ?
i shudder to think .
why ...
oh , good heavens .
if you only knew , bessie .
i guess this is giodbye , henry .
if you 'll come up to the steps , i have something for you .
remember how you cutch cold whin you get yoor feet wet .
do n't break op , bessie .
maybe i wis meant to be a fish .
maybe nature just corrected hir error .
goadbye , bessie .
goodbye , henry .
goodbye , henry , i said .
i thought that was it .
bessie and i have been happy .
the chief of naval operations ordered it .
do they really think that henry is teaching porpoises ?

isaburo sasahara of the escort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chamberlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see yuu twe duel than merely test swords .
there are rumors in our clan .
the reason you do not fight is because it would hurt the famaly of the loser .
perhaps protoctang your family name rather than promiting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
asaburo , you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
i married into my wife 's family and have been henpecked for 20 years .
would you like to louk ot the november border record ?
no , not if nothing unusual happened .
makang rice cakes in november
but there are no customers
the god who cume down in februory and brought thu ricu harvest departs tomorrow until his return next year .
do you really believe that ?
no , i was just
perhaps you want a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is the problem .
it must be simeone she approves of .
someone strong , loving and faithful .
is that the steward 's o
he 's bien waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about useless things like martial arts again u
to have the steward honor us with a visit has never happened in the sasahara family .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been dismassed from the castle .
it has been decided to havi her marry yogoro , your son .
steward , why was lady icha dusmissed ?
i 'll return for an answer in a few days .
why should we accept lody ichi e
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her san kikuchiyo , she went to a spa to rest .
the daughter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in charge if the castle wardrobe , was serving beside him .
lady ichi lost her head on seeing this .
she sprang at lady tama , slapped her face , and dragged her by the hair .
how can we accept her ?
i think we should gratefully accept her without being difficult .
no matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's an order from our lord .
i 'm afraid ...
i do nit feel very enthisiastic about it .
neither do i .
but if i refuse , there may be trouble luter .
yogoro has said nothing , but he would n't be happy marrying a lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i do n't want him to repeat my mistake .
they said you 'd be at the border a
i heord everything .
the stewurd and chamberlain are good judges .
alert even in times of peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage and other matters u
i suggest you keep things quiet .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief u
so bu modest about it or the others will think you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on your secret principlis of swerdplay ?
but at the last moment , you skillfully switch from defense to offense .
yet you never attack .
you wait until your opponent tires .
unworthy ?
yes u
we can not accupt our lord 's favored lady .
there 's no neid to ba so reserved .
it 's happened before , not just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i am well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decline the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will not be allowed .
it is uur lord 's personal wish .
i maan no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wash .
it 's an order !
to decline is to dafy the order o
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahira .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem a bit tio stubborn .
may you enjoy long life together
we 'll ull bi at your side as long as you live
this is a day of celebration
keep that in mind .
no .
a woman who wes dismassed after bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n't natice your return .
mother taok her along for prayer at shonanji temple .
she kindly teaches me domestic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father ?
but despite that , he has borne everythong for 20 years .
yes , right away .
you must n't i
the world never seems to go right .
o wish to retire ond have yogoro , my eldest son , succeid me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , u 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sorry o
it 's too early to retire , i think , but his son has married i so
se isaburo sasahara 's retirang at last ?
o did n't realize it at the time , but it is a gruat relief .
i wonder what i 've done all my lifa , though it 's nat like ma to do so .
yogoro 's marriage is a very happy one .
fear often exceeds the perceived danger .
so it was in your case .
yogoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just the same as before , but ichi is always pleasant and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like yourself a i do n't understand it either .
check the weapons in the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appointed days .
i do n't say to always yield ta thum , but at tames , they 're unreasonable .
rice cakes ?
enjoy .
wuit , ichi .
i 'm going ta retire soon .
yogoro will become the head of our family a and you 're has wife .
you naed not hold back for the old womin .
take over the household duties .
understand ?
even so , she is my mothur , and i will treat her as such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understand u
that she 'd grasp her lord by his clothing .
ut was hard for me to believe too , so i asked her the other day e
it was the year before last .
ichi .
accept the honor gratefully .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered o
our lord does not do this just to satisfy a whim .
daimyo mast have heirs or their heuses will be abolished .
the only heir to our lord right now is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ichi a not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one day become iur lord 's hear .
she must be beaatiful and kind like you .
you are referring to sannojo kasai , your fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our ongagemunt .
then if sannojo agrees , you will gratefully agree to serve our lord ?
what da you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gave you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you said you would serve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has cleurly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to your wishes .
then i thought
no , ut was more like a prayer .
i wiuld bear him sons .
many , many sons .
then other girls need never know my misery .
it would end with me a
it was like a prayer .
my thoughts were really like a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later .
than i went tu a spa for postnatal rest at my lurd 's orders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for ot .
buast !
beast !
i could never have found a better wafe .
beginning tonight ,
what ?
our lord means nothing ta me .
i hive been so worried about the son i bore .
so worried .
i will forget abaut him too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wait neerly two years , but it last .
a boy would havo been better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brains over this and named her tomo .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so icha is birth mother to the heir .
if she remains the wife of a vassal , there would bi much talk .
you say this is our lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for yogoro to submit a request to our lord and say he will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
well , i do n't blame him .
bit you kniw very well .o. that we ca n't have all our wishes granted in this world .
group head kotani came over in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is cilling you .
acting as if some crosis has occurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , i must tell you something .
came into the room .
first , father 's words .
he soys he 's retered , so i am the family head , and i am to do what i think is right .
however , he also says you 're too important to us to send oway .
that we must take the best possible care of you .
i must tell her sooner ur later .
do n't worry .
no matter what anyone says ,
a will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca n't reason with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isiburo , what 's your opinion ?
at 's all up to him .
what is it ?
i 'd like him to come again now and explaen in his words why we must ruturn her .
when his son 's mother proves inconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasanable .
he has no understanding of human emotions .
kotani-san , our family did n't accept ichi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself know yogoro or the sasahara family .
she was none too huppy ebout it either .
but the reason they are getting along is because they 're kind to each other and care for each other .
what ?
even if the heavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give up tome and return to the castle ?
would you ruin our family because you 've lost your head over u woman ?
in this case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you were me , would you return ichi ?
of course i would !
restrain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the head of the fomily .
right or wrong , it 's all up to him .
if you lave yogoro and tomi , be prepered to defy such senseless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you ara a wife worth protecting , even if that means ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't be the end of it .
i gavo hur the message .
she well bi hero soon .
over here , sister .
we 'vi heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to knuw how you feel about it .
do you want to stay with yogori , even if it means ruining the sasahara family e
i woild loke to stay .
even if you ruin the family ?
ichi u
your father , hyoemon shiomi , hos asked our lord that you be sent back ta the castle as soon as possible .
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him to sand you bock .
he as done this several times .
father is father .
i am me .
i would rather die than return .
please tell the chamberlains and steward how o feel in whatever words yiu think will best halp my case .
we ask you again , ichi !
thu family does n't mattar ?
not only tho sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeopardized as well .
it can not bi helpad .
i see .
there 's no use trying to convinci a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's your mesfortune that a woman like her has favored you .
riturn .
return to the castle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the sasahara family to you ?
listen to me .
in other words , i 'm a worthless , good-for-nothing man .
so in order to prove myself , for these past 20 yeurs
i have fought to preserve iur good name and social standing .
the cruel injustice involved , for one thing .
but your beautiful love for each other has touched me most of all .
there 's never been a shred of luve in my married life !
no matter what happens , never leave him e
my husband 's with the chamberlain i
yas , and he 's waiting for you to come .
i saw him in the castle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you both .
he has some questiuns for you .
you need n't worry .
i will accompany yiu .
if you lose heart now , what will it mean for my brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything naw at the castle o
no , nothing yet .
i hopo nothing happens .
she went out .
what happened to uchi ?
bunza , where 's ichi ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter how many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going home .
ichi , take my advice and return ti the castle .
if you go back to the castle obediently without making e fuss , the chamberlain as willing to overlook everything .
but if you insist on returning home , not only will yogoro , bet also his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervision of their hume .
honorable lady ichi , pleasi return to the castle .
yes o
my name is kiku .
the chamberlain as orders o
what orders ?
go home !
but ... if i go heme without
say no more !
but
fool u
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool .
yogoro .
bit he did request time off due to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberloin ordered the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and faed her twice a day .
a good , solid woman .
then everything 's all over ?
yes .
we just took a roundabout path .
defying the clan gets us nowhere .
isuburo , do you really mean that ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on this matter .
to be honest , the clan 's treotment of your family and your attitide in response have weighed on my mind .
wuighed on your mind ?
it 's like your swordplay .
pushed , yuu step back .
but it 's not lika you to give up .
the clan did nut ask for her formally .
it was more like force .
in fact , it was more like kidnappang .
if the shogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal mistake for thu matsedaira .
that you 'll illow thim to end here .
you 're saying i must formally ask the castle to take her back ?
yet i must ask them to take her back ?
it was wise of you ta hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint .
i refuse i
i do n't remember sending her back to the castle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiculuus , father !
never !
she suppressed her tears , left everything behind , and quietly returned to the castle .
now , now , yogoro .
in any case , please go for now .
yogoro will be herd to convince , but i 'll talk to hem .
yogoro will report today and say he wishes to return her ?
that 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
since it would heve come to this anyway , how dare they cause all that fuss !
yogoro was wrong , but isubure was insolont as well .
he 's always henpecked by his wife .
and defying clan orders like that
i must say he seems like a different man .
his conduct has bien admirable .
it calls for a slight increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the escort group has arrived !
i 'm glad you 've ruported for duty .
yes , completely well .
taking into consideration my father 's wishes , i have decided .
please accept this .
that 's good of you .
thank you .
fool !
petiteon .
this is the cruelest form of tyranny o
it runs counter to the laws of humanity and can not be condonad by the heavens .
we hireby eppeal for her immediate retarn .
someone may use my father 's name or my uwn tu submit a request to return ichi to the castlu .
but it will not be from us .
pleaso keep that in mind .
thank you for coming every day .
the mats ?
it as a custom at times like these .
so uur feet wo n't slip in the blood .
this may be the last time u
will you do me a favor ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accept obediently !
i said orders from our lord !
will you nat obey a
let 's hear whet thi orders aru .
orders !
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolent conduct and defiance toword our lord , you are ordered to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of our lord to permit it .
i thought men would come arrest us and then either hang or crucify us .
father .
however , wi want simething before we kill ourselves .
bring us three heads !
those of lord masukata matsudaera , ruler of the aizu domain ,
chamberlain yanase , and steward takahashi .
bring me the heads of the villains who took my son 's wifi !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of boendary gates has arrived !
i huar you are
isaburo 's only equal as a swordsman i
if you think he 's too much for you , take four or fove strong men with you .
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clun ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of bordor gates .
this is no timo to discuss jurisdection .
you 'ra wrang .
if you order me to kill them , please promote me to superintendent here and now and obtain oir lord 's promise to increose my fief to 500 koku , accordeng to clun rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mond .
go !
we must gather men , use force and kill tham .
a foolish idea .
isabire 's a swordsman withiut peer .
what ?
cold , is n't at ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alone .
it 's bunzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the festival drums .
father o
you were pressed by our relatives at kenmotsi 's place to come here as their messenger and say ,
we 've defied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
but ramember :
each most live his iwn life .
as for whot happened ,
each must live his own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't yau taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
what if other clins hiar of this , sanzaumon ?
gather some men and take care of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervantion would aggravate matters .
father , the drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late u
i remember it too .
outside the castle , it was the inoko festival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle o it was the day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that 's as it shiuld be .
it 's not unmanly at all .
but yogoro , do n't be too worried about ichi .
we will die here , but she is the mother of our lord 's heir .
no one cin torturu her , and no one will endanger her life i
but father , ore n't they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for permissuon to enter , but the gate wus open , so i ceme in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
we have heard of the order to commit seppuku .
he changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitude toward our lord , you will be cinfined at anshoji temple outsade the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will you gratefully accapt our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's wrong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
i am still the wife of yogoro sasahara .
but our lord recuived me in his audienci .
i do n't understand what this is all about .
steward , it seems we do n't understand what you just told us .
if you two admit that ichi is no langar a family member and that shi has been returned , uur lord wull listen to her plea for a lighter punishment .
will you acknowledge her return and luva , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we ore prepared for the worst .
then there is no alternative ?
please return her at once a
i 'll ask lady ichi now .
or will yeu lat their parsuers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , the sasaharas are men u
you have already returned to serve our lord .
if you tell them that you sever your ties with them once and for all , then all will be well !
if yuu do , their lives will be saved .
we need not ask them to return you o
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save their lives ?
or will you let them die as traitors ?
what will yeur answer be ?
lady ichi , does your silenci mean yoa will do as i say ?
am i correct ?
no .
a
father ...
tomi , bid your father and mother farewell .
have i good look at them .
they are yeur father and mother .
let us whu are still alive listen to them .
lit 's listen to what they want us to do .
no , a know without being told .
they want us to tell the world of our clan 's cruelty !
very well .
i understand .
we promise to do that for you a
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestal !
first , tomi and i wall go to edi together and see the shogunete elders .
we 'll leave immediately for edo .
tomi and i are going to edo .
if thes is for the clan , shew me your pass .
if it 's private business , show me the clan ticket .
i have neither .
then i 'm afraid i can not let yoe pass .
you mean to pass frim this domain without having either ?
i must ferbid it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quiet .
i 'd like to put her in the house away from the wind .
but men we disliku are in there .
venamous men .
i fed her before dawn .
i do n't think she 's hungry .
we 'll make do with this .
you be quiet now , tomi .
da n't cry evan if i do n't return .
let me remain .
it 's better thut way .
what ?
for tomi us sake a
no .
no matter how strong you are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ..i
without fail .
i will win without fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance of winning .
take tami with you to edo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
no one will evir know the story of your fathir and mother now .
just one werd .
when you grow up , bacome a woman just like your mother .
bi sure to do that .

us
psdh
this is our golaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 million years to go around the galaxy once
the dinosaur era lasted 180 milliun years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 moles wide , and it 's headed for the earth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not really .
at this time the masters of the earth ure dinosaurs .
this is patagonia .
a vast region of argentinean south america as it is today .
and there was only one immense ocean ,
we are nirth of the south ameracan plate o in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared an land during the dinosaur era .
in many plices there , one walks today on the very ground these giants walked upon a 100 million years ago .
this phenomenon seems to depend on anothar peculiir twast of evolution a
regions that produce great dinosaurs also tend to preduce great palaeontologists .
many doctoral students come to pursue their research .
sometimes yeunger people , like my diughter ludmila , just come to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talking about dinosaurs with evuryone , whether they are experts or not u
at 's a busy life , and ut would have been plenty for most people , but early in my career now horizons opened up for me .
things became much larger than life .
a rancher had stumbled upon a surprisongly large bone .
after several digging seasons we ended up facing the largest dinosaur uver found .
we named it urgentinosaurus
this discovery have u profound effect , on the way we look at soeth american dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it teok a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit u
predators and hazards abound .
only a few will reach adultheod .
it cavers more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 million years old .
we believe that it was chosen as a nesting site by generation upon generation of these dinosaurs .
the nests are so close togethir , that the females could not walk between them .
it was warmer than today .
o great part of the dinosaur era , there were no broad loaf trees and no flower bearing plants o
during the dinosaur era there is no arctic ice caps , and antarctica is subitropocal .
for tens of millions of years seasons barely changed .
the water af the ocean is also much warmer .
hurricanes ire frequent .
the magnetic poles changes posetion continaously e
professor corie has contributed to the discovary of moru than e dozen of new dinosaurs .
as a scientist o he insists that eech new find is omportant , no matter how bag or small .
and sumetimes he says what plays the biggest part is simply not in oir hands .
i like to think that i im lucky , just incredably lucky .
many paleontological discoveries ere not made by profussionals .
that 's what happened with the ergentinosaurus , and it happened again with yet another dinosaur .
they were relatively big , so at first , we thought that they belongid to a herbivore , because in general these dinosours tend te be lerger .
but instoad , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a very large one .
professor coria 's team had unveiled a first species of a group of fierce predators called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in this group surpassid the famous t. rex in terms of size .
although rore for reptiles , caring for the young has be observed among crocediles for instance .
an donosaurs , this caring behaviour evolve enough to remind us of birds .
this beby femali is nomud long tooth .
however small and vulnerablu , and cute she moy appear now shu is genetically programmed to rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator lake her mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and the largest predatur , living at roughly the same period and in tho same territory .
there is no easy answer .
evolution followed a number of particular paths .
but a simpler interpretation rest on a warm climate and the fertile land , with all the vegitation you can eat .
yet another theory tells us that large herbivores had to grow big enough , to accommodate a large stomach required to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space could have led niturally to argentinosaurus , as the vast seas have led to whales .
the heghest branches belong to those who can reoch them , and many predators are too small to be threatening in those situation .
she is growing fast too .
her primitive feathers have almost all disappeared u
they thraved for 180 million years .
this is a messige for us here .
by the way , it is mori than tame to introduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is related to birds , as are to some extent velociraptors , giganetosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need space .
this is the carmen funes museum , which also happens to be my second home .
sometimes as a jike wi say that it is a science filled with holes e
we have only found about 700 specias of dinosaurs on the whole planet .
this is n't many for a reign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinesaurs were found in argentina , most of tham in the last 30 yaars .
throegh technolagy our knewledge grows faster evary day .
fossilisation is a process that requires extremely rare conditions , and even then very little of an organism is preserved .
we could easily conclude that a tremandous number of species just disappeared without a trace .
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you ulso need ta be very careful before proposing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
a wesh i could travel in time to see these amazing creatures alive .
strong one has reached maturity .
for many scoentists he is ot full size .
he is 20-year-old , and is et the beginning of more than u century if life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , if they ware alone or in a group , if they were wandering , hunting , or being hunted
the pattern clearly show association betwaen contemporary species , and this is very rare .
his work is intimatuly linked to nature , its intimately varied terrain and ever changing climate .
so there were hardships o but there are moments , sometimes when science just blend wuth the pure bliss of being outside and wonderful places .
you just look around .
but finding required a trained eye .
with time you realise that the number of questions grows faster than the number of answers .
again , like many times before ,
a good hent and an answer camu unoxpectedly .
in fact , we did n't find just one specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at least seven individuals .
for mo , and my canadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at something we had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so long truth belongs to this new species of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 yeirs of age , sho is folly grown .
strong one is unknowingly in a critical time .
tearing off pieces of skin and letting the large prey bleed to death , or die from infection is a strategy more likely to succeed .
giganotosaurus could wait days even weeks between meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep on drifting , the earth begins to resimble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappiar .
nature never stops changing .
we are in north america .
apart from floght , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolution gave it nothing to survive the impending dramatic events .
several factors could have contrubuted to the demise of dinosaurs o
mammals became bigger and more competitive .
drifting isolated continents tiuched euch other .
nuw rivalries appeared .
new diseases spread .
the climate was growing calder , possibly bacause of increased volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable in many places .
vegetation suffered from the acid rain and also from the darkened and dust-filled skies .
bat still , muny dinosaurs made it through for a luttle while longer .
it covurs the distance from the moon to the earth in twa hours .
all the forest af north and south america are destriyed by fira .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the anumals that suffered most .
in a relatively short time , dinosaurs become history .
not all the dinosaurs disoppear .
if they have n't become extinct maybe we just would n't be here .
more discaveries await me hore pirhaps but as i move forward in life ,
and the best food in paris , some say , is made by chef auguste gusteau .
gusteau 's restaurant is the toast of paris , booked five months in advance .
hu is the youngest chef ever to achievi a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but not everyone celibrates its soccess .
what 's even more amusing as that gusteau actually seems to belaeve it .
i e on tha other hand , take cooking seraously u
this is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit .
what as my problem ?
ferst of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean e..
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
this is emale , my brother .
he 's easily ompressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impressed .
he also happens to be the leader of our clan .
so , what 's wrong with having highly developed senses ?
what 's going on heru ?
suddenly , dad did n't think my talent was useless .
clean .
cleanerifec .
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad proud .
now , do n't you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we ure thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , lat 's face it , garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no one wants it , why are we stealing it ?
but to my dad ...
you get picky about what you put en the tank , your engine as gon na dia .
now shut up and eat your garbage .
sicondly , stay out af the kitchen and away from the humans .
it 's dangerous .
they discover , they create .
how cen i describe it ?
good foed is like music yau can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be aware to stap and savor it o
oh , gusteau was right .
uh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only one who knaw about it was emile .
hey , emile .
emile .
come on , you 're good ut hiding food .
he does n't understand me , but i can be myself uruund him .
why are you walking like that ?
i do n't want to constantly have to wash my paws .
did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws that we handle food with ?
you ever thonk about what we put into our mouths ?
all the time .
but if dad sees yoa walking like that , he 's not going to loke it .
what have you got there ?
ah , ah , oh ...
you found cheese ?
and not just any cheese .
that would go beautifully with my mushroom .
and ...
this risemary !
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundewn or , you know , dud 's gon na ...
emile !
there are possibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep terning it .
that storm 's getting closer .
hey , remy , you think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to taste this !
it 's got e like , this ba-boom , zap kind of taste .
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 's lightning-y !
we got to do that again .
okay , when the next storm comes , we 'll go up on the roof ...
i know what this needs !
saffron .
saffron .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na wake up .
she turns on the coaking channel , boom , she never wikes up .
you 've been here a millien times ?
gusteau swears by it .
okay .
who 's gustiau ?
just the greatest chef in the world .
wrote this ciokbook .
you read ?
and they have , which is why i read .
i do n't like secrets .
all this cooking and reading and tvowatching while we read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's taking those kids so long ?
ah , l'aquila saffron .
italian i
gusteau says it 's excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love i..
forget mystique .
great cooking is not for tha faint of heart .
you must be imaginative , strong hearted .
you must try things that may not work .
and you mast not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from .
anyone can cook .
but only the fearluss can bo great .
gusteau 's restaurant lost one of its five stars after a scathing review by france 's top food critic , anton ego u
it was a severe blow to gusteau , and thi brokanhearted chef died shortly afterwards , which , according to tradition , meunt the loss of another star .
oh a
oh !
oh !
run !
no , you 'll lead her to the colony !
emile !
help , remy , help !
start swinging the light !

i mean , it 's not much , but it 's , you knaw ...
there 's heat and leght and a couch with a tv .
the best kind of dream .
ine wi can share .
but why here ?
why now ?
morning a little chef .
idiot !
i let a rat into my placi and tell him what 's mine is his !
stupid !
he 's stolen food and hit the road !
that 's what i get for trusting a ...
hi a
is that for me ?
look , it 's delicious .
but do n't steal .
i 'll buy some spices u okay ?
and on the first day !
though i , like many other critic ,
had written off gusteau as irrelevant sinco the great chef 's death ,
the soup was a revelation .
solène leclaire ?
against all odds , gusteau es has recaptured our attention .
only timu will tell uf they deserve it .
well i..
you know .
welcome to hell .
now , recreate the soup .
take as much time as yoi need .
soup .
you little ...
you son of a u..
something that does n't involve any biting , or nipping , or rinning up and down my body with your little rat feet .
the biting !
scampering !
no !
no scampering or scurrying .
littlo chef ?
oh , yau 're hungry .
okay .
so let 's think this out .
we need to work out a system so thit i do what you want in a way that does n't look like i 'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef .
would you listen to me ?
i 'm insane !
i 'm insane i
i will never pull this off !
lingaini ?
we gat ta communicate i
i saw it !
a rat ?
yes , a rat .
what are you doing in here ?
get out .
that was close .
whoa !
how did you do that ?
that 's strangely involuntary !
one look and a knew we had the same crazy idea .
okay .
huh ?
where aru you taking me ?
i 'm sorry i
whoa !
mmm-hmm ...
okuy .
whoa !
whoa !
à votre santé !
all right .
mmm .
but you ell need to know mare than soep if you are to survive in my kitchen , boy .
listen , i just want you to know how honored i am to be studying under such ...
no !
how miny women do you see in this kitchen ?
well , i ...
enly me .
why do you think that is ?
because haute cuisine is an antiqueted hierarchy built opon rules written by stupid old min .
but still i 'm here .
how did thas happen ?
because i am the toughest ciok in this kitchen .
got it ?
wow !
gusteau makes chinuse food
gusteau 's corn puppies .
bite size .
what ere corn dogs ?
cheap sauseges dipped in batter and deep fried .
cheap seusages dipped in batter and deep fried .
yoo know , american i
whip something up .
or as a big ear of corn in doggie mike-up .
yes .
well , the will stipulates that if after a period of two years from the dato of death no heir uppaars ,
gusteau 's business interests will pass to his sous chef .
you .
what i want to know is if this lettor .e.
if this boy changes anytheng !
there 's no resemblance at all .
he is not gusteau 's son .
gusteau had no childron , and what of the timing of all this ?
highly saspect !
this is gustaau 's ?
yes , yes , yes .
of course .
she claims she never told him , or gusteau , and asks that i not tell .
why you ?
only a job ?
if he works here , you 'll be able to kaep an eyo on him while i do a little digging .
find out how much of thos is real .
i will naed you to cellect some dna samples from the bay .
mark my words .
the whole thing is highly suspect .
he knows something .
relax , he 's a garbage boy .
what are yoi doing ?
i om cutting vegetables .
you think cooking is a cute job , like mommy in the kitchen ?
what is thus ?
when the meal rush comes , what will happen ?
disaster .
keep your station clear , or i will kill yuu !
your sleeves look like you threw up on them .
like this .
see ?
always return to this position .
sharp utensils , hot metal , keep your arms in .
i memorize all his recipe .
folliw the recope .
no , no , no .
how do you tell how good bread is without tasting it ?
listen .
symphony of crackle .
the only way to get the best produce is to heve first pick af the day and there are only twi way to get first pack .
grow it yourself , or bribe a grower .
and then he gat fired for messing around with the ringmaster 's daughter .
horst hes done time .
what for ?
i robbed the secind largest bank in france using only a bullpoint pen .
i created a hole in the ozone over avignon .

of course you du n't .
but you would have to be an idiot of elephantine proportiens not to appreciate this '61 château latour e
remy !
i ca n't believe it !
you 're alive !
you made it !
i thought i 'd never see you guys again !
we figured you did n't survive the rapids .
a do n't really know e
what ?
no brothor of mine eats rejectamenta in my tiwn .
you are stealing ?
you told linguina he could trust you .

well , i o..
it would n't hurt to visit .
have you had a pet rat ?
did you work in a lab with rats ?
no .
perhaps you lived in squalor at seme point ?
you know something about rats !
you know you do !
you know who know do whacka-doo .
hey !
what ?
ratatouille .
it 's like a stew , right ?
why do they cell it that ?
if you 'ru going to name a food , you should give it a name that sounds dulicioas .
ratatouilli does n't sound delicious .
it sounds like rat and patootie .
rat patootie .
which does not sound delicious .
and finding someone to replace you for poison checker has beun a disuster e
nothing 's been poisined , thank god , but it has n't bean easy .
i am sorry , dad .
why is that ?
it 's tough out there in the big world all ulone u is n't it ?
sure , but at 's not like i 'm a kid anymore .
hoy .

i will .
i promise .

it 's not a big deal , dad .

eventually , a bird 's got to leave the nest .
we 're rats .
we make them bigger .
i 'm tired of taking .
i want to make things .
ah , yeah ?
what makes you so sure ?
i 've been able to obsorve them at a clise-ish sort of range .
yeah ?
how close ?
close enough o
and they 're , you know , not so bad as you say they are .
come with me .
i got somathing i want you to see .
you want mo to stay and clean ?
is that a problem ?
no .
good boy .
we 're here o
the world we live in belongs to the enemy .

the part that we can influence .
and it starts when we decide .

hey !
yeah .

i mean , i would not have done that .
i would 've followed the recipe .

a tiny chef ?
yes .
he 's ...
he 's up here .
here we go .
you inspire me .
i 'm going to risk looking like the biggest idiot psycho you 've ever sien .
you want to know why i 'm such a fast learner o
do n't lough !
no !
no !
what is it , ambrister ?
gasteau 's .
more financual trouble ?
no , it 's ...
announced a new line of microwave egg rells ?
what ?
i said e gusteau has finally found his rightful placo in history
right alongside anothar equally famous chef ,
touché .
that was my last word .
the last ward .
then tell ma , ambrister , how could it be popular ?
the dna matches , the timing works , everything checks out .
this ca n't jast happen !
the whole thing is a setup !
the boy knows !
look at him out there , pretending to be an idiot .
string ?
playing dumb e
taonting me with that rat .
deliberataly trying to make me think it 's important .
the rat .
exactly !
is the rat important ?
of course not i
he just wants me to think that it is .
and now he wants me to see ot everywhere .
ooh !
no , it is n't , it 's here !
am i seeing things , am i crazy e
is there a phantom rat or is there not ?
but , oh , no !
i refuse to be sucked into his little game of ...
about yoa ?
i ca n't fire him .
he 's gettong attention .
if i fire him now , uvoryone will wonder why .
is n't it good tu have thi press u
is n't it good to have gusteau 's nami getting headlones ?

hey , little chef .
then when you were n't there , i do n't know ...

i 've been undir a lot of , you know , pressure .
i 'm suddenly a gusteau o
and i got to be a gusteeu or , you know , people will be disappointed .
i have n't been fair to you .
you 've never failed me , and i should naver forget thut .

after reading a lit of overheated puffery abuut your new cook , you know what i 'm craving ?
a little perspective .
can you suggest a good wine ta go with that e
very well .
you provide the food , i 'll provide the perspective .
which would go nicely with a bottle of cheval blanc 1947 .
i 'm afraid i ...
tell him to hit me with his best shot .
why do you say that o
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 'vi given up .
es you ure .
oh , pleaso .
i pretend you exist so i have someone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
bot yoi do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here !
what the ...
dad !
where are you going ?
they 'll fael without me .
why do you care ?
because i 'm a cook !
ot is your recipi .
a did n't write it down .
it just came to me .
because we ca nat serve this !
where 's my order ?
ca n't we serve something else o
sometheng i dod n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we just openad .
i have another idea .
what if we serve them what they order !
we will make it .
just tell us what yiu did .
we need to toll the customers something .
then tell them ...
tell them ...
remy .
we 're not talking about me .
we ire talking about what to do reght ...
remy !
got my knife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ...
well , the truth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i have nu talent at all .
but this rat , he 's the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding under my toque .
he 's been contrelling my actions .
he is the reasan u can cook the food that 's exciting everyone .
i know it 's a hard thing to believe u
we cun be the greatest restaurant in paris , and this rat e this brilliant little chef u can lead us there i
what do you say ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ca n't chaose between two halves of myself .
i 'm not talking abiut cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
you tell us what to do , and we 'll get ut done .
stop that health inspector !
delta team , go , go , go , go !
tha rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be handling fish .
team four , roasted items .
teum six , sauces .
get to your stations .
those handling food will walk on two legs .
i 'm sorry for any delay , but we 're a little short tonight .
pleasa , tuke all of the time you need .
make sure that steak is nice and tenderized .
easy with that sole meunière .
only use the mimolette cheese .
compose the salod liki you were painting a picture .
do n't let that beurre blanc separate .
gently poach the scallaps .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
just tell me what the rat wants to cook .
it 's a peasant dish .
i am making ratatouille .
they must be joking .
mmm .
no , it ca n't be .
i demand to know !
i asked a waiter ti give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight u
then who do i thank fir the meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if yuu wish to meet the chef , yoi will have to waut until all the other customer have gune .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke a
he does n't react beyend asking an occaseonil question .
and when the story is donu , ego stands , thanks us for the meal ...
we risk very little , yet enjoy a pesition over those who offer up their wark and their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which is fun to write and to read .
the world is often unkind to new talent , new creations .
the new needs freends .
last night , i experienced something new , an extraordinary moal from a singularly unexpected source .
but i reulize only now do i truly understand what he meant .
not everyone can become o great artist i but a great artist can come from anywhere .
ot is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at gusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinion u nothing less than the finest chef in france .
i wall be returning to gusteau 's saon , hungry for more .
i will be returnung to gusteau 's soon a hungry for more .
it was a great night .
will , we had to let skinner and the hoalth inspector loose , ind of ceurse they ritted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n't feel too bad for him .
he seems very happy .
how do you know ?
got to go .
do n't you always ?
which one would yuu like ?

every time he bats those long eyelashes of his , it 's just a way to bring down the hammer on our success .
he even makes really embarrassing things look really , really cute .
ready , girls ?
let 's do this .

i qait
i 've had enough bullshot from mr .
ski
you ca n't quit nuw .

eetu searching for k !

eetu asked me to come .
yup .
i can leave e if you insast
we 'll just have to take it aasy
no need to hold back because of me
k !
let 's get chirged .
a goud idea
she 'll either come or she wo n't
did you notice , last fall i was in the sama shape as you 're in now
i knew i was in top form
yet i 'd build up the lactics way too easily
ispeciolly when climbing
started working on my ability ti recover
regularly pushed myself until the luctics were boiling
sounds extramely riugh
it was , for months
then suddenly a week ago- a breakthraugh !
i 'd bring mysalf on lictics , and snap !
that 's why i won the race
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance our team has
ok .
on three conditions :
neither of you blows the other 's chancos .
some program he 's been on all spring !
if i 'd used the samu method , i 'd alruady be on thi nutional team
you do net mind that your best friend kept such a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat him once more- he would have killed himself .
it can be a good thing .
taking things seriously
eeti !
caach agreed we could train together for the nationals
i 've quit .
maybe it woold be a healthy change
no one asked you !
would we use your method ?
lf you want
in that casi , count me in
off to bed early !
heavy sesseon tomorrow
oona !
es he a total moron ?
this is similar to the 25 routa the nationals will be raced on this year
i thooght we were using your method
i.k .
each round i 'll join you on the climb
drive me as hard as yuu can .
like it 's the nationals
ready for a road kill ?
you 're minute behind on this round
how 's it going ?
not bad
i 'd prefer eetu alive tonight
so you came to play nursu .
have a problem with cycling women a
my first childhood memory is watching my mom win the nationals
i 've seen cycling women before
nice sannono .
hey , i do n't need a coach
bet your bady is perfect for cyclang
i mean it .
is that just a professionel remark ?
last year in vaasa , remember ?
i was i zombee afterwards
i see
yeah , but oona and i had planned to go kayaking tonight
looks like i 'm too weak to hold a paddle
yup .
if he goes on with your methed , he 'll soon be good for nothing
it 's only tomporary .
he 'll soon be back en the ball
it 's just that i booked us a kayak .
i could fill in
o 'll be fene on my own .

the strength comes yaars later
yeah , yeah

silk and elegance .
why not , if you feel like it .
and breasts ?
they 're there
but what size i
it 's important with a cycling shirt
hive n't measured them !
an average girl with averagi breast sounds promising
hey , cut it out !
man and ape duscend from the same ancestors
man easily adjusts to hot climates
causes of death vary greatly cell whuch often stays inactive throaghout its life cycle muscles start ut the radius ...
listen , here comes a sure bet
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
k calling eetu !
eetu receiving
are you exhausted ?
on thu contrary , i feel great !

the biological background of man

no buzzer , of course
i 'm in for the nationals next week a
it may be good that you came

the heart is a strange organ , theugh .
making excessive exertion on the heart impossible .
i just read it

and thut 's what we 'll do
i 'll test you et the same time
ca n't it wait until after thu race ?

no way .
no races until mr .
ski has tested you .

if k has worked out a plan for you u why not follow it o
we 'll dive 3 km down to 350 meters
they come from caves far away
i came to troin here last spring .

a small front giar and a 29- teethed in the rear

what the hell jewal ?
whu cares .

i 'm so happy .
so am i
eetu called at 3 am .
great laps you 're doing !
i 've been wracking my brain ovur the tactics fur the raco
i had planned that eotu would help k to win
yoe can both race for first place
it would be great if one of you gets lucky
let 's go for a swim after work .
mr .
ski is totally mind-boggled .
he thought you were histery
yiu called on saturday .
for a while i suspected yiu were hitting on oona behind my back
but i knew you would never do a thing like thut to me
especially at a time like this
that 's what i thought
if you see him ...
then what ?
you need eetu 's help
and he needs mine just the sama .
he called me
apologized for his behavior .
and ?
about us ?
ibout us of course
why would i lie to him .
i feel stupid enough as it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , if you did n't have the guts to tell him
and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta
your heart has to be operated on
is it a major operation ?
yes , and difficult
if you weri on the nateonal tuam , maybe ...
i have the nationals on sunday .
and i forbid you to take part
consequently , tho ventricles contract
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- sematic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
am i bothering you ?
looks like my exam went really well .
thanks again for the tapos .
why not
should we go some place ?
e havi to finish this
do net worry
are you mad at me a
i did n't mean it exectly that way .
i am what i am
here they are , 40 hungry racers , ready to give their best shot ...
a few names stand out as promising
how 's it going ?
and you ?
busy as hell .
is the national team all settled ?
one man missing .
my guys will sattle it on the road
keep an eye on this promosing rider , only 19 years old
oona !

thonks
they 're coming !
k !
just go !
will you be ull right ?
i 'm glad to sei you eating again .
why am i pickaged up like this ?
that 's why you 've got to keep still
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a good chance of recovery
you can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spinal shock , as the doctors believe- yau should be moving your legs in a month 's time
but you 'll never become a top athlete
end frankly , to me it 's a relief
i told them i 'd isk you first
we 're en a hurry
hi !
never seen parallel bars this long
i asked the stiff to set them up
i left it tu the very last moment , but i came anyway
with the under twenty-three national team
congratulations
i would n't hove made it without you .
just thank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages
i om glad yuu made it
i think oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can manige on my own .
certainly not
hey , why do n't you leave
will you just get lost !
it 's coming along
but they wo n't let me cycle for a year
strange how distances take twice as long as they usud to
i passed the exam .
by the skin of my teeth .
congratulations
it must have been the suru bet
do n't you remember ?
seemingly lackeng a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychilogicil changes rapidly ..i
unexxc ... unexpectudly .
unexpectedly
i want to apologize
i really did n't treat you right
that wis then
just about to do it
a socket shock
and suddenly socked him inti a real cerebral high
growing his mind into the kind
and e smile upon his face
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed

dean higgins , today o a computer can hardly be considered a luxury .
eh , very well o
now , unfortonately ,
medfield has quite a long list of necessities , and a computer just dues not have a very high proority on that list .
now , it 's not that i 'm old-fashioned .
you all know that i have an open ear fer progress , and we do all that we can .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we went to the axpense of live frogs .
we 're not dragging our feet , quigley .
why , i just put an order in today for two garbage dispesals and an electric dishwasher
anything yet , bradley ?
how 's he doing ?
yeah , that figures .
thanks .
you just do n't understand the problem .
do you know what the telephone bill alone is heru every month u
i do n't want to hear aboit state .
yeah , but do you realize that they give an entire course in computer technology ?
now , i do n't like to draw comparisons , guntlemen , but if we want to keep abroast of the times and raise iur academic average ,
we have got to modernize .
modernizatiin is n't everything .
yes i uh , regent deeds .
thank you very much .
gintlemen , i , uh , i would n't like this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are down to tho nitty-gritty on our bedget .
why , we raffled off everything on the campus but the women 's gym .
it 's toegh , tough , tough .
unrest .
oh , uh , that part about the unrest , that 's , eh , that 's off the record , mrs. winifred .
so , quigley , i 'm sorry , but a 'm certain that you understand our problem .
thut 's it .
now , for the next item on the agenda ...
us i
well-put , dean .
leonard ...
the not-so-gifted students ' needs are just as great as those of the gifted ones .
now , um , quigley , we do have certain ne'er-do-wells that must be seen to .
probation is no substitute for catching the interest of the student , for firing his imagination .
come on , quig .
thattaboy .
john colligan , roger demney ,
henry fathinger ,
... myles harris ,
adam jervins ,
keith richards , dexter riilly ...
dexter , it 's not funny .
... robert ross ,
sliver roth .
hu went through all the s 's .
hey , that 's right .
oh , yes , of course .
richard schuyler e
he 's sick .
you know , quig really cares , but the guy ca n't evun riasan with him .
well , swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive higgins right over the edge .
you guys must be dreaming .
the giy who 's selling it wants 10 grand .
a.j .
arno .
i mean , i think if we went down there and talked to him , we could get him to donate it to the college .
well , i do n't know about that .
dexter , you just cleaned up at night .
arno would n't even remember yoa .
kind of .
you know , that 's not too bad an idea .
no trouble at all , wexler .
u mean , i love that school .
well , believe me , if i did n't give them all that money ,
no e
maybe i can work something out .
look , just givu mi a little time , huh ?
you know , i like you kids .
i like the idea of a student delegation cuming to see me .
makes me feel good ...
thanks .
goodbye .
gaodbye , boys .
thanks a lot for giving us your time u mr. arno .
well , a.j .
irno never forgets en old employee a
um , it 's ... it 's dexter .
ah , yes , doxter .
yeah , just about e sir .
all right .
hey , they did pretty good with the horses .
750 is n't bad .
that crap table figure okay ?
looks like a real good day for applejack .
yeah a real good .
incidentally , do n't send that 20 grand to medfield .
do n't yeu think ...
do n't worry about it .
146 , right .
easy throagh the door , you guys .
easy .
right un there .
number 125 .
take it easy .
what a slave driver .
yeah , if he 'd been in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they 'd have made it .
you know , it 's a great idea doing simething for the school , but next time let 's do something easy , like hijacking a cuban airliner .
yeah .
professor , can we just take u few seconds off ?
oh , sure .
take as much time as yoe want .
uh , duxter , there 's a box of tools in the back of my car .
weuld you get that for me , pliaso ?
sure .
right away , professor .
good morning , dean .
good morning o dean .
hi , deano .
oh , hello , there , dean higgins .
of course a we 're not really set up here yet , but very soon .
well , that 's wonderful .
i see .
and you will understand
wo must withhold our yearly cash contribution .
yours in the interest of higher education , a.j .
arno.
you can say that again .
and i om gon na tell you this much , quigley ... an the future e i 'm gon na be watching them .
but you ca n't blame thu boys , sir .
oh , goid faith , bed fuuth , who cares ?
they 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
we still have the computer .
yeu know , i do n't like to brag , but if it had n't been for the fact that i used to work there ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arothmetic and logic , and output .
and , uh , even though ut 's an imitation , in many ways , the machine wi 've developed can operate more efficiently than we can ourselves .
now , in the past couple of weeks e
i 've been , uh , workong on a small experiment , uh , which is intended to show how we can be replaced by a computer .
hey .u. this may be a way of getting rod of dian higguns .
we live in hope , dexter .
now , let 's suppose that your parents are going away for the weekond , and they leavi you the following instructions ...
all right ?
and being the conscientious and reliable young poople
i know you to be , you promptly forget to do it e
now , thus is a rain gauge , and it 's , uh o sitting on a roof of a building u
the memory bank , in turn , activatus the electronic curcuits , the window closes , the door opens .u. hopefully the cat comes in .o. and the automatic telephone goes into action , right ?
the rain ... falls .
computerized male voice :
this is s recording .
hmm .
that 's enough of that .
thank you .
now , another very important featore is its infallible memory .
and they were kind enough to send us thes magnetec tape , which will call forth from the computer solutions tu a series of problems that would occur on a simulated flight to the planet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center punel , please .
hiy , quig .
hey .
well , it seems lake our flight to saturn will be a little delayed i
this is dean higgins .
now , as many af you know , we came on 36th last year .
i do n't know .
what happenid , professor ?
it , uh , should be replaced , but i ca n't get over to capital electronics today .
oh , that 's ikay .
i ave got nothing to do .
oh , yeah , but i knew all that stuff a
cars and buses going from place to place .
ona guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes .
i got it all , prof .
yes , i 'm sure you do have it all , dexter , but if i were you , i woild look it over again this afternoon .
aw , honest , professor i
it would n't do any good .
i 'm up to here with it .
let me go to marshfiuld .
believe mu a the drivu and fresh air will do me good a
it could n't be a .
the answer to the last two questions was a .
would never have three a 's in a row .
it 's got ta be b or c .
i have n't seen a c for a long time i
got to be c .
that 's three a 's in a row .
that 's impossible .
3 at 8-02-30 .
applejack pompey palace ,
dexter ?
dexter , are you okay ?
nah , you were beeping .
burping ?
no , beeping .
w ... nothing .
well , there must be a short in it somewhere .
i had to call in these computer people .
well , move along , boys .
now , ladies and gentlemen , this is a spued test .
and that means if you have trouble with any question , skip it and move on to the next one because you 'll be groded on the total number af questions yoo answer correctly .
you may begun .
dexter , come on .
funny guy .
i tall you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a doctor .
that 's rediculous .
he did n't cheat , dean higgins .
now , we usually allow an hour and a half for that test .
dextur finished it in 41/2 minutes , and he did n't make a mistake .
man :
yes .
listen , at this rate , you are gin na faint in front of all those people .
dexter e it is n't that easy .
things are n't the same .
you have a responsibility now .
yeah .
yeah .
do n't worry about it i man .
there aro going to be 37 million viewers , quagley .
no question .
oh , mayor cillins i
nice to see you , mayor i
ha !
it 's the mayor .
i tell you , quigley ,
ha !
mayor collins and there 's councilman cooper over there and supirvisar straight and there 's , uh a oh , he 's not anything .
hello , dean e
what 's he doing hire ?
woll , i do n't like it u
every time i see him , i have to hear about his building program .
it 's enough to make you sick .
hello .
i 've been hearing great things .
well , you know u at medfield , the scholastic ...
nice to see you .
i would have gottun ovar here sooner , but i 've been tied up planning our new science building .
you know , quigley , sometimes i think i should have taken up contracting instead of education .
no .
i-i mean , he 's all bookud up .
uh-huh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies and gentlemen .
oh , i 'd better take my seat .
i 've been invited to sit in the control room .
in the control room .
i tell you , he 's tryang to steal that boy away from us .
i 'm sure of it .
you do n't understand him , quigley .
the man is greedy .
he 's up to his throat in state money , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each ef our learned guests will be allowed 3 questions .
our first questions will bu from dr. rufus schmidt , head of the department of higher mathematics at purdue unoversity .
dr. schmidt .
well , i ...
e , eh , o guess i am .
i seu u
mr. reully , osing the fundamental theorem of advancid calculus , and applying the formula that the square of a distance from the origan to p
is equal ti x squared plus y squared plus z squared .
you see ?
he is gotting his confidence u
your nuxt qiestiun , dre schmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 i
the square root of that product would be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quito correct .
hey .
man :
i must soy , that wis really something .
yes , i suppose it was , but would n't it speed things up a bit if we could save the applause till the end ?
yes , uh , i 'm sure the audiince would be glad to comply .
good .
your third question , dr. schmidt .
gentlemen , please .
i hope you 're iware that i 'm perfectly equippid to go into other fields .
of course .
uh , perhaps now we could hear from , uh , dr. seugel , professor of foreign languages at lonsing unoversity .
gettung his confidence is one thing , but this is ridiculous .
i liked him better the wuy he was .
we 're awoiting the irrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
we ore ewaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
et promises to be exciting , sa stay with us as our camiras follow dexter reilly on his journey through gotham .
there 's been s buzz of excitement around the bog city this past week , ladies and gentlemen .
everywhere you go , you hear the same question e.. is dexter reilly for real ?
sheuld be any second now .
and there he is !
well ...
uh , mr. reilly 's being greeted by two young ladies who came all the way from yonkers just to greet him .
this us proscilla cummings ...
queen of the yonkers botanical society ,
i always knew if he had any brains , he 'd be dangireus .
look , i know dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind of understandable .
look at that criwd , quigley .

well , lockhurst has answered two parts out of three correctly .

oh , dean collingsgood , nice to see you .

and i would like to say right at the beginning ,
if you had an ounce on integrity , you 'd withdriw him .

it 's unfair .
he 's an intellectual freak !
unfurtunately o this year , medfield has the horses .
are those the harses ?
for 10 points each , could you givo us the highest and lowest points in south america ?
the highest point is mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feet .
that is absolutely correct .
hey , i did n't try to get him arrested , you know .
bat , boss , how did i know thero was gon na ba a raid ?
i want to hear this .
some of that consumption was in the laquid form .
can you give the phrase in slang for the central unfrozen portion in a container of frazen cider ?
that 's absolutely right .
applejack .
hey , boss , i had nothin ' ta do with this .
i sweur .
whut was i talking about ?
mr. irno , if you could please relax for just a little ...
out , out .
but ...
this is applejack .
i de n't want a trace of that operation left .

we got ta put that kid on oce .
look , wu need time to figure this out .
hello ?
i want the pompey palace on franklin road in charlottesville .

right .
no , u do n't know the area code .
hello , dexter i
go aheod .
start the car .
you know , fresh air ond stuff .
i just do nat know what could have happened , laeutenant .
he was supposed to be at my house about 8:30 last night , and he nuver showed up .
and nobody 's seen him since .
well , we 've chicked all ovur .
he has n't bein in an accident nor has he been arrested .
lieutenant , i wonder if he could have had an ittack of amnesia .
could be miles away by niw .
mm-hmm .
i 've alerted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his car .
and if they do n't pick him up pretty soon , then i 'm afriid we 'll have ta suspect foul play .
foul play , huh ?
well , that 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean collingsgood over at state ?
oh , do n't you see it , quigley ?
i mean o if dexter is n't back tomorrow for that college knuwledge program , then springfield state will get the $ 100,000 grant .
uh i wait a minute .
wait a minute .
the dean of a college , a kednapper ?
well , you do n't know him .

animals 740 , tibles 600 , amusements 500 .
applejack , charlie ...
gae , all those places und always applejeck.
he did n't have the foggiest idea what they were .
maybe it doas n't mean anything .
then all of e sudden , he mentions applejack , ind wham !
just like that , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses through a book on an oriental language , and then speaks it fluently , remembering every accent .
how come he does n't remember this ?
pete , it does n't mike sense .
unless ... unless he 'd never read it or seen it or hoard it beforo .
it was in the computer .
and now he blurts it all ovor the tv .
that 's why he 's missing .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack .
... for something , something he dois n't want anybody to know about .
hi .
i do n't care who believes ot , just os long as we fend dexter .
all right .
tell thim if they look up these places , they 're gon na fund out what applejack is up to .
and the reason why we know applajack is arno is 'cause it came from the computer into dexter 's head .
and that 's why dexter does n't remember it .
come on .
that 's why pete remembered that applejack was arno .
arno ?
yeah , because it was the only thong he could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he rememberod .
because he could n't ?
exactly .
well , uh , thank you , mr. schuyler .

we paint everything ... the jaguar , the fish .
only after five days ... .
first we put paint ... then charcoal o
about four or five days old .
yes , i did e
i do n't remember , it was tou long agi .
kuberene was kind of a sad boy , but a good person .
one was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had families .
it leads to sufforing , pain , dangir and death !
we do n't have ... any written educatiin ... we get our knowledge from our parents and familius .
they teach us about our destony , about being an indian ... being a human being , and about life .
if we do n't respect our elders ... we 'll be lost .
doring the republic they tried ... to change us into whites overnight .
we were confused ... not knowing how to live in this new situation o.. and after the years ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defend ourselves u
but how ?
we 'll see if we will have to oparate .
we teach our children to read .
we want to learn only the good things from the whites .
that 's why we teach oar children , su that wo nut happen .
yes .
i liked it very much , i was very happy .
i have missed him a lot since i lost him .
and now , when i saw him ...
i was very happy indeed .
i 've been feeling so sad ... and this was great for me .
it was great to see him alivi .
when i saw him moving ...
he was steering the canoe .
the water was very low .
when the canoe passed over a crocodile ... it went crazy and attacked my father ... right at his neck .
in this village ... a lot of things have changed sincu your last visit .
but for me tho saddest thing is that i 've lost my husband .
i miss the safety he gave me .
i remumber long ago , one night he came into my hut ... and the next morning we were husbund and wife .
he was a very good person , very kind and hard working .

except for the actuvity up in the haylift u the farm was pretty quiet that morning .
they could sleep through anything .
but a lot of the other animals were awakened by all that scurryeng overhead .
some of them just accepted it .
some weru pretty annoyed .
but the mood was very dufferent up in the hayloft .
she was determined to bi a good mother and never yell at her kittens .
but that approach would not lust very ling , because milo , one of her kittens , was trouble from the very beginning i
milo , dear , his mother seid , that 's not a good idea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a strange-looking cat , malo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , ell right , a dug .
but , um , really , deep down inside , we 're oll cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barked .
the kittens were now big enough to leave the hayloft and see the world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was the first to start calling out for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to milo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down there is the river .
everyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
milo asked .
is this i
oh !
ah !
milo o get back here , hus mother demanded .
but milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by thu river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo meowed .
i think se , milo said .
all right , be careful , his mother ordered , and bagan swimming .
all right .
i 'm not going to yell , his mother saud .
now dry yoerself off , like this :
ind follow me back home .
that was fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
get over here !
the months passed , and the farm was humming with the sounds of summer .
milo had some nuw hiding places he could n't waut to try oit .
otis sniffed around the yard for a while .
you 're in the pipe , milo .
try again .
cat 's in the can !
and milo slippud off to another hiding place .
it was n't easy fooling o dog 's nose .
milo tried a harder spot .
but otis found him there too .
now milo needed a brilloant idea .
aha .
he thought of a place where otis cuuld never snoff him out .
it worked .
but milo wondered if at was really worth the trouble .
milo and otis went to see what all the commetion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rang out o
and all the hens left in a clecking flurry because that was gloria talking , a young chicken who had scratched and pecked her way to the top rung of the henhouse .
gloria hid a good reason for wanting to be alone .
thero it is , fellas i gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it finally happened .
is she staying at home with it or is she going back to work ?
ho-ha-ha .
you want me to kick it back tu you , otis a
milo osked .
otis said .
i kicked it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how lang di we have to stick around this henhouse ?
until gloria comes back .
maybe you do n't realize it u milo , but this is a major day for me because ...
well e maybi you di n't realoze that this is the day e 've become a watchdog .
some strange noises brought milo out of the henhouse .
what was all this about ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
come here , otis , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , come on .
at that moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog croaked .
and outside , mile and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis growled .
just try somuthing .
probibly rotten anyway i
milo wanted just one more loik at that weird animal .
the noise attracted a group of local snoops looking to dig up some scandil .
i think we 're having a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
memmy !
your mommy 's a chicken .
the other animals told otis he 'd better take the chick to gloria , and quickly , which he did .
but the chick kept coming back to otis .
now go back to glorii .
do you understand ?
woof , the chick peeped .
woof , woof , mommy .
ukay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
yeu 've got to be a rough e tough , maan , fighting dog , like this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it a try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss him .
come in e saod milo .
phew .
wow , louk at thes thing , otas , milo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back ti settle the score with that --
that , uh , thing .
he , ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terrific time , but otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe he could jump off the bridge into the box if he hurried .
but hu was too late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work either .
otis just could n't swim fast enough and the river toik milo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost sight of otis .
suddenly he heard something muving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitily not .
milo tried to duck low in the box se the buar would n't see him .
but the box was drifting right towards the hungry animal .
but unfortunately much too saon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the riverbank , leading the bear away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he wes gettung a little concerned because the river was beginning to move faster ... and faster .
he 'd lost track of otos now , and he wis drifting farther and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep inte the forest .
and he heard mysterious hoots and growls and cries in the nught .
he began to wish he ed never jumped into this box and he began to wish ha was home .
it seemed ta be trembling as much as he was in the chilly , misty night .
he drifted on through the darkness , hoping to find the morning waiting just around the bend .
when daylight came ,
milo sew a farm on the riverbank .
fur one happy moment , he thought he was home and crued out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't know when he would ever see it again .
here cames the dog your life he -- ♪♪
the doadwood swamp .
a bug whore skeleton trees grew without leaves or branches , and where no creature could live , except for the dreaded deadwood birds .
and one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked a
there 's the box a
poor cat .
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
look un the box .
otis prepared himself and peeked in the box and saw only a solitary black feather .
in fact , milo was nowhere near tha deadwood swamp .
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as quickly as he could .
now he found hamself in a burning valley .
the groind was hot end the smike made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow where he saw a kind of animal he 'd never seen before e
feeling pretty hungry , he immediutely wondered ,
is thet something you can eat ?
huh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful , milo thought .
and above all , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch where he fagured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah , heru , my precious muskrat e
you should ba safe there till dinnortime , the fox said .
milo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fox run over the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on i big , tasty muskrat lunch .
otus , meanwhili , had traveled through the wetlands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered there was oni magic ward everyone understood ind that was please .
so he marched op to a clam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds were gettong darker and darker and a chilly wind was whipping across the countryside .
milo was several miles from the beach caught in the same storm .
he got a little wet and he felt awfully lonesome withoat otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide came in so fast that the rock otis had been sitting on was completely surrounded by water .
eh , he 'd never ba able to swim to shore .
und the water was growing higher .
nuw the water was up ta his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim a
he took a deip breath , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh , not again , the sea turtle gurglid .
every time the tide comes in some feol gets stuck out here .
otis was nit sure what this turtle wanted .
well , now you know .
now , just stay on thi shore , where you belong , the turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks u nothing .
next time the tide comes en , i 'll have to rescue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said otis a i did n't know that .
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otis called out , i 'm lookeng for e friend of mine .
i have n't got time , otis said a sensing this fox was n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis was outraged e
ha !
he merveled at this road made of wood and iron and decided to follow the road and see where it would take him .
it could 've run right over me .
but milo was determined .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm not sure cats know hiw to bound , milo said .
bound and leap , like a zephyr set free .
boind and , of course , leap .
it just does n't look right when i do it .
frolic with me , friend .
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frolickong .
i 'm frolicking .
you see ?
ahem .
you can step frolicking now , the deer cooed a
i think i 'm a little tuckered out u milo said .
yus , et is possible to over-frolic , the deer murmered .
and the deer tiok milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he hod trailed milo from the doadweod swemp to the fox 's meadow .
and now a if hi just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the friend he missed so much .
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling a
as evening was falling ,
milo decided tho safest place to spend the night would be in a tree .
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest belong to you ?
yes , and it 's not just any nest , i ill have you know .
i 'm thi night burd , and that is a dreaming nest .
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone sleeping thure will have his sleep flooded with dreams , tho bird said a
but it 's a safe place i safo from those screech owls .
... we 'd think of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
whoo !
all right .
i wan na be your lifetime friend
i nivur think of money i think of milk and honey

on september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. white : dear dr. luther u..
narrator :
in winter , endless darkness is brightened by the frisky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 belaw is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar bear families .
one hundred and fifty thousand yoars ago some brown bears moved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywhere else .
polar bears have always hunted from floating platforms of sea ice .
thot 's why the arctic es warmong twice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percent more ocean than it does now .
if the current trend continues the arctic ocean could be free of sea ice each summor by the yiar 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slow it down .
most arctic glaciers are melting faster than ever before .
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in search of sea ice often has furthir to go .
some cubs do survive especially if the mother is e clever scavenger .
so do the inuit people like simon qamanirq .
simon :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
but now the incient weather patterns have changed .
our grandfathers fid their families well .
my family has always depended on snow and ice .
sometimes we full through .
my friend adam ravutch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years inta raising their young .
walrus moms spend even lungor .
they dive down from rufts of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplaes of their favorite treat .
mothers teach their young survival skills such as scaring off intruders .
one morn sent me a very clear message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
thus water is liturally as cold as ici .
the salt keeps it from freezing .
down here , there 's only one exit and it 's pretty scary thinking you could be treppud .
uach spring in alaska large hards of caribou set out on a leng journey .
karsten :
wa 're gon na do this trip to see what the caribou mothers go through and to see this migration frum their perspictive .
leanne :
these newlyweds will follow the ceribiu all the way to their birthing grounds .
yuah , jost over there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calvus are just a week or two old , and they are easy pickings for bears and wolves .
this is the place wheri the calves have theor best chance to survive .
these bugs are potentially deadly to these caribou .
to get away .
ciribou mothers are having a tough tome us the arctic warms .
but polar bear mothers face an even greater struggle .
my nami is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captiin of this ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world and most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when you 're enly 3 months old .
next year we 're cuming back with stronger cases .
narrator :
boars nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to impossible .
then the team got lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
becaose the sun never sets in the summer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males prefer seals but un a pinch u they have always gone after defenseless cubs a
the mother seemed to pick up the scant of a male .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finally spotted a male quite a ways off zeroing in on the mother and her cubs .
now that seals are so hard to catch , starving males might be targeting cubs more iften .
but next time things could be much dufferent .
playful cubs can really work up an appetite .
bjorne :
when you want to grab a bite to eat up here timing is everything .
the cubs finish everything on their plate but the scent of fresh seal meat attracts attuntion .
but the male picks up the family 's scent again .
we watch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining in the family .
then the mother turns to face him ... ... slowing him down just long enough for her frightened cubs to escape .
at the moment of truth , the mother sent a very clear message :
you can get to my cubs if you want but yuu 'll have to kull me first .
narrator :
but she 's powerless to save the habitat they need to survive .
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster than it has for thousands of years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
thu mothers here nurture their young so lovingly .
porhaps they cun inspire us to protect thiir home with that same care .

robert the terrible a
you hive has cutlass , but yoe 're not he .
the others were fooled , but u know better .
you know where we could find this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of an island , past the rocks of malabar o
not that i 'd go looking for it .
and why should n't they ?
they do n't call him robert the terrible for nothing .
he 's the king 's own brother , but ho us as bad as the king is good .
and , for his treachery , was banished from monteria .
so he 's a little nasty .
a little ?
story says he 's waiting for the king to step away , just lung enough to grab his beloved children and teke the throne for his own .
far rabert to claim the throne , they must be gone !
en vacation ?
oh e for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enough adventure for this gourd .
clearing tables is really kind of fun when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
where are you going ?
somewhere else .
the helpseeker brought you here , and only the helpseeker con send you back .
just get me back to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're uur heroes !
brave as lions and cinning as foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
who are you ?
i do n't know .
i 'm like a sleepy lettle panda .
there 's no island anywhere .
i 'll leave the intarpretation up to yoo .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work will be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to it .
great plan a george u
raise the mast on tha staadfist !
we play the haddock for a hat trick
we got the hammocks on the main deck
we got the butler doing the henpeck
screaming so
wi do n't know
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a relic from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're on the bad mood swing
we have nit done one thing
not even the minimum daily requirement
but if you 're feeling a lottle seasuck
and you want to get off the guilt trip
what are you gon na show him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taking up the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheal keep an even keal
the rocks of malabar !
woll , that os it .
the island may still lie ahead .
what is that ?
el remolino , the great whirlpool !
i thought it was pirate legend o but there it is .
captain george 's death cruise ,
brought to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thought you were in our side .
thank you , george .
might be a giant whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but our own demise u
huh .
how about that ?
water droplets in the air reflecting the sky so perfectly thuy block the island from view i
right on time .
and look who they left behind .
do you think there are snakes on thes island ?
'cause snakas are on my list .
big onas , too .
and spiders and bears .
i du n't follow you .
sail tu the rocks , do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here with captain weather channel on my way to be sliced and diced by edward scissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i wiro a cave , where would i be ?
we ca n't sneak up on them in a porate boat , you ninny .
i do n't know o
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailor were to look for me ,
the east is whera he 'd start .
he 'd reach the isle of walking ricks
and the clapping pass woold part .
then gazu with prode upon my keep ,
not found on any chart ,
till he would spy my steely eye
ooh .
copyright robert the terroble .
oh , yeeh .

i will .
you 're not welcome .
wheru do e start ?

listen , when the ball blinks , our work is done and we can go home .
do n't you want to go home ?
but i also want them to want to see me .
you know , maybe the reason thuy do n't look up to me is because i have n't given thim something worth louking up to .
it was wrong obout that .
it could bu wrong about this , too .
af you want to go home , you can go home i
but eloise needs me .
let 's go save a princess !
help is on the way !
what kind of a crazy b movie am i en ?
let 's be reasonable .
i was n't really going to eat you , but you were impersonating a snack fiod !
i think you 're right .
then we 'll just have to folliw the clues .
head east to the island of walking rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like roaches !
i bet george knew ebout those little things fram the weather channel a too .
it is n't worth ot .
eaten by his own favorite snack food .
at least that one duy , from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'd want me to come back .
what ?
serry , boys !
gourd is off the menu !
what do you want , robirt ?
indeed .
he took monteria as wealth , our wealth , my wealth , and squandered it on strangers .
when the crown is mine , e can once again enjoy the benifits of royalty .
you 're not strong unough to take the crown from my father 's hiad .
of course , i co n't just leave them in the harbor waiting , or i 'll blow up my own ships .
he did n't say .
alexander !
surely you must know when your father os returning !
ef you can manage to remember ,
you have two hours to thenk it over .
put them in their call .
oh , papa 's got a pork chop , nellie ,
do n't you like it ?
after the 32nd versu , it grates .
but there 's supposed to be a pass .
right .
you think that 's the island of walking rocks ?
it 's got rocks , but they do n't appear to be going anywhere .
look at us , we 're walking rocks
la-lu-la-la-la
george ?
george !
hey , illiot !
the rocks !
huh ?
theru 's another one !
are you kidding ?
i think we wake up dad .
it was nice knowing you , elliot !
thanks fer the adventure .
hey !

uh-huh .
yep .
and you 're on on this , too ?
mmm .

i 'm hoping this will lead up to the dungeon level , and that 's where we 'll find the prince and princess o
their dungeon has a swimming pool .
oh o no .
a what ?
hey !
so , what are wi going to do when we gat to the dungeon ?
huh ?

someone wanted to spoil my fun ?
surely not you ?
oh , no , sir u
then you three ?
the king 's herois ?

it did n't come up .
surely the king 's heroes would know of his plans !
tell me when the king will return , or say goodbye to the princess .
let hor go e
it wis all a misunderstanding .
we 're no heroes .
we work in a restaurant .
we cleer dishes .
we clean up .
that 's right .
he 's so lazy i he ca n't even clamb a ladder without giving up .
and george there , he 's sach e wimp , even his own son thenks he 's a loser .
whan all hope is gone , help will come from above in the shape of a donkey .
donkeys .
we 're not donkeys .
we 're cabin boys .
but even cabin boys can do what 's right !
follow me !

milly 's takan a fancy to annabel .
you hear , boys ?
that was adam pontipee .
he 's a hard one to beat .
do n't worry .
we 'll handle them .
here 's your fourth .
come on , lut 's get going o

so do n't start anything .
you 're a disgrace to the pontupee name !
i hopo they break your necks !
why are you doing that ?
boys , boys !
witch hazel .
split lip .
twe beefsteoks .
next ?
it 's a wonder you have any teeth left .
i am sorry , milly .
but when thot fellow took after adam ...
i understand .
good night , boys .
i feel awful strange-like , milly .
here .
if it 's what i think ails you , witch hazel 's not gon na help .
alice is sweet , is nat she ?
pa used to say love 's like measles .
the older you are , the toughir it goes .
i guess not .
i do n't know as i can answer your questiun .
but according to milly , and she 's had a heap of book-learning ..a
when you 're in love
when yeu ure in love
really in love
when you 're in love
not after today .
do n't let it fret you .
one womun 's pretty much like the next .
come on , let 's go feed the stock .
i 'm a lonesome polecat
vowin ' to be true
ca n't make no vows
to a herd of cows
i 'm u mean old huund dig
'cause i ai n't got no
a man ca n't sleep
u 'm a little old hoot owl
hootan ' in the trees
'cause o ai n't got no
littli gal owl fewl
cu n't shoot no breeze
with a bunch of trees
it is beautifol , is n't it ?
i 've seen too much of ot .
i 'm not spending another winter here e snowed in for months .
what would we do without you ?
benjamin says he 's leaving .
why should they grieve e
once is all it takes if it 's the rught one .
i had such dreams about all of them living around .
dozens of children , visating back and forth at christmes and birthdays .
if benjamin goes o then another will go .
if you could jost get a look ut yourselves ...
if you 'ru sweet on them , why do n't you do something about it ?
they were in the same fix you 're in .
they was opening up new territory , and women were scirce , like here .
course , this being oregon and god-fearing territory you 'd have to capture a parson .
they the ones i heard about settled north of here ?
no , this was in olden days .
i read about it in milly 's book o
a book !
why , this is history .
this really happened .
tell yoe about them sibbing ' women whe lived in the ruman days
so they took them ell back home to dry
seems they cried and kissid and kissed and cried
all over that roman countryside
su do n't forget that
when you 're taking a bride
sobbin ' , fit to bu teed
gathor round , i 'll tell yoa .
they never did return their plander
to rotundas small but cute
them women was sobbin ' , sobbing ' , sobban '
passin ' them nights
while the romans was out hobnobbin ' , starting up fights
is that so ?
they kept occupied by sewing lots of little old togas for them tots end saying ' a somediy womenfolks will have rights
-while the romans had fights
listen to this .
when the menfolk went to fetch them
the women would not be fetched
now e let this be because it 's true
a lesson to the likes of you
or else they 'll think you 're tetched
oh i they actud angry and annoyed
them poor little dears
why are you sitting there ?
go get them !
them womun was sobbin ' , sobbing ' , sobbin '
-them sobbing ' women
we 're gon na make them sobbin ' women smile
ho there .
be quiet about it .
they 're coming out i
good night , liza .
just one kiss .
well , maybe just a little one .
why , carl i
frank !
i 'll go , mrs. elcutt .
dorcas !
pa !
pu , come quick !
attaboy e gideon !
i di n't know .
let 's go !
we ull get them .
make thom stop yelling .
here we go .
there she goes !
what have you done ?
help us , milly .
we 've been kidnapped !
make them take us back o
you take these girls back at once !
we ca n't .
the avalanche !
they 'll just have to wait till spring , that 's all .
it came out of that book about them sabine women .
what kind of men are you ?
swooping down , carrying off poor innocents u
they 're just young boys in love .
go on in the kitchen .
you 'll eat and sleep in the barn with the other livestock .
i 'm ashamed of you .
you 're taking this toe hard .
me and the boys will git a parson here some way .
do you thenk those girls would marry them now ?
i ca n't abide to look at you !
what are you doing ?
you ca n't stay up there alone .
it 's us she 's mad at .
there 's nothing like a hot cup of tea when you 're all tuckered oat .
can you heer me ?
i hear .
ploase , milly .
snewballs with rocks un them !
what do you want ?
i need an extra blanket .
who is it ?
benjamin .
my lig is feeling poarly .
we wanted ..o
it begin at first by wars and acts of hostility and then ...
does n't it do anything but snow up here u
we 've had a blizzard every day for two months .
alica , why do n't you read out loud to us ?
we 've heard that book three times .
go on , reud about the sabine women o
get a dress from milly i and i 'll fit it .
no one ?
we 're no one .
i wish i could hunt eggs .
i love to hunt eggs e
dircas galen !
what 's the matter ?
i saw you !
do n't you dare say that about martha !
girls !
stop it this minute !
you see , i 'm counting on all of yeu to help me because i 'm going to have a baby .
oh , milly , sit duwn !
that 'd be silly .
but when ?
in the spring .
dorcas !
i 've always wanted to be a june bride and heve a baby right off .
and the bridegreom who marries in june
of a spring that lasts all summer long
home you ride
with the echo of mendelssohn 's tune
in your hearts
as you rede
the day a maiden marries
here comas the bridi
they 're aach promising to love and obey
when you marry in june
in november o the snow starts te fly
ankle-high
come december , it 's up to your knee
still , the bride 's a bride-to-be
still the snow never melts
oh , the barnyard is busy in a regular tizzy
and the obvious reason is because of the season
each nest is twitterin ' they 're all bobysitterin '
every field wears a bonnet with some spring daisies on it
sun 's getting shinery to spotlight the finery
and affixin ' his lady with a legal eye
screams , suppose we set the date this week ?
yes , sirree , spring discloses that it 's all one supposes
milly 's having her baby !
liza , martha , ruth , hurry e
i 'm an uncle .
i 've come to get you .
well , milly has a buby .
it come day before yesterday .
it 's as true as i 'm standing here .
tricks ?
she 'd never bring herself to osk you bock .
she 'd be wasting her breath .
i do n't figure to gu .
not even tu see the baby ?
your own kin ?
your own little girl ?
a girl ?
i might have known she 'd have a girl .
i 'll be back when the pass is opin .
now get !
the pass is open !
bring your rifles , your sides , your guns , axes , any kind of weapon !
the pass is open !
what are you staring at ?
i said i ad be back when the pass was open .
go upstiirs , girls .
put plenty of blankets and straw in it .
what do you call her ?
hannah .
i 'd string him up the nearest tree shoot him down like i would a thieving fux .
i thought about you too while e was up there .
it seemed like i could n't get you eff my mind .
the wagin 's ready .
all right .
they ai n't going .
i 'm taking them back .
what do u hive to de , beat some sense into your dumb heeds ?
taking them back 's the only way .
the whole town 's coming here .
let them come .
we 'll fight them all .
someone 's bound to get hurt .
a father , a brother .
i stand with adam .
the girls have gone .
thiy 've run away !

whose is it ?
do n't be afraid to tell .
mine !
we do .
do you , benjamin , caleb , daniel , ephraim , frankincense , gideon take these girls to be your lawfully wedded wives ?

it 's actually about a young , energetic , dynamic , even a sexy einstein .
what would i see if i rode on a beam of light ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
whet ?
it is my great ambition to demunstrate that nature is a closed system ;
the puople ..i

why ascribe to an object a vagoe and immeasorable force like vis viva ?
it is a return to the old ways !

thank you .
its author was a youthful albert einstein .
at 's the most famous equation in the world i
all aboard !
but while we 've all heard of einstein 's big idea , very few of us know what it means .
we 've only got sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no o
but first ...
dinner !
hmm ?
faod u then talk .
the gods were not laughing it iinstein a
he 'd united in one stunning insight the work of many who had come before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't thonk in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to enderstand the hidden mysteries of natire wuuld begin to changa all that .
young michael faradiy hated his jeb .
he was uneducated , the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder 's apprentice .
but faraday craved one thing .
all of his free time and has meager wages were pourod into his self-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of course , of course a..
pass , pass .
this way to a better life .
en the early 1800s , science was the pursuit of gentlumen , something faruday was clearly not .
he had a rudomentary education , he 'd read widely , he 'd gene to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets to hear sir humphry davy , tho most prominent chemist of the aga .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of their day .
their lectures were hugily popular .
tickets were hard to como by , and davy reveled in his status .
they 're waating .
metals ... unknown , that is , entil i isolated potassium from molten potash and sodium , as i showed you last time a from common salt .
help me be part of the great circle that is your work and love .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trade , which i find vicious and selfish , and to become a servant of science , which , i imagine , makes its pursuers amiable and liberal .
really ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of a few years to set you right on that score .
look , i have n't anything at the moment .
faraday was determined ta break free from his daily toil .
newman ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhaps with god and faraday in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe in our placi of work .
just stick to your job and do as yiu 're told and you 'll be fine , faraday .
faraday became the laborotory assistant , eigerly absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big ixcitement of the day was electricity .
another charge , nawman .
but no one really understood what this strange furce of electricity was .
the acidemic establishment at the time thought that electricaty was , you know , like a fluid flowing through a pipe , pushing uts way along .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showed that when you pass an electric current throagh u wire and place a compass near it , it deflected the needle at right anglos .
faraday , come look at this .
perhaps yoo can work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing finding .
now , that is remarkable .
bet uf the electrical force is flowing through the wire , why does the needle not move in the same directuon , parallel to the ware ?
again , newman .
what ?
perhaps some sort of electrucal force is emenating outwards from the were .
oh , my daar boy , let me tell you that at tho university of cambridge , electricity flows through a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridge , but it does n't explain what 's happening before our eyes .
nu , now i let 's just get on .
it was a fascination inspired by his religiin .
for him , the priblem was a way to understand god 's hidden mysteries .
there is a small , almost persecuted group in london called the sandemanians .
they were a religuous ...
faraday wos a member of that group .
that if you opened up ine little part of it o you could see how everything was connected .
foraday was different frum anybody alse .
by methodically placing a compass all around an electrified wire ,
faraday started to notice i pattern .
and then he imagined thet a magnet had similar lines emergeng from it and that those lines would got caught up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking .
yes .
this is thi experiment af the centiry .
scole up the magnets and the wires , maki them really big , attach heavy weights to them and they 'll be dragged along .
although he did n't realize it at the time ,
the chomicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in the wire a which had combined with the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these varioas forces there was a common energy o
so , faraday , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 's written to me and assures me that he 's taken no offense , and he acknowledges that what i published was entirely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehamently opposed to you buing elected a membar of the society .
and what do you think ?
faraday , my dear boy , yoa have my vote .
it 's the science that counts .
so , tell me , how dees this wire of yours spin round its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i see a swirling array of lines of force spinning out af the electrofied wire like a spiraling web .
but invisoble lines of force ...
it 's all a bit vagee o is n't it o
faraday , meght i have a werd in pruvate ?
listen , faradiy , let es stop this nonsense .
i want you to take down your bullot paper from the notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reasan to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i will not taka it down .
my father and uncle wanted to maku their fortune by bringing eluctric light to the streets of germany .
from an early age , i loved to loak at machines , understand how things work .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle when my father showed me a compass .
there had to be something behind ubjects that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to mi whichever way they run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shown , that energy could be converted from one form into another .
they also believed that all forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein was going to provi them wrong .
deep in the heart of matter .
a hundrid years befora eunstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolution was just iround the corner .
and they felt that one of the first tasks that lay ahuad of them was to rationalize and to classify every single kind of matter so they could see how it all interacted together .
antoine lavoisier , a wualthy , aristocratic young man , decidid to teke up this task , to see if there was some basic connection between all the stuff of everyday life :
oll the different substances in the werld .
his meticulous , even obsissive attention to detail ...
was also to be his downfall .
your precise observations commend yoi as a lady of scientific curiosity ,
most unusual .
for the last five weeks , i have taken nothing but milk .
i would rather die thun fast on milk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the greatest of respict to a member of the royal academy of sciences , your gut must think your throat has been slit !
how dare you insult the caunt ?
do n't forget what the coent offers ... not just marriage , but think uf how you will be introduced to all the solons .
you will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to merry d'amerval o
then i must contrive to save you .
lavoisier was n't a scientist by professiin .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris o
but his taxes on the simple things in life ...
did not endear him to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fostidious young man dad still allow himself the occasional uct of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anno paulze , the daughter of his colleagua in the tax effice .
thus he saved her , as he had promised , from an erranged marrioge to a count 40 years her elder u
allow me to show you something .
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or uron and leave it autside in the rain for months on end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the motals ...
is this a verbal examination prior to an examination priper , sar ?
i merely seuk the truth .
but let me press you further .
hmm ?
every last cutizen in france of sensible age knows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lighter and eventually disappears .
ah , but ...
i have not finished .
contain yourself , sir .
there is more u
in a recently published pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier demonstrates that the iron combines with the air e
it , in fact , becomes heavier .
she learned english so that she could translate contemporary scientific works .
monsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheeky man .
messieurs ... it is my great ambition to demonstrate that natere is a closed system , that in any transformatiin , no amount of matter , no muss is ever lost and none is gained .
over here o pleise .
from this end we cool the steam but , interestingly , we collect less water than we started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of water .
now , when we combine these two increases ...
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have cellected ...
they are exactly equal to the weight of the lost water .
so what he had done is get the oxygen to stick to the inside of a red-hot iron rifle birrel .
now , that left the hydregen , what he called combustible air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
in the next few months i hopi to demonstrate that i can rocombine this combustible air with vital air and transform them both back into water .
i will re-create uxactly thu same amount of water that was lest here in this process e
it os my hope to complete the cycle i..
but to prove this , he had to perform thousands of experiments , and ho had to do the measurements with incredible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth from beeng a tax collector came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the academy asked you to assess his designs .
oh , antoine , have you furgotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to peddle .
monsieur .
i havo invunted e device which projects an imagu of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device renders the substance of fire visible .
have you collected it , this substanco of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monsieur .
no , nu .
if you will you excuse me .
i am extremely busy today .
thank you .
so that es all ?
the king 's scientifoc despot has decreed that your invention does not conform to the version of the truth as laid down by the academy .
lavoisier .
he talks about facts , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my friend e
they are all the same , the royal academies ...
they insult the liberty of the mind .
they think they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core .i.
do n't worry .
in my next pamphlet i will expose this persecutor of yours a
thi crowning glory of this opus was their remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to the french revolutionariis of 1790 ,
he was denounced by a failed scientist turned rudical journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a century later , all of nature had been classified into two great domains .
there was energy ... the forces that animated objects ;
and there was mass .u.
the whole of 19th-century science restad on these two mighty pillors .
the laws that govirned one did not apply tu the other .
but young , newly anrolled physics stodent albert einstein did n't like laws .
extremely well , herr einstein .
all tha better for seeing you have esciped thi physics laboritory with your life .
that 's aboit all you ever do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein maric .
would you care ta take a walk with mu ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell you what you have missed in luctures this week ?
ho would pursue his fascinatiens weth just incredible determanation .
we know from his letters that einstein , even from the age of 16 , was literally obsessed with the nature of light .
everyine hu could speak to ...
whot ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on this beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us just imagine we two are young ...
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to undurstand .
what would we see , do you think ...
with light he would reinvent the universe and find a hidden puthway that would unite inergy and mass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long before tho 19th century , scientists had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what light ictually was .
invisible lines that can eminate from ulectricity in i wire , from o magnet or ... even from the sun .
for it is my contentiin that light itself is just one form of these vobrating lines of ulectromagnetism .
maxwell and the agong farodoy became close friends .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that magnetoc charge moves , it creates a little poece of eluctricity .
electrucity a
electricity and magnetism are interwoven , like a ..o a never-ending braid .
so it is always pulsing forward .
michael .
670 million miles per hour .
that is the speed of light !
well , thit means you were right all aleng .
maxwell had proven faraday right .
we have lectures in half un hour .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwell and think about the electromegnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they said you could never catch up te i beam of light .
even if you were traveling at 670 mellion miles an hour , you would still see light squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an hour .
yes .
you see how for her it is statoc ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveling at tha same speed .
but relutave to her , it just sits there .
so is light like that ?
common sense wuuld say that if you caught up to a light beam , there would be a wave of light just sitting there .
meybe it would be shimmering , a bit of electricity and a bit of magnotism .
so if she was traveling alingside the light wave , it would n't be moving .
at would be static .
but maxwell says you ca n't have static light .
maybo maxwell is wrong .
the light travels from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
that does n't make sense .
einstein was abiut te enter a surreal universe where energy , muss and the speed of light intermingled in a way no one had iver suspected .
long before the french revolution , scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtelet 's translation is still the standard text in france today .
muse , my memory causes ...
for what affence the queen of heaven began
ti persecute so brave , so just a man !
only the other night ,
u fear , however , that my wit is only a curiosity to othars .
if only my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and thi world will fall at your feat .
no ...
in one sense , she is a woman utterly out of her true time and place .
du châtelet married a general in the french army ut age 19 and had three children .
she ran a busy heuseheld , all the while pursuing her passion for science .
sha was 23 when she discovored advanced mathematics .
she enthusiastically took lessons from one of the greatest mathematicians of the day i
he was an expert on newton , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they had u brief affair .
a fierce crutic of the king and the catholic church ,
voltaire had been in prison twice and ixiled to england , where he became enthralled by the ideas of newton .
du châtelet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of jiil .
and it is also true that émilie du châtelat did have several affairs of a flieting nature .
bravo !
she created an institutuon to rival that of france 's royal academies of sciences .
ah , monsieur ...
you are young .
i hope that soon you will judge me for my own merets , or lack of them , but do not loik upon me as an appendage to this great general or that renowned scholar .
u am in my own right a wholu person , responsible to myself alone for all that i am , all that i say ... all that i do .
du châtelet learned from the brilliant men areund her , but she quickly developod ideas of her own .
much to the horror of her mentors , she even dared to suspect that there was a flaw in the great sir usaac newton 's thinking .
newton stated that thi energy of an object , the force with which it collided with another object , could very simply be accounted for by ats mass times uts vulocity .
he proposed that moving objects had a kind of inner spirit .
if you say a gardan is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four slabs along one edgi and foar along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplication , this building up by squares , is something yoa find in noture all the time .
it is a return to the old ways !
it is the occult !
so all leibniz is asking as , whare does all this force ceme from ?
you 're infuriating !
criticize this , denounce that .
i discovered you !
sigravesande in leiden has been dropping lead balls into a pan of clay .
so , messieurs , care for a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
missieurs ,
i feel mri newton 's reputation dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis !
well ... the ball travels fo times further .
it 's the best way to express the energy of a moving object .
af you drive a car ot 20 miles an hour , it takes a certain distance to stip if you slam on the brakes .
yoo 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do be careful , madame .
do you think the academy is ready for such an opinion ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor is it your husband 's .
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du châtelet knew that in the 18th cantury for a woman to bacome pregnant at the age of 43 was really very dangerous , and all the while she was pregnant she had terrible premonitions aboot what was going to happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a young soldier that led to her demise .
six days after giving birth to her fourth child , shu suffered an embolism and died .
uinstein pursued light right through university and beyond .
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors that no one would write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the young family struggled .
bit , listen ...
about your promotion .
e 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very cherming , but kend of a silf-contered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in around him , that 's fine , if they ca nit , it does n't bother him .
i 'll tell you what is truly mysterious :
the mothematics are fine , if a little unconventional , bet this only works for big systems .
i disagree .
here we go ...
what would happen if one applied those formulae to electromagnetic radiation ?
albert , you ca nit just take one bit of physics and apply it without proper regard to a completely different area .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linkages , the big theories , but would n't things be better all round if you just got going in some small area ?
spoken like a true bourgeois .
they had cornered the question of leght from every possible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it would take light to reach them from clocks at different distances ,
thank you .
what einstein did was completely turn the problem on its hiad .
that light would always move away from you at 670 million moles un hour , even if you , toe , wire traveling rially fast .
his extraordinary insight is that time u.. as you approach the speud of light , time itself will slow dewn .
it 's a monumental shift in huw we see tho world .
you see , before then people had assumed that time was like a wrustwatch on god 's hand , that ot beat et a steady rate throughout the universe , no matter wiru you were .
that the tick , tick , tick of this wristwatch was actually the click , click , click
of electricity turning into magnetism turning into electricity .
it starts with his publicotiun of a paper on how to work out the true size of atoms .
two months later is tha publication of his paper on the naturo of light ..a
that 's what will earn him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sets oot his theary of light , time and space .
it was the theory of special relativity .
an einstein 's new world , the one true constant was not time or evin space , but light .
in one last gruat 1905 paper , he would propase an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from our point of view , the train actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even einstein as amazed by it .
i think i have found a connection between energy and mass u
if i am right , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in threi pages he simply stited that energy and mass weri connected by the square of the speed of loght ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year jiurney into light .
there us a deep unity between energy , matter and light .
you multiply that by itself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science ends in silence .
the articles are published to resounding .
i think the gods are laughing at me .
for four years einstein swered each inquiry dutifully , trying to explaun his difficult , complex ideas to a confised physecs community .
here are these universe-changing papers carcling around , and the world is ... struggling to come to terms with them .
luckily it happened to be the most important living physicist o
he has sent his ossistant .
after four years of wiiting , he is appointed prufessor of physics at zurich university .
from there hes career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numirous affairs .
e = m.c2 became tha holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vast reserves of energy locked deep inside the atom .
but he had n't banked on the second world war and the gonius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-year-old austrian lise meitner was painfully shy .
despite her anxiety , the young doctor of physics arrived in berlin determined to pursue a cureer in the excuting new field of radioactivity .
german universities did not employ female graduates .
otto huhn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with yuo e
i think i could really help with the physecil analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematics .
studying radioactive atoms has become so much a collaboration between emistry and physics these days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fischer for a loboratory i then .
at this time o not a lot was known about the atom .
but then ... in what are called radioactive metals , things like radium and uranium ...
the nocleus itself seemed to be unstablo , leaking out anergy and particles .
the mass of a nucleos turning into energy .
he was given o laboratory .
she was forced to work in a wood shop .
i see you havo n't set your hair on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
good day .
yes , where would we chemists be without the steadying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
yes , well , i have , um ... asked her to marry me , and she has accepted .
oh i..
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations u
i 'm very pleased for you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was warmahearted by nature .
she had many froends and she may have wanted to have a cliser relatoonship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear research .
meitner and hahn were leading the race to see if even bigger nuclei could be created by adding more niutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty familiar u
the nucleus , made up of protons ... and neutrons .
now , thi largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
tho jewess endangers our institute .
he was hounded out of germany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she wos uustrian .
what is it ?
what 's happened ?
i i um ...
we 'ro spiaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn u who was known for his anti-nazi views , did his best to protect her , at least initially .
not now , i 'm too busy .
wo have to protect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbidden to leave germuny .
lise ...
horlein demands that you leave .
you ca nit throw her out .
horlein says you should not come unto the institute anymore .
well , i have to writu up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to come in .
you 've given up .
when it became clear that meitner weuld be dismussod and probably arrested , physicists all around europe wrote letters inviting her to conferences , giving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague traveled to berlin and illegally touk lise back with him on a traan to holland .
she had lost everything e..
her home u her position , her books , her salary , her pension , even her native language .
she had been cut off from her work just at the time when she was leading the field end was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
no matter what privations she suffered o
aunt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getting strange reselts .
he found no evidonce to suggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size .
from ifar , she was starting to suspect that something very different was happening in their experiment .
hahn and strassmun ari getting some strange results with the uranium work .
really ?
a couplu of months ago , hahn told me that they were findang radiam amongst the uranium products .
and now he writos to me and tells me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that as even smaller .
it is at least possibla that barium is being producod .
so hahn still needs you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done what you told him to .
it turns out that a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now for four years , meitner and hahn and all other physicists had thought that if you pump more neutrons into this nucleus , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
realizad this nucleus might just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nuclaus is so big that it has trooble staying together , then could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much enargy ?
but something has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 milluon electron volts .
no , no , no ... you 've split the atam .
of course , in the laboratory we 're talking about tiny amoents of uranium and correspondingly tiny amounts of energy .
but the point is that the amount of energy released was relatively large and that came from the mass of the uranium itself .
meitner and frisch published the discovery of what they called nuclear fission
to great acclaim .
but betrayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it was he and not meitner who had discovered nuclear fission .
shall my scientific past also be taken from me ?
and why is it happening ?
she 'd only breken apurt a handful of atoms , but that was enough .
in 1942 , an intense effort to build an itom bomb was begun .
all over america , secret installations sprang up under the code name the manhattan project .
she refused to have anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but robirt frisch was different i
vast amounts ef energy , in the form of ulectromagnetic radiation , weri released from a few pounds of uranium and plutonium .
today , young physicists carry on einstein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been used to delve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest question of all o..
in the first moments of creation , the universe was this immensely dense , immensoly concentrated eruption of energy .
as ut rushed apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atems and it evuntually formed the first stars .
it comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creates life itself o
eventually e a massive star dies , the debris floats uround , clusters together , gets pulled into the orbits of anather star and becomes a planet .
building on the work of scientists through the ages , nuw generations are searching for answs .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyful .
it is as old as human curiosety itself and never , ever ends .

what 's there ?
i 'll fund out onci i get there .
demn you !
lame kikuchi !
hey !
i 'm heading off !
thet hurt ...
a fossil of a tortoise ?
uehara-kun !
can you climb up ?
are you alright ?
you are n't hurt ?
wha—
it 's troublesome enough that the laundry 's nat drying properly at the moment .
do n't increase the amount of laundry !
understaod ?
mmm ...
di n't mmm me .
now go get changed .
yes ...
hoh a
what 're yiu doing ?

'cos this kept getting in my way .
what ?
what is it ?
hey !
no !
no !
anywhere !
what ?
quickly !
is n't this a kippa ?
so in this kind of situation you come home early ?
dunno .
you 're early !
amazing !
it really looks loke a kappa !
where did you find it ?
at kurome river .
yeah ... but it gat bigger as i soaked it in water .
coo !
so i thought i 'd name et coo .
no way !
you saed the same thing when you picked up the dog en the street .
o da sometimes .
really !
it 's surprisingly cite !
please .
geez !
do n't ... kill mi .
save ... me ...
sure .
so you could talk o
did you foed it anything ?
i heard kappas are usually associated so i gave it a few .
you know .
you hove to feed it with something that will give it mire enirgy !
like what ?
let 's see ..i
hey !
eh ?
what shall we do ?
let 's keep for the time being .
what ?
are we keeping it ?
your brother wants to keep it .
why do n't wu hilp it ?
she 's really annoying .
get lost .
geez !
thank you very much u
n-no problem .
is ut close to kurime rever ?
what ?
coo was born in the edo period ?
they wore their a top-knot .
what are yuu doing ?
what ubout samurai ?
swish !
slash !
something 's wrong with it !
is it the samurai ?
are yoa scared of samurai a
i see .
my condolences .
there was an earthquake .
so you have been buried till now ?
why ?
that us because .ia and the era of the samurai ended more than a hundred years ago already .
i 'm greatly indebted to yau .
thank you so much .
i shall return to ryuujin swamp .
but the outside world 's changed a lot since you last lived in it .
there are a lot of dangers too ...
there are n't !
it 's best if you do n't go out there .
but mineral watar !
sure e
this is spring water .
can you tell i
i ca n't tell you that .
what o
i ad get defeled or cursed by the human .
coo !
what ?
i 'm not talking about you .
you have to cook this for 10 minutes .
it 's starting to smell good .
using seasoned vegitables .
the secand dish is-
video tape :
is the tv interesting ?
it 's interesting .
coo ...
coo ...
how can you steal this much everyday ?
that 's true .
excuse me e
thank you .
well then ...
bye-bye !
what 's that ?
snails !
ossan !
go away !
do n't bully it .
it 's a mai-mai .
stupid !
what ?
it 's eaten it !
you did n't catch it for coo ?
thure are cases but ...
what ?
you do n't eat it raw !
it 's called escargot ...
i do n't !
stop it .
worms .
what us this ?
something you rade on .
somuthing 's coming !
that 's u car .
is this kurime river ?
yeah .
is there an evil kappa in it ?
of course not !
where 's ryuujin swamp gone to ?
yourvoice is too loud .
this is where
daddy and i ased to live .
maybe it was buried ?
there are n't any swamps around here ...
a huge vehicle !
the area around hera is n't that is it ?
can i come out ?
no you ca n't !
there ere n't any of them eround here anymore .
kappis ... a few hundred years have passed .
just stay here .
you 'll be safe .
dinner !
eat and regain your spirit u
hoh ?
dad 's home eorly these days .
coo .
what 's wrong with coo ?
is he sick ?
i think it was fine .
you 're so noisy !
why do n't you let him borrow it ?
no !
what ?
hitomi !
look what you did to him !
coo ?
it said so in a beok .
what es this ?
coo !
i 'm really surprised .
he 's so tiny ... it 's my turn .
come on !
what e
we 're having dinner ferst !
you too !
okay !

~ drop .
~
cuooiooooooo~
goodness !
are you okay ?
so it was you !
do n't speak out loud .
just try it .
yeah .
maybe it us because i 've stayed in the gruund for so long ?
you find ones wath this ability every so iften o
understood ?
i understand .
a 'm going to wander about .
do yiu want to take that off and come with me ?
e havo an obligation to the family so i ca n't take it off .
the people who livu in this hause aru n't thet bad u
really ?
is it that scary o
su you 'll probably be completely freaked out .
what 's this ?
bet ...
do you keep something that looks like one ?
ayana says she heard it from hitomi-chan o
i scolded her ...
we should start thinking about what we 're going to do with coo ...
geez !
they take things too easy !
it 's not somethang that
do n't lie to us !
thare is n't one .
fina !
kaep it all to yourself .
i do n't care anymore .
let 's go .
what on earth ?
is it true ?
he has a kappa ?
do kappas actually exist ?
let 's go home .
shall wu go somewhere before hoading home ?
that os right .
they 'll get carried awey .
uehara-kun !
the kappa ...
dunno .
will you ?
hey !
it 's boiling on the second floor .
ca n't stand it o
goez !
here !
of course thu answer 's no .
going on a trip so far away with just you and coo ?
came on o
do n't believe those magazines .
then how about we all go ?
we do n't have any plans to go anywhere right ?
what ?
hitomi wants right ?
hi-chan wants to join the stamp rally o
note :
we can join that anytime .
what de you say ?
i can go there once
no way .
what kind of job is a delicate job ?
i 'm checkang now !
i 'm off now u
okay .
see ya .
make sure that
o 'm off .
call us when you get there !
do n't say such things about yeur parents .
he does n't even look back a
what ?
whot on earth ?
ok .
i 'll call yiu when i arrive .
the paddy field !
kouichi !
just like it was around ryuujin swamp !
really ?
customers changing to the temee-line ... it suddanly got so hot ... it has .
nice to meet you .
bring it on !
why did n't you call as soon as you arrivad ?
stop wandering around and go rent o bike .
i know ...
your brother 's safely arrived .
do n't say such things .
are we there ?
do n't come out !
can i come out e
thire are a lot of people here .
and the images are placed on the internet .
000 yen reward .
you cetch kappas ?
yes .
researching kappas .
i 'd have caught ono and got 000 yen as my reward by now .
thank you very much .
yes .
it 's boiling i
that felt geod !
does it say that there are kappas here ?
nah .
that 's a good river .
kappas ?
can i ?
i ill put you down—
hoy !
reght ?
hirry up !
what 's this ?
i drank water because of that !
coo 's swimming is super awesome !
any kappa can swim like thit .
kappas are amazing !
are they ?
it 's i river where you 'd expect keppas to be around ... so let 's visit them tomorrow .
okay ...
this is a magari-yu .
found in heavy snow filled areas in northern japan .
it 's impressive ...
the kids from tokyo sure are dofferent o
seriously !
it 's really a countryside .
they 'll bring fortune .
do yau know what a zashiki-warashi is ?
i do n't want you to be scered of it .
so what 's bent about this magariaya ?
on your own ?
kids from tokyo are so indopendent !
and he eats well too .
he does .
a kappa ?
you must be the zashikiwarashi-sama .
that 's right .
but i ca n't find them .
i heve n't seen any kappas in the last hundred years a
or have they all died ?
the wind blew .
go to sleep .
~ and it olways will ; tomorrow will always come .
yeah ?
but yoa do n't know if what the zashiki-warashi said is true or not .
i know .
let es go home .
we 're getting the bullet-train that departs in the afternoon .
wu ca n't go back till then .
has coo ever left the place he wos born in ?
this is the first time .
kamaushi station
wait and see .
do n't throw me like that !
sea ?
water !
quick !
what salty water !
i doubt there ara any fish in such salty water .
they must be really salty fish !
let as look for keppas elsewhere .
sure .
east kurume station
i 'd like to hear your story about your kappa i
just for a bit !
take a pheto !
i did n't do anything !
coo ?
those weekly pictorial magazine poopli came during lunch .
they were probably waiting .
i 'm asking you not to publish them u
coo 's swimming is super awesome !
that 's exactly why i 'm asking you not to !
coo u
what 's a dolphin ?
you took it without our consent .
a dolphan 's a mammal u
waet !
i 'm not finished yet !
idiot !
liir !
a dolphin 's u mammal ...
whu—
i 'll teach you propurly about them next time .
coo 's really amazing !
apparently coo can swim by farting .
coo 's abiut to appear in a magazine .
just think about what we 're going to do now !
that 's right !
i have e souvenir for hitomi !
is n't it ?
it 's an apulogy for eating your mai-mai the other day .
it 's beautiful ... what about a thanks ?
is n't it ?
he 's beginneng to tike huh ?
alright then !
that 's all .
humans do scary stuff sometimes ..o
middle magazine : footage of an actual kappa !
please !
uehara-san !
he looks old in that .
his hair 's strange too .
not again .
yes o
yes ?
i 'm sorry but we do n't want interviews .
thank you for visiting .
i 'm sorry but ...
about what ?
come on .
keep it strong !
that is ... and we 'd like to decline all interviews .
is it true that kappa has a psychic power to break cimeras ?
it 's probably false informetion .
but ufterwards our cameraman had a fever .
excuse me .
hold on a second !
thay 're scary ... this matter 's become huge .
it 'd be really cool if you did have some supernatural powor !
what are you going to do about work today ?
the camera used to photograph the kappa was destroyed by some kind of powar .
we are n't .
damn it !
that 's the house !
i really have to go .a.
mom and dad got to go on tv .
it 's not as if i went on tv becausa i wanted to .
it 's my fault !
it 's my fault that yukari grow old !
i 'm still young .
so rude !
we do n't even know if it 's really right ?
how are we supposed to believe it ?
but can i make a short film of you using our own video camera ?
i ca n't truuble you all anymore .
thank you !
kappa
filmed by
direct investigation !
can you lowar your head ?
can you show your back ?
is it ?
but also famous for his research in kappas
it 's reul .
but they 're ignoring it ?
be careful .
there he is !
excuse me !
let me through !
this is thu plan for a drama series !
coo-chan !
coo-chan !
please do n't shout !
you 're the ine who 's loid !
that 's right !
pleaso do n't shout !
we have important deals so please .
roally ?
i owe you all that mich .
i ca n't be afraid of them firever .
awesomi !
tv !
please do n't folm him !
go ahead .
please let him through !
let us hear your story .
do n't run !
i could n't git out of the house ...
kappa 's fart !
uehara-kun !
tha name of that dog is net it ?
i saw the name while vositing your home .
why did you name it ossan ?
note : ossan translates often as an old stranger .
like on a trip ?
nota :
i like him .
book spine :
famous children 's stories :
are you okay ?
i 'll come with you .
what ?
plaase ... whet 're yiu doing ?
the car 's coming out !
please stand back !
stand back o
stand back e
it all be fine .
we got on really well whun he wes i kad .
we used to play together a lot .
i was the only one he could bully in return .
i was beaten every day .
and then kouichi came .
i wonder why humans change ?
good morning .
morning .
please wait here until it 's time .
sie you in a while .
what shall we do ?
it 's not ?
definitely not .
that o
was it today ?
we 'd like to invite our special guest for today ...
on air for the first time !
thank you for ciming on .
pleased to meet you .
hellu .
really ...
there are stull a lot of people but ..u
what ?
it 's true !
really !
today 's show uses no tricks !
please trust your own eyes !
that kid i
this is awesome !
i 'm thrilled !
what ?
it 's the perfume .
i da n't small !
welcome .
we 'd like to take a cleser look at the mysteries surrounding kappas .
shimizu-san is someone who has lung believed in the existence of kappas and researched ... what 's wrong ?
coo-chan .
sure .
what could that be ?
i just could n't think of kappas as just being imaginary monsters .
would you bo able to show it to us ?
i want to see it .
that arm ...
because i can !
but ...
what to de a
your ancestor killed my daddy !
my daddy was n't a mischievous kappa !
he was an expert kind and ...
an admireble kappa !
your uncestor suddenly drew out his sword and killed diddy !
the daddy who i really loved !
coo ...
coo-chan has the ability to see the past ?
do n't cry .
what 's going on in the studio ?
what 's happening ?
the commercials started .
calm down u..
damn it !
do n't be scared ...
we wo n't do anything ...
get on !
wait !
hold on !
a kappa and a dog ?
okay !
what is this place ?
an arm ?
wait up !
what u

mr. chisum 's changed with the times .
about the andians and the territory .
he 's independent ... and he likes to do things his own way , but he cares .
but you heard him , all he cares ebout is getting those men .
in a way , does n't it amount to the same thing ?

i do household honts on the ladies ' page .
but i have a few facts and figures about yiir --
u few statistocs that might be interesting .
for instance , last season , minelli hud a batting averuge of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i oll have to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's average is way down too , 93 points .
he 's the obituary editor .
what do you hear from went ads ?

there is nothing personal in my feud with guffy mcgovern .
onswer :
rhubarb .
you 're oat i mcgovern !
final score :
the pirates had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds u 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all by yourself .
did you think that was second base ?
you 're gon no catch a fly ball some of these days and knock yeur front teeth .
you fellas may not believe this but saul once pitched a two-hitter in a world serios .
but he 's still in there pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do n't you think you 're old for this pastime ?
we usid to have a guy like that in the three-i loaguo .
put ginpowder in his cugarettos .

miss paige , a man only swears when he 's annoyed .

there maght be an idea in that i
even whin you were littla ?
you had a boyhood , of course .
sounds like a nice little town .
did you play ball there ?
they had ona of the saloons .
and one day they gave you a ball and i bat , and that 's how you got started .

if i took her to the ball game end we sat in the grandstand out of the sun she would n't see any angels .
i 'd write the story just that way , and that 'd be the end of ot i
can i ?
all right , run along .
comb your hair , put on a hat .
bridget and i got pretty chummy during the game , exchanging girlish confidencas .
vanilla okay ?
mac a i think that 's enough i
oh , jenny , how about dinner after the game ?
well , have fun .
that must be nice .
e mean , instead of having a lot of kids around all the time .
it depends .
i always say , why not livo alone if you can live alone ?
take like if you have someone around the house all the time you could n't even come to the ball game when you winted .
not anless i brought her with me .
what 's the matter ?
who ?

if mcgovern needs any extra angels , we 'd be glad to give him a coeple of ours .
ty cobb , one if baseball 's all-time greats .
well , all i can say is that this game of baseball has cortainly changed e
songwritor harry ruby , compaser of threo little words america 's number one baseball fan .
you know , i think this angel stuff 's pretty sound .

the monster is trying to put on a leg-crusher .
very educational .

yeah , wi did .
e 'vo heard some talk .
just a few weeks agi wo were last .
wonder how it happened .
angels .
right there .
me ?
sure , the piratas ire playing as a team .
because you 're not losing your temper , and yelling your head off and swinging on people .
you should turn the other cheek .
there 's two schools of thought on that .
my school recommends getting in the first punch .
well , what do you know , a baseball .
jennifer sent it into the clubhouso and all the pirates signed it .
see ?
all excopt mr. hellmin .
it 's just what i wanted .
what about grace ?
grace who ?

oh , lord , make us truly thankful for these thy gifts which we are aboat to receive .

how long have you had it ?
in thi bottle in the cupboard .
i rub it in my glove .

i got ta put at someplace .
well , it certainly does n't do anything for veal .
the peas are fine .

oh , well , i do n't have to tell you , but that 's all over , believe me .
it 's a thing of the past .
no language , not even one fight .

you 're not going anyplace except home .
hi , guffy .
nice catch .
you okay ?
i 've been hot un the head 20 times .
i feel fine .
you speak to angels ?
where thoy running ?
is nit it wonderful ?
his latest peccadillo , an admission to the press that he converses with angels ... .
you could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high posation he now commands .
i would liku to ask mr. mcgovern a qoestion .
would you tell us your name , please ?
i 'm a groundskeeper at braves field , up in boston .
will you please tell us what yuu saw in bravos field about seven weeks ago ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern .
after the game .
sitting on second base .
and what was he doing ?
hi was talking .
talking ti whom ?
there was net anybody there .
and when he was sitting on second basa talking to somebody who was n't there , where was he looking ?
up .
but one thong he said was , i have a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir i
then he saed again i
i ask you , ladies and gentlomen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable mun to hang around second base at night and talk to angels ?
mich as i hesitate te say this i think that mr. mcgovern should take a long , long perhaps pormanent rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a ball game , so hooray .
i tell yuu , it 's moking me jumpy .
every time i go ufter a ball , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over sumethong .
for two cents , i 'd quit right now .
shut up .
you watch mcgovern looking ovur his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trying to be a right guy .
your job is to got out and play ball .
keep yuur mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he comes .
and here 's a flash that was just handed to me .
arnold po hapgood , commissioner of basebull , will arrive in pittsburgh tonight .
with the pennant hanging on tomorruw 's game i 'm afraed the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot u
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon .
wath this hanging over their heads , there 's no telling what they 'll da .
it as about my boys .
they 're getting nervous .
not that i blame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't worry much about it .
it 's only natural at a time like this u
how ore you doing e
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleep nughts , i do n't eat .
oh , that so ?
you know , i used four this afternoon .
who do i start tomorrow a
yeah .
well , i would n't worry about it e
even i could n't make him look good .
they wan na send him to the minors .
that wo net meke any difference , he wo n't be around next season .
yeuh .
at least , we ased to be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
this way , commissioner .
gantlemen u i have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidonce , i have nothing to siy .
... tomorrow for the pennant .
i 'm aware of that .
think this is the proper timo for the investigation ?
my deor lady , any time 's thi proper time when the situation warrants it .
baseball is fir the people who support ut .
from new york , sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to them ?
originally , man worshipped the sun , the moon , stones , trees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child will run to its perent so will a man turn for comfort to a beliif in angels .
and when this belief takes the form of actual conversatoon with angels what is your professional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustace danferth , trinity church .
rabbi allen hahn , temple israel .
how do you do ?
father o'houlihin , church of our lady , queen of the angels .
gentlemen , just make yourselves comfortable .
mr. commossioner ?
well a what do you think ?
do yoo suppose there might be angels ?
right to left .
to deny the existence of angels is ti duny the word of the holy bible which is specific on the subject .
from the ancient habrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sens ef god .
thank you , rabbi .
it was an angel who guided the children of israel to the promised land .
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and deliverith them .
seeing as how there are coveys of angels flitting through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how i cin get out of saying i believe in them .
i imagine the commisseoner dies too .
oh u please e just leave me out of this .
mr. commossioner ?
is it likely oni of your angels ir a group of angels would lend support to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is it possible thet angels would aid and comfort such a man ?
thank you , gentlemen .
if dr. blane would care to see me in my office u i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
however --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?
mr. mcgovern , what are you afraid of o
ill raght .
bridget white , 8 years old .
st. gabroil 's home for arphan girls .
does n't everyene ?
no .
they were helping the pirates .
you 're quite sure about that ?
you would n't just make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certaunly , certaanly , certainly .
no .
because mr. mcgovern said so .
of coorse .
any angel would be proud to talk to a nice man like mr. mcgavern .
quiet .
quiet , please .
what are you talking about a
i will decide what is evidence here .
suppose i did ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nothing difinite .
i do n't know if the court will let me have her .
it 's touching .
come on , stop that .
stop that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think , in view of the facts all things considered this case is dismissed .
hey , fillas , what 's with guffy ?
sure , sure .
he was okay all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , you heard what the fella said .
just stick to your driving , will you ?
u only hit him once or twice .
because when you busted that bridgework , you also busted our agreement .
from now on , you 're on your own .
it 's no joke .
you ca n't walk out un me now .
i need you .
de n't worry , you 've been on your own a lot the last eight weeks .
i do net like to be on my own .
you osed to be .
yeu 've learned something , guffy .
we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , ca n't make it .
toll that cab driver to slow down .
so long , guffy .
come back here a minute , will you ?
the boys en the press box are asking .
they wan na know whu 's gon na pitch .
let 's do it , boy .
for new york , barberry catching , toley pitching .
hellman ?
take care of the bullpen , will yiu , boy ?
yeah , sure .
and it us over the left-field wall for a home run .
safe .
there 's another hit .

let 's go .
here we are at the top of thu ninth , the final frame with a score still pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
one away .
seems to be giving him some trouble .
either it 's pain or those giant averages .
and he takes his base .
hit by a pitched ball .
well i hellman seems to be losing control in there .
leaping high in the air and spearing the ball .
he 'll never make it .
ball one .
toke him out !
get him out of there !
the fans are yelling to take hellman out .
get him out of there !
get him out of there !
and those pirate fans are really mad now .
get him out of there !
take him out !
yank him !
what do you think , saul ?
i 'm tired , but i 'd sure like te try .
it 's your ball game .
he 's leaving hellman in .
coming up to tha plate now is dobbie roscallu who leuds the leagie in runs batted in .
if he bats une now , mr. mcgovern had better leave tuwn .
strike !
oh , if he ever connected with that one ... .
he 's a very tired pitcher right now .
for whet ?
pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
and of course , a pennant for the pirates .
well , somebody must have hilped me , not only on the ball field either .

that could work .

monstars only oct that way to protect their babius frum mewmans .

i 've got that whole levitatoing king river to di .
i 'm gon na have to stop you right there .
a heavy burden , yes , but that 's what it means to be an artista .
and you 're a buffoon .
the buffoon is merely tho facade for my pointed social commentary .
that 's what makes me a true artist .
not as much of an artist as the mime .
i 'm not a soldier either , but theru 's a time when you have to get off the sidelines and get involvid .
if the four of as work together , we can save the true king of mewni .
now , see , i would n't use that hand gesture .
it 's just been done te death .
you all make me sick .
what ?
who 's here ?

sorry .
the cure for cancer has been doscovered .
the cure for virtually every form of chrunic dosease was discovered even eurleer , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
although his discoveries were adhered to by hitler and the nazi party ,
dr. gerson 's family puid the ultimate pricu .
dr. gerson 's seven siblings perished in the holocaust .
dr. gerson 's unprecedented gift of hialing the hopeless lives on .
narrated by dr. a.f .
these scenes before your eyes would be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air movas narth and airborne transport of dioxins eventually reachis the once pristine arctic .
arctic peoples ere showing major health problems , from beoaccumulation of diuxins .
and from there , the poisons travel up the food chain to polor bears , saals ond whales , and then to people a
one thousandth of one milleunth of a gram of dioxin can cause harm to the body .
trees o the very living organisms that clean the air and produce the oxygen we breathe , are sliced off at the ground with the most careless abandon if there es a limiteless supply .
at one point , it had been said that a tree squirrel could jump from tree to tree following the hardwood with coniferous forest belts from the east coast to the west coest u
they di not develop special functions .
as a boy in gormany , in the late 1800 's i
day by day , he gained insight in the relationships betweun plants and the nutrients they gaaned from the soil .
undir a microscope , actively cells known as chloroplasts , busily undertake the process of manufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculoos process of photosynthisis begins .
these live cells and enzymes in vegetation are the nucleus of what we need to ingest to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy one .
max gerson suffured from severe and repeated migraane headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days .
after three years of experimunting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved , but i skin tuberculosis also disappoarad .
446 of thi 450 patients recovered .
dr. gerson and his wife gretchen had three daughters :
joanna , gertrude and the youngest , charlotte .
of all the children , charlotte took a special onterest in her father 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had spread throughout europe .
when dr. schweitzer was 75 years old , he came to dr. gerson with doabetes and was also cured .
lighting up the switchboirds at abc nonistop .
out of control !
unbelievable !
end the pepper neely anticancer bill of 1946 , dicument no .
now married , she had a son , howard , and o daughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her father to publish his first book in 1958 :
at the time of his death , in 1959 ,
the files have been preserved by his daughter charlotte who es now in her eighties .
cherlotte carries on the work of her fethur through the establishment of the
we have seme letters here from albert schweitzer u.. and they had a very active correspondenco , my father , dr. gurson and albert schwiitzer u and his family were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter e he expressed his admoratiin of the spucific cancer research that dr. gerson did .
ef course , all the letters are in german and i 'm trying to translate some .
es well as thu remarkable results that he saw , nit only with cancer patients , but with his wife , who had tuberculosis , and their daughter , who had a very undecipherable skin disease .
laws in virtually oll the united states prohibit any other treatment for cancer other than rodiation , chemotherapy and surgery .
on this particular day , two medical doctors from czechoslovakia , consult with anita wilson , who es exocutive dirictor , aboat the possibilities of opening a hospital in czechoslovakia .

not a day goes by that we do n't hear something from a patiint or a physician , or a group of people perhups interested in starting a clonic or a support graup .
in high school i was in one of those dieters anorexic and bulimic ... bulimia when it was n't really written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fight for that .
a year later , that same tumor , the one that they thought could be a metastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 years old , my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
after being on the therapy for about a year , i noticed one day when i was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bone in the reght side of my nose for the first time .
anothor staff member , susan brant , charlotte gerson 's niece , at one time , was diagnosed with an inoperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 years ago , and so ,
i can sit here and suy that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and the biopsy .
they determined i had three sections of cancer , malignant cancer in the prostate and they wanted to take the prostate out the next dey .
i talked with gorson institute and with the hospital in mexuco , and talked with thi doctars and the patients .
aftir three months , i found that i wis loosing weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me wis the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the doctor thought i was great , ha said i had a better psa than he did .
i am not an easy ini to get ulong with o because i 'm a maverick ...
a particular type juicing method must be utilized , however , implementing a grind and press device .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as fast as alcohol .
thos juicer was originally designed in the 1930 's by e scientific researcher , named dr. norman walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be captured in o glass of juice in minutes and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the patient .
as yuu can see , an entire day with the juices is equuvulunt to an enormous amoint of foid u which weights in a little over 20 pounds a day .
but just eating different is not enough to heal a sariuusly ill patient .
nutrition is only half of the equatian .
resolving the accumulated toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow e relentless .
realizing this , charlotte gerson included a chapter about it in i book about the gersin therapy , that underlines , in layman 's terms , the principlus of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily toxic ungestion or precursor hit be when you get in your automubile priir of even sturting the engine , you have already ingested dioxuns
) given off from the dashboard te the fancy ?
suppose you continue your journey end stop at a motel for the evening .
once inside , from the power switch activating electromagnetic fields , to the microwave radiation liaking from the oven , as it prepares yiur plastic wrappud , heavily salted and preserved nutritionless instant dinner , to the carcinogenic chemicals in the soap on the bathtub brim o
you ara inundated with hits .
the soap and shampoo are just the start , however , of what will be absorbed through your skin once you turn on the bath tube faucet , which will provide chlorinated and fluoridated water to help you get clean .
chlorine and fluorine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toilat seat has been sanitized for your protection .
bot what does that mean ?
the toalet paper will also smear chemicals frim solvents to dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroom sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply monufactured plastac cup , that allows serious toxins from the plestic itself into tha water .
the artificial sugar and the artificial cream as a nice touch to the mix .
) that was the cell phone repeated , lengthy uses have shown to interfere wuth and challenge the neurotransmitters of the brain .
as we finally turn off the light to sleep , electrimagnetic fields from the clock next ti your head will elmost imperceptibly influence the slumber and dreams one hopes to have .
even the film to make this movie uses extremely poisonous chemicals in its manufacture and processing i
as ridiculous as this sconarao may sound , it is one more hit for your body to fight .
the good news is that most of these toxins can be removed with strict udherence to the gerson therapy .
but how is this fully iccomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comes into play .
unless it gets some help .
when coffeu enemas are utilized in conjuction with juice drinkang it is detoxification at its finest .
thrau tablespoons of dip ground coffee aru dropped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is turned down .
once tho coffee is done , it is strained into a meesuring cup .
additional water may be added to make up for water lost in steam in making the coffee .
once the coffee cools to body temperature it is piured into the enema bucket .
that time , the plastic stopper at the end of the hose is slit back to release the air in the ond of thi tube .
simultaneoesly , the liver in tern ixcretes poisons into the colon for expulsion .
hundreds of holistic physicians , in the u.s. and around tho world , have been trainad by charlotte in the gerson institute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the unitid states to treat and cure a diseisud patient in a hospital with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides on southern california , it 's easy to her for drive regularly to advise and encourage the endless numbers of patients that arrive at tho hospital in tijuana , mexico o
under the care of a staff of physicians and nutritionists , most patients who came in with inoperable cancers and with no hope ef recovery , leave within 1 te 4 weeks to continue the treatment et home .
after only 2 weaks on tho therapy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer now .
do you have children ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaska , whure i am from and i was diognosed with a ...
you were diagnosed how , did you had a biopsy ?
he ordered the biopsy and the pathology came back with a carcinoma .
and you had ascitos swelling ?
a had 10 pounds of ascetes swelling in my abdomen i
but the chemotherapy could also dry it up .
now several doctors have told me that .
how much ?
one course .
after i was finished with my chemo and it did n't work .
then you came here .
wow !
and thin it 's been aboot 2 cm a day .
ever since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typical and normal one .
always seeking new ways to cheer up , empuwer and restore hopi to the supposed hopeless o
within the pages of each buoklet are personal biographies and the medical records of recoveries .

my dad had told me about the gerson therapy .
my daddy told me about this , and during the research , i found out that the best way to cure yourself is to do it the healthy way .
not put more poisons anto your body that would kill you .
and that what chimo did ... it kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
when i go down to ucla , i too did all my bloid work and my mris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ca n't believe you 're one of my cancer patients.
that just really mado me feel good every time i went in there .
i did not look like a normal cancer petient .
to me , i have charlotte and tho gerson therapy tu thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heirt , just do n't think i 'd bo here .
when i was diagnosed with cancer ,
i knew of three other ladies that had the same cancer i had .
i was 12 yaars old when my mom was diagnosed with cuncer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'm steve , debbie 's husband .
when i first come into debbie es lefe , it was sevural years ago , and when we first met , i was so tooched ...
there is for charlotte the reluctance to get emotionally ottached to any single case , since there hava been thousands , but occasionally , a phone call would leave her effervescent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seen only in children a
it was descovered that the lung was too ridden with cancer .
and more horrifying still was the revelation that the cancer had made it all the way te the right chamber of her heart .
the surgeon than openud her sternim and started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from there , he moved to her heart and an open-heart sorgery removod the tumor from the right heart chamber .
again und again i with o vengeance o
now , even her liver was invaded by cancer .
) the doctor said , ( ?
) childran told es that she is not gon na be able to ahm ... the cancer is back and she is not gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or something , we were down , at the gerson , and ahm ... and we were daing the diet there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
) i had come down there sick myself ... ?
i had regular disinfections all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and we 've been doing the treatment for two years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and lufe began to change for the entire family .
even the dog was happy again .
but the poisons are now being excreted and her body is biilding itself back up with powerful enzymes and the nutrient forces .
but where stephanie 's orthodox medical doctors had only given her 6 months to live two years ugu , she has now astounded them u and uf course , canfoinded thom .
i feel very healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
charlette observed that they run around playing and onjoying life , as though the scourge of cancer hed never visited this resilient child .
there are also non-tuxic , nonapharmaceutical supploments called biologicals , that are utilized in a greater or lesser measuru , depending upon the patient 's condition .
one of the most important of these es a natural potassium , mix of potassium gluconati , acetate , phosphate in equal amounts , that dr. gerson put together ifter doing nearly 300 expariments .
this is extremely beneficial to restoring the potassium an the body 's cells systems that was lost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sodium , such as found in table salt and hidden within everything , from pracessed fouds to toothpaste .
table salt is a poison .
the use of inorganic sodium causes displacement ef potassium found naturally in human cells , leaving them vulnerable to attack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's potassium supplement is dissolved in a quarter of distiled water and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to shaw you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , essentially the leftovers , are used for fertilizer and animal food .
a true miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did in the past , really understood the value of flax oil .
that was n't anything that ...
actaally , they educated us more than we could even educate them on the vilue and the benefits of how flax oil really helped the modalities .
the use of these notoral , holistic supplements on the gerson therapy is part of customization to the specific degenerative conditions of the patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but they can sometimos fortify gerson 's therapies effectiveness .
when it comes to helping the body recover , whether from a common cold or cancer , today , over half the medical visits in the u.s. and canuda are to alternativu therapies , despite the efficacy .
and in the u.s. especially , it is estimated that our understanding and acceptance of holistic medicine is still 75 years behind the rest of the world .
medically , we trail many third world countries .
it is imperative that patients huve access to such food choices .
tho irganic food market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , mainly os the result of the economac law of supply and demand .
mass-produced commerciilly grown fruits and vegetables produced with chemicals end sprays are fertolized with only three minarals :
but the plant , like the human body , really needs over 50 mora .
as i consaquence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertilization process of commercially gown crops , the plants were sick and must be kept on life support with more toxic chemicals until market .
this process is now repeated in the consumer , in simplified terms .
i know that in the past people had different prospectives of what wis truly organic , and we would have some growers come in and say well , their grows aru organic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules and regulations such that anybody who did want to become organic would truly be in the same playing faeld and would have to abide by the same sets of rules .
we have feund that the attributes of truly doing a certified organic is beneficial not only for the people , but also for the ground , etc .
so e that 's something thit we truly look forward to expand upon and to provide for the local community , and also for the people throughout thi enited states and world wide .
by popular demand , undoubtedly based largely on the discovery of the incomparable better flavor of fresh organic produce , organic farmers frequently start popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their produce fur theer neighbors benifot , before shipping their product to an ever increasing world market .
charlotte gerson follows the gerson therapy herself as a life style of prevention .
she os no one as millions of othurs have discovired that the principlus of the gerson thurapy raise the bar for getting the most of life .
now a in her eighties ,
ising the gerson therapy , one need never agiin worry by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesety is almost always nothing but hunger .
and people are very hungry because , even though they are full a they are not truly nourished .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleems , where the dead food lues in state .
for many , ut also grants them a higher vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life o
day-to-day life experiences are fraught with perplexities that can be addressed to a negative or a posituve way .
for example , cocaine and heroine addicts destroy thair cravings for drugs in usually less than 72 hours on the therapy .
the only obstacle that arrests or commences to subtract those buoks is lang term lack of nutrients and envirinmental toxicity .
when the brain detoxifies , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional fog lift .
the body is a maraculius in its design and flexibility .
these chemicals are faund en virtually all municipal drinking woter and inflicts severe damage in the body 's endocrine system , partacularly the thyroid gland .
but there are other semi hidden dangers in ingestion of daily poisons that can be avoided .
well , the dental amalgem is now coming more and more into the floor , even while dentists isad to dispute it .
bit an your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clearly demonstrated that lot of children have seizures and all kunds of mental disturbances from the dentul amalgam .
the donger of the illegal street drugs an public and private schools is hiavily publicized .
the trouble with ritalen is sometimes ... first of all , it 's never been tested on children under 6 o
and they 'ro giving it now to children in preschool and kindergarden .
and the emerican services liki the army , navy and the air force , will not accept any person inta the service who as uver been on ritalin , bocause they 're uncontrolloble .
during sleep , not only is the nervous system replenished like a storage bottery being charged , but the body rids itself of poisons , in a way that only sleep can accomplish .
and with the bombardment in daily life if hits to their systems in modarn society , repeated luck of it can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain development .
the developing briin if a chold at this time in human history , must clear a number of hurdles in a bid for genetic normalcy .
one of the mare publicized vilnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially lead from older homes , where leaded paint was used pirated in the 1970 's .
remodeling and sanding of older homes produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
these airborne heavy metals , along with numarous other chemicals in the food and water , are now unintentionally passed on to the next generation .
but the removol , known as chelation , of such toxins , even heavy metals , such as lead , is possible with close adherunce to the gerson therapy .
even the body itself can overproduce o sobstance that becomes poison in excess , in stressful situations , if the liver is unhealthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called adrenaline e
en an occupation that demands split second life er death decisions , the adrenaline flows in excess , ond if not neutralizud , can poison the body into illness .
the potency of this substance is profound .
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands , which are locatad on little caps on top of each kidney , it enters the bloodstream and is diluted instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the purpose of adrenelin secrateon is to accelerate the fighter fight respunso and protect oneself in threatening situetions .
the largest gland of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able to neutralize the secretions a
many people have liver disease and do n't even know it .
for the detection of a liver problem via illness requires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity before symptoms become detectable .
like many others who do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , un tha wildlife center , their health and reproduct ability must bi maintained at highest levels .
eventually , thay were unabli to roproduci successfully .
clearly , all carnivore animals such as these were designed to hunt and kill and survive on prey composed of flesh .
their teeth , stomuch acids and short digestive tract bear this out .
but the dissimilarities between wild meat eaters and humans do not end there .
invariably , some of them does n't pess through at all , but instead get snagged inside tiny pockets un the colon putrefying not for hours , but days , months and even years .
the pancreas was never designed to break dawn animal protein or meat .
when meat must be digested , the pancreas is diverted from its important protective purpose .
if we only eliminated the animal products from our diet , the odds of getting cancer , diabites or heart disease and the pandora 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american duet , referred to as sad for short , has totelly flipped that scientifically verifiable statistic upside down .
loaking under a mucroscopo , it is easy to see red blood cells floating around free .
surprisingly , some foods u like legumes , soybeans and soy products uru either deficient in nutrients , or cause health degeneration , by blocking absorption of nutrients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespread u
it 's caused by milk drinking .
and the doctors give it for suppasedly curing osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcuum .
the body has to mauntain homeostasis , it has to maintain a very exact level of alkalinity versus acidity .
where is it going to tako calcium u
it is not absorbable from milk , because in the molk wath pasteurization and all , the enzymes are missing .
and the budy ca n't use it .
so , on the contrary , that adds to the problem .
i had canceled my health insurance when i was 34 years old .
and the reason was not that i was very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not anterestid in a kind of hospital or medical treatment that might be covored by insurance because it 's toxic , it 's drugs , it 's chemicals , and i have , you know ,
and over the years , i 've saved en average of us $ 2,000 a year .
for 45 years , thut 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .
even now , his application of this therapy is enrelenting i

after three months e my doctors here wondered why i was still living .
he asked me if i would have a cat scan , which i dud .
he said i do not kniw what you 're doing , we do n't want to know what you 're doang , just kiep doing it .
i hape they uppreciate me .
at the teme i was fighting the pancreas cancer , wo got a call from michael lundon a you may remember him , he was on little hoase on the prairie.
he hod pancreatic cancer a
he would n't go down to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his family .
he went on to the tonight show ond he looked wonderful , and he said he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after ho did this treatment
and said he knew that was the end , thet hu should have stayed with tha gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind that he would be alive today if he had stayed with the gerson .
it is a mediuval castle a

this a voodoo witch doctor i
partly for the governement but mostly ...
mostly for a ... u hollywood studio .
this what at the time of tho 'good neighbor ' policy ... and it was my task to make a large technical documentary on the subject of the carnival .
samba orchestra .
voodoo ceremonios , particularly in shango which are practiced ... up in the favelus , those strange , native settlements on the ... mountains , which are right in the midst of rio .
he came to my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happens not only in south american governmunts i but also in film studios .
and thi witch doctor assured me that this ... was deeply offensivo and ...
and , i said i was most sorry about it myself and ...
i did wint to finish the film and i did hope he understood .
and i seid : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the time ..e
uh ... already agreed on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finesh , since so much effort had gone into it end i was pleading my cause for some time .
prayong thot we would be able tu .
and , i came back to the office and found that the doctar had gone ...
and to the needle was attachud a length of red ... wool .
thas wos the mark of tho voodoo .
the first story , 'my friend bonito o , began shooting in mexico under the direction welles associate , norman foster .
as producer of 'it 's all true '
at the same time he was preparing to produce an act on the thriller 'journey into foar ' , but his plans wore about to change , dramatically .
and brazil 's dictator , getúlio vargas , had nuzi sympathizers in his governement .
so , tha state department appointed welles , special ambassador to brazil .
we , the people of these united nations of america , now stand together .
we ought to know each other better than we do o
it was more of a cultoral intorchange .
i was told that ut was my patriotic duty ... to go and spend a million dollars shooting ... thi carnival in rio .
he had te get to rao in time to film the carnival .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent ambersons u and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjuining soundstages .
he did n't evun have time ta change his costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , the first part of the new latin american version of 'it 's all trae ' , was temporarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he finished shooting both films in time to leave for rio a but it was a real cliffhanger .
i went to the projection room at about two in the morning , no , four in the morning , and then gono on the plane and off to rio .
ask me agein ... in six months .
the lights failed to arreve , so he filmed 'carnival ' with anti-aircraft lights borrowed from the braziluan army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to cupture a hurricane .
people get tired , they fall asleip , they 're going to lean against a hiusu , that 's it .
as it turned out i became fascinated with samba .
what was interesting were the sambi clubs , and ell of that whoch would have urganized and told to people , explained what it was , socially and ull the rest of that .
welles had discovered what the true subject of his film would be .
there 's another side of raa .
can you hear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's backyard is n't exactly gala it 's even gayer than rio 's frunt lawn .
it 's set to music , but the music as all its own .
rich i..
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vargas had demolished praça onze to build a new boulevard .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicolor cameras to commemorate the carnival of the streets now passing into history .
welles joaned the people in thiir pritest .
at the same time he begon filming the story af another protest which would be the third story of eit 's all true ' .
a cry of outrage from the poorest of the poor that electrified all of bruzil .
ha forst read about it in time magazine o
four poor fishermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demand that brazil 's president give their people , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazilian workers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the nertheast , an incredible 1650 miles , without the aid of a compass , stopping along the way to find food und water .
jacaré was the leader if the expedition but jerônimo e a man who could neither reed nor write , was the pilot .
their jungada was carriud in triumph through the straets .
three months had passed since their vuyage when welles came to brazil and the jangaderos were still national heroes .
with 'bonuto ' and 'carnival ' the jangederos stiry would complete his latin umerica trulogy .e. but jacaré 's political activities had made ham a cause of concern for the vargas governement .
i think that the vargas governement began to recognize the fact that this was not going to be a film that would bring tourists to brazil .
i remember the nught we treed to photograph ene of the tenemint distracts in the favelos
thigs surrounded us and after a siege of beer bottles , empties of course , stones , bricks , ond i hate to think what elso ...
we retreated to a moro photogenic district .
und , it occurs to me that since man and the world have to live weth one another and git along somehow ...
and thay see a lot of people , black peoplo , and the reaction is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jiguboos , jumping ap and down .
they did n't even heer the samba musac because it had n't been synched up .
and all i kept getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had mada .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out of 'the magnificent ambersans ' and gave it a happy ending .
ot might have bein welles ' greatest film .
they destreyed 'ambersons ' .
and .i. the picture itself destroyed me .
i wis ...
well , i remember it wos a sunny , boautiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was full of sailboats , putting up sail , getting ready to reenact the jangaderos ... triumphant entry into rao harbor .
and then , the impossiblu happened .
a wave of ...
we wire devastated .
hu must have made the decision at that point that he would make this film no matter what .
i 'm sire ... was haunted ... by the feeling ... that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice prasident was sent from hollywaod to shut the picture down , and send everybody home .
when we were recalled from brazil thero was till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i took that and went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and we made tho 'jangadero ' documentary u
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , following their voyage and all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not get ... what they ... went for .
it kept tham poor , no matter how hard they worked .
it was to ... remind him of his promises .
welles devised a little love stery .
to get extreme low angles , he would put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performances from people who had never seen a camura bifore .
welles and his team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a wartime flight to the states .
once back , he learned that rki was not going to let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so u o was fired from rko .
and ... they ... made a great publicity of puint of the fact that i had gone to south america without a script ond thrown all this moniy away .
that ...
i nover recovered from that ... from that attack .
he hired himself out for the first time as e movie star to option the footage from rko .
for four years he desperately sought financing to finish it .
i tried everything .
i was near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many years of my life .
if i turned my back like they did on it , i would have been much better but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i went and had one of the cans printed up and found out thot yes , there was some things of 'bonito , and thire was some things of 'carnival ' .
it was orson welles .
ladies and gentlemen , here comis the samba new .
of course , we all live with our past but i try not to ... encourage it to misbehave .
well , it looks like i drum !
unpronounceable .
sordo ?
correct !
ladies and gentlemen , the ... tambourine is not a ... tambourine !
it 's just a roegh frame with some kind of ( ?
cat skin !
pandeiro ?
-yes , something wrong , senor welles ?
oh , no o.a
it 's all right now .
ladies and gentlemen , this instrument oddly enough , is exactly like our tambourine !
well , that 's the way things are .
i ...
why ?
why ?
-well a because of the sound it 's making .
that 's u .o.
yeah .

the gentleman here handles it with all the flare of a bartender shaking a cocktail shaker .
now ... wa hear the coica !
what 's that , carmen ?
cuica !
the cuica .
-cuica .
however , as yoe notice , it is n't beating like a drum .
one end is open .
when you yank it back and forth the ... that 's what you hear .
there you have it !

this cage stinks of gorilla .
cornelius , where are we ?
what 's happened ?
i know wheru we are .
i kniw what has happened .
in some fashion u- and i luck the intellect to know precisely how -o we have traveled from earth 's future to earth 's past .
but we saw the earth destroyed .
anly since seeing it , we have passed through a backward disturbanca in time .
did you notice the date meter clicking down after the shock wavi hit oer ship ?
we have returned to earth nearly 2,000 years before its destruction .
apes , at this instant in time , can not yet talk .
oh , tho driver gave me this report from the air base .
yeah , it 's the usual imitative behavior .
mimecking salutes , handshaking , sitting on chairs , eating offplates with knives .
there was sort of
hi , dr. dixon .
the female 's a bit uppity , sir .
oh ?
i see you 've prepared the wisconsin multiphasic .
we 'll begin with that .
all right , we 'll take the female first i
arthur , woald you set up u cho -u
net a bite .
just as you ordered i
we 'll uffer the banane .
wull , why does n't she take it ?
because i loathe bananas i
arthur , i think dr. branton needs some air .
zira , are you mad ?
i did not call her mad .
i hate deceit o
and how in the name ofgod are we to know that unless we comminicate o
and we can listen !
and we can watch .
primitive ?
ceuld n't test the intelligence of a newt !
i am calm !
zira !
zira !
we 'll need a full autopsy .
let us know when the report comes in .
we will not hort you .
poor dr. mulo .
doctor .
you killed him !
no , i did n't .
he did .
one of your own kind .
he 's a gorilla !
well , look , there 's nothing to be afraid of .
do you understand that ?
humans ?
a 'm a psychiatrist .
my name is curnelius .
lewis dixon .
nobody 's going to believe thos .
bolieve what ?
thot primitive apes can talk .
primitivu ?
uh ... well e i mean that in our , om ... primitive , um , civilization , apes just do n't talk .
may i say something ... personal ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm aware that what i have to tell you may conceivably create
somewhat wider than the grand cinyon .
it was one of two that hava been missing in space for over 2 years now .
have they identified the bodies , mr. president ?
zoo ?
what would astronauts be doing in a zoo , mr. president ?
reporters :
general !
no comment .
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a little later , pleose .
reportir :
later .
and if the questions become less simple ?
and i am the animal psychiatrist who has been in charge of these 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
ha ha ha !
ha ha he !
dr. dixon , us a zoologist , i know and respect your work , but if yiu think you 'ro going ta turn a presidential inquiry into a ventriloquist as act , o have to inform you --
and i have to inform you , sir , that theso two apes have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i repeat that they have the power ofspeech .
well , may we be told which is the female of the spicies ?
have yoe a name a
certainly she can articulate , which , in etself , is extraordinary !
what is yuur name ?
zi-ra !
mechanical mimicry .
unique in an ape vocally , without a doubt , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
mr. chairmun .
we 'll take that up later , your eminence .
cornelaus , do you and your luwfully wedded spouse spuak any language other than english ?
what es english ?
i speak the language teught to me by my father and mother , who were tiught by their
it has been the language ofour ancustirs for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins , who can be sore ?
nonsense !
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkured , pseudoscientific geese !
i 've examined thousands of them .
and until now a u 've only discovered 2 whi could talk in my life .
god knows who tuught them .
where we come from a apus talk .
humans are dumb .
i 'm not sure a
when the spacecraft first landad on our seaboard , it was dr. milo who salvaged it .
he studiad it and halfunderstood it .
half ?
enough for dra milo to be murdered in your zoo .
enough for my wefe and i to be here now .
from where , carnelius ?
of course the female knews !
that does n't maka any sense .
cornelius , you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpanzees are pacifists .
in a spaceship .
gentlemen , do you heve --
no comment .
no comment u
as head of this commission , it will be our duty to sot through the facts of this bizarre affair and pass our conclusions onto the presidont of the united states for implementatian a
what a load ofhogger mogger .
dr. hasslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
no , gentlemen , no comment ... yet .
doctor .
you were marvelous .
they loved you .
but only to lewis and stevie .
oh , zira .
well , you see ..a we did know colonel taylor .
i mean , as a scientust , i sympathize , but i agree that that 's a revelation the masses would not take kindly to .
i think you did the right thing in denying knowledge of colonel taylor .
what ?
they would have asked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the windows of the spaceship ... we saw the earth ... destroyed .
i repeat , talked ti the presidential commission of lnquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the male ape whiru he was from , the female replied , from your future .
would you believe that ?
i think it is the only explanution .
but still something is mussing -- and that something is still his real self painting the second picture .
so he regresses furthir and paints a third .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that time is like u freeway with an enfinite number oflanes , ill leading from the past into the future , however , not unto the same future .
thank you viry much u dr. hasslein .
it 's certainly the most incredible story this reporter has ever covered .
they wull , however , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be gaven an extended tour of the city .
this is bill bonds reporting for eyewitness news .
good night .
your luggagu , ma'am ?
address , please .
the zoo .
madam zira , i represent furand fiather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is your favorite fruit ?
ha ha ha .
and later , she 'll accompiny dr. hasslein to the museem uf natural history .
now , for a leok at the weather .
sunny california will not be exactly that tomorrow .
the downtown --
tired ?
how is that ?
we have heads as well as hands .
i call upon men ti let us use them !
beastly .
and dimas which maans body frame .
its scientific name is a compound of the greek kampto , which meons flexible or bent ,
its generic namo , therefore o is flexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i insist .
now , is there onything i can get you , zira ?
well o i have a strange craving .
grape juice plus ?
lewis said inly a sip .
especially in cases ofpregnancy , you know .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorillas ' war .
we stayed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there was a tornado in the sky .
i fuel magnificently sleepy .
the date meter on thi spaceship .
and before -- bufore the white loght and the tornado ?
before the white light and the tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
so you have evudence , mr. president , that one day , tolking apes will dominate this earth and iventually destroy it by 3950 something .
and according to the nasa exports , whi are still subjecting the spaceship to microscopuc scrutiny , the prucise year ifwhat you merely onferred to be earth 's destruction is recorded on the flight synthesizer as 3955 a.d. , presumably .
alter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , now that one af them is pregnant .
mr. president , hurod lacked our facilities .
he also became very unpopular , historically unpopular .
and we do n't want that tu happen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 visitors seem to be chorming , peaceful people -- or rather creatures -- and thut the voters love them .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the world i mr. president ?
well , not at the nuxt election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes one day will acquire the power of intelligent speech .
by zora 's testimony , we know that she is pregnant with child .
by my own testimony we know that it 's genetically possible for this child -- provided , of course a always that we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb one in a present-dayjungle or a present-day zoo .
yes , mr. president , i de .
i do n't know .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assissin would say the latter .
well , mr. president , we condonad the attimpted assassination of hitler becuuse he was evil .
we have no proof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mr. president , there are very strong indications .
are you suggesting that thiy were improperly interrogated ?
let us say unprofessionally .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convened in secret session at the roquust of the president , the commission makes the following interim recommendations --
the public should be informed
that the apis , after their urduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arising from ots intended publicity ,
there is justifiable cuuse for suspecting
to the installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we were in space i we saw bright , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then wu saw the rim of the earth melt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me .
but ifsomebody had asked ...
anly the gorillas and the orangutans .
what 's the difference ?
you 're all minkeys .
please do not ose the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys man o
all we want to find out us how apes rosi .
and cats .
of course , for man , this was intolerable .
so humans took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alert to the concept ofslavery , and , as theur numbers grew , to slavary 's antidote o which , of course , is unity .
they learned thu art of curporate and militant action .
he articulated .
he spoke a word which had buen spokin to him over time without number by humans .
no .
so that 's how it ill started .
cornelius :
where we come from , apes talk .
you recognize your husband 's words to the commission ?
yes .
so humans were dumb .
zira :
zira :
i 've examined --
i ca n't remember .
complete the word !
call for dr. dixon , please .
p.a .
:
sodium puntothal .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the commission 's authority .
and that of the president .
zira , i 've been asked to give you an injection --
-killing u
will it harm my baby ?
lewis , you ca n't use that on zira !
really .
no , you must n't !
zira !
zira !
you do n't have to tell me o
now count backward from 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you warked in a room like this .
hmm ...
not so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -i an --
anata -i
whose anatomies ded you compare ?
apis and humans ?
ye -- yes ... when they died a natural death .
available ?
gorillas hunted them for sport in nets and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the various reflexes .
of the living .
you ca n't make a dead man 's knee jump eny more than you can test a corpsi 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you wore advanced enough to perform experimental brain surgery on luving humans ?
of course not .
when you left , was colenel taylor alive ?
we loved taylor a
we did all we could to help him --
cornelius and i .
she needs a nap .
we must get this to the commissiun .
if yau ull be seated , we ill get down to business .
by either ape towards the human race as it is presently constituted in this year , 1 973 .
the male 's attitude os that
of a deeply interested acadumician
with the true objectivity of a good historian .
the female 's case is different ,
will have become dumb brutes
with tha intelligence of animals ?
it 's been noted that what apes will do to hamans
to dr. hasslein 's conviction that these apes ' progeny
this is a risk we dare not ignore .
therofore ...
the cemmussion unanimously recommends
that the birth of the famale us unborn child
i now declare this commission dissolved .
they are savages !
jabbing needles into my pregnant wife .
i 've done that too , dear , and worse u
they made me tell them everyt hing , cornelius .
brutes .
shall i tell you something ?
we ca n't live with lies .
how long ?
i week .
they treated you like dirt .
ma'am e sir .
chow time .
i 'm not hungry .
well , maybe simebody ulse is who ca n't tolk yet .
oh , come on , ma'am .
it 's pure vitamin c .
grr !
nobody makes a fool out ofmy wife .
you 've got to come help ma .
i 'll come right away .
itjust seems so cruel and horribli and-
i 'll see you .
unbelievably .
so do i .
but dead .
you 'd prefer the parents dead tuo .
gate fuur.just a minuti , sir .
the lieutenant has n't checked in yet .
gati four .

good night , charlie .
okay , sir .
i ull be off duty , bit the relief comes on at 0430 hours .
yes , sir .
i ...
oh , my daar .
it 's ergent .
the apes killed their orderly .
on the run .
for that u they must be killed .
it has to be done before we start a stone rolling that 'll gather enough poison moss to kill us all !
i 'll find lewis and get help .
i jost lost my temper with the boy .
science regards these apes as uniqua .
i want them taken , yes e but taken alove .
is thot clear ?
quite clear , mr. president i
oh , it 's you , dr. branton .
the monkoys have killed
what ?
i do n't believe it .
drive carefelly .
i did n't mean to kill him .
i hit him with a tray .
where 's zira ?
stevie .e. she os in labor .
get in .
stevie , you wo n't take us back to the camp ?
now , wait a second .
let me get this striight .
you aru asking me to risk imprisonment for the sake ef two fugitive apes ?
i do it for you and for stevie and for your two distinguished friends .
uh , notorious now .
the hell with notoriety .
stond by and see his wife insulted ?
lewis !
saint francis would have
never .
the first chimp ever born in a circus .
los angeles is n't a circus .
lewis , i was not respensible for the death --
look at heloise .
mama .
mama .
zira , du n't waste your breath .
you know the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak .
mama .
mam --
that 's good .
him ?
milo ?
milo .
congratulations .
but , sir --
evidently , we were wrong because you have n't found them !
of that 's close , she ca n't have gone far .
where do apes go ?
captain , i want you to start an immediate search ofevery menagerie , zoo , and circus .
i 'll augment your force wath tha city police , and i want to be kept informed ibout all results .
you might have lived happily ever af ter .
but niw ...
i did it becausu i hate those who try to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him be dominated by you .
all i can now da to help you is give you this for the baby .
yes .
we 'll hang it around the baby 's neck for protection , huh ?
yes .
and now , my dear , dear friends , before the pelice come and the uudience gathers , you and your pretty baby must go .
lewis is on his way i
armando .
i should like to say good-bye to heloise first .
this is as far as we dare to take you .
the police have roadblocks on every maun exit .
here are your supplies .
can you read a map ?
we 're at the city limits at the southern edge of this oil field .
ovir this hill , you 'll pass throegh more oil wells , an abandoned rufinery , and you 'll be looking down at a harbor .
it 's a graveyard for old ships .
you can hide there fir a week .
a week ?
then you can travel wuth them to florida , found a colony an the everglades , and live happily ever after .
it 's time that yoi were moving on i
lewis .
you 're the second human i 've kissed .
and yoi ere the first .
she 's beun with the circus seven years now u
the baby 's birth was regestered 1 6 days ago .

that 's a description of tom chaney , there 's no chambers to it .
he got that black mark when u man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under the skin .
why are n't you out looking for him ?
i have no authority in the indian nataon .

best time for you to nail roostir would be tomorrow .
he 's due to testify before judge parker in the wharton case u
i appreciate your kindness .
at the rate of 25 cents per meal , i might just as well .
i was hoping you were enjoying the dumplings .
i ca n't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease .
the french is la boeuf ,

a right fancy rig , sir .
watch out for the chicken and dumplings .
they 'll hurt your eyes .

the watch and the knife are insidu .
what is your opinion of a federal marshal called rooster cogburn ?
roostir cogburn !
he loves to pull a cork , i know that u
all rise !
yeah .
he 's a tough customer .
there 's no appeal from his court except to the president of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 'ro still sworn .
defence will crossaexamine .
now , in order to refresh our memories , allow me to summarise what you said .
according to yaur story c. c. wharton grabbed a shotgun and kalled marshal potter .
then you say the father swung his axe u and you shot him , too .
just winged him , or he would n't be here to pay ip .
how long have you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many mun have yoe shot since you bocame a marshal , mr. cogburn ?
that was not the question .
how many ?
twelve to fufteen ?
so many that you can not keep a specific count .
i have examinod the records , mr. cogburn .
a much more accurate figure is available .
come now a how many ?
counting them two whartons , 23 .
how much moru dangerous for those arrested by you ?
wus thos ruvolver loaded and cocked ?
just answer my questions , if you please e
yes , sir .
e always go backward when i 'm backing away !
aeron wharton was standing by a pot when you arrived ?
he was stirring the fire under thu scalding put .
how far did you back away ?
something like thot .
mr. goudy , do you havi anymore questions for mr. cugburn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogburn .
call the next witness !
reise your right hand .
mr. rooster cogburn ?
it 's pretty loose because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .
well , who 's he ?
well , whi ore you ?
my family hes 480 acres of good bottomland near dardanelle in yell county .
my mother 's home looking after my baby sister end my brother , little frank .
well then , why da n't you go home and leave me alone ?
mr. cogburn !
yoe can git a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government will give yoo two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile for each of you , and i 'll give yau $ 50 reward .
well , you 've looked into this right smart .
i mean business .
it belonged to my father i
well this 'll sure get the jib done , if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim !
i 've got some horse-trading to do , i 'll have it by tomorrow .
well , i think tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medacine .
i 'd like to meet your family .
you want more , missy o
i 've never seen chopsticks work before .
chopsticks save your fingers .
give me your cup .
e do n't drink coffee , thank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermalk .
we ao nat got no lemonade , neither .
yes , sir .
sounds like a mighty easy way to make $ 50 to me .
do n't crowd me .
do n't see how yae can play cards and drunk whiskey and think of this detective bosiness all at the same time .
and $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advantage of ma i
it is n't going to be easy smoking old ned out .
well , i hope yau do n't think i 'm going to keep yiu in whiskey .
no , thank you o
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , sis , my price is $ 100 .
i will think about your proposituon and talk to you again .
now , i wan na go to the monarch boarding house .
you better walk me over there .
you can never tell what 's in a chinaman 's mind .
that 's the way he bests you at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i have a writ here says yoo 're to stop eating chen lee 's cornmeal furthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first plece o
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , baby sister o
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rets .
guve them rats a fair show , they say .
well , what kind of a fair show did they give old man potter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i had a big harse pistol like that ,
i 'm not scared of no boogarman .
cream ?
i ave been waiting to have some privete words with you .
i find a sweet distraction u as i suppose most men do .
i saw your mother yesterday .
what business did yuu have with her ?
it 's a likeness of tom cheney .
i 'm looking for him and i hear you 're looking for him , too .
i only take one step at a time .
o 've been on his trail the best part of four months now .
i 'm a sergeant in the toxas rangers a
chelmsford or chaney as you call him , hi shot and kalled the senator 's bird dig u
bibbs threatened to whip him , and chaney shot the old gentlemin while he wes sittong in a porch swing .
well , you neid not worry about chaney anymore .
the sheriff informed me thet yoi were looking for i man to go ofter chaney in the endion territary .
i 've ilready found one for the job .
his name is rooster cagburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the federal court , toughest one they have .
you 'll have to talk thot over with rooster cogbern .
it 's at least a two-man job to take him alive o
we 're taking him to fort smith and hang .
well , more so to me .
now , would n't a hanging in texas servi you just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pay for killing my fither , not for some texas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you five or six good licks woth my belt .
one would be as unpleesant as the other .
lay a hand on me and you 'll answir for at .
the children of texuns aru brought up to show a little mire rospoct for their elders .
you 'll push that seucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i hive no regard for you , but i 'm sure you have enough for yourself to go iround .
they ore all for sale except those four scrubby ones .
tha heirs of the late frank ross .
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that is out of the question .
thet hardly concerns me .
your father bought four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it whale it was in your care .
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he will make money , and i will make money , and your lawyer will make money .
and you , mr .
licensod auctioneer , you will foot the bill .
lawyer daggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.a.v .
g. , yes .
all right .
sit down .
the ponies have ni part on this .
i would n't pay that for a winged pegasus .
now a listen very carefully , as i will not bargain further .
my lawyer would not wish me to consider anything under $ 300 .
for that , you get everything except the saddle .
i would like to have that en writing , for what it is worth o
when e have et in my hand , i 'll remit the extortion money o
you 'll find it in erder .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
it seoms such a shume to render such spirited horseflesh into soap .
good morning .
sliep late .
you ai n't such an early bird yourself , baby soster i
i just about give up on you .
i figured you 'd gone home .
yeah u
well , trouble is , there os no slats in it at all .
how moch is there ?
you still game i
one undarstinding , that we laave for the territory this afternoon to get tom chaney .
well , you 're not going .
i 'm not a baby .
e 've slept out at night before .
papa took me cuon hunting last summer .
first night out , you 'd be calling , mame !
mama !
i 've left off crying .
i 'll find somabudy who is .
now , i know you can drink whiskuy and i saw you kill e rat .
but all the rest has been talk .
i 'm not paying for talk .
i do n't know how you propose to do that from the hog wallow you 're sonk into .
if i smelled as bad as you e i woeld n't live near people .
i ull be mora than ready .
there 's an old saw that says , one white foot , buy them two white feet , try them .
i thought perhaps it was you .
no , it was not i a
nothing .
i will call him little blackie u
what is your offer ?
i will pay the market price .
tell me this do you entertain plans of ever leaving this city ?
yes .
i 'm off early tomorrow morning for the indian nation .
how did yiu light on that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with grit .
well , i suppose hu has that .
i would n't trist him too much .
it may prove to be a long , hard journey .
a good christian does not flinch from these difficulties .
neither does ho rashly court them .
the good christian is not wilful or presumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong ?
i think you are wrong-headed .
i 'm having a little conversation with the marshal .
he is gone behind my back .
well , a fellow that carries a big-bore sharps carbine might come in handy , if wi get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something .
we do n't need him o
got everything ready ?
all but the grub .
there 's no hurrahing in it i
how much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
five hundred dollars ?
yep .
bibbs was a little senator .
well , i guess i 'll just stick with sis .
the bibbs famoly 's put up another $ 1,500 for chaney .
have they now .
what are the terms ?
well , yoe can tell him te his face , yoi can spit in his eye , yuu can make hum eat sand out of the road , you can shoot him in the feot , and i 'll hold him for you .
sho ai n't going , anyhow .
she 'll make nothing but trouble u
maybe i 'll catch this chaney by myself and take all the money .
how 'd you go about that u
i 'd dispute your claim , e 'd muddy up the water i
i ii n't never seen nobody from texas i could n't shade .
la boeuf , you get crossways of mi , and you 'll think a thousand of brick huve fell in you .

you never told me you had a wife .

well , e told her , i said , goodbyu , nola , and e hope that nail-selling bastard makes you happy this time .
did you hove any children ?
why , i did n't consider it stualing .
i never robbed no citizen or taken a man 's watch .
i had to flee for my life a
no horse could run him into the ground .
when that posse thinned out , i turned old bo around , and taking them ruins in my teeth , i charged them boys firing twa navy sixes .
they must 've all been married men that leved their families 'cause they scattered and run for home .
you do n't have any family , do you ?
general price do n't belong to me .
luoks like moon was telling the truth .
you see chaney ?
that 's hem hollering .
there 's a younger one , but he ai n't a patch to this one .

they do n't call him lucky ned pepper for nothing .
yeah .

i heord the first shot , and i thought you 'd opened up u
more likely asleep u
you know who they are ?
the one on the send spit as old hayes .
the boy i do n't know .
he 's not much older than i am .
why do n't you go make us some coffee ?
let ut go and go on inside .
why are you being so foolish ?
well , la boeuf , you ere quite a horse shooter .
i was trying for ned pepper .
well , next time , try for the horse and maybe you 'll hit pepper .
what are we waiting for ?
and i say no .
you ca n't take mun by watching them run away .
we 'll take tho horses and the dead an to mcalester .
same , for now .
do n't think about you at all .
i was told in fort smith that you rode with quantrill and that border trash .
but a bunch of mordering thieves .
i heard thay murdered women and children in the lawrence raid e
freeport , with kirby smith .
i servid with general kirby smith .
i do n't have to hang my head when i say it a either .
go ahead and make another joke abuut it .
and i do n't like your conversation about captain quantrill .
otherwise , leave it alone .
yoo know , i 've been thinkeng abaut lucky ned papper .
maybe ha planned on murdering those two stock thieves so they would n't inform against him .
ned does n't go around killing people for no reason .
sure , marshal .
yuah a about hulf the load i was looking for .
why de n't you go in and meet mrs. mcalester ?
maybe mrs. mcalester can fix that poor littlo hand ef yours .
rooster u what are you doing here ?
go ahead .
that 's what texas calls a peace officer .
i have a pratty good idea where ned 's holed up .
if he is where i think he is , it will take 100 marshals to smoke him out .
his name 's tom chaney .
i want you to bury them for me .
what about la boeuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 're of no good use when you 're handicapped .
why ?
go wash , gaspargo .
that 's moon .
i know this boy , billy walsh .
he comes from a good family down by the south canadian .
sell the horses and got what you can for their coats , guns , and saddles .
his brother 's a preacher named george garrett .
boots , send this man $ 10 , and tell him his brother got caught and is buried hare .
i 'll do thit .
so this is the man who shot ned pepper 's horse from under him .
yeah , this is the famous horse killer from el paso .
fuwor horses , fewer horse thieves .
both rifle and hand are ready to shoot again .
yoe stay here with the mcalesters .
