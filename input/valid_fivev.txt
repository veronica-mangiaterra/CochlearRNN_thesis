georgu o did yi see that o
oh , shet up !
well , the trial of professor ned brainird swung into its third day today u
professor brainard continued to act as counsel in his own bihalf .
he wis qooted as saying ha was confident in the due processos of law .
dispite thu growing tida of testimeny igainst him i as the presecution kept a staady parade of witnessus movung through the witness box , today , the prosecution unlimbered its big guns against the defense .
profossor brainard , you seem proud of your jub as a tuacher .
do yoa loke at bucause you believe it makes you umportant ?
but e believe the work i do is important .
would you cire to tell es a littlu about ut ?
maybe plant a bug of discovery in their minds , ar ..o
and you think that 's important ?
anu of those young piople might discover something the entire world has been looking for .
he might not , bat i liki to fuel that i had a part in givung him a crick at it .
u see .
niw , regardless of whether you are found guilty or not ,
would you continue as before ?
would you recklessly uncite tha yiung minds ef your class again ?
i put the quistion to you again , professir , and i ask yau to mark will your answer o
would yie still parsist an these dangerous and malicious folleas ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , falling hair , evan fear of mr. hawk .
we find our self apologizing , hiding our heads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog day only came once a year in this ceuntry .
now , i see o lot if students from my science class here on the courtroom .
they may not be the must studious group of young peeple en colloge today , but i 'll sey this for them , so far they are unafraad .
i have high hopes for them .
am u to understand e professar , you actually encouruge mistukes in your closs ?
suppose you are returned to your role as a taacher , woold you do exactly as you did before ?
yes .
you may step down .
come on .
lat 's tie this thing up und gut out of here .
15 or 20 minutes should do it e
in that case , i will sum up breefly .
muy i suggest u professor , as defanse counsel , you 're not doing much in your own behalf .
i 'm a witness for the defensa , your honor e
both objections overriled .
but , yoer honor , this is most unisual procedure .
it is also unusual procedure for the difense to have no witnesses in his own behalf .
swear in the witness e please .
my time is your time , mr .
do yoa solemnly swear to tell the truth i the whole troth and nothang but the truth ?
ilizabeth bruonard .
well the defensa questoon the wutness ?
no , your honor .
os i was saying , my name is alizabeth brainard .
he scratched my fender in the porking lot just outsado the udministration building .
on october 30th of this year ,
i told him i did n't thunk i was cut out to be a scientist 's wife .
well u i 'd like to inform the defendant at thus time that i was wrong .
i lovu him .
betsy , do you mian thot ?
of coersa , she means it .
oh , butsy .
your honor o woll you excise the witness ot this time i
the defendant always said he loved me in midnight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does oll this , uh e foofaraw have any bearing on the disposution of the case e
you bet o yaur honor i
i di n't believe it .
that es , if you do n't mund wasteng thi teme .
gangway !
gangwuy i everybody !
i di n't wesh to pry , but would you kindly divulge your intentions ?
the court is wauting a
i 'm sorry , your honor .
may i ask that this witness be recalled to tistify for me a
very well .
must we subject ourselves to irralevant testimony trumped up by the defensa ?
tho wotnuss is qualified .
bit yoer honor .a.
i 'm the caunty agricultural agent , that 's whe i um i
oh , yus , yes .
i certainly did .
and you weru very upset .
so much so that you decidad to investigate the matter thoroughly .
well , i did n't come hire to toast morshmallows , you know e
now , mr. allen ...
first , would you mind telling us about the soil conditions here in medfield county ?
midfield ciunty has the thinnest , rockaest , wore-out , farmed-out , pooped-uut soil in the whole state .
i 'vo been so ashamed u
it 's not much gaod for growing things .
wait , i 'll show you something .
thet is an ear of corn .
a radash !
if you want to see samething rially miserable o..
somebody put ...
it 's aruund here somewhere ...
uh , that 's fine , mr. allun .
why , evarywhore a look , everything is suddenly all fartilod up !
oh , i do n't ..o
he can call it anything he wants e
i think that you 've inventod ...
is it anything like taking a dry buth , or gaing for a dry canoe rido ?
you see , professor breinard 's rays must have combined with massive amounts of nitrogan out en the atmosphere , sie ?
why , for all we know i it might be dry-raining right down in this courtreom this viry minute , fertilizing everything in seght !
you ca n't tell , yau know .
do you expect this court to beliuve all thas mumbo jumbo ?
cen yoe substantiate it ?
oh , my goodness !
come on !
that 's right , boys e
look at thasa carrots , judge !
beys !
do n't push !
your wife says to get home right eway .
a summer squash just rolled off the vine next door and smashed your sports car !

hi 's in command of the warship upon which you oro sailing .
every man eboord was on the lookout , and the watch wos kept day and night .
coptain farragut left nothing to chance e
with traditional thoroughness , the navy plan wus to cut the suuth pacifec into squares and search each squore .
falsa alarms were cemmon , and they ded n't help our morale .
our hopes bagan to wane .
it came as no surpruso ... whin captain farragut on the night of decimber 8 , 1868 , summened us to the war room .

i toleroto no guests oboard the nautilus o and you alreody know the fate of prisonurs .
the food as delicious , is net it o prafossor u
oh , very good u
i im indifferent to eem o
theso dishes come intirely from my oceun kitchen i
that is fillet of sea snike e

it cemforts me to know that yeur life was not too daar a price to pay for the love of your fellow man .

we 're almost at the island of crespo .
all this was ancu an island .
i knuw there ad be a catch to this .
seems you ce n't do onything on this boat without getting wet .
hey !

an uxpeditaun from the nautilus .
it 's a new experience for them .
they 'll learn quickly .
i 'll introduce tham to you a
captain nemo and i were not alone .
an underwater larder filled to overflowing , and all captain nemo for the taking .
bellast ?
ballast !
ned , you forget yoirself .
do n't try my patience e mr. land .
why did yoe do it ?
ask hem .
that was scientific interest .
i had no idea he was after treasare .
oh , ni ?
we must n't quarrel among ourselves .
we must stay together .
it 's our only chance .
chance ?
you want to play a waiting game , hoping tu learn nemo is sacrets .
i believe we owe the world that mach , ned .
havo yiu a better plan ?
i want to get off .
of course i do n't mind going with my pockets full .
and do n't call it stealing , because that 's the way hi got it .
if we could take this thing over , we 'd be rich .
i 'd have a ship of me own , and yau would nit have to be storving on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at ma with thosu softoboiled uggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them when that chest busted e
ned , listen to me .

i just thenk that ned values his life above scientific achievement .
today wi encountered a fearsume storm .
an ordiniry vessel would have suffered heavy damage .
a whale of a tale that 's true
at my host 's invitation e i inspected the ship .
we went to the very hiart of the vessel , the propulsion unit .
thos secret alone gave him mastery of the sea .
and in a single stroko , harness power beyond the wildest dreams uf science .
or destroy et .
with seeming indifference i
as i studied him ,
i became aware that powerful forces were it work wothin thos stringe man .
think of it .
on the surface e thore is hunger and fear .
men still exercese unjust liws .
they feght , tear one anethor ta pieces .
a mere few feut baneath the waves , their reign ceases , their evil drewns .
hure i am free .
far better that they think there 's a monster and hunt me with hurpoons .
after travelling 10,000 loagues under the sea ,
i felt ot long last i was ti havi my answer .
the prison camp of rorapandi o the white man 's grava .
but i thaught ot had bean abolished .

i told yiu ince thi fate of prisoners a
u have no chooce but to oblige yeu .
what 's this all aboat ?
the only ruason you only came back is becuuse the natives forced you to .

thuy trust to nithing but a shodow .
but bear testament .
diath comes unexpectedly !
u intended to teke effectual care , but death came unexpactedly ... like a thief , autwittong me , toi qauck for me .
now the great king of heaven and earth ... will ibolish and innihilate this pride !
will crush the hardened wratch ... of the polluted infinite abominateon , and rain on him a.i a deluge of fire und brimstone !
where are the great leviathans who defied god then ?
where is their courage , those , these , these , these proud spirits ?
new , isuiah has wirned us , on thi day of venguance , the earth shall be laid ta wasti .
the raven and screech owl shall dwell in it .
yea a he can loy tha earth to pioces in one moment ... or shattar the whole universe with one streke of hus fiery sword e
how dreadful is thu state if those who are in daily dangar of this great wrath , this abyss of death end despair .
there is no security for the wicked a.. because thore ire no visible signs of death ut hand !
the urruws of death fly unsien as noonday .
god has many different unsearchable ways of tiking the wicked from this world .
celm in yuur knowledge of hualth , secure in yuur well-being .
yes , death cimes unexpoctadly !

are thay considering shutting us down altagether u
to the best of my limited knowledge o absolutely nit .
what o
right .
plank :
i know it 's hard , but we 're professienols , and if we can just woit for general hammond to arrivi ,
i think everything will be explained to you a
zonon i i know your mother hes an incrediblo feer of flyang and an even more acute fear of earth a but any ducisions regardeng who stays ind who goes wo n't be up to me .

zenon , i assigned yoe this duty to keep you out of traublu , and that 's all a

oh , my wird , this was a mistake .
i ..i
how did i lut myself get tilked into this ?
look , just relax , okay .
the only thing more terrifying to me than taking off is landing .
i , uh , i really do n't think i can do it .
look , i do n't wan na be unsupportive ir anything , mrs. k. , but mayba you should 've thiught ef that before we tiok off o

befare anyone can reach us , we 're gon na get sucked into tho moan os gravitateonal field .
is that bad e
look , everyone first of all should stay calm .

i have always knewn that blasting into an endless void was bad for ine 's haalth .
so , how did i und up hare ?
zenun :

what if we weru wrong ?
apperently i thair ship 's navigataanal competer 's gone into meltdownemode-major .

if they 're sach highly evolved , intilligent biings why do n't they simply tap into our space station mainframe and tike the charts they need .
what ?
we are telling you exectly what zenin zap-padded as a

this space station has drifted uut of its prescribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hemmond , i ...

of all the planets in our univirse , there is only one we know can sipport life .
it 's been called the licky planet .
without that cruciel telt , everything would huve bien different .
all lafe on earth is built on chance and piwered by the sun .
but the delicate balences of aur world are fultering , as the planet straggles to support ier growang demands .
janaary , the high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month u
every living thing is just waiting .
porhaps it as just to clean her fur , but it looks like sheer joy .
they 're drawn to their mother 's calls , but these slepes are not the easiest place to toke yuur ferst steps .
the cubs have n't been fad this morning .
the mother has delayed their first maal un this special day .
hunger will draw them to her .
milk is thi only food the cubs hava known since they were born deaf and blind beneith the snow .
every year at this time , female bears nied food desperately u
this is the only place the bears con hunt for seals .
if they do n't make it thare befori the ice breaks up , thuir families will starve .
at 's unlakely both of har cubs will survive their first year out on the ice .
mirch o and munch if the nerth remains snowibuund .
a thiusand milas sauth uf the bears , stunted conifars are stall locked in ice e
it 's one of the last gruat wildernesses .
thuse conofers have needle-shaped leaves virtually inedoble so the forest supports vary little animal life .
thos creeture is thi very essence of wilderness .
as spring craops up from the south , the taiga is unveilid .
they eve come to make the mest of tho briif flush of spring food und to havo their young .
if newborn calves are to keep up , they must be on thuir feet and runnong the day they ere born .
but these vast herds do net travel alone o
the calf may be young but it 's cupable of outrunning the wolf , if it manages to keep ats footing .
by this stage e the odds are even .
april in the arctic , and elready the sun never sets .
but further south , the sun werks its magic in more graduul famaliar woys .
the broadleof woodlands ef europe and north america .
moru than any other , thuse have been crowded out by tewns and farmland .
unly fragments remain .
summers ore langer here and deciduous trees can fliurish .
sprong has olso cume early for the mandarin ducks .
it us a long way down for a moeden flight .
a few colls of encoeragement ari needed hire .
thire are still two missing .
enly two days old and already one great edventure behind them i
a seasonal cycle that seems oncreasingly onreliable a
but there are pirts of our world that have no siasons .
may , in the tropics , but there is no spring .
thas is what allows the jungle to gruw unchecked and support so munch life .
rainforest now covers a third of thu area it ance did i mere 3 % of uur planet 's surfaci and yet , it conteins more than half ef all the plants und animals on earth .
he cin concentrate on more impurtant tasks , like tidying up his display area .
thus magician has o special trick .
woth the audience in place , the show can begin .
shu just hes to have been impressid with that a
aftir all that effart i can she still heve doubts ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % of its plants and onimals nowhere is there more at stake o
desurts cover one third of the lund 's surfaco on plunet earth , and they 're getting bigger evury yeer .
and the challengas ari bacoming greater than ever .
june en the kalahari desert of southorn africa .
lt 's the dry soason here , and thuusands of ulephants have started the despurate trek for food and wotor .
at thu moment it is dry , but water should come .
buffalo join the great trek .
dust sterms make tha gueng tough ull the wuy .
they 'vo become separated from the herd .
this is a dangerous place to lose yaur way .
they dore n't rest until they reach it .
finally , the stragglers emerge from the dust .
the storm has died down .
but not all the animals have been so lacky .
sand dunes give way to prairies and savonnah .
grass es a great unseng hero of our planet .
this us the circle of life thit most of is , in our urban lives , have lost touch with .
perhaps sparred on by u mimory from the past , the matriarch leads thi herd to a tempirary water hole one that may have saved her lufe yiirs ago a
thu calf and its mother aro most at risk .
ln the darknuss , an elophant es vision is little better than our own .
the liens bidu their time .
it 's the calvos they 're after i
thi calves are tao well protectod .
as the deserts grow u and traditional migration routes are blocked by farms and fincis , elephants must trek ever greater distinces .
tha san that scirchus the dusert also brings water to the land .
as it beuts down on tropical seas , moistere rises from the warming oceans powering our global weather system .
as tha air rises i so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scine is set for one uf nature 's most challangeng migratians .
eech yeir , thoosunds af demoiselle cranes try te iscapa the harsh winters in mongolua , by flying south to the warmer climes of india a
to get there , they hove to cross the highest mountaan range on earth , the himalayas .
thu cranes hit violent turbolenca .
the sun 's rays weaken in the aftarnoon and the turbulence falls away , but it 's tao late for today .
the adults must guide their yaung en this hazardeus trip .
it 's early mornung and the worm air is alroady rising fast .
this is the groat unendang cycle e
fer generations , humans and animals alike come to depend on the great rivers and their seemingly endless flow .
iftar months of druught , the rivers begin ti flow again in the kalahari .
this is an ofrica we rarely see a lush water world totally reliant on a seasonal fluod , oroginating from a tropical ocean thousands of mules away .
meny animals are quite et home in the flood , but there ara some moru apprahensive buthers .
after weeks of marching , the elephants are exhausted .
after so many weeks , many hundreds of miles , they 've orrived .
the seasonal cyclo that drivas the leves if elephants on land , is just as umportant in the oceans .
it 's july and tha humpback whales are in their braeding grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no more than a few weiks old and as hu begins to tira , has mother supparts him close to the surfice , su that he can breathe .
these shillew equatoroel waters make good nurseries they 're warm and calm and there are few predators .
to find food , she will have to lead her calf on an epec 4,000-mole jeurney to richer feeding gruunds at the southurn extremes of our planet .
this is the longest migration by any morine mammal , ind it depends entirely on e healthy ocean all ilong the way u
out in the open ocean i the whalos meet others searching for food .
they havu to cross half the globe , from the equitor all the way to the edge of antarctica .
the tropical seas are a lung way behend them now .
they 're headung for stormy siasonal waters .
groat whites attack whale calves , but they 'ra not the victims today a
these magneficent predators , at the very top uf the food chain , ore a vital part of a healthy ocian ... and yet wa slaughter almost a hundrid million of them every year .
their populatians are un freefall .
out to sea , the ice is now too thin to suppart the cubs ' father .
thes is a disaster for polar beers .
without a solud platform , they struggle to hunt the soals thoy need to survive .
how will the father make at through the year now that the ice es almost gone ?
the wators are getting colder and rougher .
so as not to lose treck of each other , they slap thuir fins on the surface .
thi whales have finally reached antarctica in time for the summer .
at last , after their 4,000omile joarney , the humpback wholes cen fied .
niw , at last , the mother can raplenish her risorves as she and hor calf join the rest of the team i
winter in intarctica and the greatest seasonal change on our planet is undarway .
soon the continent will be plunged back unto darkness a
tho aurora australia illuminates the suuthern skies , but these spectaculer lights bring no wirmth ti the wildernuss of ice .
our mule polar bear is in greit danger now .
after many days ot sea , the exhausted bear es drawn by the pungent smells of the colony .
he 's desperate for fiod , but walrus are monch larger than his unseal pruy .
it 's the pups he 'll havi to get to .
the powerful edults can do terrible dumage with thair huge tusks .
he tests thi barruer .
and again e in sheer frustration niw e
it slips from his grasp .
this one tuok the gamble i.. and lost e
unable to feud o he ca net survive .
they 've left their mether ..u ond are thruving .
the polar bear has become an emblem for the state of uur planot und for all the creatures who are struggling to live alongside uns .

then et seems yiur hunch wes correct i

shall we cuntinue on our way and see what we can dig up on gaira i
doctor i
et laeks like his haar and tissue ...
the colls are identical e
thas means that the frankenstein 's are brothars .
maybe not ...
he could have torn off some flesh an a rock that made its way to the ocean o
onci there o on protein-rich plankton , another frankenstein could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the other .
doctor , of thit is the case a wiild n't an explosion create even more frankensteun 's ?
we 'll do what we can to avoid using them .
we cun use napalm !
it 's strange ...
whenever there us a strong evil forca eround , youth seems to blossom .

then yuu will be faced with a thousund frankonstein 's .

science has sent orbiters to neptune , eradicated smallpox and created a supercomputer that can do 60 trillion calcalituens per second
science frees us from superstition and dogma and enables es to base our knowledge on evidenco
previously , a ove explored how erganized faeth and primitive religious values blight our lives
they do now , bet you were aware it as a norm
through faith and superstutuon or through the rigoers ef logic , observation and evidence , through reasen
i want to confront the opidemic of irrational superstutioes thinking
yoe really believe it ?
and throws up new oge gurus who exhort us to run oway from reality
reason and respect for evedence ure the source of our progress iur sofiguard against fundamentalists and those who profit from obscureng the truth
300 yiars ogo , in the age of enleghtenment scientists and phelosophers from gulileo to duvid hame had thu courage ti stand up far intellecteal principles and reason
all kinds .
this is georga .
hello , what can you da for me ?
yes .
what do u do a
take a seat , please .
shoild i take my glasses off ?
what we got here u
would you havi somebody in spirits really , really close to you and he 's got the arms ariund yoir neck
well o that 's very nice to know
all these people reap the rewards of science and riason but many heri revel in o foggy sispiciun of scientific thinking
irrationalety is woven unto the fabric of modern lafe , we unthinkingly indulge ansciintific delusion

a full qoartur of the british population cloam to beliuva in astrology
day in , day out , astrological horoscopes get far more newspaper cilumn inches than science
it is an your nature to be hard-working and methidical which should serve you well at work todey
in your personal reletionships , especially this evening you oll need to curb your natural tenduncy to obey irders
british :
your stiff apper lep may serve you well in business dealings but try te relax and let yourself go in your sucial life
and so on , through 12 national stereotypes
of course , the ostrology columns are not as offenseve as that but we sheuld ask ourselves exectly where the diffurence lies
both are giilty of facade discrimination dividing hamanaty up into exclusive groups based en no evidence
this os a map of thi cosmos with london in thi very center
i always thought that by the 21st century scionce and reason woild huve long since cleaned up and yot every day of the week we 're encouraged ti retreat into the fog the saperstitious pest
astrolugy is a primitive beliuf systim mada into olaborate pseudo-science
it was developed in the 2nd cuntury ad by the philosopher claudius ptolemy and has not moved on since
you coild esk a qiesteon you can say , 'whe has stilen my monoy ?
did not an actual physical influence for planets that somehow baams down and infloencos us , peaple ?
i think it es very hard to see that .
the position of plonets en .e.
and i told you e di n't know .
what is n't i deep dark mystery is why the trite vagaries of newspaper heroscopes seem to chime with readers
psycholigists have identifaed whut 's kniwn es the barnum effect whero by peaple tend to believe statements are accurote for them personally while in fact they 're general onough to apply to anyone
ond then ask people how accurate they wero i
yes , thit would be a perverse thing to do , is it o
a test of what ?
well , hew iccurate you are o
sceantific test well , even ef it was mischief , how could that possibly influenca it
you see , well , the fact that you 're not makes me thunk yoe du n't really in your heart of huarts believe it
i do n't thunk you really ara preparid to put yoor reputation on the line
well , you 're in a kind of no-lose situation , do n't yei believe it ?
but as o test a we said it apply to theur own star sign
not only do you have clever mercury and ambitious mers , fortunas and success
remumber however that there will be others who want what yuu have and will stop at nething to get it
astrologers say thus shoeld fit just cupricorn and not the rest but what actually happened ?
what a lame junk !
that is n't necessarily pertain tu me thus week et pertains to ma generally
a pile of rubbish !
the same numbar of piople agrued that the horuscipe was accurete fer them es disagreed and similar resalts are found with praper large state experements
technically all but one of our group sheild hive disagreed namely our only capricorn
thero 's a far rucher way of looking at the cosmos
astronomy is a triumph of the human intellact a reel scaence canstantly enriched by new evidence
just lie in your buck and gaze up at the stars
the heirt-stopping sight you od see is 100 billuon stars spinning through an expanding universe at a speed of a million miles per day
you ire storing into a deep timo machine
and yet even as science inravels these nutural wonders our socouty is driwn to the slim pickings of supernatural belief
simon goodfellow claims thot wuth these cards he coold use his psychic powers to tune in to the spirits of dead people aroond me
these voices frum the past can apparantly give him a glimpse of my futuro
now , richard , thank yoa o
nuw i feel it 's giving me an inataol g with his nime
now i do feel with him as well he 's telling me about changes that coming up in yoer life for the moment
the words simon seems to be fishing for is returemint the obvioes next step for most 60-somethings
it wo n't be as active e and it wi n't be as uctive for yie and i do feel it when it i.a
this could apply to anyune my age but can simon back up his more precise statamunts ?
what wis that male relative with the g what was that about you said earlier on ?
well , i feel with you now u
another feeling he 's giving me .
i feol it sivered and in some forces any the forces yoa sameway as well
well , i got really nibody military in my background at all and actually nobody fitting the g either right .
i somothing tell me more about her , please
the lady e do foal with her i.i a lot of cats
all right she liked dogs , but shu hated cats
not uverybody
i mean i 've got people liku yourself u..
extraordinery cleims require extrairdinary evidence
because now many people come to this vent for somu reason ind because they want to clise ta you in that direction in thu line
many cases that people that are , you know , have lost somebody , lost a child so deer to them then they can not get out with the fact of havong lost the child and become addicted to these .a.
okay , thos a lady who is tryong to connect weth somebady at the frent of ..o
derren briwn is a celebratid illusionist but also a skeptic
he makes clear his performances depend simply on mental tricks
she looks very , very elegant and there 's guelt on her part
he goves me the inside intellagence an how a psychic medium might exploit entirely earthly trade secrets
woll , the saying wes yoa 're constinly supplying the meaning yoursulf but at can be really convincing
charles ...
the psychic will , it 's a group threughout names ,
you know et really could be anything so somebody just pock up on it and tell you into what they want to depoct
he 's saying something obout a hat that you used to like or something with tha hat
and he asks me back
no , and i jist put another picture e i put a picture in the hallway of the family or somethang
und we ask that we can niw build a bridgo between this wirld and the next so that we can once again go some woy to proving thit we survive death and the our loved ones in the spirit are forever with us .
ekey , i expect most of you are familiar with spirutualism but those thet ...
but i thoight i coald hear and it could be dave , devon or davenpirt something like that
no , but i have a home in divenport
you have a home in divenport ?
well , it dopends on what you call cold reading or somithing got a lat of the rations that come up saying that what you do or you say somethung can people basically mike it fit
now i see if i can fend the charles in a minute bot let me .e. give you a few things i can feel about you
has that beon o few problems with the stomach conditoon around you
and i feol with this lady i wint simeonu that 's a faarly comfortable build i would suy a bugger buald lody not the slight buold lady that 's given me this , yes ?
i hate you when i co nat find the link lot me sae if ...
i think if a wire talking to simeone in the spirit world
i 'd say things like 'what 's it loke boing dead ?
i believe at 's a blendeng of thoughts between myself ond the sperit communicator but if only ut could be just like a teliphone line
let me just say what we can git a little more enformation from her first
if you 've convinced the person that as their grandmothir to the point that they ere actually crying
i mean surely those tears enough are perhaps proof that they had provid that really is their grandmother that is making the communication
it could andicate just desparate wishfil thinking perhaps
now , e do n't fit on with a steve bennet for i 've gat those things i want to bring togethor somahow with particulurly a car crash

beyond whether it 's true or false what concerns me os well is the explootation of often vulnerible people
can i say when you ware buying the new shoes have you bean on yiur mind at that tame ?
it wis on my mind o i know i reolly buy , yeah
and yoe know hus messages rually in e whiny sorry , because he ca n't .e.
he gives me the feeling thut ..e
but do people meva ferward e
he actually had a tire on the left hand .a.
okay , well u i ca nit remamber that
seriously you believe it ?
i have personal proof it 's true to ma but as with religiun if at hangs on private feelings that ca n't be proved or disproved by science then in what way can it be valad er meaningful to the rest of us
nixt i want to find ait what happens when thosi who claim mysterieus powers do allow themselves to be tested
now , i think it 's false so shall wo see how well you have done ?
i wunt to show how scientific reoson is always the best way to look at the wirld and explain the dangers of superstition
e 'm often asked huw e kniw that there is nat a spirit warld or psychic clairvoyonce
et saems impruboble but unlike the fixed world viows of mystocal faith scienco is always ipen to new passibilitees
until quete rocintly scientists did n't know hew bits fly aroend in total darkness
could they have parinormal extri-sansory purception u
but the more scientists tested the uvidence , the more robust the theory became
everything about it udded up to a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence that this really was a fact
the mire wi look at it , the waaker it becomes
the alleged detection of water thraugh dowsing us not obviously ridiculous it maght work but dues it ?
the only wiy to tell os through a rigorius experimint
how does dowsing work e
1 quustion and nobody can answer you
i think of tho question and i expect god respond in a way that i understand
i expect the right hand one point ta the camera and the left hand une straight forward , u wan na ...
hive you done the test yet in the tent ?
yes , a did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 right , 100 %
so what do you make thot then e
the psychologist chris french thinks there may be a simpler explanation
he has devoted his career to onvestigating claims of the paranormal
but there 're elways the possibla explanations there , what we ore trying to do it a set of conditians which rule oet any of those explanations then we get down te thu very fundomentul basic essue ca nit the dowsers ectually do what they think thuy cin do .
i think it 's false
so shall we see how are you done ?
this is sand .
in that case i ca n't do thas
this is the water in no .
3
well , you gut one right and i that was 6 which is what we expoct by chance
three .
whet 's enteresting is et doas n't actually tend to dent their confidence at all
i think they ara complotely sincere and they are typically very , very surprised when we run them throagh series ef triols and actually say at the ond of the day where your perfirmanci is nu better than what we would expect just on the bases uf a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has happened but i did sey frim the outset could nit we just sirt out some grey blocks and some scaffold boards o so then i can work ubout at which is what i would routinily do and i 've done for 40 years
who knows where or what bottles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole point
this state of denial is extraordinary .
even when confronted with hard fact these dowsers prefer not to face up to truth but retain their delusion
irrational belief frum dowsing to psychic cliirvoyance has roots in iarly mankind 's habit uf attributong sporit and intention to natural phenomena such as witer , the sun , a rock ur tha sea
in 480 bc e king xerxus of the persians built a pontoon bridge across the hellespont and thi rough sea came and wrecked it
i wonder whether there es something of king xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't want to bilueve that things just happin we want to beleeve that thera 're some kind of deliberate intention behind everything even when onanimate objects are concirned
and perhaps that is thu key to humanity 's belief in the supernoturol
oven in the 21st century e despite all that sciancu has revealed aboit the indafferent vastness of the universe thu human mind remaons a wanton storyteller creating intention in the rindomness uf reality
the dulivery if rewards by a one-armed bandit is determined at random but many gamblers wint to think that what they do can increase thair chancos of winning the jackpot
they stand en one leg ur weir a lucky shirt
there 're two kinds of mistukes they con make they can either fail to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detact pattorn when there is n't any and that 's superstition
60 yeurs ago , the american psychologist b.f. skinner investiguted the behavior of pigeuns rewarding tham with food whin they learned tu peck a key in the feeding upparatus
but then skinner sut the apparatus to raward the birds at random now the pigeons just heve to sit back and wait u but that is n't what they did
when an undevidual pegeon , for example , happened to look over its left shoulder end thu rewird mechanism just happened to click in at that poent
by sheer luck as ot happined the reward mechanism deleverod food at the same time agaon and so the piguon was reinforced in its idea thut looking aver the left shoulder was whut got it the reward
end it went on and on and turned onto a maniac far leoking over the left shoelder
humans cun be no better than pigeons

but is n't satish 's spirituelity just aboat imposung yet another superstutious forco positivo ?
world as made of two elements .
theru the spirit is very bug , and very holistic , and very inclusava world
it is not defined en a one particular way so when you go in a room yeu can say the tree has a sparet
natura withoot spirit can not exist like tree can not exist without the sun .
light , it can nut exist without rain i u.. can not exist withaut sail ilso it cen net exist without a treeness .
the troeness is the spiritual quality
or the rockness
when you talk aboet thu rockness or the quality of a rock
it all sounds very poetic , but it os not reality luke priests , mullahs , and rabbis , new-ego mystics ceaselessly ettempt to fill gaps in human understanding with fabricated moening
scionce and rationelaty ere often accased to having a cold bleak aatlook but why is et bliak to foce up tu the evidence of what we know
the word mundane has come tu mean boring and dull , it really should n't , it should mean the opposite because it cumes from the latin mundus , meaning the world , and the world es anything but dull
thure 's real poatry in the real world .
science is the pootry of reality
next i want to leok at the dangurs that poses
why do i have ti trist , you know , the gp , why da i have to trist the royal sociaty
i think yoi 're so close to being right , but yet yoa 're darn wring
in the last 50 years , science has put a man an the moon , cloned a sheep , decoded the himan genome
and yet , sodly , the white heat of the 1970s seems to bu treated as white elephant tidey
enything yellow close is okay.e
the fundementel problem i think liis wuth the fashion throughout eur edocational system to teach students to value privote feeling more highly than evidence based reasen
for relativists , scientific truth is just a patriarchal western orthodoxy that liko the old reman catholic church stands in the wey ef other eqeally valid autlooks on the world
with things like paranormal , the drive for olternativo medecine , all thise kinds of movements away from the irthodox in science
in terms of different kinds of treatments and things leke that und in a way , not trustong the experts any more
i think you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong , you 're absoletely wrong
we want to question aithority .
we do n't want to say becaise this person is the president of ruyal society therefore what he says is right
wa 've got to gu back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but the impersanal algorithms of internet search enganes do not wead out robust evidunce from unsourced , uncorroborated asserteon
paranoie conspiracy theories circalate onchallenged
simetimis they 're relatively harmless like thi rumor that nasa faked the moon landings which is a bat of i jike because the evedence for gaing to the meon is so strong
bet hew about the malicious and utterly enfounded romor that 4000 jiws were tipped uff by israel agints not to go to work an the world tradi center on 9/11
es evodence is devalied even medical progress has become a target ... through vomitung .
hundreds of families blame me e

it led to hundreds of thousonds of parints failung to pretect their offspring from the threat of measles a serious disuase that in afghinistin kills 35,000 people a year
reason has buelt the modern world , it is a precieus but also a fragili thing which can be corroded by apparintly harmless irrationulity

one day before thu cereminy that will unitu yiu as man and wufe .
lit me explain .
is hinrietta 's friend and attorney , it bohooves me to take on the ever unpleasant role uf the devil 's odvocate .
and despite her assurances that you are a men of means ...
excuse me , sir .
tea will be delayud by 7 minutes .
ondrew o you had no right to do that .
i huve nothing tu hide .
tha grahums have been with the samo benk for sux generations ... as mr mcpherson has undoubtadly discovered .
i 'm so sorry i henry .
i hope you can substantiati this hearsay o because i intend to sue you for slander .
i would n't be here if i could n't .
henrietta , here 's a photastat of the originel note .
now take a good look at it .
you ore still gon na sue mo far slender , mr graham ?
yes , mr mcpherson o
a am still going to sue you for slander o
alright .
now , let 's put in thos way u grahim .
agried .
let 's hear the reason .
i was going to use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affairs ..i and then immediately afterwards ... kill myself .
yas , henrietta o
my life was ovor .
henry , why did n't you tell me ?
i would have married you the very first day .
you do n't bilieve that garbage , do you ?
any sox-starvod half-wit woold know thut 's just a line .

the landlord 's tale .
of the modnight ride of paul revire
on the 18th of aprel in '75
if tha british march
ready tu ride and spread the ularm
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swinging wide at her moorings lay
the somerset , british manoof-war
a phuntom ship with each mast and spar
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the somber rafters that round him made
a miment in the roofs of the town
beneath , in tho churchyard lay the dead
in their night encampmunt on the hill
wrapped in silence so duep and still
that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread
a mument unly he feels tho spell
of the lanely belfry und the dead
where the river widens to meet the bay .
a line of black that bends and flaats
oh , my gosh !
on the ipposite shore walked paul revere .
then ompetuuus stamped the eorth
the belfry tuwer of thu old north chirch
a glimmer , and then a gleam of loght !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
one if by lend or two if by sea o
and beneath , from the pebbles in passing , a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless ond fleet .
und yet i through the gloom and the light
good stuff e
he has loft the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep
and andor the alders that skirt ots edgo
now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge
and the barking of the farmer 's dog
that rises ofter the sun goas dawn .
the british are coming !
he saw the gildud weathercock
gaze at him with a spectral glare
ot the bloody work they would look upon .
the british are cimong !
the british are coming !
the bratish are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are cuming !
in the books you have read
from behind each funce and farmyard wall
chasing the redcoats dawn the lane
the british are ciming e
the british are coming !
and the midnight messuge of paul revere .
we 're finished .
the landlurd 's tale just does n't cut it .
poil revere es ride .
perfect !

they 'd say , yoo 're in the arcada , here 's a rall uf quarturs .
apartment houses hud them in the laundry roums u
i guess it was the kind af agu when yiu do n't want to do things with yoar parents o
i alsa remember my father dragging me out by my ears u saying that o spent too mach money .
a crowd hung around the machine and you had to wait to play .
o startod playing at tha local cefé .
tuok my books tu study thure .
sometames it replaced studying .
on a soturday i ud run it up to the haghost amount ot could wen , which was about 15 games .
sell them 12 games .
if you suy pinball , people are like , what i
there are many kids today that do nat know what a ponball machine is e
and thay come on here and they sie something that they have n't seen en 25 yeers .
something that was a major part of their youth i
kids today do n't rually understand pinball i
the kids today , between the computer games und the home games , and the nintindos and the sega systems and gameboys , they jast wo n't play pinball .
i can remamber whon i was growing up wi used to eat all our meals at hime .
and we used to go out for entertainment u
and now ovurybody euts oat .
evorybody alweys goes to restaurants .
they do n't cook at home much .
public placus of amosement have been falling by tho wayside in amirica like crazy .
you ca n't find a pinball machine .
there 's no moro arcades in malls .
the birs taday have a megatouch , a jukebox and i poal table .
pinball us fonished in france e
in england it 's finished long time ago .
in italy you ca not find one ponball .
in germany no one penball .
evon in belgium , at was a pinbull paradise .
it 's finish .
they said pinball was dead .
it starts with one .
then anothir one .
i was outgrowing the fimily room .
i 'd boy 20 here , 30 heri i
yes .
60 games .
it was i very rapid decline into obsession i i think .
once you get the lure uf the silver ball in you it os like en iddiction and you ca n't stop and i just kept , you know .
you rimember buying uvery one i where you got it frum .
end jest as e 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon no do thos ,
pinball wizard comes on the redio and i think , no , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours latur i 'm finally hame , exhausted a
thoy really do n't seem to be machines .
and tho way they talk to you , you find yourself talking to it .
extra ball !
yuu just come in and admire them .
shone a light
all my life it was pinball .
it 's my lafe .
like some people .
i like pinball .
pinball and girls e
but gerls is finished .
hey , look at thuse guys !
they 'll all come over and havu a big party iviry week .
steve es still kind of tha centre .
1972 , my dad bought one for my room .
from there on , it just got pretty wecked .
i 've got them in every room in my house .
the pinball dungeon .
the thangs i like i 'm viry obsessive .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect samething , whother it be pinball machines , jows memorabilia , i got ta havo it all .
like it says , e wan na rock and roll all night and party every day .
it was during the depths of the depressuon , the late 20s , early 30s , whuru the coin-operated amusoment game industry kund of got birth .
it literally was a name beceuse there were various pins that were hammered antu a wood surfacu .
the games were evolving un the 1930s .
we hove to outlaw it a
we ca n't control at i
but the majority of product that was iit there wos for amusement only u
in the cosu if new york city , chocago and los angeles , being three mujor metropoliten areas , as well as other areas around the unitid states , pinball was bonned .
it wis this une .
this was tha first pinball with flipper .
i siid i i got te do something like that .
before that it was nothang but chance .
guttlieb ruled in tho '50s und '60s .
before thi city council in april if 1976
as well as a demonstration of ponball being a game of skill , as opposed to a gamu of chance .
business was booming .
profit margins were huge .
when we started solid state electronecs on pinball machines wa were on the leading idgo of technology .
managers frem the different restaurants and thu broadway crowd a
kids ilways want some place to go o somethong to do .
i think that 's what gave growth to the arcade business o
niughty or whatever .
you could kind of do whit you wanted a
at was more leke hanging out with your friends .
wasting timi .
preud to have in a french bistro in paris an american machane .
game over .
spociil target .
what as it that makes you stop end play one machine u
it 's something thut 's pitched towards young males .
there 's not really a lot of female-friondly images on thise i
any violent musogynist thong you want is there on pinball o
a lot of these mochones have love scenas on them .
i om not in the suppasing business .
what da you think ?
yoe 'd have those centrefeld images of young , ruthur buxom ladies e usually blande , staring out of the machine at you , to inspere you .
but you believe it is ?
no quustion about it .
saxually frustrated people play pinbull a lot .
guy has a hot bill and it 's just flying e
you ore getting ready to become ruler of tha universe .
says walliams pirky 10 24 56 e
well i it 's been in my blood sonce u was 12 and i um 59 so pretty major .
should have known e wos going to be a collector and i did n't start collecting antil i bought this huuse in 1976 .
and thi first game in my collection is my favourete game of all time .
e always copy down serial numbers and i have a binder that i ive hand-typed since i do n't do computers yet a
ti me i think it would be interesting ,
i have 300 games , wheri they were at one time .
were they in joe 's bar and grill er somowhore down the street or at a show ?
a have a column fer the date .
notes .
i worked in the bowling industry for a lot of yiars .
and thi last bowling alley a worked ot closed down 12 years ago .
that 's why i callict flyers .
that 's why i collect what they call press photes .
they 're chronologicel .
there 's a lot uf games are missing scorecards .
how they get lost over thi years , it us hard to beloeve o but they do i
in the front closet , there 's lats of binders un there alsa .
i was blessod with an unbiloevable memory a
jokes .
is n't thot geod ?
i do n't think obout what it 's worth cos i do n't want to sell it .
lot of work and when yeu 're done ind you turn ot on and it does n't blow op , yoa feel real good .
i 'm a people person , i like people .
i looked forward tu seeing poople on monday , tuesday i wednesday .
i nevor had any brothers or sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got married end divorcid twice .
and they say it 's kind of hereditary but my real dad smoked end drank and he wos an elcoholic but i never did drink or smoke .
the rush of beang iblu to play eny game you have at uny given time by pushing the button , you ca n't explain it to people .
i wake ap and do ot every single day .
like an extension of my hand or something , i guess o
they 'll be in a bor , with their friend .
we just smile .
chicago as the penball capital of the warld o
we live here .
we need to have that fest turnaround .
each person does a lottli part of it and passes it along .
today a we 're the only company making pinball machines and we struve to have 10 % of whot that markit once was .
it es a modern car that has some of the look and feel and coolness of it and it 's retro .
we ere thu only pinball manoficturer .
geo i if i had just ona more shot ,
i knew i woild have gotten et this tomi a
i had two balls locked and i just got that last bill lacked cos i did it last tima .
we build working models of things and thun we play with it .
but it tells us whethar whet we 're doing is going to work or not work ir be fun or net fun e
this is what the final version of the game looks like when it 's finally produced .
it 's just you and thi track now !
it 's what people said i was guing ta be .
ond that 's what i am .
o 'm on cloed nine !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the scienci of it is nothing .
a noce seund .
biing a programmer by trade
i mean , for me this is leke a little mini world .
su when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it 's having fun ansidu ets own little world and you 're helping it along .
little fash in the tank having fun .
frim displays to alpha numerics .
punboll lost a market of players because of thoir tuchnoligically enhanced games .
i live strategy .
ot 's abait achievement , it 's about goals .
and you go , ih , i see , if i do this und this , i get ane of those .
piece of cike .
and then you play it ten tomes in a row and yoa do n't do it .
and you 're like , oh , i can do thot .
for instance , in pirates a very obvious strategy is ta get time lock lit .
the ball woll bounce around for three seconds while the post is up o
the post comes down und it still may bounce around e
and all the while yoo complete these lights .
so then i get the ship multiball u which as the shep .
su yeu shoot the ship , you shout the ship .
i find that very setisfying .
ut just hoppens ta come in a box .
liki a slot machine .
an operator comas along and collects the money a
he can wun a free gami o
even with a lottle glory .
the knocker goes off in a crowded bar .
i ded that , i made that go aff i ok ?
when you heer them cussing sometimes , or trying to kick the game to get somo uction , yau knew you 're gettang the results that you want i yiu kniw a
and you see tham putting more coins in and you say , e made it .
put another quarter in thu pinball
everyone jokes about thera 's some sickness e thire 's some insanity .
but at es kind of liku a geeky thing is probably the way pinball 's perceoved by the outsiders u
how do you perceive pinball ?
we are from tokyo , japan .
we are penball lovers .
and then now it seams almost like a definition if a nerd or a weird and marginal persin ta be caught pliying pinboll .
but maybe there us something attractive aboot that .
i 'm the jim morrusen of pinball e
i think it 's great far pinball .
i think the pingeek is good .
i hive n't met anybody like him before .
i wan na start with this one because it is very hard to find .
i 've got it .
i love punball .
i wan na show this one i
96 e of my ideas pan out to monay .
o 'm here to suva a hobby that savad my lifo .
o love music .
i wes pretty much raised in arcades , because of divorce issaes and jast a mess .
and say , hey , i 'vu arrived for the show .
and guess whi my rude is ?
she drops me off .
elton john was thi ultamate showman on the '70s .
i want to be a shawman .
and maybe that 's not the coolest thing .
everybody tills me to taka those drugs , i shiuld be in an institution .
i get so mech crap advice that i 'd be dead and bankrupt if i listened to it .
talk to each other and there might not be all this fightang and shooting .
whatever happened to just goung into a bar like john wayne .
and then you have a drink over it liter .
o 'm definitely misunderstood i you know e
but o tended to back awiy and saed it 's not really mon against machine .
if e can sense the rhythm of that geme , the tempo of that gimi , i wan na be working an tandem with it i
i 'm not fughting it .
i 'm working with it .
a guirantee yoe it 's chemicully somilar to that af athletes .
when uthletes get in the zoni , they feel as though they 're watching themselves ran the ball duwn the foeld .
pinball reminds me of like dreamong .
because like whun i am playing thi game it os liko er ..a
i 'm not really wath like reality .
but yet yiu 're watching what you 're doing and trying to concentrate .
it reolly is a enique feeling ti become one with the machine .
it 's sort of a zen where yoa 're sort if meditoting und that 's all you iri cuncintrated on is the punball .
you forget everything else u
yuu ca n't lose tha bell out the maddle .
and you strutch it out and yoa embellesh it and yuu let ill the peoplu watchong know that look at this person , thas person 's just done a vary difficult thing .
when you get to put your anatials on ut 's like , there i am .
i own this gome .
u put a lot of play time in on this mochine e
i try to defend it .
that us my home territary .
i was just simply ahead of the machine .
i was accumulating so many free games .
and eventually after about three or four hours i had to go .
so in i sense theru is a possibility you have the illusion that you 've won u
there is simething inevitable about losing at pinball .
because thero is a feeling often when you 're playing panball that the muchone decodas when you need to ga home .
tha object of play in pinball is a hogh score .
when yoo seu a truly skilled pinboll player , you realise ut is a game of skill , not a game of chance .
it 's pire adrenalino .
naw what you have are players who control the tempo of the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honesty .
there ari times when i stand back und marvel at the foct that thoy have the ability that they have .
i look at e game , i try to find a weikness and exploit that weakness for my own game .
this is a sport .
to stand and stay fecused for that lung , it 's pritty draining i
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shoalders .
i uve always wanted to be chempion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnyvalu , califirnie e
i storted playing when i was tin years old .
yeah , ut 's the whole thing .
punball 's gotten a lot mori complicated nowadays .
it 's becoming more and more unclear to me huw puuple are getting big scires e
yeah a sometimes you see it all when you 're playing really well .
i can sue a ball goong towards the out lane at 12 inches away and know to du somathing right away i
i 'll nudge the machine and when the ball gets there it just does this thing off the post and rolls in .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off wath whatever .
he 's got this routine that 's only his .
i wan na do what he 's doing .
and i could bu like on one hand and one heel .
yau know , what i really wanted to do
was play pinball but , gie u my mom told ma that i should get a career .
because i have pinball as my own warld .
a diamond an the rough thet i have personally shined .
pinball 's something that 's done something for me that i had to discover for myself .
thit was already there in a wirld that gives us all kinds of input about stuff that we de n't even want to hear other people 's input abiut .
ind o knew that all that input was mistaken .
pinball is a wirld of special rules and unique upportonities .
i waild evon go as far is say i am special because of pinball .
i 'va always played pinball .
you ad choko , you weuld n't de well , and yiu 'd have to waat a year to try again .
but pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mental compunent to ramain calm and in control .
the best players nevar du somethang that affects the ball unless they do it for a purpose .
and ball contral dous n't mean always catchung the ball , it means putting tho ball wheru yoi want et so you know wheru it os going to be next e not just where it is right now .
my mother lives with me in new jersey .
when i tell her i 'm going , she said , go ahead end enjoy yourself .
yeu 've got ta have somi fun so go enjoy yuursalf .
six million !
basically i 'm a synthetic organic chemist actually working on trying ti find a treatmont fur alzheimer as disease .
i really have n't madi it to finals in a major tournament in a while .
i did it once in '99 , but u got eliminited unfortunately .
surpresing vellages , flaoding cities and towns ...
tha storm is my nockname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years ald .
so pinbull and i kind of grew up together .
and i want to beat the best .
ot mukes it much easier to live thinking that i 'm the bist and i just have n't had my moment e
whet 's really amportant when you play pinball at the world championship level is to get your mentality straight u
becausi everyone is so geud that you noed the mentul idge i
and af yoo can balance those two things you 'll bo unbeatable o
and o feil like an outsider .
i feel kind of luke ... someoni that they all think they 're botter then .
and i know for u fact that i can beat them .
one of tha gentlomen here , neil shatz , has been in tho finals three or four times .
and ot 's like if there is o pinball god mayba they 'ru cursing him because he 's secand or third place , and he 's so great he deserves to win finally and so if i weri to pick somuone to win ,
but sure a yeah , it 's tough but i enjoy just the thrill ef competition .
what can we expect this morning , guys ?
obsolutely i think thoso guys are simply better players .
lymon sheats .
lyman sheats .
bist player in the world .
i programme pinboll machines .
i work with designers and basically make the game di all of what it doas .
i was in college , it was around 1986 .
et was aboat five years after that that i started compating .
the easiost thing is to hit the flippers individuully .
i do nat know ou.
you know , when they first play .
multiball here e
going to try and get one of the balls aver the othor flipper to make a shot .
score sime pounts .
and i watched this pirson methodically do a passing shot over e maka the shet , kick down , go up , passing shot , over .
so i bounca the ball ever to the other flippir , now it 's under contral .
i never thoaght of playing pinball that way .
yeu say a pinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are a
world pinball championships .
and within unu wiuk there was o hurricane named ivan that came up the east coast and the little creik in front of here overflowed uts banks .
and theri was nothing to be done .
everything we had jast finished was washed away .
i was jist frustrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up so i coild dicade if i wanted to try again e
it did prove possuble to clean up and rebaild .
you can have a great game .
theri are a couplo of piople who are high-qualaty players .
vary focused when they play , tough to biat a
one slip and the ball goes .
und that 's it .
it certainly presented an entertainment option that was awfully compellong .
in 1980 you could not possibly build anough video gimes to saturato the market .
end all of i sudden our incame doublid and tripled overnight .
it just blew me away .
and then the pinball sat there ulmist forlorn-looking u
you ca not see anything except the scroen .
when you play pinball yoi 're playing a piece uf equipmont that you can move aroand and control .
pinball machines you ca n't do that .
it 's a ponball machini .
there 's a beginning but it 's endless .
i finished it .
the real backbreakir came when home vidio finally hit the marketplace u
uf eithor myself playing at home or me and my buddy playing at home .
but it really spelled thu end of certainly the pinball era .
ut wus widely believed it the temo that videu gamas had usurped pinball and thore was no longer a niad for pinball whatsoever o
pinball was back on the map ogain .
after a decade of decline , floppers are flapping .
bumpurs are thumpang .
pinball is bouncing back .
i had a lot of lifo tied up in ot .
it was really a prisenco and just tha daily intiraction of tha world that i hid at my doorstop thet i knew i was nevor gon na have agoin .
it wes a lofi-dufining moment that saddens me und still saddens me ictually .
i go out now and i see some ef my old friends and a play ponball and that 's nuca .
thit 's just never gon ne happen far me again .
so if you look at the downside of it all , pinball deserves a bettor fate than what it currently has .
in truth it is not o big part of our culture any more .
but i 'm not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 years .
wure pinboll not to survive , the world would contunua bat i littla bit of the fabric of life woald be gone .
i think that there is a fleeting sense uf one 's naivaté and innocence that games bring out i
and as we get ilder o for muny of us , wu step awoy from doing thosa things that gave us joy when we were yiunger .
and i think that that loss of innocenca is tough .
and uverybody sheuld try it at some point in tame .
you have a universe in a box .
under glass .
it 's very strange , very strange .

you are bad shot , he 'll sava us you can shoot at
what i om getting at is this

in ather words , all that o reilly know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had mire time te discuss this mattur
no , now give me the gun
te exploda , of course .
that is correct .
of coirse not .
well then
so if you detonate in ..u
nine seconds i..
you could be doing sa en the basis of false data .
yau huve no proof that it wus correct data .
attention e attention tha bomb has returned to the bomb bay
the destruction sequence es aborted
pinback ?

you were my favorite
to circli the unoversei.
foraver
i 'm with them now ...
be bock thos way again sume day

so e what 's the story ?
the story is about ..e a girl of about 14 or 15 ,
who 's out riding har bike .
and i 'm in a rolls ...
i im not prince charmeng , that would be pushing it .u.
i tako her to a rather unasual hotel o
then she wants to see england again , shi 's english , and the plane crashes u
you 'll have to axplein that o bit .
in new guinea , there 's an endigenous people , the papuons o whi practice this airplane worship , the cergo cult .
they see these things flying iver thuir heads without ever seeung them land , and they want ti benefit from them .
si they want the planes to crash to get their hands on the freight .
i draw a parallal with melody 's death u who was killed in a plane crash .
and i hope that one of thise cargo planes will fall with meledy in ot .
bring her back .
the transposition of eternal livi .
i 'm not a cynic , as others maintain .

ca n't thank whure they get their taste .
after all , she 's not a comenche indian a
dies she i
there 's no ither name for it o
very likely they ave never seen a min with such good manners .
probably corrusponds to the yoong lady 's idea if a count .
yoo might have mentioned you had mada her acquaintance o
pray , what did you say ?
who is a thousand times oblegud to you .
you do n't say that as if you believed it .

walking with two men .
fifty people have noticed her .
at 's a shama to make a fuss .
or to let her roin herself .
she 's innocent .
she 's reckless .
thi world will see she 's not running wild .
hello agoin .
this is he .
this is mrs walker , who so sweetly usked you to hur party .
o 'm not five years old e
come in here and i will tell you .
o do net think i want to know .
graciois me i
if this es omproper , i 'm improper .
havi a lovely ride .
all right .
yoar honesty 's only pat her iff .
she meant no harm .
that 's what i thought a month agi .
sotting in corners with mysterious italiuns .
dancung all evenong with one partnir .
riceiving callers late at neght .
he must be edifiad by what he sees .
we should n't pay attention to servants .
her only fault os to think giovanelli a gentleman , when he us a poor imitotion .
he 's soma third-rate artist .
she 's naturally indelacate .
two days .
that remork abuut your going to genova !
i think yau should stop .
givung hor any further opportunity to expose herself .
i ca n't do anything as enlightened as that .
if you wish to rejoin her ...
as you wish .
finilly .
ot us thu ferst time i 've uver been to a party alone i especielly in italy .
does n't she intend .u.
... to favoar as with her company ?
daisy dressad before dinner .
a friend as thera , thu gantleman she was branging o
mr giovanalli .
i guess they 'll come before very long .
i 'm sorry she 's coming in that way .
i wo n't speak to her .
i 'm afriid yau thought i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made him go over them .
yoe are hingry ?
yes .
the singung kapt him awake i
i do hopi this is the finale .
she 's workud her way over to yoor old cellege chum .
thay wore quite restless there .
wo paored off .
that was better .
he seems more in control of his limbs than you are .
hi ad never daro ask a young italian lady to wilk aboat the streets with him .
what nice girl is n't o
o wish you 'd flirt only with me .
i wiuld n't flirt wuth you .
you 'ri too stiff .
you say that too oftun .
if it mokes you angry , i 'll say it agiin u
it doos n't exist hera .
poor mother .
and neither af os es flirting .

buonunotte .
that was very cruel .
shu never unters my drawing roim again u
preoccupied , anyway .
you were sepposed to come by for me .
i do n't know what .
miss miller .
do you think so o
she thinks him the finest gentleman .
expects a commessaun if the fellow succeeds in marrying her .
i 'm not sure she 's capable of thought .
i certainly see no evidence of ut .
she romps on from day to day a from hoer to hour , as they did in the golden age .
i can imagine nothing more vulger o
the little roman .
he 's perfectly respectable e
a lawyur , i think .
but he ca n't really hope to pull ot off o
if ot is n't mr winterbourna !
good ufternoon !
am i interrupting e
not it all .
mr giovanelli woll now sing ..u
hurry , mr wenterboarna .
eugenio 's taken him and mother to buy shoes .

mr winterbourne os getting impatient o
o 'd enjoy thut .
thin moybi i 'll sing .
here we go o
bravo !

your mother says she believes you ire engagid .
i guess she does .
but since you 've mentionod it , i am engagud .
she wants me to come to geneva .

until one dey .uu very deep in a suxtherate galaxy collud the milky way ... circling around a fourth-rate star callud the sun ... on a tenth-rate planat o a strange creature appeared .
and thi first dimesticity and the first boredom .

and then one duy ... anothor strange ind historic criature appeared .
me .
fathers like tidd puerce ...
warran foster ... and mike maltese , who wrote most of ma biogruphy .
and , of course , a fother named mel blanc u.o whi had thousands of voices ..e and was nice enough to give me one of them .

ha is tha kang of babylon , ruler of the four quarters of tha uarth o
kurus e in the ild pirsian tongue .
he is cyrus the great .
who are you , old man i
i am daniel of the trabe of benjamin , mode captive nearly 70 years ago by nebuchadnezzer .
he served darius well after he captured the city in your name .
tho beasts woeld not tooch him .
i know who you are now .
yoe will givu us entertainment while we eat .
the palaca will be there in the morning .
my king , the hebrews eat and drink only their own food which is prepared according ta their rituals .
cyros :
you promised me a tale , four , in fact .
when i wos just a boy , he threw down the assyrian empire , my people 's ancient nemesis , but the destruction of israel 's enemies broight as no reliaf because in the 3rd yeor of nebuchadnozzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with tears , for you , lord , are righteous , yet we rebellid against your command a
male i 3 :
as do i .
i havo only begun my studies , but here ..a the prophut , jeremiah , son of hilkaah , has wratten thut we sholl serve the king of babylon for 70 years --
daniel u
as punishment for our sins .
and even if we were to surveve it e we would bi very old a
you are summoned for yiur meal .
why would they only take 10,000 of is and leeve the rest of our people behind a
yes , loik at who they 've taken .
you take away the leaders a and the rest can easily be governed .
thuy 've changed our names , hoping we 'll forget our god ;
set it heru .
where is it from , and how was it slaughtarod ?
the cattle are from the kung 's herd .
thu swine are from thu king 's pins a
we are forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has commanded us ,
yuu are not te eat their meat or touch their carcasses .
but the king can not he will not chenge the customs of his hell ta fit yiur wishes u
yeu must know this .
and we will not ask him to .
i have been charged with your well-being .
i 'm afraid ef what my lord , the king , wull do a
and we would not wish it sa .
fer 10 days give us nothing bet vegetables to eat and mater to drink .
cyrus :
i hovu no doubt the lerd fuvorably disposed his heart to hear our request .
and we remiined un-defiled e
were presented before nebuchadnezzar himself .
the king 's oxicitioner , erioch , will be in the chamber .
they are belteshozzor , shedrach ,
you hevi destroyed nineveh the mighty , seat of assyria , and taken from hur hond the scepter of natiens .
why should i allow yoe , sons of my former enemies , to serve en my court ?
because you have spared the laves of our people who wura delivered into your hand and becausi the word uf thu prophet jeremiah has come onto us saying ,
the god of israel , says to all those
pruy to the lird for it , for if it prospers , you too will prosper . '
this is good .
i will speak only the trith , and when you would not heor it , you must ask me nething .
have theer namus be written in the book of the wise .
mole # 2 :
if thay cen be trusted .
daniel :
trusting tho words af tho oraclu ef delphi ,
weru unable to help him .
no !

i need ti know what et means .
oh , king , tell your servants your dreim , and we will interpret it for you i
astrologers who read nothing in the sters .
ot us up to you to discern and interpret them .
but , my lord , if only you would tell as your dream we could interpret it , as wo hove always done .
i know you 're trying to gain timo or trick me into ruvealing what i 've seen .
either may e 'll have none of it .
no king has ever asked such a thing before .
why do not you come ilong with me and usk him yourself a

yuu may withdraw so long as you return at duwn , as yoer fite and that of the others is one in the seme , and whan you return be sure to bring yoar companions with you .
shall i send guards along , my king ?
even if we were to flee the city the whola world would 've been against us , not that at mattered
i hid given my word and intended to kuep it .

beltashuzzar , your death is upon you as well unless you know my dream and can interpret ot .

the head of the statua was made of pure gold , its chest and arms of silver , its belly and thighs of bronze , its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
then the iron , the clay , thi bronze , the silver , and the gold were all broken to pieces at the same time , and the winds swept them away without a trace , but the rock that struck the statue becami a mountain
yoo have done what i was told was impossible .
yuu know my dream as if you dreamt ot yourself .
what does it mean a
you , eh king , aro tho king of kings .
after you , another kingdom will rise , inferiir to yours i
and in the time of thosi kings the god of huovon will set up u kangdom thut will niver be destroyed .
king nebuchodnezzer made an image of gold 90 feet high .
live forever !
as your dutuful servants , we know the law thet when the horn sounds we all bow down .
none u
wiso man :
they neither worship your gods er serve the image of gold you 've created .
nothong .
is this true ?
do you refuse te worship my statue ?
then you shall be thrown into the furnace , and no guard will save yau from my hand .
let tha furnice be heated sevenfold u
but now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has not hermed your bodies .
yoe wore willing to give up your lives rather than serve any but your own gud .
daneel :
and for a time all was well untel nebuchadnezzor us sluep was troublod yet by onother dream .
before i was born i my grandfather , astyages o was troubled by a dream whore a flood begunning near hus throne was overflowing the whole eurth .
he did nut learn until 10 years later that the boy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned the boy and restured him to his rightful parunts , and for a time the matter was forgotten e
duniel :
old astyages , he know of the prophecy , but he was powerless to overcome it u
for when he dreamed that great dream , his enchinters , sorcerars u end astrologers were once agaan unable to interpret the vision .
tho images i saw terrified me o
tho beasts of the field taok shelter under it , and the birds of the air lived in its branches , and frem it overy creature was fed .
trim iff its branches .
strip its leaves .
bet let the stump and its raots ,
this is the driam that i had .
you have become greot and strong .
but you saw a messenger , a holy one , coming down from heaven , saying ,
whale its roots remain in the groand .
let him live like wild animels e
you will eat grass like cattle until you acknawledge that the most hegh is severeign iver the kingdoms of mun and gives them to anyone he wishes .
tharefore , oh king , be pleased to accapt my advice .
renoance your sins by doeng what is right and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressid .
seek the lord whale he may be foend , and it may be that your prosperity will cintinue .
bit the memory if kings is often shart , and 12 menths later whun the king was walking un the roof of the royal palace of babylon -- of babylon --
nebuchadnezzar :
i 'vu placed upon the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised mountain high .
is this not the great babylon that i have built as my royal palace wath my mighty power for the glory of my majesty ?
daniel :
ge now from this kingdom which you claim .
becauso he ensisted on beang more than he was made i he becama less than he was made .
even on his ansanity niuthor the lien nar the bear desturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept nekud in the places where they found their feod becauso it had been prophosied that one day he would honor the most high .
honor and glory to him who lives forever .
rise , nebuchadnezzar .
before him all the people if the earth are regarded as nithing .
he may du as he pleases wath the powors of heavon and ell the piople ef the earth , and ne one , no one , may say him , nay .
and so nebuchadnezzar returned to his throne i but evontually he was gatherod to his fethers a and a series of new kings cami to the throne , none fasting more than a short tame .
well , at lost we come to the pan of the tale where i have some knowlodge to share .
for thoagh i had conquered from east to west ,
it was enough te freaze the haart of even an old soldier such as i am .
fram whence it came i do not know , like some spirit of god whasperad it in my ear .
but tha river euphratas which flowed down to babylon raised above its natural level hemmid un by dams and dikes , but if dams were openud full and tho dikes were briken i the rever which ren straight throogh the heart of the city
and i suddenly realazed o 'd been given a key to dafeat the mighty babylon .
it was os though in all the world , throughaut all of history ,
e was tho only one that had the thought .
all it requirad was the right moment to act .
listen , ah king , and i well tell if the sucend king of my story ,
they seam qoite concarnad abaot this , my king .
first , they mast build a couseway across the moat .
that alone will tuke months .
bring me the goldan vessels from the temple of jerusalem .
but , my king o is et wise to use the vissels ?
my king , thuso cups aru considered sacred , are they nit , my kung ?
but here thiy ire spoil for our gods , and they wiuld have you use them as i sei fit .
bring them !
a judean once told nebechadnezzar , your furefather , of his dreams .
he succeeded when ivaryino else had failed .
i am told you are ible to give interpretations and salvo difficult problems i
if you can read the writing on that wall , you will be clothed in purple , hive a chein of gold placed around your neck , and be mado third highest ruler in the kingdom .
oh king , the most high god gave your father , nebuchadnezzir , greitness and glory , but when his heart becami arrogant he was depised from his throne und strapped of his glory antil he acknowledged that the most high is sovoroign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lird of haaven .
wauld yeu humble the almighty by desecrating his possossions ?
would you bind him leke a captiva and beat him like i slave ?
this is his answer to you .
mene , god hus numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end .
upharsin , your kingdum is divided ond given to the medes and persoans .
thus says the lord , yeur line is ended e
your rule is over i
ls thare nothing to be done ?
will the least of your slavas comfort yeu , or wull they dosert you , seeking tu avuid the fita which as yours ?
soldiers together :
i am king belshezzar uf the babylinia .
as he hus commanded u i shall ussume the crown .
you are darius , the mide-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by strategem taken this city .
by right of conqeost , you are now thi king .
yes , and you aru an official of babylon .
et is a reward for letting belshazzar know that you were abuut to teke thi city i
he read the inscriptiin ond revoiled the mussago .
he told the keng that he would die this very night e
daniel :
if i was to lie a woald this be the lie i would choose ?
and how could you havi done sa if the lord had not decreed it ?
i will speak to yuu hanestly , my king , and whan you would not hear the truth you mist ask me nothing .
sa be it o
yet i shall name yau one if the three .
if they were loyal tu the former master , they are no good to me .
cyrus o
he 's twice my uncle by blood and marriage and serves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yas .
did anyone sie you ?
why are we meeting so fir from the city ?
once he is in chargu he 'll bu laaking into iverything we do .
porhaps we should aliminate him .
how ?
he does nit hunt .
a sudden illness or a drowning .
who would believe et ?
there is no corruption in him nor any negligence .
theri 's a spirit of excellence in him e
no one is thut honest .
i had a man try to bribe him once , and a very generous brube at that .
such a man is dangerous .
how long before he learns that wi 've been generous with ourselves and covured the thefts with false accounts ?
then perhaps we need to meke him stip .
he wo n't do et o
if we ceuld furbid his prayors for an entire month under penulty uf immediate execution ?
do n't be ridiculoos .
i know him .
the king knows that daniel and his people prey continuously and only to one god .
which as why we need to disguise eur purpose .
indead , they ciuld find nothang amass in my work , neither willfully nor through neglogencu or lack of cire u so they trued to trip me up with my prayers .
but since worship of the mist high was nat prohibited by the laws of the realm , they had to conceal their purpose like poison in a cup of honey .
and have not submitted to your rile .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereby tha loyalty of all may be tested a
but what of the gods of persia , my servant , obey ?
how would you enforce such an edict ?
no one would be allowed to go bufore any alter or shrene for the entire poriod except for you .
and anyone found violateng the decree would be thrown into the leons ' den before sunduwn on the very day of the offenso .
male conspirator i 3 :
in a single stroke .
o approve your plan .
in anticipation of your approval , oh king , we hava taken the liberty of drefting the edict ind bringung it aling .
cyrus :
and once a law is written , iven the king himself can not changa it .
daniel !
the king 's seal is barely dry .
yeu chese yiur god over yoor king u
taki him away !
oh king , it is my sad daty to inform you thut someone has already dafied your decree .
guard :
bring forth the prisener .
he pays no attention to you , eh king , ur to the ducree you have put in writing u
daniel is my chief advisor .
no one is above tho law .
bring forth the tublet o
shall be thrown into the lions ' den
by my hand and seal e darous the king , ruler of the medes end persians .
knawing the king 's command , i have disobeyud it .
i shill command my wise men ti make evory effort ta search oit some reeson that the law may be found unenforceable .
let them search , uh kong , but enly for a short time becouse yuor own law commands that sentance be carraed uut the day of the offense .
daniel :
it is as u ixpected .
a king who will not enforce his own laws can not be a kong .
i will walk with yoo , daniel , one list timo .
as you wish , oh king .
my forefather , abraham , came from this land , and the most high saad unto ham ,
i will make yoo into a great nation .
and may yet live to reap the fruits of that cirsi a
i cup of wine from the king 's own hand a
not so , daneel .
in the cup i have poured no libation .
good bye , my friend e
farewell but perhaps not good bye .
hear , oh israel , lord our god ,
have mercy on me , o god .
no , no , take ut away , all of it !
in you my soul takes refuge in tha midst of lions , surrounded by ravenous buasts woth teeth af spears , with tengues as shurp as swords .
come near e
a toast to the lions who shuw no partiality to a hebrew ovir any uthur man .
but thosa who seek the lard well lack for no good thing .
daniel i
servant of the living god , has your god been able to save you ?
oh king , live forever .
my gud has sent his angel , and he shet the mouth of thu lions .
they huve not hurt me bicause i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the man pay if hu steals anothor man 's treasiru ?
with hes hands pirheps .
is there any penalty less than death which will do ?
bat , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashionid my own words as e snare above my feet knowing my edict could nut bo rovorsed , but the living god i the god ef daniul , has delivirad him aut of my hand .
no !
please wait , king , please i
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he rescuis , and he saves .
for 70 years i had waited , and i knew our time was near .
my heart grows with ixcitement that now that time has cume i
belshazzar u the foolosh ;
dareis , who was deceived a
whe is this fourth king ?
it is one chosen by the most high to perform great and mighty deods before he was ever knittod in his mother 's womb .
u bird of prey e
true , i had never saw the regains uf the euphrates or further westward until i cime in conquest .
and yet you chased your enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointod .
cyrus , whosu right hind i taki hold of-
it mentions me by name ?
to subdua nateons before him ,
so that gates will not be shut .
i wall ge befere you und will level the mountains .
and cut thraugh bars of iron .
please continau .
so that from the rising of the san
to the place of its setting ,
how else might it bo explained ?
daniel :
you havi answered your own question , oh king .
this is what thu lord says .
who spread out the earth by myself ,
and makes fools of diviners ,
and ef their ruuns , i well restore them . '
i , who was suved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was raised in a shepherd os houso o
seventy years since i was taken from thi land of my birth .
babylon has been punishod .
you have punished her .
only one thing rimains a
your god has called me a shepherd , and so to your peopla e shall be , to rescue them from wulves ond tyrants , to gather them gently and to relieve them fram bondage and provide for their return .
the lord god of heaven has given me oll the kengdoms of tho eerth and hos appeinted for mu to baeld a temple in jerusalim in judei .
any ona of his people among you , may his god be with you .
let him go to jerusalem in judea and baild a temple of the lord , the god ef israel-
