i ca n't afford a mortgage .
you 're the only person i know who can turn a simple book report ... into a lifelon commitment .
i 've never been responsible fo anything before .
this ould be the worst thing that 's ever happened to her !
i think i know how to become her hero .
while she 's away taking care of her grandmother ...
i could complete the book report for the two of us .

here he comes !
a perfect score ?

you have what is referred to as an irrational fear .
huh ?
peppermint patty :

nice use of angles there , charles .
both :

and this is where it all began .
as a youth , he passed many hours just sitting n that chair ... keeping his deep thoughs to himself .

the fame that cmes with intellectual superiority can be very fleeting .
you have to cash in while you can .
this is all for you , charlie brown .
you 've really made it .

lucy :
charlie brown .
this is not easy for me !
my whole world has turned upside-down !
it is my pleasure to prsent to you today ... this award for the highest achievement in this year 's standardized testing .
on this day , whereas you have upheld
the highest of academic standards .
and whereas no one would have ever expected that of you .
and whereas you are the irst to ever receive a perfect score .
therefore , be it resolved
how about that , charlie brown ?
you 're the star of the school now !
congratulations , charles .
let me present you with your perfect test .
charlie brown :
oh , no .
befre i begin ,
i ' like to thank all of you for your spport .
you ave all ben so kind .
it 's not often that i get this sort of recognition .
but , um ... there 's been a mistake .
this is not my test .
ha !
can a brother and sister get a divorce ?
i think this belongs to eppermint patty .
that was a very admirable thing you just did , charlie brown .
i 'm not s sure .
let me see wht you wrote 
hmm .
hi .
charlie brown took it upon himself to omplete th report for the both of you .
and i must say , this is one of the finest bits ... of literary analysis i have ever ead .
no , no , no !
lucy :
whenever i eel really alone ,
i just sit and stare into the night sky .
i 've always thought that one of those strs was my star ... and at momets lke this ,
i know that my star will always be there for me .
lucy :
the flying ace had to return to the aerodrome ... if he was ever to rescue fifi .

timing is crucial if we 're going to succeed .
yeah , chuck , your crazy dog is over here again .
aww !
excuse me , mister .
well , actually , let me just say that ...
that 's great !
well , okay .
the thing is , flying a kite is n't for everyone .
it takes a certain type of person .
they tend to hve a mind of their own .
really ?
you old the string .
plant your feet .
weight orward .
back straight .
when i say go , run as fast as you can .
tat way .
now , go !
i hope the littl guy dos n't get disouraged , snoopy .
he does n't quite know how difficult this will be .
it may take him years to gain my level of experience .
huh ?
little kid :
woo-hoo !
wow 
thanks , mister .
you sure know your kites .
do you want to try ?
charlie brown :
a-ha !

reverend .

professor ashton from rutland university .

miss carlisle invited me .
yes , yes , i remember .
oh , it was so sweet of you to go to all this trouble .

i 've alerted his housekeeper .
# the ring is in your right-side pocket #
professor !
professor brainard !

oh , not again .
# bum bum-bum-bum #
i 'm trying to solve the secrets of the universe .
and failing .
do you know what time it is ?
you 've been working all afternoon .
i 've been working on something very important .
more important , i suppose , than getting married ?
oh !
oh , you 're getting a wonderful girl .
if you ask me , she 's too good for you .
i love you , too 
is anything wrong ?
and , professor , may i say happy honeymoon ?
you certanly may , mrs. chatsworth .
miscalculation has been staring me in the face for weeks .

ross your fingers .

very good .
yes .
yes .
now we 're cooking , charlie !

i hope you can get your money back .
i 'll be at the office at the usual time in the morning .
shelby , i do n't sem to have an escort .
i m yours to command .
oh , hello , charlie .
what happened ?
what happened ?
get away , charlie .
i 'm not sure wha we 've got here , charlie , but if we 've got what i think we 've got , we 've got something .
there 's one way to find out .
ready ?
yes !
yes , charlie !
we 've got it !
it 's not going lower and lower .
you know wat that means ?
it 's generatin its own energy .
it means we 've discovered a new kind of energy !
discovered .
substance x .
in apparance , subscribes to classical requirements of metastable compound , but whose behavior is distinctly nonclassica .
hypothesis .
of course you do n't .
we just discovered it .
we 've got to give it a name .
flying rubber .
flubber ?
all right .
now a sliding shutter to le the right amount of gamma rays through to bombard the flubber .
here we go .
perfect control .
now we ease off on the gamm rays .
light s a daisy .
just as i thought .
just as i thought , charlie .
weght makes absolutely no difference .
just shoot up a few extra gamma ray .
is n't that wonderful , charlie ?
i can still make it .
yes , 5 minutes to 8:00 .
in the morning ?
no .
no , i did n't do it again .
i know what you 're thinking .
but do n't you worry .
when i tell betsy what i 've done , she 's gon na be happy .
mrs. chatsworth .
do n't you tell a soul , but i 've discovered flubber .
that poor , poor girl .
daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbed by rumors that you plan to take our campus and construct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely he ould n't .
not even mr. haw .
but he 's an alumnus .
my dear girl , our esteemed alumnus made an extremly large loan to te college .
that loan is overdue , and mr. hawk has us , if you 'll forgive a pertinent expression , over a barrel .
i 'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would be convenient to you .
i shall make myself available .
psst !
hwever , mr. hawk ...
do n't be angry .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding again .
look , i could n't help it .
go .
i hit my head .
i was knocked out .
daggett :
go .
get out .
look , the most wonderful thing happened .
wait till you hear .
look .
flubber .
i shall make myself avilable at any time .
... of the greatest importance .
no , make that of the most supreme imprtance .
brainar :
flubber .
flubber .
flubber .
h .
good morning , sir .
i have the most wonderful thing to tell you .
the most wondeful thing you can tell me is goodbye .
this way .
just a minute .
anything you say would be superfluous .
daggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasant surprise .
i , too , have been wanting to chat about our loan .
brainard !
yeah , that 's right , pop .
do you know that this man flunked my oy ?
may i remind you it was hawk brains that founded this town ?
i wish i could show you his examination paper .
not nly did he miss every answer , he misspelled the name of the college .
do you mind ?
this means my boy ca n't play in the big game tonight aainst rutlan .
flunking yur star player .
a makeup exam .
but he could n't be bothered .
so he 's ineligible .
none of your vague promises abot lending money is going to change that .
mr. hawk has already loaned the money .
professor , i rejoice in your sense of ethics .
but do you mind terribly if i speak for myself ?
mr. hawk .
hold it .
i 'd like to discuss our loan .
and you might brig some of those principles of yours and see how much they 're worth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
get me the file on wealthy alumni marked emergency .
we have some letters to write .
yes , sir .
the you 'll understad why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd like that .
for once i would really like to understand .
like most things that seem complicated , it was ctually quite simple .
do you know what that residue was ?
no .
well , it 's been thrilling .
betsy , never in my wldest dream did i hope to find a compound whos configuration is such that the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a change in the configuration .
but they act in a direction opposite that of the force which triggered the change .
yes 
now that  clearly understand what happened to my wedding , will you excuse me ?
president daggett and i have some important work .
it could be worth millions .
do me a personal favo .
go bounce your ball somwher else 
we 'll talk it out tonight .
i 'll pick you up for the gae .
you 're kidding , are n't you ?
about closing the collge and turning the grounds into a housing tract ?
they 're all in the same boat .
the little man is gon na get squashed .
but you graduated from medfield .
it 's your college .
so what do ou want ?
some total stranger to close it dwn ?
is n' there omething you could do ?
give them some more time on the loan or something .
i 'm sentimental about medfiel just like yo .
has word gotten arund that you 're not playng ?
say , lenny , see what the point spread is on the medfield-rutland game tonight .
how much you want to go for ?
8,000 or 10,000 bucks .

brainard !
tell them who i am !
now , you told us who you are .
suppos we all go confide in the sergeant , hmm ?
you boys are a big comfort .

10 new buildings 10 stories high .
one building devoted entirely to science .

from a certain revolutionary discovery .
what 's revolutionary about a tin lizzie ?

unless , of course , it happens to fly .

i see .
how do you figure thi can help the farmer ?
i do n't want to help the farmer .

it 's national defense .
oh , national defense .
national defense 
before we go further , i just want you to know that i am proud of the new spirit of cooperation between the ary , the navy , and the air force .

brainad swings a lot of lead .

i want you to understand .
i 'm using it as a security measure .
what better plac to hide my discovery than in a model t ?
i want yo to keep in mind that this is only a primitive application of my discovery .
we use this spark lever here to levitate , the gas lever to move forward , and the brake to stop or to go in reverse .
absolute cntrol at all times , as you will see .
all right , get a good , tight grip on your emotions an prepare for takeoff .
cool head .

the prsident , devoted to the advance of science , has embraced the discovery of flubber with enthusiasm .

butin an erawhere almost nothing can be kept private , does the resident of the united states have secrts -- information so forbidden , so potentially dangerous that it must be kept hidden from the public ?
therearesome things that you do n't want to put in writing any more than you have to .
wekeeplots of secrets , we kep an amazing number of secrets .
butif thereare secrets , here would they be kept -- in a computer , a safe , a locked briefcase -- and who else , if anyone , could be trusted to share them ?

onjanuary20 , 2009 , chief justice of the
supreme court john roberts aministers the oath of office to president-elect barack obama .
roberts :
but when aske about the letter ,
did it contain critical information about the economy ?
or much , much more ?
if so , what would be in it ?
did he ave he from a secret book left behind by hi predecessor , or was the intelligence he received rom less audacious and more conventional sources ?
rather :
a ltof it is told oraly , and understandably and rightfully so .
there are some tings that you do n't want to put in writing any more than you have to .
theonesthatwere probably the most interesting , ones where they said , kay , well , let e just tell you some other things that we know .
narrator :
president-elect obama regarding ongoing covert activity by the
ibeganb saying , mr. president-elect , these have ll been personally authorized by the presidents .
but they are not authorized by the persn of the president .
they are authorized by the office of the president .
and , and then i , then i walked him through it .
it 's one thing to be the candidate .
it 's another thing to have your finger on the button , as they say .
only then will he or she have unlimited access to all classified documents , answer to almost any national security question they might have .
and could this be the real reson for the marked diffeences between the rhetoric of a presidentil candidate ...

narrator :
todaythepresident hs a uniue handle on the nuclear arsenal .
everywhere he goes he is accompnied by a military aide who carries a 45-pound briefcase known as the nuclear football .
what 's in it is highly classifid , but what it does is allows the president , as the commander in chief , to be connected to the nationa military command center and those force commanders who must respond to an order to initite
presdent did over the years .
one of them was dealing with a surprise attack by the soviet
missiles on the way .
our rtaliatory strategy was massiv retaliation during most of that time -- mutually assured destruction .
metzger :
constitution , the president of the united states is the person who would make that decision , and so thre was a notion that something tha the president had to have the capability to make that decision anywhere and everywhere and at all imes .
lichtman :
forgetabout togetherness btween the
president and is wife .
duringhis transition , the president-elect is briefed on how to use the codes .
then , during the inauguration , the miliary readies two cases -- one each for both the outgoing and incoming presidents .
this serves to both immediately transfer power and to deter any surprise attacks .
butwhileanew
president comes into office knowing he will receive the nuclear codes , is he , in fact , the only person who can authorize a nuclear attack ?
intheory , no nuclear weapon , in theory , could be launched without the
fortunately , since
but what if the unthinkable does happen and the military is caught off guard ?

withthe government of the united states apparently under siege , staff at the white house also responed to the news .
iwashaving breakfast with a colleague in the white house mess , in the basement of the west wing lobby .
but while the staff were ordered to evacuate ,
scret service gents quickly escorted vice president dick
bohn :
narrator :
president 's home and office had been threatened ?
are there methods or avenues of escape from the white house itself ?
and not something that i can discuss , but ther are ways that the president can be moved from point a to point b very quickly , in an emergency situation .
nd then there 's also tunnels from the white house under the

their location and heir capabilities , i really ca n't talk about .
lichtman :
weknowthat not far from washington dc , there are major uderground acilities .
there 's one in virgina in th
shenandoah mountains know as the mount weather facility which apparently is an entire underround city .
and i would guess there are probably hundreds f these secure locatios around the country to which the president coud be brought .
narrator :
united states , and , if so , are they all kept ready to secure the president 's safety at a moment 's note ?
you need to be isolated from the threat .
once you 've isolated the person , the very next thing you need is purified , clean air .

he needed to kind of recreate the cold war with a new enemy , and that new enemy would be l-qaeda .

intelligence operatives .
president bsh 's political rivals have eagerly exposd it ?
i alwaysgo by the

thisis an enomously energetic , complex system , and different agencies hae different habits and different atterns .
but s a species , we 've had conspiracy theories from the very begnning .
oneof themost enduring conspiracy theries that surround the office of the
president first took root in 1947 , when the u.s. military reported that an alien spaceship had crash-landed outside
roswell , new mexico .
i mean , you driv on a long , long dirt road , and here are ground sensors in that road , so that base ecurity know that you 're coming .
eventually you arrive at just really at a series of signs -- there 's not really even a clearly-defined border -- and that 's the point that you do n't want to go beyond .
there are contractors that show up in pickup trucks , and they kind of watch you and surveil you .

and , if so , would n' the u.s .
president know about it ?
o'brien :
president , but i ca n't help ut think that some of them , upon assming the office , ask their predecessor , all right , come on , what 's the deal with alien technology ?
i mean , there are people out there , uh , that rally believe that there are these aliens .
and we literally spent some time looking at this , but there was nothing conclusive that came of it .
lichtman :
intruth , though , he reason why there 's so much secrecy bout area 51 is , that is where the air force develops its most ecret and sensitive panes , including its high-flying surveillance plane and the stealth fihters .
but , hey , there are plenty of people who believe that 's an elaborate cover-up for a storehouse of an lien ship , alien bodies , and maybe even live aliens .

fly to brazil again , or no job .
make up your mind .
if i take pictures of hlios 7 , i 'll sell them to another publisher .
to take pictures of you ?
no deal .
i 'm not about taking pictures of women .
no .
island ?
yes .
selgio island .
it 's located between hawaii and the marianas .
only eihty inhabitants .
it 's like it has fallen behind the time .
an island in th sun , surrounded by coral reefs that 's selgio .
we 've invested a lot of money in it .
once this plan has materialized , th world will be stunnd .
you want me to take publicity pictures ?
that 's right .
a single picture can impress people .
i refuse .
but ...
pease .
it 's been a long time .
yeah 
we worked together on the series , mysteries of japan .
i see .
remember ?
monsters ?
yes .
i thouht you 'd be happy to go there .
well , i do n't believe monsters exist unless i see one , but they might ...
doctor , is it here on this map ?
yes , selgio island is thee .
you 're right .
the spot you marked .
no , this is n't the mark for selgio island .
what ?
selgio island
fshing is prhibited in that area .
that 's why it 's good .
the natives here would n't like us to violate it .
who would believe that ?
but they 're serious about it .
every accident that happens at sea , they think the monster did it .
that means more fish for us .
th folks coming from tokyo ...
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's just a current of cold water .
really ?
look !
yokoyama !
sakura !
obo !
you were right !
yokoyama , true ?
yes , rico .
gezora is angy .
so , you really believe the monsters exist 
yes , i 'd like to be friends with them .
you could be a good writer .
and it lands in the backyard of prehistoic monsters .
enjoying yourselves ?
sure .
from yokoyama , too ?
yes .
i have n't had a chance to talk to you .
makoto obata , anthropologist
let 's be friends .
this is where you are .
there was an accidnt on the island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
hs partner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it 's interesting .
it 's a beautiful island .
it 's beautiful because nature is intact here .
i know .
do n't make fun of gezora .
do the natives here seak japanese ?
i see .
fortunately the 're fond of japanese .
mr. yokoyama is supposed to meet us here .
rico , why are n't your pople around ?
i ll find mr. yokoyama .
ico .
all right .
lt 's take a rest .
he 'll be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the natives would give me lodging .
the shedule for research of selgi islad
i think it 'll be difficult to research the entire island in a week .
right , we have to take pictures of undersea life , too .
over here !
the though makes me shudder .
do n't give me that .
your firm sent us here .
no !
it reads our harts by telepathy .
you saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
i 'll drive .
that was some scream .
i thought it was a monster .
the sea water .
look .
huh ?
what 's that ?
the light ?
this is terrible .
this is a japanese watch .
it 's sakura 's .
sakura 's watch .
hey !
mr. yokoyama , how about other people ?
i 'm leaving this island !
mr. yokoyama !
eave me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you will di .
shut up !
i 'll go back to japan and warn the people do n't go to selgio island .
it 's hell on earth.
no , no !
shut up !
gezora !
fnally we can eat .
where are they 
gon .
mr. yokoyama !
look .
rico .
he ' alive .
come on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remember .
rico !
wait , he is scared of he light .
would you stop making jokes ?
it 's no a joke .
it 's not a scrach or a bruise .
no , it looks like frostbite .
frostbite ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body temperature must be near zero .
you 're all suffering from monsterphobia like that man .
that 's right , where is mr. yokoyama ?
plans for the selgio island undrwater hotel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
you forgot me ?
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if we cn bring back his memory , we may be able to fin out what happened .
let 's go .
our bags ?
right .
the islan 's shaman , i think .
die , friends f the devil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a first-aid kit .
is h conscious ?
rico , rico .
there 's one good thing .
we 're lucky to be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream of it .
no , i wo n't be able to sleep .
octo , but what if the monster really lives in he sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come on .
i think this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main chracter ?
let 's get this straight .
what did you come here for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important .
we shouldn t have hard feelings .
do n't worry .
you 're as mean as ever .
aki .
rico .
come !
i ca n't believe i 'm alive .
the monster is a squid .
the legendary gezora is bac to life .
does t hate rubber ?
i do n't know .
my knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the shaman .
wy are you so skeptial ?
the people here are serious .
not e .
ombo .
ombo .
everybody is going to die !
doctr !
you 're all right .
doctor , it 's just a monster squid .
it has the characteristics of a squid .
but ...
can you call that a squid ?
when the fire burnt it , the monster was upset .
any gasoline on this island ?
the company brought some , ut it 's gone with that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil ad gasoline .
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guns !
good .
good !
pour out the gasoline !
ight .
ge back !
fire !
great !
gezora is burning !
here .
this will protect us .
i never imagined .
plenty of gasoline .
we 're safe even if it comes back .
i 'm encouragd .
if it was only a simple giant squid we 'd be safe .
what does he mean ?
doctor !
doctor , if it wa n't a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible creature .
tell me the truth .
you know what the monster rely is , do n't you ?
i 'm sorry .
terrfic !
i 'll show you .
wtch out !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondered where he went .
he ants to escape .
it 's angerous .
come back !
he monster ca n't get me !
we shuld evacuate .
go farther .
hurry .
hurry !
we are almost there .
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca n't be sure that we destroyed it completely .
why is it so quet ?
makoto obata .
you are no longer an ordinary human being .
no use resisting .
abandon human emotions .
i will give you an important job .
you must find our formidable enemies all ove the earth and annihilate them all .
stand up , obata .
there s one here too .
yes ?
i 'll tell you what i think .
and the giant squid we fought yesterday is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size had changed .
all the principles of genetics and biology ca n't explain it .
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab is n't ganie .
the space creatures that came with hlios 7 made the crab into a monster .
as a weapon to attack us .
you mean the space creatures got into helios 7 in outer space some hundred-millions kilometer away from earth ?
if this creature is highly developed , it may be able to live in a vacuum .
... and it may be able to alter its own cells and pass through the atoms of metal 
i see .
space creature or not we must destroy it .
we must hink of some way to fiht .
i will marry rico .
we will hae a wedding tonight .
wedding 
congratulations .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
aki .
you recognize me ?
rico .
good !
you had amnesia fo a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
yes , monster !
but bats came and gezr ran away .
bats ?
yes , bats came .
gezora ran away .
why ?
there ere porpoises when we were in the sea ...
i got it !
what is it ?
the space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes , humans can hear sound waves up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porpoises emit 120,000 cycles ultrasound with which they use to guide themselves .
yes 
i guess space creatures hate it .
if we have bats , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bats live in caves .
yes , but they 'll come back to the cave in the orning .
there .
the bats !
there .
did the monster do this ?
i do n't know how , but noboy else could do it .
i thought we were safe , but ...
even though they are space creatures , they ca n't kill all the bats on the isand .
here too .
all right .
maybe all the bats are dead .
that ca 't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 're safe now .
we can control some bats .
mr. obata !
of course .
the monster ca n't beat me .
what 's this ?
the monster is sared of bats .
great 
then let me sleep here too .
what are you doing , obata ?
it 's about time for the bats to move .
he went ot .
wait !
doctor ...
you .
he 's not obata .
why did you come to earth ?
we are the wanderers of space .
we can exist only by living off other forms of life .
what are you going to do with us ?
you know our weakness .
rico !
now we know enough about earth creatures .
before they arrive  i must annihilate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see mankind perish like this .
even though you 're a wretched spy , you 're still a human being .
a human being !
kamoeba !
go to the ountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go of it !
let go of it !
 wo n't ...
obata .
do n't come .
do n't come near me !
pray !
that 's all we can do .
even if a man 's cells are taken ovr , he has his soul .
man is more than a structure of cells .
every man has a soul .
his soul is fighting the space creature .
they 've gone md !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck !
i wish i had my camra .
what happened to the monsters 
even space creatues .
mr. obata !
mr. obata 
obata killed the last space creature by killing himself .
mr. obata .
thy must have seen the volcano erupt .
the united forces of earth creatures ...
porpoises , bats and men destroyed the invaders 
will the people believe this story ?
mmm !
hmm .
huh ?
huh ?
woo hoo !

oay .
o i should probably tell you about my cousin .
but , uh , you know , she 's got a family , she 's got a career .
she 's had a speech impediment her entire life 
and that 's okay , because that 's just not her thing ... just like my thing is
hav you seen me dance ?
i 's not ven called dancing ... it 's called tripping and falling and stumbling .
but that 's okay .
she says that each of us need a good friend to show us ... the best part of who we are .
everyone has their weaknesses ... but also we have a special talent inside ... that could make the world a better place if we shared it .
i got something for you .
kathy gave me this , bcause she saw smething in me ... that i did n't know was there .
i thought it was very courageous of you tonight ... to get on that stae in front of all those people .
camp princess-worthy .
there is one condition , though .
i want you to use that courage and try to find ... that one talent , that one special thing ... that will make the world a better place .
can you do that for me ?
yeah .
okay , c'mere .
let 's go .
c'mere .
i guess is what i 'm tinkin ' .
could be hat 's the way to handle it , sure .
i ever tell you abot my cousin dan ?
one summer , when we was about , oh , ten or so ... my uncle told him to go pick up a bag of horse feed ... down a the supply store down the road a ways 
now dan , he did n't weigh much more ...
well , did he make it ?
yeah , eventually .
lost a big chunk of the food , too , on account of the hole ...
he just kept saying , no , i ca do it .
i can do it .
ust , you know , i always wondered why he would n't ...
let anyone share the burden , so to speak .
save him a lot of extra trouble
i would think , do n't you ?
jerry ?
no ... wish i did .
but you know somebody who might be able to ?
but te thin is , we wo n't know unless we ask .
what 's up ?
so that vaultin thing you were telling me about ?
yeah !
but what changed your mind ?
the whole time i was just thinking ...
how aazing would it be to do that on a horse .
no .
uh-unh .
no way .
worst idea ever !
yes way , and best idea ever !
fine , but only if she listens to every single thing i say .
fine .
great !
you guys wan na shake hands ?
hanks !
gram i had a feeling you 'd thrive there ...
it makes me so happy to know you 're maing friends ... and  want to hear all about them .
it sounds like you 'll have a wonderfl experience ... to share with them for the rest of you life .
i ca n't wait to see you in th final show ... at the end f summer .

if they think i 'm going to throw away good money ...
on some charity case .
it 's not a charity case .
it 's not my fault if they do n't know how to run a business .
well , obviously they do n't .
i 'm starting to wonder why
i 'm spending all this money ...
to send you to a top-tie business school .

hank connors , las vegas police .
come out with your hands above your head .
come out slowly .
officer down !
you 're not aking me !
mres , automatic weapons , ammo , water
bomb sqd find any booby trap ?
any sign of chyna de vere ?
ot yet .
you know , there 's some food .
you just should n't see where it come from .
did you know that pigs are very intelligen animals ?
and certain politicians .
i do n't see connors ' truck anywhere .
let 's look in the barn .
if this is chyna de vere 's blood , we 're etting warmer .
looks like he had a hobby stuffed animals .
why 's that ?
cs season07 episode22 leapin ' lizards
this is a career first .
a little tip for you :
the new mrs.phillips does n't need to hear about his 
are you kidding me ?
come on , pretty girl , getta outta there , come on , girl !
i 'm so glad i 'm a vegetarian .
well , no one has seen or heard from the victim ' husband , so ...
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likes you .
they always do .
we went to connors ' ranch because a week ago , chyna de vere went missing .
she jus separated from her husband , got her own place .
this is a large section of her living room carpe .
well , it 's certainly enough blood to suggest foul play .
connors ' name did n't come up .
how about the husband 's ?
and he 's stll missing .
so what 's this ?
that s a single , distinct blood drop , not from the victim , not from the husband .
we also found soil trace , identified as scheelite , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim 's hsband .
looks like armageddon came o a thursday .
i 'm not sure there 's intelligent life on this planet .
i 'll get started .
i already went through this a week ago .
you know , you 're right .
yeah , not my boyfriend , my friend .
she was n't a member of your club ?
if she was , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , the club 's getting smaller nd smaller by the minute .
you 're already an accessory to one mrder .
if hank connors killed chyna 's hsband , too .
oh , is that what you think happened ?
you know , this can work in your favo with the d.a .
i 'm not really worried about that .
dam and eve were not only the first human on the earth , they were bait ...
for intelligent life forms elsewhere in te cosmos .
ut why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me .
well , ma'am , tis is standard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just going to swab the inside of ...
not !
calm down .
get him away from ...
cam down .
calm down .
no !
that bitch bit me .
i got my sample .
these isitors were highly advanced and did not appear in human form .
people of the serpents ...
of course it did .
it was not human .
not of this earth .
ufo 's , alien abduction ...
looks like shannon was  player .
reptiles ...
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
what is this ?
so connors cut off her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space ?
catherine ...
check this out .
what 's shanon doing with him ?
chillin ' in cao .
i 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , hello , xena .
oh , boy .
duct tape ?
yeah , he used it to close up the laceration from a sharp force perimortem wound .
could that be the fatal wound ?
give me the rest of the body and i can tell you .
almost three inches , smooth-edge blade ...
you know , cathrine found ...
why woud anybody want to taxidermy a huma head ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our guy had to separate the head from the body .
for that , he use a serratd-edge knife .
heartwarming .
yeah , so then ... he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle .
hen he tanned the skin to preerve it .
hydrated it with a borax and ater solution to keep the bugs off .
popped in two glass eyes , and then ... and he 's got the best-looking wall mount in the neighborhood .
yeah , i 'll get it over to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a guy on the fencing team .
his thighs wee incredible .
ys , the , uh , tip has been wiped clean .
gives us a height for a white female of 5 ' 6 .
how about fo  male ?
did you measure the head of the femur ?
41 points ...
point five millimeters .
it 's a female .
his little piggy had chyna .
yeah .
hey , greg .
no .
i 'm having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
good .
come hee , take a look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ..
yea .
you can see dick cheney , al gore , all nine supreme court justices shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 .s.presidents , most members of congress
hey , did shannon urner have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
cats are a natural enemy of reptiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found at shannon turner 's mad the tool marks on the skull .
shannon 's prints were all over the hande .
and the partials on the blade , above the hilt ...
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
yeah , but brass interviewed her last week .
she did n't have any visible cuts .
warrick ?
come at me with a sword .
all right , so i push back hard enough ... bang you on the nose .
brass would n't have seen that .
but what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank connors really believed in a reptilian conspiracy and they felt threatened by the political establishment ,
hy , nick !
i got something ovr here .
yeah .
tll death do us part .
whenever a player uses a club card at a table game , the floor man writes down what game you played , where yo sat , what time you started , time you quit .
this is the first time shannon used he card .
and the dealer is chyn .
looks like thy 're best friends .
two week ago .
maybe chyna was her lucky charm .
she never walked away a winner .
i think she was gaining her trust 
stalking her .
it 's nt a crime t play blackjack .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
we found your blood in chyna 's apartment .
then it was planted .
how should i know ?
look ... you kille chyna ,
and connr kille preston , because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you lied about knowing chyna , you going to li about this , too ?
his cells do n't de .
oh , 4,000 .
th new 50 .
preston is a great man .
he has the wisdom of the ages .
beyond your capacity to understand .
ms.turner ... was chyna a reptilian ?
the reptilian athena .
is that chyna de vere ?
tell me about this one .
is that you ?
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill you .
what ?
her husband .
she does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your ring .
i really , realy hate you .
that would explain why we found both rings in t ashes .
i found it emedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , and then the dome of the liver .
that 's yur c.o.d .
yeah , pelvis is female .
the feur 's the same length as the one the pigs were chomping on .
it 's her .
well , we 'll run this agaist connors ' guns .
then you better turn it off before they use the oxygen destroyer on him .
i do n't know why  find it so difficult to express my feelings to you .
i can see you as vividly as if you were here with me .
as sakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnet 47 , thyself way art presnt still with me ;
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move , and i am still wth them , and they with thee .
or , if the sleep , thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart s and eye 's delight .
you 're supposed to let me get these things on .
i do n't know .
you mean , like me and you , baby ?
jim .
i got a call from a passing motorist .
preston de vere ?
vey gla to be back home .
i was a captive , held against my ill .
from what the sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate our skepticism .
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
oh , so you were abducted before your wfe was missing .
what are you trying to tell me ?
you do n't know your wife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no idea .
cme on .
preston .
if she was so sweet , what ere you doing chillin ' in cabo with shannon turner ?
well , you got your pictures on the coffee ug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth of where you ere the night your wife was killed .
that 's easy .
here 's a woman , and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are victims ... and no one is listening to us .
we re powerles aginst what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has anyone talked to shannon in the last couple of days ?
they 've got her .
i 's lke we 're witnessing some form of mass hallucination .
you know , they think the cops are part of this reptilian consiracy as well .
that 's why shannon attacked greg .
let 's try this again .
sorry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contact with them .
please , we come in peace .
it 's all right 
got a warrant to tow in clarissa nies ' car .
blue fluorescence is one o the properties of scheeite .
which was found in the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same rea .
have you looked inside yet ?
i was just about to .
preston was found naked , right ?
yeah , it 's a recurrent theme in tales of alien abduction .
so clarissa dove him out there and he left his stuff in her car .
that 's not all he left :
steam cleaner .
just what ever estranged husband needs to clean up his dead wife 's bood .
this case just came down to earth .
yes ,
we were asleep and suddenly the room turned very cold .
freezing .
i ...
come on , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i mean , really .
you got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man .
he 's a brilliant man .
he saved my lie .
it was cancer and he cured it .
he knows how to preven human cells from dying .
they 're , hey 're radioactive .
it would put them out of business .
let me show you something .
look at this .
he s 42 .
he claims he 's a nutritioist .
he 's not .
and look .
they never heard of him .
he has no place of business , no job .
he got shannon turner to kill his wife for him .
gt you to give im money .
he nver asked for it .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleeping so they can manipulate your thoughts .
ou 're not only cancer-free , ou 're free f their control .
how am i ever going to be able to thank you ?
the evidence is all over your car .
he lovd me .
if they were trying to clan up all the blood , they did  good job .
steam cleaner tested positive for blood , but there was n't enough for dna .
did you find anything ?
funny you should ask .
found a hair in the brushes .
it 's on the left .
the one on the right is chyna de vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleaner was completely wiped down , could n't find any prints .
but then i remembered this story about a csi down in l.a .
nobody culd find any prints on a gas can from an arson , but he realized that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas .
and you know what ?
he broke the case .
so whose prints are on the steam cleaner ?
i just got an afis hit :
preston de vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector of mankind .
cut off her head , she dies .
no problem .
it was n't a reptilian conspiracy , but it was a conspracy .
men are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a long time for her to die .
you know , every ime i think about leaving this job  a guy lik you comes along and reminds me why i ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
these are accounts of battles for the survival of the human race ,
a battle we will lose uness we stop killing one another and focus on the rea enemies .
they are among us .

if i let them stay , they 'd eat me out of house and home .
do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't !
i do n' know how to thank you and those kind people in the town fr thinking so much of me .

my pop and i have been shipwrecke so many times ... that there are only eight or nine islands we have n't been to in the whole world .
and the ship 's cat flew past me stark naked , and his fur landed on my fork .
what do you think you 're doing ?
the sugar feels sensational between your toes .
sorry .
i know he is .
he 'll be back soon .
we 'll wipe off your face .

i think i went a little too far .
your mother -- she is dead , is n't she ?

oh , wait , oh .

the county created the children 's home for kids who are lost or have no parents .
poor pippi .

the boxes are finished .
be careful how you mount them .
they got ta be fixed real firm .

i was just hoping all that learning floating around in there ... miht fly out here and stick to me ...
he 's very bad with his numbers .
i 'd like to help you , but you make that impossible .
but now we must press on 
bye .
well , i guess we 'll just have to stay stupid .
ten everything is absolutely legal .
excuse me .
is all this really necessary ?
i mean , she 's just a child .
a child ?
i 've seen this child in action .
and i 've seen her up there .
why the police 
oh , she 's very strong .
she threw my men up in a tree .
then she lifted me like i was a baby .
that 's some baby , i 'll tell ya .
i think you 'll agree e have to be prepared for anything this girl may come up with .
now , nobody wants to be unfair or unkind to pippi .
pippi , they 're comin ' for you !

they ca n't take you , pippi .
mom and dad are tryig ruin everything for us .

narrator :
when fred astaire ang this song in the film ziegfeld follies the year was 1946 and mgm was at the height of its success in creating incredible fantasies and setting them to music .
here , lucille ball tames a pack of exotic cat-women .
it was imaginative , outlandish imagery , and audiences loved it .
the most popular entertainment in the world .
this is the mixture to start the picture
narrator :
metro-goldwyn-mayer was not the only studio that made musial motion pictures .
when i first arrived here mgm 's ream factory was in full swing .
but the success of the mgm musical did not happen overnight .
then they hit on the idea of filming popular vaudeville acts .
all :
whose pet ?
and i pet with nobody else
in the hollywood revue of 1929 one of the first all-talking , all-singing , all-dancing movies th studio gve its huge roster of stars a chance to get their fee wet in the newfangled talkies .
but at te time it was s new that some of the performers had trouble remembering the lyrics .
come on with the rain i 've a smile on my face
just singin ' just singn ' in the rain
singin ' in te rain
just singin ' in the rain
suddenly , the musical became an overnight sensation delighting audiences wth bigger casts lavish sets and costumes and even a new gimmick alled technicolor .
mgm began its most ambitious film of this kind in late 1930 and filmed all the big production numbers before the public lost interest in these plotless musicals and the project was abandoned .
what else ?
shake your stripes beat your pipe
lok your cell step light , hello , warden
clean as a whistle fresh as a daisy
brand-new clean thrugh
clean as a whistle fresh as a daisy
to capture a audience , producers knew they could alway turn t the old reliable sex .
this number , set in the shower room of a girls ' school shocked audiences in 1933 .
but , ge , i 'd rather exercise myself into
say , the water stopped .
water .
kelly :
such scenes fuelled the growing pulic outcry .
that the vulgar , the cheap and the tawdry is out .
there is no room on this screen at any time for pictures wich offend against common decency .
and these , the industry will not allow .
eddy :
ah , sweet mystery of life
at last i found thee
ah
kelly :
among mgm 's efforts for the new morality was a series of wildly successful operettas with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy .
both :
my heart has heard the answer to its calling
for it i love that rules
kelly :
in 1934 , the studio lited the public ut of the depression and into a make-believe holywoo party .
hollywood party get up , get up , get in it
hollywood party nobody slees tonight
satan sing out , yeah , man
hollywood party nobody sleeps tonight
and no , here 's to beauty , laughter , romance , music .
feelin ' high
what 's the use feelin ' low ?
on that agon on the town

thre 's a reason if you 'd like to know why
i 'm in love

kelly :
in broadway melody of 1938 and almost all of her films eleanor becomes a huge sensation by the last reel .

kelly :
and here 's a good example .
elenor powell 's tap dance of fascinating rhythm from lady be good .
stagehands using little tractors called mules quickly take the set apart allowing the camera to move forward to follow her dancing .
chorus :
fascinatin ' rhythm you 've got me on the go
fascinatin ' rhythm i 'm all aquiver
what a mess you 're making the neghbors will know
i 'm alays shaking like a flivver

as andy hardy , mickey rooey was always falling in love .
esther williams played his love intrest in her first film .
a fashion model and champion swimmer esther was working in an quacade hen she caught the attention o an mm talent scout .
in the 22 films she made at metro she was seldom out of the water .
williams :
it had been five years since my andy hardy movie .

i was called america 's mermaid because it appeared that i could stay underwatr indeinitly .
for 12 yeas , i was the center of an amazing series of vivid sights and ater pageantry .
allyson :
each man she met she went and kissed
for a girl today do n't get the scope that cleopatterer did
williams :
if one performer could exemplify the lighthearted spirit of the mgm musical then june allyson would surely be i .
allyson :
when she went like this and then like that
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the spot
she gave these poor egyptian ginks
tis was the original main gate at mgm .
it was all so glamorous .

like the boogie-woogie beat

allyson :
it was an extensive crash course designed to find those with that special something known as star quality .
an if you had it , you got to take the next big step :
for instance , kathryn grayson had to wait two years at mgm before she was given her first screen test represented here in anchors aweigh .
unhappy news away

this was mgm 's scenic backdrop building where taented artists created their movie magic , and this is ust one section of a huge paining re-creating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was originall 600 feet long and 60 feet high and wrapped around the entire interior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've always had such respect for gene .
both :
first , you put your two knees close up tight
then you sway 'em to the left then you sway 'em to the right
step around the floor kinda nic and liht
then you do the eagle rock with the style and grace
gene 's first ig break came on broadway , starring in pal joey .
both :
ballin ' the jack
charisse :
gene had a style all his own charming and athletic , with boundless energy .
his partner :
gene 's inventiveness seemed inexhaustible .
fit as a fidle and ready for love i can jump over the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
charisse :
gene teamed ith donald o'connor to perform this marvelously comic vaudeville routine for singin ' in the rain .
soon all the church bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
how the church bells will be ringing
hi , diddle-diddle , my baby 's ok
charisse :
the heather on the hill fom brigadoon .
you are my lucky star
charisse :
gene inspired a whole new generation of stars .
one of the brightest was a young california gil named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary frances renolds when i entered the miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gowns created by the world-famou designer adrian were part of the treatment .
as well as makeup and hair departments that could accomplish ny style imaginable .
a star like joan crawford would sometimes have her look redesigned numerous times until it matched he exact mood of the role she was to play 
you stepped out of a dream
you are too wonderful to be what you seem
could there be ees like yours ?
honest and truly ?
you stepped out of a cloud
in 1941 , the glamour age had reached its zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone nd apart out of a dream
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream sequence to the song a lady loves in the film i loe melvin .
loves a penthouse where he 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sail away
for a simple riviera holiday
reynolds :
now , at last , you can see our differing oints of view .
she loves her dreams tied up with apron trings
just little pots and pans
and he 'll be hadsome well , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look ie oh , never mind he price
a lady loves beaucoup i'aour
but first of all she loves to be scure
yet there is one vital thought she will place above
all o the things i make mention of
and what is more a lady loves to live
and what is more a lady lives to love
thanks for the present of the silver-blue mink
thanks for the yacht and for the solid-gold sink
thanks a lot , but no thnks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of the poer of the devastating female over the hapless male from it 's always fair weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and for the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am just a faithful lassie
and there 's no gift however classy
by which this lassie can be had
thanks for losin ' your mind
thanks a lot , but no
no thanks
i do n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to do
reynolds :
in torch song , joan crawfor made her final musical film as a fading legend perforing in tropical makeup for the song two-faced woman .
the recordig was n't a new one at mgm .
it 's been suggested that they may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
i c n't help being a twofaced woman
a little bit of boldness a little bit of sweetness
a little it of coldness a little bit of heatness
do n't fall in lov with a two-faed woman
got another lover under cover
that goes with the breeze
my disposition
that 's why they call her a two-faced woman
a little bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a little bit of heatness
black and white rong and right
they call me two-faced woman
reynods :
in the early 1940s hollywod began a fascination with things tropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exceptio .
exotic rhythms and costumes tranported audiences away from cold climates and the troubled times of a world war .
many latin artists were recruited to add an authentic sound to thes films .
one of th most populr was xvier cugat and his orchestra .
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the latin lover , driving female audiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got the kind of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just ike was beating in mine
but you make it 109 and there is more to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reynolds :
lik this before
renolds :
one ofthe performers at mgm whom i admired the most was the legendary lena horne .
or when
for the first time
seem to be happening again
it was a long time ago i stood in this very spot and recorded that lovely song .
when i first walked onto this recording stage in 1942 it looked pretty much as it does today .
i recorded all of the music for my movies here and it is still considered hollywood 's greatest recording stage .
i never felt like i really belonged in hollywood .
so i usually just came on , sang a song and made a quick exit .
just one of those crazy things
yeah , i got to sing a reat cole porter tune in a featured appearance but what i really wanted was to be given an acting role in the movies .
just one of thoe fabulous flights
if we thought a bit of the end of it
we 'd have been aware that our love affair
was too hot no to cool down
here 's hoping we meet now and then
but it was just
said that gal , du barry
ai n't it the truth ?
in 1943 , i got to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin i the sky .
love is a rippling ' brook
you got to bait your hook
rise and shne
and cast your line
ai n't it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truth ?
it 's the truth
th truth
horne :
in 1946 , i played the role of julie in an excerpt from show boat in till the clouds roll by .
i was being consideed for the part for the 1951 version of show boat but the production code office had banned interracial romne on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good fiend ava gardner .
the studio had ava rehearse singing the role to the recordings that i had made hoping to get the part which annoyed us both .
gardner :
fish got to swim , birds got to fly
ca n't help lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
though ava was one o my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did n't get te part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but when he comes back
that day is fine
as late as can be
ca n't help
horne :
 was not the only one to lose a role ere .
in annie get your gun , betty hutton was a big hit as anie oakley .
judy garland had begun filming the roe and completed two numbers when she suffered a breakdown and had to be replaced .
retrieved at lst from the mgm film vaults is judy 's version of i 'm an indian too .
like those indians
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an honest injun inian
i 'm an indian , too
folks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see , whatever conflicts judy stuggled with a a person she always came through as an entertainer .
garland :
when you 're out with a feller in the pale moonlight
you do n't ave to look in a book to find
what he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind
but they cash them just the same
grandpa dick was always sick
he just died at 93
doin ' what comes naturally
the quick toboggan when you reach he heights
horne :
words and music was the last time that judy and mickey rooney worked together at mgm endin the most popular song and dance team the studio would ever have .
garland :
no more pain
th pulled-out fur of cat and cur
judy garland and i grew up together at mgm and completed high school between long days of shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pictures toether and even when we worked separately we turned to each other for friendship and encouragement .
we were the very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her very much .
teach m how to sing
music with a modern rhythm let me swing
mr. mendelssohn swing
music is a thing
that 's no good without that rhythm
sweet and hot fast and slow
hey , swing it low
and swing it mr. mendelssohn swing
rooney :
in love finds andy hardy judy laments the fact that she 's not a little girl any longer and not quite a grownup either .
grownups ignore me
nd in every sense
i 'm just on a fence
i 'm just an in-between
for a few years , judy was an in-between .
they found it in her first staring role :
dorothy gal in the wizar of oz .
toto , i have a feeling we 're nt in kansas anymore .
we must be over te rainbow .
follow the yellow brick road follow the yellow bick road
follow the yellow brick road
because of the wonderful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to become the most widely seen motion picture of all time ad judy 's wondrful performance in the picture earned her a special academy award which i was lucky enough to present to her .
thank yo .
will you do that ?
somewhere over the rainbow
birds fly over the rainbow
why , then
i like new york in june , how about you ?
i like a gershwin tune , how about you ?
i love a fireside wen a storm is due
how aout you ?
rooney :
looks like we both agree
on what to do
down on an island , the southern seas
thee lived a lassie named minnie breeze
garland :
and all the natves would be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
came back to trinidad
who , stole my heart away
who , makes m dream all day
eems as though  'll ever be blue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one of the studio 's most valuale assets and made a special guest appearance as marilyn miller in the jerome kern biograpy , till the clouds roll by .
mach on , little doagies
here are judy , ray bolge , cyd charisse , and a cast of hundreds in a never-before-seen march o the doagies .
garland :
we do n't know where we 're goin '
till we 're past the last fence rail
out there breaks the day
oh , we do n't know where we 're goin '
but we 're on our way
me for a campfire out on the trail
me for an old cayuse
and i 'm all set to vamoose
and nobody asking me why give me a cowhand song
are marching ' on
out there lies the prairie
this is judy at the top of her career .
playing on his slide trombone
in a certain monotone
he was known as mr. monotony
any pleasant interlue
but the same dull melody
would emege from mr. monotony
olks for miles would run away
she would come around and say
ca n't play
today
it only happens when i dance wih you
rooney :
another legend at metro was my good friend fred astaire who always romanced a glamorous patnr in his motion pictures .
in easter arade , it was the one and only an miller .
astaire :
why does it happen , dear
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks
are yours and mine
i 've danced with dozens of others
that only happens with you
but fred astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on and e put me a ease right away .
come on , annie , let 's do it one more time .
good evening .
miss marlowe .
astaire :
i 've seen it often enough .
i 'll try .
that 's fine .
harry , give us the pickup on tat gang number , will you , please ?
it was a little more than a guest appearance for fred for h wa soon o be under contract to rko pictures where they were about to team him with ginger rogers causing a string of hit musicals to follow .
fred did n't return to mgm ntil seven years later at which time he starred with eleanor powell in broadway melody of 1940 .
miller :
in 1945 , fred and a new partner , lucille bremer stepped out t coffee time in yolana and the thief .
its director , vincente minnelli .
that 's for me
i 'm drum cray , yes i 'm drum crazy , yes
i 'm plumb crazy for drums
miller :
fred could make music out of almost anything .
and he often found new challenges that stretched his talents .
astaire :
first , soft violins
when the drum takes the melody
when the drm carries the tune
miller :
hard-boiled private eyes were all the rage n the '50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse .
she came at me in sections .
more curves than a scenic railway .
she was dangerous .
i would n't trust her any farther than i could throw her .
she was selling hard , but i was n't buying .

in the barkleys of broadway , they dance the swing trot under the min titles of the picture , but with the titles removed another musical gem is revealed from the most beloved dance team of all time .

well , there is oe thing .
i do n't know whether it would help or not .
you 'd let us do that ?
let ' turn ourselves in .
after all , why should you care if we get a break ?

paper !
i can not take your money .
thank you .
paper !
paper !
congratlations , professor .
# here 's to the prof of geology
# rare boy he , and rare boys we
# to the braw , aye , aye , aye , aye
# to the knicht , aye , aye , aye , ye , aye , aye , ye , aye
i 'm sorry .
will the laird of glendarach stp forward ?
sir oliver .
that 's enough obituary prose .
hellish to dust .
i thank you all from the bottom of my heart .
ah .
i was on the committee that made the collection .
£5 was subscribed .
that left three shillings .
i expended it on this .
a little extra token i thought you might fancy .
i saw it during eastr week in a little widow in glasgow , a curiosity shop .
buy me for professor lindenbrook .
what did you reply ?
could serve as a paperweight .
it 's a scholar 's choice .
what are you eating tonight ?
this being tuesday , i 'm not eaing .
i find it very healthy to eat only every other night .
be at my house at eigh o'clock .
i 'm entertaining some of the faculty .
i do not think i could .
what 's the mtter with you ?
is t those frayed cuffs that worry you ?
eight o'clock sharp .
yes , sir oliver .
eight o'clock .
lava .
i swear there 's something inside .
there 's uncle now , kirsty .
i thought it was uncle oliver .
i want it understood that not a sngle stich i 'm earing belongs to me .
i 'm early , but i trust i 'm not too early .
where is e ?
he 's never been late like this never .
i do n't know , ut , to return to the subject of my clothes , they 're my classmate 's , the young laird of glendarach .
when i rturned , my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted .
you 've explained your magnificence .
there will be one ore guest .
what do you expect when it takes a command from my uncle to bring you to this house ?
two years more  have to study for my master 's degree 
then four years more as a aboratry assistant .
they 're paying for my schooling .
how like a scotsman .
i know one whose purse as not empty , because he did n't even have a purse .
do you know what he said ?
miss jnny , the time of poetry is over .
if this is true , alec mcewen , what ae ou doing with your hand on my knee ?
now you just wait in there .
kirsty , i 'll set the extra place .
is there something you want ?
a key is stuck .
but that 's impossible .
it was just tuned last month .
this one .
you looked like spring itself .
there 's a key stuck .
# so deep in love am i
# that i will love you still , my dear
# till ll the seas go dry , my love
# and rocks melt with the sun
# and i will love you still , my dear
# so fare-thee-well , my only love
# and fare-he-well a while
# fr i 'll come back to you , my love
# though t were ten thousand mile
yes , we were .
is n' he with you ?
is n't he here ?
no .
it 's just about the limit now , sir oliver .
i gave no permission for visitors .
good lad .
if you do n't come now , the goose will be ...
aye , and without a pause for lunch or tea .
now then , from which vocano could this piece of lava hav emerged ?
mount etna ?
very close .
the lipari island group off the coast o italy .
that 's xactly what stumped me .
but that would be icelandic peridotite .
precisely .
there 's a piece chipped off .
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
hen i sw this , i stopped chipping .
looks like a letter or some notches .
three notches made by the hand of man .
what 's your conclusion ?
science does not jump to concluons .
we 're going to melt off the cust of lava .
mr paisley .
not too fast , you knw 
i shall write to professor goetaborg of stockholm aout this .
he 's the leading authority o volcanoes .
four hours ?
jenny !
are you all right ?
tha was entirely my fault , sir olivr .
i do n't know how it could have happened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendered an inestimable sevice to science .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not only looks like it is a plumb bob .
can you make out what it says , professor ?
it 's in sme nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand 
ink 
possibly .
look at this side , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ...
arne saknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable , but it must be true .
a man took some tools and went where no human being has ever set foot .
into the interior of the earth , alone .
the laughter stopped when he diappeared , never to be heard from .
until tonight .
get out of here , woman !
i did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shouting at me , sir olier .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you have n't slept !
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncle oliver .
no answer !
where is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to get here from stockholm ?
answe the ell .
did it ring ?
callers , callers .
i 'm involved in something important .
more important than our univerity ?
what does the name arne saknussem mean to you , gentlemen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study of volcanoes .
out of a volcano came this message from im .
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , was probably picked up by some peasant , gathered dust in a uriosity shop till it came to me .
whoever descends into the rater of snefels yocul can reach the center of the earth .
arne saknusem .
the center of the earth ?
an extinct volcano in iceland .
but , oliver , this is sheer fantsy .
you have n't heard all of it .
at sunrie on the last day f may the ountain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scartaris ?
it 's a mountain peak near the volcano .
but this is a student 's hoax .
let 's not tae that one .
more than anything , you must consult other experts .
and i 've written to the foremost authority in europe .
more eminent sill .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunatey i 've not yet recived his reply .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent sees fit to answer you .
and in the meantime we could do with a cup of tea .
think whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
just this moment , sir oliver .
look .
well , he 's got his letter from stockholm .
di you see the shine in his eyes ?
there 'll never be a better moment to tell him about our feelings for ech ther .
e 'll say yes almost inadvertntly .
what if he says no advertently ?
you wait and see how firm my voice can be when i speak of you .
blast and damn !
bad news , sir ?
his disappearance folows closely the date my communication must have reached him .
or too important .
mcewen , go directly to the harbor .
oliver , calm down .
you heard saknussem 's mesage .
oliver , you 're seriously ill .
i am seriously well .
wat are you waitng for ?
i told you to hurry .
if you 'll excuse me , i must start packing .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take time for this , sir .
what are you so ugent about ?
this is the mot urgent moment of my lfe .
i have to be in iceland .
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturally .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i go
i wish i could sing loud enouh for jenny to hear me .
it is a bit painful to leave her on th first day of our engagement .
to come back to her as a world-famous scientist is not to be sneezed at .
come here .
i neglected to tell you , sir .
well , you 'll get ver that after the first million fathoms or o .
he 's been surveying here .
your revered colleague from stockholm .
he is n't wasting any time .
do you think he 's aready gone down ?
no .
buy all the rope available .
you thnk we can prepare it all so quickly ?
wht 's that you 're takng ?
jenny 's farewell gift .
back to my otel .
já , professor goetaborg .
no , no , thank you .
nobody carries a soldier 's weapons .
and take your time .
these insruments are dlicate .
easy , coachman .
this is n't the same rod we came by this morning .
i said slow down , man !
you 're out of your seses !
stop your horses , man !
slow down !
stop , you fool !
whoa !
if you 've ruined my instrumens , i 'll horsehip you , so help me .
this certainly is not my hotel .
where are we ?
how did you get here ?
i do n't know .
it went so fast .
did you see who did it ?
no .
he 's a criminal .
very likely he 's dreame f such a project 
hush .
some tapping .
there 's not a oul around .
it is n't sunday .
the fishing fleet is going out for the first summer haul .
you mean he shops re closed ?
but every piece of rope  every amp , everything we 'd need was sold .
to professor goetaborg .
he 's staying in the very inn whre we have ur rooms .
a fellow prisoner , do you suppose ?
it 's a code .
morse ?
jot this down 
perhaps it 's in icelandic .
my esteemed friend , whoever you are , let me introduce myself .
professor oliver lindenbrook , university of edinburgh .
may i ask you to interrupt your tapping for a moment and listen ?
in what language would you like me to speak 
he does n't uderstand english .
mon cher ami , vous et nous sommes dans une situation abominable .
gertrude ?
ertrude !
it 's a female prisoner .
and her lover .
it 's a duck !
may i have your hlp ?
he is at home , is n't he ?
yes , i ...
h is not at home .
you can not see him .
i 'm sorry .
here are your coins .
and here is my card , if you 'll be good enough to put it in his box so that he 'll know tomorrow that i 'm around .
goetaborg !
i know you 're in there .
this is lindenbrook .
goetaborg .
the very last word in equipment .
ruhmkorff lamps .
as long as they 're wound up , the induction coil will give off current .
breathing devices .
the kind they use i coal ines in wales .
more treasure , sir .
limbing boots .
alpenstocks .
food for months .
a chart of the ...
so you wanted to push in ahead of us .
fate took care of him .
why did n't they tell us at the desk ?
we 'l observe one minute of silence in memory of a great scientist , even if he was a blasted thief .
alec , you mentioned fate .
slight correction .
fate plus a few grains of potassium cyanide .
he was against someoe who was even more against him .
who ?
i 'm the wife of professor goetaborg .
oh , my dear .
wo n't you sit down for a minute before you go up ?
please , my dear .
early in the morning he ent to the mountain .
when he came back fr lunch he received his guest right in the lobby .
they went up to his room and ate .
what are you trying to tell me ?
in the evening when the mai went to make the bed ...
oh , dear god 
as long as i can remember , no one ever ded in my inn !
he was joking on the pier in stockholm .
madam , my deep ympathy .
my name
oliver lindenbrook of edinburgh university .
professor lindenboo .
i see you are .
this will be difficult for you , madam , but it must be faced .
who was the last person to see him alive ?
 did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
thy saw each other every day .
i suggest that you have an autopsy perfrmed immediately .
neither he nor i coud suspect there ws a third party who would stop at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deeply distressed by your husband 's death , and i fully understand your feelings .
however , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off your hands .
your expedition ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole fom me .
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encounte .
a saknussem descendant turns up acts as if he were kng of volcanoes .
tries to fore me to surrender his ancestor 's secret .
saknussem called again .
new complication .
must fight him somehow .
young man , would you come here a mment , please ?
who are those for ?
that 's a beginning .
what bout lamps ?
lamps .
put me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in iceland ?
but i wish to pologize to you in plain english .
i went through my husband 's diar , and some of his remarks led me to believe i did you an injustice .
i 'm sorry .
 did n't know .
do n't give it another thought .
i sha n't .
began an that 's all it has done .
sir oliver , this morning you asked me for these .
if you still want them , they 're yours .
will you say that again ?
madam .
my husband had these boots made specially .
i hope they fit you .
i told yur man t order some for me immediaely .
good , good .
why would you need boots like this ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm comig along .
that 's why  'm giving you all of this .
it 's a ondition .
i thought you understood .
you did n't mention any condition .
then i do now .
whom did you intend to take along , besides this young man ?
then i 'll be very useful .
he does n't understand a word of english .
we 're not contemplating a stroll down piccadilly or the champs élysées .
professor lindenbrook , i hav just lost my husband .
the police require your presenc for the investigation into th death .
but , madam , quite apart from the appalling danger , think of the inconvenience .
the lack of privacy .
in short , you do n't want al of this .
i may be mad on the subject of this journey , but i am not stupid !
to burden myself with a female is seer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbance to men , never a burd .
you 'll sleep where we sleep , eat what we eat and ash when we wash .
then you accept my proposition .
professor , look !
now we descend nto oblivion or ... we enter the great book of history .
carla goetaborg .
alexander mcewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans and who ?
professo !
professor !
hans is tying the rope on her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you have told him that ?
and then there 's always the blessed chance the rope may break .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only you could see your face .
you do .
perhaps this is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no other way to continue .
eureka !
tank you .
now ten , a general summary .
a :
b :
as my husband 's charts indicated .
onward .
and let 's have some music .
the last news was that they went up mount sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys .
yes ?
ad then the animals came down without their packs .
oliver s lindenbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what 's t ?
a woman !
a slight tremor , coming rom undefined regions .
let us proceed .
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us .
the three notches of arne saknussem .
what does that mean ?
look .
we might have taken any one of these channels .
but our great colleague maketh a path fo our feet .
let us have tea .
with a double ration of raisins .
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , madam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmares , we 'd have made different sleeping arrangements .
someone is walkig up there .
human footsteps .
the hearing of all women is extremely acte .
my wife used to hear rats in the attic , usually the nights before i had an important lecture .
alec , go up and find out .
hey need rest .
moreover , it was stipulated tht i give the orders .
there 's no need to use that patient voice with me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i am a member of this expedition , and as uch i intend to report any observation i make .
alec .
put it down in the record that a member f the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right here .
conceal these marks completely .
i 'll give them some new ones .
starting from an estimated depth of 129km , limestone formation continues .
here are the three notches again .
good .
let 's see .
one heads 220º south-southwest , the other 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quite .
what 's he saying ?
hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expedition .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well , why does man freeze to death trying to reach the north pole ?
once a question has arisen in the human brain , the answer must be found if it takes 100 years .
1,000 years .
let 's hear you render that into a few well-chosen icelandic words .
why not simply tell him sientists hve bats in their belfries ?
are you all riht ?
can you unhook yourself ?
grab his and .
never mind bout that .
how is it possible ?
this way was clearly indicated 
this is no recent fissure .
thi has been here since the beinning of time .
i was not in a position to observe it scientifically .
but where ?
we 're supposed to stay toether .
tricked into the wrong tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam ... heard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she 's saying it .
we ut return .
why ?
you know that .
but if there is a madman loose ...
he 's against all of us .
against the very concept of this journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to where alec fll .
but it 's not on our route .
if we 're to go ahead , we have no time for detours .
then you wait here .
madam , now that the boy has gone and hans does 't understand english ,
i 'm blushing already .
professor !
yes , i thought so .
alec !
i 've got to take a specimen of this back to edinburgh , i it 's the last thing i do .
unique .
were the devil is he ?
it 's a blind aley !
keep back !
hans !
good god !
that 's it .
prais the lord !
alec .
professor !
hello !
professor !
professor !
here i am !
salt .
professor .
rofessor , you ca n't go on this way .
i 've kep track of the passage of days .
you have n't .
we 'll try the crosschannel over there .
you wo n't find him there .
i 've got to find him .
i ' responsible .
i can see that this is a recent break .
if you 're down there , give us a ign !
alec , listen carefully .
when the echoes stop , you must try to answer .
pick up a pebbe and scratch the rock .
just give us a sign .
how can i live with myelf ?
you must continue with what you started .
it was his roject as much a it was yours .
we will proceed .
down there , food and water .
so you 've lost your friends ?
jut as well .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of place here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to seal the professor 's roject ?
you need me as much as i need you .
you found me .
my friends could find me too .
very well .
you 'll carry i with one arm , not two !
it 's a multiple echo , reverberating throgh the rock chambers .
the last echo will give us the direction .
alec .
alec .
alec !
professor .
where was he ?
i did n't think he 'd shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trspassers here .
you are also the murderer of my husband .
he would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of your geat ancestor , put down that preposterous gun .
you 're not going to listen to a murderer ?
never interrupt a murderer  madam .
i resnt that bourgois classification .
you have my word of onor .
give me your hand on that .
a bourgeois trick .
so sorry .
we have to hold court .
guilty .
gilty .
then the mandatory sentence is death .
we will follow the route marked by the notches .
no , no , no , no , no .
i can carry somehing with my left hand .
you can cary yourself for a couple of days .
that 's all we can expect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his famil hae been loyal to the saknussems for generations and , well , he can not touch th gun .
this is contempt of crt .
no , no , professor ...
i ean  sir oliver .
you must n't look at me .
oh , no .
you ... you could n't consider for a moment tha i could do it .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weeks you 've been denying your sex , and now you fal back on it .
i would say the natural executionr would be the leader of the expedition .
we 're much too civilized to ...
what do you propose ?
drag him with us ?
stop fidling wth those lams .
the lamps are giving out .
to save what we can , i insist that we leave tese rgions at once .
you insist ?
what 's the harm ?
the harm is , mada , that he 's wasting a lamp .
madam , make a final note , while you 've still light enough o write by .
let me , madam .
this may be our last entry .
hans and i can cut some rope into some torches .
what puzzles me is that the three notches of old arne saknussem still keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on neither do you , sir oliver .
yes , just switch it off .
why , it 's miraculous !
look at this .
wat is it , sir ?
lit without heat .
a cool , chemical light .
he same principle is involved here .
256th day .
the phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 'v said lindenbrook expedition , you 've written mcewen expedition ?
may i remind you that months ago you gave me explicit ordrs to that effect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to be corrected by you incessantly .
you 're doing it with your looks , the inflection of your voice , the very posture of your body .
your entire presnce is a contant criticism of me .
i 've had enough 
well , let me tll you , you dried-up walnut of a man , if anyon 's had enough , it 's me .
it 's i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carl goetaborg !
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ...
well , t least you know i have a temper .
and from now on alec will keep the chars 
alec !
why ca n't he stay around ?
a forest of mushrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grew wihout sun this far under the earth !
it 's tougher than leather .
it 's like an oak tree .
mushroom steak , mushroom soup , mushroom hash .
ater some months of this , you 'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef .
if we only knew how many more .
there 's no term to the work of a scientis .
but that s not professor lindenbrook 's feelng .
and what is the name of the girl you love ?
the girl you love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
but why would you wa to know that just now ?
dear alec !
professor ?
here 's some hot mushroom porridge for you , sir oliver .
i slept as i never lept in edinburgh .
i may move here permanently .
i do n't know .
is that madman still giving orders ?
the inute you fell asleep he wen off in that direction , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want with al those ?
you 've com to ask me why i did n't take my rest period .
i do n't sleep .
i hate those little slices of death .
it ' a sea .
it 's an ocean with wave and currents .
the fissures closed again .
it 's the prerogative of the discoverer .
 congratulate you .
a dimetrodon !
if i ha my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swim ?
no , thank god .
hre .
i wonder if it 's cold where they are .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hand !
my watch !
save the instruments .
my ring !
my wedding ring .
a field of force that snatches gold away .
this is it !
this is it !
the junction of magnetic forces from the norh pole and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness over there .
after all , we did hit the center of the earth .
he wants to know where we o from here .
tired minds o n't plan well .
slep first , plan later .
oliver , the day may come when you 'd very much like to have that porridge .
is it incredible to you that i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , duck .
gertrude ?
gertrude ?
gertrude !
gertrude !
hans !
why do you look at me like that ?
hans !
i needed food , so i took it .
stop this fol !
hans !
you ingrates !
what can you do without me ?
tis is the sunken city .
after 5,000 years , behold a fragment of the lost atlantis .
ll we know abut i comes from the greek .
the floor o the sea opened up and swllowed the whole island of atlati .
this must ave been the market square .
eating .
well , we 've learned one thing about the inhabitants of atlantis .
stale bread .
we must speak to the baker .
mada !
madam !
j ?
exacty .
to think that at a moment like this i 've no pad and pencil to recrd it all 
turn around , madam .
hat is it ?
look at that tibia .
you wo n't find anything edile in there .
the chinese eat eggs over 400 years old .
gunpowder .
it 's pointing somewhere .
of course !
this is the way up .
a direct hatchway to the surfae .
and we can climb up .
let him venture 100 meters or so on reconnoiter .
the updraft ca n't carry him awy .
now i 'd say let 's roll up our sleevs if we had any .
we must n't hope for much .
this light wo n't stay with us .
i 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kai-ai !
ka-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be walking in darkness .
i wish i had better news .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward , straighter than the one we descended .
there ' an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway .
hans said only a landslie could ever move it .
if his hopes had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , sir ?
the haversack arne saknussem 's havesack .
get it .
i guarantee that this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrounding rocks will take the dsturbance lightly , i can not garantee .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear god , ruler of heaven and earth ...
do n' set any limit to his realm , laddie .
god of the universe , we are in thy merciful hands .
look out !
a monster !
let me go !
it 's an earthquake of unusual magnitude !
more likely it 's a volcanic eruption .
stromboli , italy .
the capule of the dead volcano broke under a treendous explosion .
rocks of extraornary size are being spewed out into the sea 
dammi una mano .
piano .
piano .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrown from the altar stone ... long before we hit the wate .
non si preocupi .
i 'm most grateful , ladies , but my immediate need is not a ladder .
pataloons .
pantaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindebrook !
speech 
fellow scots , i these shouts of yours express some pleasure that we 've returned alive , i thank you deeply .
however , if they 're meant as praise for a successful scientist ,
i must disclaim that honor .
a scientist who can not prove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothig .
i have no records , no shred of evidence .
i will never embarras this distinguished university by asking that it take my word .
this , i know :
the spirit of man can not be stoped .
splendid , oliver .
professor , here 's someone who wants to say goodbye .
hans , old friend .
did you get your injuries when the volcano blew up , in the hot lava ?
he was in such a hurry leaving the hurch , he fell all the way down the steps .
after all that waiting .
it 's been no marriage for you at all .
you underestimate alec .
i 'm taking the night train to london and then back to stocholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a job to do here i edinburgh .
i intend to write my memoirs .
what you need is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictatin .
no , none of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend one 's days and nights with a man under the earth , anohe under one roof in scotland .
what did i say ?
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
frau goetaborg !
yes ...
carla ...
i warn you ..

i think  then , you would be most rewarded to consider this .
do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance .
like so many things , it is not what is outside , but what is inside that counts .
it once changed the course of a young man 's life .
the diamond in the rogh

i wonder what it wuld be like o live there , and have servants and valets .
oh , sure .

all right .
the truth is ,
there 's his guy at northern .
is n't that the guy you 've been readin ' about ?
right .
he 's this close to discovering the graviton .
if we can figure out how the graviton works ,
dfy it .
where bridges wo n't collapse ,
where planes wo n't crash .

a good scientist does n't keep repeating the same experiment ove and over
expecting to get different results .
ch-chaz .

chaz anthony .
amy abrahms ?
claire addison ?

chaz anthony ?
chaz anthony ?
i 'm so glad you decided to join us .
i said take a seat , young man .
i see first impressions are yor strong suit .
paul o'donnell .
friends call me odie .
yu 're hard core , man .
settle in , chaz .
i 'll be teaching this class all yer .
and i 'll be disrupting it .
and it took many , many yeas
before galileo could prove his theory to be correct .
that , indeed , the planets travel around the sun in a circular orbit .
well , i 'm very impressed .
uh , i was , uh ...
skating and some geek told me that the ice rink was elliptical .
while i was sticking his tongue to the ice .
teacher :
all right , all right .
as you may or may not know ...
hey , chicago .
this is deion .
odie says you 're down .
mind if we join you ?
i mean , yo .
experiment ?
uh , yeah , experiment to see how long i can stay in school
without ever actually going to school .
he 's the bomb .
hey , how 's it going ?
i finished te calculations for today 's experiment .
eah , the data 's right there on your desk
undeneath your eighth grade geometry book , chaz .
so , how 'd you find out ?
my computer told me .
so , who 's chaz ?
a guy who has a life .
i 've gone through life s far s charlie boyle
and it is n't any sleigh ride .
who thought he , i was cool .
me .
that has never , ever happened to me before .
ever .
and i 'm going back .
ok .
charlie , i 'm not your dad .
good .
right .
scienc .
one kid ven gave me his lunch money
always hae .
oh , look , i got this one from a street fight .
look at that .
 got an appendix scar .
bear , bear ...
listen , it 's not the scar , all ight ?
ok , girls , i yu think that was something .
personal record .
well , the skeleton lecture sounded awful interesting ,
so i thought i 'd vary my routie a little .
class :
park it , mr. anthony ,
and lose the blades .
catch you later , claire .
teacher :
all right , everyone , settle down 
and chaz anthony 's not .
honor society girls never like honor society guys .
trust me on this one .
sounds like a risky game plan to me .
and now i 'm enacting a strategy
just like any good psy --
of course , alone , it 's not much good .
to atually move .
thank you .
now , ho many bones do you think are in your feet ?
big finish .
i just wish you 'd use your powers for good , not evil .
what are you talking abut ?
there are geniuses your age , you know .
i was talking to a colleague over at northern .
he was telling me about a young man --
who was it that helped you ?
like i said , some loser in science club .
now , who wants to come up here
and fiish charting these points on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricature
you know ..
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have become openly hostile .
not to mention the dorm food .
well , the only fatherly advice i can give you about the science stuff
is ust keep plugging away .
a utor !
dad , you 're a genius !
genius ?
my first f 
your first f .
what am i saying ?
but why are you so happy about getting your first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i guess they 're gon na kick me out of school
if i do n't get better grades .
and i would care because ..
you 're pretty ok .
ca n't you find anyone else ?
i mea , well , you were the first one on my list .
maybe we could work something out .
then i gess i should start practicing .
oh , great .
just what i want to do after school ,
more school .
take it .
fine .
ho nothing lasts forever
well , they 're wrong
yeah

you 've got the key to my heart
'cause i
it seems so long ago
when my world was upside-down
hey , nice ...
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you know , just to say thanks and all .
that 's good , is n't that ?
i mean , that 's what we 're supposed to be listening to , right ?
thank you .
hey , so , what 's with the museum ?
he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey  daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ...
i 'm just going to get my things here .
chaz ?
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i would have loved to have seen coach addison 's face .
i 'm glad he did n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over with claire , too .
that was 20 miles of rough road on the apoogy turnpike .
hey , doc ?
you ever have a girlfriend ?
yeah , sure .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it , charlie .
and still , there 's no sign of a graviton .
well , mybe if we take our minds off it ,
you know , if we sit back , relax ,
and , h , have a little fun .
the eureka synrome , yeah .
whenever he had a problem that he could n't solve ,
eureka !
come on , dance with me .
oh , no , i do n't think so .
uh , you do n't wan to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any different .
only as a particle up until now .
we can jus as easily think of it as a wave .
you said so in your book .
microwave onflic .
how could i miss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ..
set up a phased harmonic ,
affected the nuclear matrix ,
in other wors , groovy little huse beat
just unlocked the mysteres of the universe !
we did it , charlie !
thi is big !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
ca we do it later though ?
 'm kind of late for science class .
maybe you just had a good tutor .
but you are going to meet one .
i got to thinking it might be good for you t meet a kid your age
who s not ashamed of being smart .
he can probably use some one-on-one
with a kid who 's not ashamed to kick his butt .
class :
yes , well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arranged a field trip today to northern .
doc !
doc 
i got to show you something really cool .
oh .
oh , what ?
what am i going to do ?
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
6 shades of purple ?
thank you very much .
thank you and wlcome .
the youngest partcle physicist
a terrible lab accident has let young mr. boyle
temporarily disfigured .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agreed to come out and talk to you anyway ,
mr. charlie boyle .
charlie ?
charlie , in gravely voice :
thank you , felow teens .
wi eventually subside .
since i am in obvious discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let professor krickstein
well , uh ...
psst !

t 's starting to burn .
i do n't know .
off .
may times i think that an atom is -- is pretty much lik the univre --
i got ta go pay the water bill .
excuse me .
krickstein :

this is a very valuable clue as thymine is changed to uracil .
uh , here at the niversity , we have , uh , t1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i wanted to meet charle boyle .
from the head of the anhropology --
and schedule anther field trip .
i 'm sre i can convince charle to come back .
what are you doing to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
wht are you doing ?
i-it 's too much .

i can do it myself .
he s fine  he 's fine .
really .
you kids do yur homework .
bye .
i decided to move my suff back in .
i need some help .
you ...
with what ?
physics , chemitry , poli sci .
you have everything .
i could say the same about you .
women , poise ...
woen .
losing my scholarship ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bad trade-off .
yeah , right .

right in the middle of her routine ,
the heavens pened up
nd her whole attitude changed .
in a snow globe .
hmph !
you 're the most beautiful thing i 've ever seen .
couple of days .
hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the people up there think i 'm a genius ,
and then the other half think i 'm a punk .
hey , i 'm going to use th particle accelerator while you 're gone .
might as well get some work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck own here .
mi particle accelerator es su particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerator .
and i wanted to say thans for passing me .
hey , you have nobody to thank but yourself .
so , uh ...
hee .
it 's from me and the guys .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goin ' down .

boy :
come on , dude .
all ight , now the 3 to worry about are stoker ,
now cross will usually distrct the referee here ,
while stoker nd rder rack our best player ,
which is me .
we send somebody else out here with my number ,
that 's your plan ?
but -- but --
and you 'd come out with a phony number .
i like it .
hey , i 'm a genius .
hugo , sit up !
ladies and gentlemen ,
yeah , enough pleasantries .
listen ,
if we beat our arch rival tonight ,
we 'd get to take home some sort of great big cup , would we not ?

claire , let me explain .
explain ?
ust what was all of this ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a study of the local culture ?
then i guess you were just having a laugh at my expense .
imagine , me thinking i could teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fat liar 
i also left the particle accelerator on !
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
announcer :
do not venture onto the ice !
get off the ice !
this game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and we were this close .
this cloe !

claire :
come on , guys .
what are you reading ?
breakaway .
i love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron finds , uh , subatomic particles
and how they 're connected to a mysterious quantum force .
oh , yeah .
but yo know something ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to split a photon ,
and een though the partices are 6 miles apart ,
whatever one does , the other one does
col !
and maybe unlock the secret as to how it works .
and then ...
defy gravity .
let 's get to work .
and the output lvel is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antiravit alves .
wy he rubbr coating ?
they all act like superballs .
and when i prss thi button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i can make amends
well , with what we just discovere ,
i figured out a way to help orthern beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can keep his jo ,

and mabe ...
claire might like me again , too .

you just try and do tat !
for the re-scheduled central conference championship
how 's this supposed to work again ?
how is that possible ?
like the super balls i showed you .
corresponding microchips with other graviton halves
hatever our skates do , their skates will be forced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c in science .
you sure did a number on this lab .
nah .
besides , i 've arranged his schedule so that he 'll be gone all day .
and he 's never here during hockey games .
almost never .
this has gone way too far !
i told you i had to do what i had to do .
this has got ta stop , and it s got ta sto right now .
you know i 'm on yor side .
ahead of what ?
you can solve all the mysteries in the world ,

even superhuman .
and hey think that he might be teaching them ?
that 's right , lieutenant .
but admiral ...
s that a good likeness ?
perfect .
yes .
at least that 's the way he looked before ...

how he was when ...
and this taken by one of our divers .
is there any doubt in your mind ?
no , that 's him .
skipper !
we have no choice , lieutenant .
orders from the very top .
they 're recalling him to active duty .
henry always lived in a wold of his own .
thank you , miss arnes .
well , did you have your physical this morning ?
i 'm afraid not .
really ?
no , my eyesight .
they do n't want my blood .
well , i hope so .
and very healthy .
they may take her .
henry ?
yes , e is .
that 's nice .
they rejected me .
rejected ?
do n't hang around that pet shop .
do n't be upset , miss barnes .
there 's a fish in the water cooler .
hi , hen old boy !
george , good to see you .
do n't you look important ?
that uniform and all those oodads on your sleeve .
just a ouple of hash marks .
do n't apologie .
you look first-class to me , george .
what kind of a machine are you mated to ?
hey , bess !
time to tke over .
lover-boy 's here .
hello , dear .
hello , hery .
i forgive you , casanova .
george has liberty the whoe weekend , and he wants to spend it with us .
the whole weekend ?
no , i missed the subway train , but i ...
washed out compltely , i hear 
you ca n't win them all , george .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks for actio , go dacing ?
feel like shaking a leg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
how any times must i tell you , you o not rumba with your eyes !
now , do n't worry .
why do n't we go to the university for professor hoffmeyer 's lecture ?
you know , he 's gon na talk about the mating habits of the shellfish .
it 's a little risqué .
sort of for adults only , you know .
i 've got it !
why do n't we run out to coney island tomorrow morning ?
well , i d n't know ...
i hate to miss that lecture , but i do like the water .
water and fish .
look at him .
always drawing into his shell , going off into his fish world !
george , come here .
the what ?
devonian period of the aleooic era .
you know , it followed the silurian and preceded the carboniferous eras .
i 've given it a lot of thouht .
a lot of thought .
maybe go in or parakees .
he 's read many books on the subject .
he claims years ago there was nothing but fish in the world .
then some of those creatures became amphibians they crawled out on land .
hope for what , hery ?
with the war in europe and new weapons being invented hat if men were foolish enough to destroy themseves ?
then the fish would develop into a new race of men and this time they might turn out better .
fish have a better life than people .
the water !
what a mess !
you are floating yourself out of your home with this hobby !
i 'm gon na run down to the store and get a regultor for the intake hose .
yu mean get rid of them ?
but bessie !
either those fish go or i do !
which is it to be ?
who looked hurt ?
my fish .
for once .
i left out the most xciting details .
see , i do n't like to brag but , i tell you , that one morning ...
it was at night , was n't it ?
right .
good memry .
we went out with me in the engine room ...
i thought you were on he bridge with the admiral 
the uss elias j. starbright  is n't it ?
i can tell you this  though .
there are so many nazi subs below te surface you could walk o europe .
the ocean 's juming with u-boats ready to go if uncle sam gets in the fight .
i o n't want to start a panic , so you keep all this under your ht , righ ?
right , bessie ?
old boy , did i ever tell you about the caribbean ?
what a liberty we had in a port near trinidad !
and miami .
did you ever do the rumba , henry ?
no , i have faulty equilibrium .
yes , sir .
join the navy and have a whirl !
barbados , kingston , the virgin islands !
lunch is almost ready .
come along , henry !
more than anything , i wish i could be one of you right nw .
i wish i were a fish .
henry !
save him !
what will we do ?
get some help !
all the lifeguards !
get the polce !
police !
help !
come on .
it 's all ver .
he does n't even know how to swim .
he dos n't know how to swim !
what 's gon na happen to poor bessie ?

fish ?
oh , no .
there bessie , we 'd better get going ome now .
all right , folks , back up , please .
let us through .
and i thought it all would be so beautiful .
wish i were home with bessie .
i 've never stayed out all night before .
maybe i should have listened to essie .
i got this back from the pet shop .
well , he was so cray about it .
that 's sweet .
here 's the otice :
the body was not recovered .
limpet is survived by his widow  bessie limpe .

why  yo 're a splendid specimen of a pagurus pollicaris .
i 'm glad to meet you , crusty .
hey !
i do n't wan na fight !
let that be a lesson to you , you confounded , four-eyed ...
say , what are you , anyway ?
you related to the porpoise family ?
no , i 'm a limpet .
i 've see flat fish , but i 've ever seen no four-eyed flt bush .
listen , flatbush , anything i hate , it 's a smart-aleck fish .
shrk !
jumping jellyfish !
just swing about and let that shark chase you full speed away from here !
did that come out of me ?
hurricane !
stand by for a blow !
that belch of yurs could capsie me in the backwash .
if you sound off like that again , i swear i 'll batten your gills and lower the boom on you .
and furthermoe ...
crusty ?
crsty ?
you all right , crsty ?
got ta hand it to you .
that blob of shrimp bait 'll hink twice before he fools with us agai .
well  guess i 'll be off .

where are you going ?
i 'd like t see if i can locate other of my kind .
i figure i 'd better go along to keep you out of trouble .
hey , great !
all right , flatbush , let her rip .
loo !
a freighter !
hey , let 's not get too close o the critter .
do n't worry , t 's not alive .
not alive ?
suffering swordfish !
what kind of sea monster killed a whopper like that ?
a topedo did it .
oh , they wo n't attack us , they 're just after ships .
hey , do n't go moseying around in this thing 's innards .
no wonder this thing died !
here 's the captain 's lgbook .

i did n't hear it say anything .
if only i could help .
come on , let s shove off .
gangway , get me out of here !
it 's only a mirror .
it 's me .
well , swab my scuppers .
another flatbush .
i 'm not a bad-iooking fish at that .
really , a pretty unique specimen .
but maybe i 'm a freak !
if only ther was another fish like me .
even just one .
someone who would understand me .
listen .
do n't you hear that sound ?
i beter go up topside and have a look .
how awful !
did you see that ?
are you all right ?
thank you .

wow !
the first time i saw you .
remember ?
your pop brought me for dinner .
on my nose ?
tigma-tism .

do you see that barracuda coming at us ?
oh , limpet , limpet , we 'll be killed !
ladyfish ... ?
you see , you do n't understand .
married ?
is that like astigmatism ?
oh , that !
i do n't see why it should .
do you spawn with every tom , dick and fish that comes along ?
you see , up until now i 've been too young .
now shall we go 
i 'd sure like ...

do you suppose hat we could just be well , more or less friends ?
friends ?
goodbye .
gosh , i ca n't .
ladyfish !
ladyfish !
o , ladyfish !
i 've searched everywhere .
sunday , december 7 , 1941 
sources say the president will ask congress ...
ur country at war ?
look , flatbush , if you 're in trouble , you can count on me .
if you 'd stay here and look out for ladyfish , i 'd be grateful .
oh , please , it 's important , crusty .
if you do n't need me .
to look after her while i 'm gone .
flatbush , take it easy , huh ?
i will , crusty .
thanks .
they 're missing the u-boat !
ahoy !
a friend .
ship ahoy !
do n't be alarmed .
please do n't !
are you on a raft ?
i 'm a fish 
ahoy there !
what are you doing ?
why did n't you identify it ?
give the recognition signal !
give the recognition signal !
i fell in the ocean and was drowned .
only i was n't drowned , exactly .
give the recognition signal !
commence firing !
commence firing !
activate sonar dome .
you missed the sub .
left standard rudder .
the old man should hear this 
pip it to the bridge !
all engines ahea full , left standad rudder ?
400 yards straight ahead .
a direct hit .
could be a nazi trick .
cut that lght !
if you 're friendly , give the recognition signal !
you cold n't find it , could you ?
and then you got it , did n't you ?
we an not see you !
i 'd rather not say at the moment , you would n't believe me .
what the blasted blas is this ?
probably a nazi trick  just as you said , sir .
you want to meet with somebody called pickle ?
not pickle !
stickle !
machinist mate second class george stickle !
on the uss elias j. starbright !
i 'll send a full report of this meeting in but i ca n't gurantee pickle 
good .
i 'll be at this same spot three days from now .
wait till this hits the navy department .
harlock , you 've either bee drinking or you 've got combat fatigue !
we have n't time for nonsense .
whatever it is .
it led us to a nazi su and directed our charges accurately .
all right , harlock .
what 's your explanation for this phenomenon ?
i only kow that it 's friendly and cooperative .
blast it , harlock !
we ca n't enlist a voice !
why ?
i 'm not going on record as the admiral who was sent away because he believed in voices from the ocean .
there 's obody else cray enouh to take it .
oh , not me , admiral , i ...
stickle .
who is he ?
the voice asked us to bring stickle out to meet with him .
i tink we can arrange a leave for you immediatel .
think what this means .
it ould spot submarines all over .
within a year we could break the nazi u-boat threat .
all right , halock .
until we learn the nature of this device , it will remain top-secret .
certainly , admiral .
except betwen stickle and yourelf .
commander , you 've got to believe me !
i 'm just a machinist mate second class ...
i know all about you  pickle .
i hunted through half the navy to find you .
you have ben summoned here by a voice from the sea .
i have , sir ?
yes .
i do n't know anyone down ther , sir .
it did not come from a sumarine .
so help me , sir , i do n't know anything about this !
when the voice hils us , yo 'll talk to it until we get a fix on it .
yes , sir .
ahoy ot there !
did you hail us three days ago ?
he 's here .
say something , quick !
talk , sailor !
ahoy there !
this is henry limpet .
george !
come on , sailor !
hello , henry .
it 's good to hear you .
limpet is dead !
we 've got four other ships closing in on him .
this is a real surprise , henry .
i 'm not , george .
i 'm just ...
well , a little different .
sir ?
radar ca n' detect anything .
secure that light !
break out a rubber life raft .
rubber ... ?
oh , no !
you ca n't make me ...
you 're the key to this mytery , stickle .
put him in the boat .
henry , it 's me .
george stickle .
i 'm right here , george !
where ?
do n't turn that flashlight on .
look , if you 're really henry , what are you doing out here in the ocean ?
remember when you jumped in the water after me at coney island ?
i sure do .
did n't you see a fish ?
hey , wait .
i did !
no , george , that was me .
you ?
if you were a fish , you certainly would need to wear your glasses , henry .
if you 'll pardon me now , i got ta get going .
now do you believe me , george ?
got ta go down for air .
remember how you 'd come over on friday nights ?
you and bessie would play poker while i read myself to sleep ?
that 's rigt .
regular as clockwork , every friday night .
how about the time the three f us went to the oo ?
i got separated from you two .
i had to walk home .
bessie had my cash .
hey , wait a minute !
only henry limpet would know all that !
you are enry !
yes , george .
is there ... ?
is there anything i can do for you , hery ?

ladyfish , got a message for you from limpet .
he said he loes you and other such mush le that .
he loves me ?
oh , crusty , do you think he 'll ever come back ?

ladyfish , i 'm in terrible rouble .
i ca n't see .

i 'll climb topide and serve as your navigator .
the sound of the convoy will guide me , and with you navigating , why ...
i ca n't ask you to risk your life .
risk my life ?

do n't you care for me at all , limpet ?
but i have an important job to do before we can talk about that anymore .

a thrum .

we 're nearing enemy water , stickle .
sir , t 's not my fault .
we 've come quite a way .
i still ca n't pick up any sound of the convoy .
say , why do n't you make that whale-busting noise of yours again ?
just hold up a minute till i get inside .
dead ahead .
whole school of big nes , coming dead at us .
hard right .
they 're coming at us !
follow me , you beeping devil .
we 'll take it right back where it came from .
i do n't kow , sir .

something big is going n down there .

we 'll just let them knock themselves out .

it 's about time you showed up .
i got ta talk to george stickle .
where have you been ?
you put me in a terrible spot when we lost contact .
i ' sorry , george .
i lost my glasses .
i 'l see bessie when we get back and have her get you a new pair .
aye , aye , george .

i 've got to talk to my wife first .

ad to lose my best buddy to a frilly female .
i 'll elp you forget .
i 've forgotten an awful lot already .
so long , flatbush .
i 'l never leave you , and i hope you 'll never leave me .
it s always the males who leave in our species .
that 's why there 's so few of us .
in that case , there might be more bfore long .
there , that 's my wife .
not much to look at , is she ?
let 's get this over with , limpet .
hello , bessie .
henry , is that you ?
do n't yu recognie me , bessie ?
henry , you really are ...
a fish ?
yes , bessie , you can say it .
to think you 're actually still alive , and i 'm married to a ...
a fish .
is that so terrible ?
it dos n't happen every day .
well , what 's new ?
i mean , how have you been , bessie ?
i 'm bewildered , henry .
henry , am i the widow of a man or the wife of a fish ?
let 's be logical .
you could n't keep me in a tub , could you ?
i mean , what would the neighbors say ?
i shudder to think .
why ...
oh , good heavens .
if you oly knew , bessie .
i guess this is goodbye , henry .
if you 'll cme up to the steps , i have somethig for you .
remember how you catch cold when you get your feet wet .
do n't break up , bessie .
maybe i was meant to be a fish .
maybe nature just corrcted her error .
goodbye , bessie .
goodbye , henry .
goodbe , hnry , i aid .
i thought that was it .
bessie and i have been happy .
the chief of naval operations ordeed it 
do they really think that henry is teaching porpoises ?
that 's what we 've been assigned to find out .
stickle .
it 's worth a try .
get the old man 
the secretary of defense ordered him to take command of his mission .

isaburo sasahara of the escort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chamberlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see you two duel than merely test swords .
there are rumors in our clan .
the reason you do n't fight is because it would hurt the family of the loser .
perhaps protecting your family name raher than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
isaburo , you 're to attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
i married into my wif 's family and have been henpecked for 20 years .
would yo like to look at the november border record ?
no , not if nothing unsual happened .
making rice cakes in november
but there are no customers
the god who came down in february and brought he rice hrvest departs toorrow until his return next year .
do yu really believe that ?
no , i was just
peraps you want a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is the poblem .
it must be someone she apprves of .
someone strong , loving and faithful .
is that the stewad 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about useless things like martial arts again .
to have te steward honor us with a visit has ever appened in the sasahara family .
the truth s , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been dismissed from the castle .
it has been decided to have her marry yogoro , your son .
steward , why was lady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll return for an answer in a few days .
why should we accept lady ichi ?
in he first place , she
everyone nows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa o rest .
the daughter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in charge of the castle wardrobe , was serving beside him .
lady ichi lost her head on seeing this .
she sprang at lady tama , slapped hr face , and dragged her by the hair .
how can we accept her ?
i think we should graefully accept her without being difficult 
no matter what you say , we must accept hr .
it 's an order from our ord .
i 'm afraid ...
i do n't feel very enthusastic about it .
neiter do i .
bu if i refuse , there may be trouble later .
yogoro has said nothing , but he would n't be happy marrying a lord 's mistress who has borne a cild .
i do n't want him to repeat my mistake .
they said you 'd be at the border .
i heard everything .
the steward and chamberlain are good judges .
alert even in times of peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage and other matters 
i suggst you keep things quiet .
you 'll prbably receive a larger fief .
so be modest about it or the others will think you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordplay ?
but at the lat moment , you skillfully switch from defense to offense .
yet you never attack .
you wait until your opponen tires .
unworthy ?
yes .
we can not accept our lord 's favored lady .
thee 's no need to be so reserved .
it 's happened before , not just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of hat , but even so , i wish to decline the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will not be allowed .
it is our lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wish .
it 's an order !
to decline is to defy the order !
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn .
may you enjoy long life together
we 'll all be at your side as long as you live
this is a day of celebration
keep that in mind .
no .
a woman who was dismissed afte bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n't notice your return .
mother took her along for prayer at shonenji temple .
sh kindly teaches me domestic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father ?
but despite that , he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes , ght away .
you must n't .
the world never seems to go right .
i wish to retire and have yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sorry .
it 's too early o retire , i think , but his son has married , so
so isaburo sasahara 's retiring at last ?
i did n't relize it at the time , but it 's a great relief .
i wonder what i 've done all my life , though it 's not like me to do so .
yogoro 's marriage is a very happy one .
fear often exceeds the perceived danger .
so it was in your case .
yogoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just the same as before , but ichi is lways pleasant and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like yourself , i do n't unestand it either .
check the weapons in the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clan them on appointed days .
i do n't say to always yield to them , but at imes  they 'r unreasonable .
rice cakes ?
enjoy .
wait , ichi .
i 'm going to retire soon .
yogoro will become the head of our family , and you 're his wife .
you need n't hold back for the old woman .
take over the household duties .
understand ?
even so , she is my mothe , and i will treat her as such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understand .
that she 'd grasp her lord by his clothing .
it was hard for me to believe to , so i asked her the other day .
it was the year before last .
ichi .
accept the honor gratefully .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
our lord does not do this just to satisfy a whim .
daimyo must have heirs r their houses will be abolished .
the only heir to our lord riht now is young lod masamoto .
even so , miss ichi , not just anyn can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one day become our lord 's heir .
she must be beautiful and kind like you .
you are referring to sannojo kasai , your fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
then if sannojo agrees , yu will gratefully agree to serve our lord ?
what do you say ?
but h bowed to our ord 's wishes and gave you up ?
so you ad no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
d n't bother me !
no .
you said you would serve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ihi is here in answer to your wishes .
then i thought
no , it was more like a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
many , many sons .
then other girls need never know my misery .
it would end with me .
it was like a prayer .
my thughts were really like a rayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later .
then i went to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord ' orders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i coul never have found a better wife .
beginning tonight ,
what ?
our lord means nothng to me .
i hav been so worried about the son i bore .
so worried .
i will forget abou him too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wait nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would have been better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i rcked our oor brains over this and named her tomi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birth mother to the heir .
if she remains the wife of a vssal , there would be muc talk .
you say this is our lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here ad the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for yogoro to submit a request to our lord and say he will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been t him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
well , i do n't blame him .
but you know very wel ... that we ca n't have all our wishes granted n this world .
group head kotani came over in the fternoon .
but i coud n't bring myself to tell you .
ather is calling you .
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , i must tell you something .
come into the room .
first , father 's words .
he says he 's retired , so i am the family head , and i am to do what i think is right .
however , he also says you 're too important to us to send awa .
that we must take the best possible care of you .
i must ell her sooner or late .
do n't worry .
no matter what anyone says ,
i will not send you bak to the catle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca n't reason with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo  what 's your opinion ?
it 's all up to him .
what is it ?
i 'd like him to come again now and explain in his words why we must return her .
when his son 's mother proves inconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasonable .
he has no understanding of human emotions .
kotani-san , our family did n't accept ichi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself knw yogor or the sasahara family .
she was none too happy about it either .
but the reason they are getting along is because they 're kind to each other and care for each other .
what ?
even if the heavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give up tomi and reurn to the castle ?
would you ruin our family because you 've lost your head over a woman ?
in this case
brother !
i am .
buno , if you were me , would you return ichi ?
of course i ould !
restrain yoursef , buzo .
yogoro 's the head f the family .
right or wrong , it 's all up to him .
if you love yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy such senseless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are a wife worth protecting , even if that means ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't be the end of it .
i gave her the message .
she will be hee soon .
over here , sister .
we 've heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you want to stay with yogoro , even if it means ruining the sasahara amily ?
i would like to stay .
even if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiomi , has asked our lord that you be sent bck to the castle as soon as possible .
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to pead with him to send you back .
he 's done his seveal times .
father is father .
i am me .
i would rathr die than return .
please tell the chamberlains and steward how i feel in whatever words you think will best help my case .
we ask you again , ich !
the family does n't matter ?
not only the sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeopardized as well .
it can not be helped .
i see .
there 's no use trying to convince a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's your misfortune that a woman like her has favored you .
return .
retur to the castle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the sasahara family to you ?
listen to me .
in other words , i 'm a worthless , good-for-nothing man .
so in order to prove myself , for these past 20 years
i have fought to preserve our good name and social standing .
the cruel injustice involved , for oe thing .
but your beautiful lve for each other has touched me most of all .
there 's never been a shred of love in my married life !
no matter what hapens , never leave him !
my husband 's with the chamberlain ?
yes , and he 's waiting for you to come .
i saw him in the castle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you both .
he has some quetions for you .
you need n't wory .
i will accompan you .
if you lose heart ow , what will it mean for m brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
o see tatewaki .
anythig new at the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happens .
she went out .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo , where ' ichi ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter how many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going home .
ichi , take my advice and return to the castle .
if you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain is willing to overlook everything .
but if you insist on returning home , not only will yogoro , but also his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervision of their home .
honorable lad ichi , please return to the castle .
yes .
my name is kiku .
he chamberlain 's oders ?
what orders ?
go home !
but ... if  go home without
say no more !
but
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool 
yogoro .
but he did reuest time off due to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid woman .
then everything 's all over ?
yes .
we just took a roundabout path .
defying the clan gets us nowhere .
isaburo , d you really mean that ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on this matter .
to be honest , the clan 's treatment of your family and your attitude in response have weighed on my mind .
wighed on your mind ?
it 's like your swordplay .
pushe , you step back .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
it was more like force .
in fact , it was more lie kidnapping .
if the shogunate officials in ed hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal mistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow them to end here .
you 're saying i must formally ask the castle to tke her back ?
yet i must ask thm to take her back ?
it was wie of you to hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remember sending her back to the castle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiculous , father !
never !
she suppressed her ters , left everything behind , and quietly returned to the castle .
now , now , yogoro .
in any case , please go for now .
yogoro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will report today and sa he wishes to return her ?
that 's wonderful .
now we ca look forward to the uwa shrine festval tomorrow .
since it would have come to this anyway , how dare they cause all that fuss !
yogoro was wrong , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he 's always henpecked by his wife .
nd defying cln orders like that
i must say he eems like a different man .
his conduct has been admirable .
it call for a slight increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the escort group has arrived !
i 'm glad you 've reported for duty .
yes , completely well .
tking into consideration my father 's wishes , i have decided .
please accept this .
that 's good of you .
thnk you .
fool !
petition .
this is the cruelest form of tyranny .
it rns counter to the laws of humanity and can not be condoned by the heaens .
we hereby appeal for her immediate return .
someone may use my father 's name or my own to submit a request to return ichi to the castle .
but it will not be from us .
please keep that in mind .
thank you for coming very day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at times like these .
so our feet wo n't slip in the blood .
this may be the last time .
will you do me a favor ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accet obediently !
i said orders from our lord !
will you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
orders !
isaburo and yogor sasahara , for your insolent conduct and defiance toward our lord , you are ordered to commit seppuku .
seppuk ?
it is gracious of our lord to permit it .
i thought men would come arrest us and then either ang or crucify us .
father .
however , we want somethng before we kill ourselves .
bring us three heads !
thoe of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler f the aizu domain ,
chamberlai yanase , and steward takahashi .
bring me th heads of the villains who took my son 's wife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear ou are
isabro 's only equal as a swodsman .
if you think he 's too much for you , take four or five strong men with you .
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this is no time to discuss jurisdiction .
you 're wrong .
if you order me to kill them , please promote me to superintendent hre and now and obtain our lord 's promise to increase my fef to 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mind .
go !
we must gather en , us force and ill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsman without peer .
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it ?
ast 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alone .
it 's bunzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the festival drums .
father !
you were pressed by our relatives at kenmotsu 's place t come hre as their mssenger and say ,
we 've efied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
but remember :
each must live his own life .
as for what hapened ,
each must ive his own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
wat if other clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather some men and take care of it yorself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervention would aggravate matters .
father , the drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i remember it too .
outside the castle , it was the inoko festial , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that s as it should be .
it 's not unmanly a all .
but yogoro , do n't be too worried about ichi .
we will die here , but she is the mother of our lord 's eir .
no one can torture her , and no one will edanger her life .
but father , are n't they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter , but the gate was open , so i came in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
we have heard of th order to commit seppuku .
he change his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitude toward our lord , you will be confined at enshoji temple outside the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will yu gratefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's wrong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
i am still the wife of yogoro sasahara .
but our lord received me in his audience .
i do n't understand what this is all about .
steward , it seems we do n't understand what you just told us .
if you two admit that ichi is no longer a family member and that she has been returned , our lord will listen to her plea for a lighter punishment .
will you acknowledge her return and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared fo the worst .
then there is no alternative ?
please return her at once !
i 'll sk lady ichi now .
or will you let their pursuers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , the sasaharas are men .
you have already returned o serve our lord .
if yo tel them that you sever your ties with thm once and for all , then all will be well !
if you do , their lives will be saved .
we need not ask thm to return you .
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save their lives ?
or will you let them die as raitors ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ichi , does your silence mean yu will do as i say ?
am i corrct ?
no .

father ...
tomi , id your father and mother farewell .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are still alive listen to them .
let 's listen to what they want us o do .
no , i know without being told .
they want us to tell the world of our cla 's cruelty !
very well .
i understand .
we promise to do that for you .
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestal !
first , tomi and i will go to edo together and see the shogunate elders .
we 'll leave immediately for edo .
tomi and i are going to edo .
if this i for the clan , show me your pass .
if it 's private business , show me the clan ticket .
i hve either .
then i 'm afraid i can not let you pass .
you mean to pass from this domain without having either ?
i must forbid it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quiet .
i d like to put her in the house away from the wnd .
but men we dislike are in there .
venomous men .
i fed er before dawn .
i do n't think she 's hungry .
we 'll make do wih this .
you be quet now , tomi .
do n't cry even if i o n't return .
let me remain .
it 's better that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
no .
no matter how strong you are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ...
without fail .
i will win without fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance o winning .
take tomi with you to edo .
we ca n't go o edo anymore .
no one ill ever know te stor of your father and moher now .
just one word .
hen you grow up , become a woman just like your mother .
be sure to do that .

theodore ?

girls ?
oh , no.no , no , no , no , no , no , no !

dave ;
alvin !

anyway-
you can follo me on critter !

captain .
alvin :
what 's he going to do , make us walk the pank ?
yes , dave .
uh-hh .
absolutely .
what if we need to disobey you ?
and why would you need to do that ?
now , it would be easy for me to take my trusty old swiss army knife and cut the ropes .
yes , alvin , you do .
what pocket knife are you referring to ?
you could cut yourself .
alvin , there 's no such word as robbae .
and it 's pillaging .
there 's got to be times when you trust us to take matters into our own hands .
i trusted you tonight and look where that got me 
that 's probably just the hot gravy talking .
is it hang gliding , wakeboarding , or bungee jumping ?
shuffleboard .
alvin :
man !
by my calculations , it appears to be 10 % shuffle , 90 % bored .
oh , thans .
you know , dave , i think i 'd prefer the plank .
and i ge to do something i have n't done in a long time .
absolutely nothing .
brittany appoaches her puck , adjusts her stance , looks ver at me , quite annoyed , wonders to herself if i 'm ever going to shut my mouth , realizs i 'm not , and makes her move .
oh !
you can make all the jokes you want , alvin , but not even you can make this nteresting .
oh , really ?
well , care to make it interesting that i can make this interesting ?
simon  the poor guy has n't had a moment 's peace since he mt us .
he 's exhausted .
check this out .
in three , two , on .
but kept the ishment .
it 's word play !
uh-huh .

hey , kid !
that 's a nice-looking kite .
alvin :

all i ever do is try to save him and it oly gets me in touble !
this wo n't end well .
simon , do something !
h , seriously ?
simon , help !

but he is coming , right ?
f course he is .
we hould prepare to stay the night .

us
psdh
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 millio years to go around the galaxy once
the dinosaur era lasted 180 million years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock 
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for the earth ... fas .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not really .
at this time the masters of the earth are dinosaurs .
this is patagonia .
a vast region of argentinean south america as it is today .
and there was only one imense ocean ,
we are north of the south american plate , in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
ome species of ichthyosurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land during the dinosaur era .
in many places there , one walks today on the very ground ths giants walked upon a 100 million years go .
this phenomenon seems to depend on another ecular twist of evolution .
regions that produce great dinosaus also tend to produce great palaeontologists .
many doctoral students come to pursue their research .
sometimes yunger people , like my daughter ludmila , just come to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talking about dinosaurs with everyone , whether they are experts or not .
it 's a busy life , an it would have been plenty fr most people , but early in my career new horizons opened up for me .
things became much larger than lif .
a rancher had stumbled upon a surprisingly large bone .
afte several digging seasons we ended up facing the largest dinosaur ever found .
we named it argentinosaurus
this discovery have a profound effect , on he way we look at south american dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit .
predators and hazards abound 
ony a few will reach adulthood .
it covers more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 million years old .
we believe that it was choen as a nesting site by generation upon generation of these dinosaurs .
the nests are so close together , that the females could not walk between them .
it was warmer than tday .
a great part of the dinosaur era , there were no broad leaf trees and no flower bearing plants .
during the dinosaur era there is no arctic ice caps , and antarctic s sub-tropical .
for tens of millions of years seasos barely changed .
the water of the ocean is also much warmer .
hurricnes ae frequent .
the magnetc poles changes position continuously .
professor coria has contributed to the discovery of more thn a dozen of new dinosaurs .
as a scientist , he insists that each new find is important , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes he says what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hands .
i like to think that i am lucky , just incredibly lucky .
many paleontological discoveries are not made by professionals .
that 's what happened with the argentinosaurus , and it happened again with yet another dinosar .
they were relatively big , so at first , we thought that they belonged to a herbivore , because in general these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
but instead , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a very large one .
professor coria 's team had unveiled a frst species of a group of fierce pedators called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in this grup surpassed the famous t. rex n term of size 
although rare for reptiles , caring for the young has be observed among crocodiles for instance .
in dinosaurs , this caring behaviour evolve enough to remind us of birds .
this baby female is named long tooth .
howevr mall and vulnerable , and cute she may appear now she is genetially programmed to rapidly becom a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like her mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbvore and the largest predator , living at roughly the same period and in the same terriory .
there is no asy answer .
evolution followed a number of partiular paths .
but a simpler interpretation rest on a warm climate and the fertile land , with all the vegetation you can eat .
yet another theory tell us that large herbivores had to grow big enough , to accommodate a large stomach required to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space could have led naturally to argentinosaurus , as the vast seas have led to whales .
the highest brances belong to those who can reach them , and many predators are too small to be threatening in those situation .
she is growing fast too .
her primitive feathers have almost all disappeared .
they thrived for 180 million years .
this is a message or us here .
by the way , it is more than time to introduce harp feathers 
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pound male rapto .
e is related to birds , as are to some extent velociraptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need space .
this is the carmen funes museum , which als happens to be my second home .
soetimes as a joke we say that it is a science filled with holes .
we have onl fond about 700 species of dinosaurs on the whole planet .
this is n't many for a reign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argentna , most of them in the last 30 years .
through technology ou knowledge grows faster every day 
fossilisation i a process that requires extremely rare conditions , and even then very little of an organism is preserved .
we could easily conclude that a tremendous number of species ust disappeared without a trace .
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you also need to be very careful before proposing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish i could travel in time to see these mazing creatures alive .
strong one has reached maturity .
for many scientists he is at full size .
h is 20-year-old , and is at the beginning of more than a century of life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , i they were alone or  a group , if they were wandering , unting , or being hunted
the pattern clearly show association between contemporary species , and this is very rare .
his work is intimately linked to nature  its intimately varied terrain and ever changin climate .
so there were hardships , but ther are moments , sometimes when science jst blend with the pure bliss of being outside and wonderful places .
you just look around .
but finding required a trained eye .
with time you realise tat the number of questions grows faster than the number of answers .
again , like many times before ,
a good hint and an answer came unexpectedly .
in fact , we did n' ind just one secimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at least seven individuals .
for me , and my canadian coleagu phil curry this was pointing at something we had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so lon truth belongs to this new species of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , she is fully grown .
strong one is unknowingly in a critical time .
tearing off pieces of skin and letting the large prey bleed to death , or die from nfection is  stratgy more likely to succeed .
giganotosauru could wait days even weeks between meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep on drifting , the earth begins to resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature never stops changig .
we are in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolution gave it nothing to survive the impending dramatic events .
several factors could hae contributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mammals became bigger and more competitive .
drifting isolated continents touched each other .
new rivalries appeared .
new diseases spred 
the climate was growing colder , possibly because of increased volcanic activity .
the air as unbreathble in many places .
vegetation suffered from the acid rain and ao from the darkened and dst-filled skies .
but still , many dnosaurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the dstance from the moon to the earth in two hours .
all the forest of north and south america are destroyed by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the animals that sfered most .
in a relatively short ime , dinosaurs become history .
not all the dinosaurs disappear 
if they have n't become extinct maybe we just would n't be her .
more discoveries await me here perhaps ut as i move forward in life ,
and the best food in paris , some say , is made by chef auguste gusteau .
gusteau 's restaurant is the toast of paris , booke five months in advance .
he is the youngest chf ever to achieve a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but not everyone celebrates its success .
what 's even moe amusing is that gusteau actually seems to believe it .
i , on the other hand , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
 think it 's apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanill bean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
this is emile , my brother .
he 's easil impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impressed .
he also happens to be the leader of ou clan .
so , what 's wrong with having highly developed senses ?
what 's going on here ?
suddenly , dad did n't think my talent was useless .
clean .
cleanerific .
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad proud .
now , do n't you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble ause .
we 're thieves  dad .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no one wants it , why are we stealing it ?
but to my dad ...
you get picky about wht you put in the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and eat your garbage .
secondy , stay out of the kitchen and away from the humans .
it 's dangerou .
they discover , they create .
how can i describe it ?
good food is like music you can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was right .
o , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally uniqe .
so now i had a secret life .
he only one who knew about it was emile .
hey , emile .
emile .
come on , you 're good at hiding food .
he does n't understand me , but i can be myself around him .
why are you walking like that ?
i do n't want to constantly have to wash my paws .
did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws that we handle ood with ?
yu ever think about what we put into our mouths ?
all the time .
but if dad see you walking like that , he 's not going to like it .
what have you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found cheese ?
and not just any cheese .
that would go beautifully with my mushroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you know , dad 's gon na ...
emile !
tere are posibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this s the real question ...
the key is to keep turning it .
that storm 's getting closer .
hey , rey , you thik that maybe we should n't be so ...
you ot to taste this !
it 's got , like , this ba-boom , zap kind of taste .
do n't you think ?
lightnin-y ?
yeah .
it 's lightning-y !
we got to do that again .
okay , when the next storm comes  we 'll go up on the roof ...
i know what this needs !
saffron .
saffron .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na ake up .
she turns on the cooking channel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been here a million times ?
gusteau swears by it .
okay .
who 's gusteau ?
just the greatest chef in the world .
wrote this cookbook .
you read ?
and they have , which is why i read .
i do n't like secrets .
all this cooking ad reading and tv-watching while we read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's taking those kids so long ?
ah , l'aquila saffron .
italian .
gustau says it 's excellen .
good thing the old lady is a food love ...
forget mystique .
great cooking is not for the faint of heart .
you must be imaginative , strong hearted .
you must try thngs that may no wrk .
and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from .
anyone can cook .
but only the fearless can be great .
gusteau s restaurant lost one o is five strs after a scahing review b france 's top food crtic , anton ego .
it was a severe blow to gusteau , and the brkenhearted chef died shortly afterwards , which , according to tradition , meant the loss of another sar .
oh !
oh !
oh !
run !
no , you 'll lead her to the colony !

where do you get the gall to even attempt something so monumenally idiotic ?
i should have you drawn and quartered !
i 'll do it .
larousse , draw and quarter this man after you put him in the duck press to squeze the fat out of his head .
what are you blathering about ?
the soup !

solène leclaire .
she likes the soup .
wait .
someone is asking about your soup .
what are you playing at ?
am i still fird ?
you ca n't fire him .
what ?
if she write a review to that effect and find out yo fired the coo responsible ...
he 's a garbage boy .
how can we clai to represent the name of gsteau f we do n't upold his most cherished belief ?
he ha taken a bold risk and we should reward that , as chef gusteau would have .
oh , yeah .
you will make the sop again , and this tim , i 'll be paying attention .
very clos attention .
they think ou might be a cook .
but you know what i think , linguini ?
get the rat .
what should i do now ?
kill it .
no , no in the kitchen .
they 'd close us down .
take it away from here .
kill it .
go !
do n't look at me like that !
they expect me to cook it again !
i mean , i 'm not ambitious .
i was just trying to stay out of trouble .
you 're the one who was getting fancy with the spices !
what did you throw in tere ?
oregano ?
i need this job .
i 've lost so many .
di you od ?
have you been nodding ?
so i 'm not crazy !
wait a second , wait a second .
you can , righ ?
look , do n't be so modest .
you 're a rat , for pete 's sake .
whateer you did , they liked it .
do you think yu could do it again ?
right ?
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not much , but it 's , you know ...
there 's heat ad light and a couch with a tv .
he best kind of dream .
one e can share .
but why here ?
why now ?
morning , little chef .
idiot !
i let a rat into my place and tell him what 's mine is his !
stupid !
he 's stolen food and hit the road !
that 's what i get for trusting a ...
hi .
is that for me ?
look , it s delicious .
but do n't steal .
i 'll buy some spices , oka ?
and on the irst day !
though i , like many other critic ,
had written off gusteau as rrelevant since the great chef 's death ,
the soup was a revelation .
solène leclaire ?
aginst all odds , gusteau 's has recaptured ou attention .
only time will tell if they deserve it .
well ...
you know .
welcome to hell .
now , recreate the soup .
take s much time as you ned .
soup .
you little ...
you son of a ...
something that does n't involve any biting , or nipping , or running up an down my body with your little rat feet .
the biting !
scampering !
no !
no scampering or scurrying .
little chef ?
oh , you 're hungry .
okay .
so lt 's think this ut .
we need to work out a system so that i do what you want in a wy that does n't look like i 'm being controlled by a tiny t chef .
would you listn to me ?
i 'm insane !
i 'm insan !
i will never pull this off !
linguini ?
we got t communicate .
i saw it !
a rat ?
yes , a rat .
what are you doing in here ?
get out .
that was close .
whoa !
how did you do that ?
that 's strangely involuntary !
one look and i knew we had the same crazy idea .
okay .
huh ?
where are you taking me ?
i 'm sorr .
whoa !
mmm-hmm ...
okay .
whoa !
whoa !
à votre santé !
al right .
mmm .
but you 'll need to know more than soup if you are to srive in my kitchen , boy .
listen , i just want you to know hw honored i am to be studying under such ...
no !
how many women do you see in this kitchen ?
well , i ...
only m .
why do you think that is ?
because haute cuisine is an antiqated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid old men .
but still i 'm here .
how did this happen ?
because i am the toughest cook in tis kitcen .
got it ?
wow !
gusteau makes chinese food
gusteau 's corn puppies .
bite size .
hat are corn dogs ?
cheap sausages dipped in batter and eep fried .
cheap sausages dipped in batte and deep fried .
you know , american .
whip something up .
or as a big ear of corn in doggie make-up .
yes .
well , the will stipulates that if after a period of two years from the date of death no heir appears ,
gusteau 's business interests will pass to his sous chef .
you .
what i want to know is if this letter ...
if this boy changes anything !
there 's no resemblance at all .
he is not gusteau 's son .
gusteau had no children , and what of the timing o all this ?
highly suspect !
this is gusteau 's ?
yes , yes , yes 
of course .
she claims she never told him , r gusteau  and asks that i not tell .
why you ?
only a job ?
if he works here , you 'll be able to keep an eye on him while i do a little digging .
find out how much of this is real 
i will need you to collect some dna samples from the boy .
ark my ords .
the whole thing is highly suspect .
he knows something .
relax , he 's a garbage boy .
what are you doing ?
i 'm cuting vegetables .
you think cookig is a cute job , like mommy in the kitchen ?
what is this ?
when the meal rush comes , what will happen ?
disaster .
keep your station clear , or i will kill you !
your sleeves look like you threw up on them .
like this .
see ?
always return to this position .
sharp utensils , hot metal , keep your arms in .
i memorize all his recipe .
follow the recipe .
no , no , no .
ow do you tell how good bread is without tasting it ?
liste .
symphony of crackle .
the only way to get the best produce is to have first pick of the day and there are only tw way to get first pick .
grow it yourself , or bribe a grower .
and then he get fired for messing around with the ringmaster 's daughter .
horst has done time .
what for ?
i robbed the second largest bank in france using only a ballpoint pen .
i created a hole in the ozone over avignon .
which resistance ?
he wo n't say .
apparently , they did n't win .
so ou see .
we are artist , pirate .
more than cooks are we .

we really did it tonight .

am i in trouble ?
trouble ?
he 's gotten all he needs .
i just took it to be polite .
of couse you do n't .
but you would have to be an idiot of elephantine proportions not to apprecia this '61 château latour .
remy !
i ca n' believe it !
you 're alive !
you made it !
i thought i 'd never see you guys again !
we figured you did n' survive the rapids .
i do n't really know .
what ?
no brother of mine eats rejectamenta in my town .
you are stealig ?
you told linguini he could trust you .
it 's for my brother .
which means i would , too .
it 's under control , okay ?
more wine ?
okay .
train ?
surely you do n't expect me to believe this is your first time cooking ?
it 's not .
 knew t !
fifth time .
but i 've taken out the garbage lots of times before that ...
do you like animals ?
what ?
wat kind ?
the usual , dogs , cats , horses , guinea pigs , rats .
i brought you something to ...
i have got to teach you about food .
no !
see ?
not really .
oh , i 'm detecting nuttiness .
now taste this .
okay .
okay .
it might be te nuttines .
see ?
could be the tang .
now , imagine every great taste in the world being combined into infinite combinations .
you lost me again .
yeah .
but that was interesting .
hey !
dad does n't know you 're alie yet !
we 've got to go to the colony !
yeah !
what 's more important here ?
well , i ...
it would n't hurt to visit .
have you had a pet rat ?
did you work in a lab with rats ?
no .
perhaps you lived in squalor at some point ?
you know something about rats 
you know you o !
you know who know do whacka-doo .
hey !
what ?
ratatouille .
it 's like a stew , right ?
hy do they call it that ?
if you 're going to name a food , you should give it a name that sounds delicious .
ratatouille does n't sound delicious .
it sounds like rat and patootie .
rat patootie .
which doe not sound delicious .
and finding someone to replace you for poison checker has been a disaster .
nothing 's been poisoned , thank god , but it has n't been easy .
i am sorry , dad .
why is that ?
it 's tough out there in the big world all alone , is n't it ?
sure , but it 's not like i 'm a kid anymore .
hey .
what 's up ?
visit ?
i will .
i promise .
often .
it 's not a big deal , dad .
i just ...
eventually , a bird 's ot to leave the nest .
we 're rats .
we make them bigger .
i 'm tired of taking .
i want to make things .
oh , yeah ?
what makes you so sure ?
 've been able to observe them at a close-ish sort of range .
yeah ?
how close ?
close enough .
and they 'r , you know , not so bad as you say they are .
come with me .
i got something i want you to see .
you want me to stay and clean ?
is that a problem ?
no .
good by .
we 're here .
the world we live n belongs to the enemy .
what ?
no .
can only be more of this ?
you ca n't change nature .
change is nature , dad .
the part that we can influence .
and it starts when we decide .
where you going ?
with luck , forward .
hey !
yeah .
stop it .
good morning .
that 's big .
that 's big .
what , yu ca n't tell me ?
oh !
fogive me for intruding on your deep , personal relationshp with the chef .
oh , i see how it is .
you get me to teach you a few kitchen tricks to dazzle the boss and then you blow past me ?
wake up .
i did n't have to help you !
but ...
i wanted you to succeed .
i liked you .
my mistake .
colette .
wait , wait .
i ca n't do it anymore .
wait , wait !
look , i 'm no good with words .
at least not without your help .
i hate false modesty .
it 's just another way to lie .
you have talent .
no , but i do n't !
it 's not me .
what do you mean ?
i mean , i would n't have done that .
i would 've followed te recipe .
i would 've followed your advice to the ends of the earth .
because i love your advice .
but ...
bt i ...
do n't do it .
i have a secret .
what ?
you have a rash ?
i have this ...
little ...
a tiny chef ?
yes .
he 's ...
he 's up here .
here we go .
you inspire me .
i 'm going to risk looking lik the biggest idiot psycho you 've ever seen .
you want to know why i 'm such a fast learner ?
do n't laugh !
no !
no !
what is it , ambrister ?
gusteau 's .
more financial trouble ?
no , it 's ...
announced a new line of microwave egg rolls ?
wht ?
i said , gusteau has finally found his rightful place in history
right alongside another equally famous chef ,
touché .
that was my last word .
the last word .
then tell me , ambrister , how could it be popular ?
the dna matches , the timing works , everything checks out .
this ca n't just happen !
the whole thing is a setup !
te boy knows !
look at hm out there , preteding to be an idiot .
string ?
playing dumb .
taunting me with that rat .
dliberately trying to make me think it 's important .
the rat .
exactly !
is the rat impotant ?
of course not !
he just wants me to think that it is .
and no he wants me to see it everywhere .
ooh !
no , it is n't , it 's here !
am i seeing things , am i crazy ?
is there a phntom rat or is here not ?
but , h , no !
i refuse to be sucked into his litte game of ...
about you ?
i ca n't fire him .
he 's getting attention .
if i fire him now , everyone will wonder why .
is n't it good to have the press ?
is n't it good to have gsteau 's name getting headlines ?
not if they 're over his face !
gusteau 's already has a face , and i 's fat and lovable and familiar .
and it sells burritos !
millions and millions of burritos !
no , no , no .
well , because you ...
rat !
disgusting little creatres .
how the world really saw me .
and it just kept getting better .
remy !
remy !
hey , hey , hey , little brother !
you told them ?
emile , that 's exactly what i said not to do !
but you know these guys .
they 're my friends .
i did n't think you meant them .
look , i 'm sorry .
do n't tell e you 're sorry , tell them you 're sorry .
it 's locked ?
hmm ...
okay .
emile shows up with ...
i told him ...
he goes and blabs to ...
yeah , it 's a disaster .
anyway , they 're hugry , the food safe is locked and i need the key .
they want you to steal food ?
yes .
no !
no !
it 's complicated .
they do n't have your ideals .
ideals ?
o , tooth , i say , tooth pick ' n chicken ?
about as french as a corn dog !
coming soon !
we 're inventing new ways to sell ut over here .
can you guys shut up ?
word 's getting out .
hey .
mind if i ...
linguini ?
why would linguini be filed with your will ?
this used to be my office .
he 's your son ?
i have a son ?
i am a figment of your imagination .
you did not know , how could i ?
well , your son is the rightful owner of this restaurant !
sorry , chef .
the rat !
it 's stolen my documents !
it 's getting away !
chef !
you !
he 's not in your office .
you are in his .
bottoms up , linguini !
cheers , ja .
chef !
chef !
what is the secret to your genis ?
secret ?
i am gusteau 's son .
but you were n't aware of that fact until very recently .
and it resulted in your taking onership of this restaurant .
how did you find out ?
the gusteau part ?
inspiration has many names .
mine is named colette .
something 's stuck in my teeth .
health inspector .
i wish to report a rat infestation .
first opening is three months .
it 's a gourmet restaurat !
monsier , i have the information .
if someone canels , i 'll slot you in .
but the rat !
you must ...
it 's past opening time .
he hould have finished an hour ago .
onjour , ma chérie .
join us .
e were just talking about my inspiration .
yes , he cals it his tiny chef 
not that , dearest .
i meant you .
it 's him .
ego ?
anton ego !
is that ego ?
you are monsieur linguini ?
hello .
pardon me for interrupting your premature celebration , but i thought it only fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game .
game ?
yes .
and you 've been playing without an opponent .
which is , as you may have guessed , against the rules .
you 're anton ego .
if i do n't love it , i do n't swallow .
listen , we hate to be rude , but we 're french , and it 's dinnertime .
do n't give me that look .
you were distracting me in front of the press .
how am i supposed to concentrate with you yanking o my hair all the time ?
your opinion is n't the only one that matters here .
all right , that  it !
you take a break , little chef .
i 'm not your puppet , and you 're not my puppet-controlling guy !
you cool off and get your mind right , little chef .
ego is oming , and i need to focus !
you stupid ...
i have never seen that before .
you know what ?
i 've been selfish .
are you kidding ?
e 'll go after closing time .
in fact ...
yeah 
this is great , son .
an inside job .
oof !
ey , little chef .
then when you were n't there , i do n't know ...
it did n't seem right to leave things the way that we did , so ...
look , i do n't want to fight .
i 've been under a lot of , you know , pressure .
i 'm suddenly a guseau .
and i got to be a gstau or , you know , people will be disppointed .
i have n't been fair to you .
you 've never faile me , and i should never forget that .
you 've been a good friend .
the most honorable friend a guy coul ever ask ...
what 's going on ?
hey ...
you 're ...
you 're stealing food ?
i thought you were my friend !
i trusted you !
get out !
you and all your rat budies !
we are what we are , and we 're rats .
steal all you want .
i 've lost my appetite .
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
come in !
you are the boss .
attention , everyone .
toight is a big night .
i mean , ego .
the critic .
and he 's going to order something .
just ca n't leave it alone , can you ?
it 's not safe .
i 'm hungry !
observe .
no , wait !
oh , no !
no , no !
you might think you are a chef but you are still only a rat .
sure he took away a star last time he reviewed this place .
sure it probably killed ...
ad .
this is very bad juju right here .
ego is here .
ego ?
he is here ?
anton ego is just another customer .
let 's cook !
yeh !
okay .
au revoir , rat !
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
yes , i think i do .
after reading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook , you know what i 'm craving ?
a little perspective .
can you suggest a good wine to go with that ?
very well .
you provide the food , i 'll provide the perspective .
which would go nicely wit a bottle of cheval blanc 1947 .
i 'm afraid i ...
tll him to hit me with his best shot .
why do you sy that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 've given up 
as yu are .
oh , please .
i pretend you exist so i have someone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in her !
what the ...
dad !
where are ou going ?
they 'll fail without me .
why do you care ?
because i 'm a cook !
it 's your recipe .
i did n't write it down .
it just came to me .
because we ca n't serve this !
where 's my order ?
ca nt we serve something else ?
something i did n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we just opened .
i have another idea .
what if we serve them what they rder !
we ill make it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the customers something .
then tell them ...
tell them ...
rem .
we 're not talking about me .
we 're talking about what to do right ...
rmy !
get my kife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ..
well , the truth sonds insane sometimes .
but that does n't ean it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i have no talent at all .
but this rat , he 's the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding under my toque .
he 's been controlling my actions .
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's exciting everyone .
i know it 's a hard thing to believe .
we can be the greatest restaurant in paris , and this rat , this brilliant little chf , can lead us there .
what do you say ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ca n't choose between two halves of myself .
 'm not talking about cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
you tel us what to do , and we 'll get it done .
stop that health inspector !
delta team , go , go , go , go !
the rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be hadling fish .
team four , roasted items .
team six , sauces .
get to your stations .
those handling food will walk on two legs .
i 'm sorry for any delay , but we 're a little shot tonight 
please , take all of the time you need .
make sure that steak is nice and tenderizd .
easy wit that sole meunière .
only use the mimolette cheese 
compose the salad like you were painting a picture .
do n't let that beurre blanc separate .
gently poach the scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
just tell me what the rat wants to cook .
it 's a peasant dish .
i am making ratatouille .
they must be joking .
mmm .
no , it ca n't be .
i demand to know !
i asked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight .
then who do i thank for the meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wsh to meet the chef , you wll have to wait until all the other customer have gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he des n't react beyond asking an occasional question .
and when the story is done , ego stands , tanks us for the meal ...
we risk very little , yet ejoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves o our judgment .
we thrive n negative critiism , which is fun to write and to read .
the world is often unkind to new talent , new creations .
the new needs friends .
last night , i experienced something new , an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source .
but i realie only now do i truly understand what he meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a great artist can come from anywhere .
it is difficult to imagine more hmble origins than those of the genius ow cooking at gusteau 's , who i , in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the finest chef in france .
i will be returning to gustau 's soon , hungry for more .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a great night .
well , we had to let skinner and the health inspector loose  and of course they ratted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n't feel too bad for him .
he seems very happy .
how do you know ?
got to go .
do n't you always ?
which one would you like ?
the ity of townsville is in some serious serious , serious trouble !

-and we learned things .
-and we played tag !
we need to talk about something .
-yep , what 's up , daddy-o ?
well , it 's your super powers .
i 'm not sure how to say this but i do n't think you should use them in ublic anymore .
why ?
and unfortunately , people often get cared or angry when they do n't understand something special or unique .
that 's silly .
i think so o , but nonetheless , take it easy wih the powers tomorrow .
things will be fine .
so i 'll be waiting here to pick you up when school gets out , okay ?

you guys , my kids .
i ca n't just leave them there alone .
he 's not coming .

no , he probably just got held up , or maybe the car broke or maybe he forgot or maybe he hates us .
the devastation ?
devastating .
t should be illegal .
used to be a time when you could buy an hnest pickle .
they were lighting up the sky .
th kind that you can only find at a pickle cart .

-good job , but we 've go ta save --
-the baby !
holy ... .
wait !
can we find the professor now , please ?
oh , man !
now stay !
this is hopeless 
i know .
ther 's too many monkeys .
what can we do ?
and the dog .
he could n't -- oh , man !
-i am ?
yeah .
the one way to stop the monkeys , save the town and find the professor is to use our powers to --
better yet , watch !
-that was amaz-
grss !
cut it out .
good one , bubbles .
-girls --
-shut up !
i was afraid of this .
come .
ou will make a good power-poof vst .
-none of those monkeys had profesor !
-where could he be ?
come on , girls !
look at the little heroes here to save their daddy !
no , gils !
-sorry , professor !
-we can take this chump chimp down !
that 's better .
it 's ood you litte freaks know when you 're beaten .
i have to seize cntrol of an area and force its inhabitants to follow my way of thinking !
even if it means taking extreme measures !
-you would n't !
now i am more mojo than before !
now , as i was saying before i ws so rudely interrupted i , mojo jojo , have succeeded in my first , greatest and most brilliant pln ever !
nd i , mojo jojo shall be king !
now let 's get out of this town !
-it 's no use .
well , now it 's time for everyoe to nderstand .
surrender now , and we 'll go easy on you !
down here !
you 're actually trying to stop me ?
that 's so cute !
-we will stop you !
who are you caling cute ?
okay , let 's play !
buttercup !
-that more mojo is no more !
somebody 's mad .
look out !
i have an idea .
-do you think he 's finished ?
-no , but you are !
fools !
you dare to challenge me ?
try to destroy me ?
i , who saved you from certain death ?
after all i 've done for you , you betray me ?
and why ?
the ones who hated you ... .
none of them will ever understand you as i can .
for we are kindred spirits , whose powers spring from the same source .
so , girls , do not make me destroy you .
we are invincible 
we have the power !
all we have to do is work together .
girls , join me .
we 'd never join you , and it 's because we are stronger .
-because we are invincible .
we have to protect them from you !
ou are evil !
and you are it !
girls , you were rigt !
we should stop mojo , and i know how !
i whipped up an antidote to chemical x !
we love you too !
-and we 're really sorry .
-we messed u really bad .
-but we 're ready , professor .
if it was n't for them , none of this would have happened .
and maybe everyone would like us more if we were just normal little girls .
no !
irls , i think what he mayor is trying to say is we 're sorry , and thank you .
yes , that was super , just super !
-amazing !
tupendous !
you rok !
thak you .
can we , professor ?
okay , but only if it 's befre your bedtime .
help !
sugar , spice and everything nice .
these were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl .
but professor utonium accidentally added an extra ingredient to the mix :
chemical x .
using their ultra sper powers , they 've dedicated their lives to fighting crime and the forces of evil .
the powerpuff girls !
hey , that 's a good name for them .
powerpuf girls , yeah !
i like that .
powerpuff girls !
it all began when the silene of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound .
it was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungle .
it was a man cub !
i would 've obeyed my fist impulse and walked away .
then t occurred to me .
oh , i knew there 'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal instinct , but ...
ten imes the rains had come and gone .
he was a favourite of all the young wolf cubs of the pack .
no man cub was ever happier .
and yet , i knew that someday ... he would have to go back to his own kind .
shere khan will surely kill te boy and all who try to protect him .
now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy 's father .
rama .
uh , come over here , please .
the man cub can no longer stay with the pack .
leave ?
there is no oher way .
but-
but , rama , even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger .
perhaps i can be f help .
you , bagheera ?
how ?
i know of a man village where he 'll be safe .
mowgli and i have taken many walks into the jungle together , s i 'm sure he 'll go wih me .
so be it .
now thre 's no time to lose .
should n't we start back home ?
mowgli , this time we 're not going back .
i 'm taking you to a man village .
because shere khan has returned to this part of the jungle .
and he has sworn to kill you .
kill me ?

well , maybe so .
we 'll spend the night ere .
things will look better in the morning .

every time he bat those long eyelashes of his , it 's just a ay to bring down the hammer on our success 
he even makes really embarrasing things look really , really cute .
ready , girls ?
let 's do this .
ok , here we go .
ok .
be quiet .
nd she 'd read me a story
it always was about a princess in distress
and how a guy would save her
and end up with the glory
i 'd lie in bed and think about
sittin ' in a dark .
cold .
dusty cellar
to come and set e free
oh .
i will survive i know somebody 's on my side
do n't wan na be no .
i 'd rather rescue myslf
i can slay my own dragons
my knight in shining armour
is me
so i 'm gon na set me free
i do n't wan na be like inderella
cold .
dusy cellar
for a handsome prince to come and save me
oh .
i will survive i know somebody ' o my side
sittin ' in a dark .
cold .
dusty cellar
waitin ' for somebody
i do n't wan na be like omeone waiting
for a handsome prince to come and save me
oh .
do n't wan na be no .
no one else
drinka ?
drinka , you still there ?
drinka ?
tell them .
i 'm all right .
i will survive .
it 's just that ... when i see you girls , i see myself .
sing it , girl .
you 're the only one i been dreamin ' of ...
you got ta slow down the dsco fever , drinka .
when i see you girls , i see , like , little drinka clones .
galleria , when i look at ou ,
i see a biracial , hip-hoppin ' version of me .
i se a hot , latin , spicy version of me .
and aqua , when i look at you ,
i see myself as if i was frm the sassy south .
if you were what ?
everyone else does .
dorinda 's like me if i was shrimpy and white .
oh , yes , honey .
you are in .
but , drinka , like , do we actually have a chance of winning ?
yes .
well , how you doin ' ?
i see that talent show bnner outside , and  wan na e back walking ' these halls .
i still keep my hand in the community .
the jackal keeps it real .
and i hae n't seen this much talent on that stage since my graduation .
and now i 'd like to talk to you ladie abut the next step in your career .
you see ,
and i thnk that thing might just have spots .
let ' get down there .
w have spots .
cheetah girls ' manager , kid salsa .
pucci !
chanel , get your brother out of here .
hello , jackal johnon .
i 'm galleria garibaldi .
i also wrote cinderella , which i hope to record for you in the near future .
excllent .
excellent .
so let 's set something up .
schedule .
you se , singing is just ome , like , fun side thing for our girls .
they 're not professionals .
mom .
he s one of the iggest record producers of my time , mother .
i read .
jackal johnson .
yes , jackal johnson .
yes , of course .
i 'm gon na take us all out to eat , ok ?
come on .
just in case , there 's my card .
your mom 's no joke .

bye , mr johnson .
thanks for droppin ' me off .
i live right here .
oh , good .
ok .
dorinda seems like a real nice girl .
the only thing e know is she has a little sister .
do n't spoil this day because you did n't get all you wanted .
at this rate , you 're hedd straight to your room .
you 'll be just as talented after colege .
50 times over .
then you would not have the time to study , you would n't have the grades to get in , and that , my dear , is what you call a paradox .
some colleges do n't even look at grades .
some people do n't even go to college .
franco ?
papa , tell her i 'm ot a knucklehead .
tell her i 'm not a pazza .
but you know what ?
you have to listen to your mother 's advice .
silly people do silly thins , mom .
i get good grades .
strong bones and teeth .
ma , it 's not fair that we do n't get to talk to jackal .
honey , i think dorothea 's instincts are right on this one , ok ?
i mean , you do n't need to be working with this jackal 
all that pltinum and those heavy chains .
i mean , luc ...
oh !
he is always on ..
ma , can you not talk about luc for one second ?
i 'm really upset here .
really .
an i know what 's gn na cheer you up .

nope .
shopping .
ok .
yes .

wht do you think about paris ?
mm-hm .

hold on , bubbles .
oh , i 'll think about it , all right .
oh , my god , bubbles , thank goodness it 's you .
my life is over .
she wo n' even let me call jackal 
well , ou know what ?
ok ?
o n't they know tht our futures are right here ?
bela .
you bat those long eyelashes , and i say yes evry time .
no , franco , she 's too young .
i have made so may mistakes in my life , and i 'm determined not to have our daughter make the same mistkes i did .
she 's not going to make the same mistakes .
but what if her dreams fall apart ?
cara .
no one is ever ready for their dreams to fall apart .
but when she 's older , we 're not going to be there to hel her ut them back together .
it 's sick .
she dangled a shopping rip in my face , and then lowered the boom .
well , you know what ?
wait a second .
hold on .
your moher an i ...
girl , hold on .
hold on .
than you .
thank you so much .

you were all i wrote the song 'cinderella ' and i 'm the founder of the cheetah girls .
yadda , yadda , yadda .
you know i did n't mean it that wy .
i was just tryin ' to get i there before my mom does .
thank you very much .

cheetah power .

make the meeting .
soak your feet later .
girls , what do you say we take a tour of your new home , while we wait for the other divette to make her entrance ?
that 's a bad first impression for jackal .
it 's business , drling .
i know it 's business , mom .
excuse me , sr .

do n't mess with texas .
jackal johnson , i am so sorry that i 'm late .
yo should 've seen the traffic .
yes .
i 'm sure this can wait .
this is jackal johnson .
i 'm sure he 's a very busy man .
it 's o now , bubbles .
he 's never gon n work with us now .
but i got to pull it together .
when it boils down , that 's what being a leader is all about .
thanks for having my back , chuchie .
you 're the one .
yeah , i 'm fine .

mama , no , we do n't .
they have to tweak it ...
mom , no .

it 's a lot to do .
this is just one teensy-weensy little demo .
it 's not a soundtrack album .
all i need is one clean take , and then the bells and whistles happen right here .
so ...
we 'll e her .
that 's what i like to hear .
bam !
off the cheetah-meter .
yeah , and now the talent show 's down the drain .
drinka will understad .
if jackal says we 're ready , then we must be ready .

global getdown is a worldwde marketing miracle .

they 're puppets 
i mean , now at least we could be down for the tent show .
and if we win , e can still have our demo .
do n't front , bubbles .
no you 're al gung ho for the talent show ?
maybe we need to do it this way first , so we can get our shot .
he knows te business .
it 's a job singing , dancing , and making people happy .
what 's wrong with that ?
it 's not your song , so you wan na walk .
you 're just mad because he wo n't do your material , right ?
our material , not that all around the world nonsense he was playing .
we make our decisions together 
you 're just one person , and you 're not the boss of everything .
to make our dreams come true .
i wish i could believe in you , galleria , i really do , but lately you 've been all about you .
i ca n't ...
we ca n't trust you any more .
oh .

i mean  they want fame .
and then there are ways .
and i want fame the cheetah girls way .

oh , sweethart .
i tried so hard to protect you from gettng your dreams crushed .
and let he people you love make their own choices .

i 'm living on the ...
k !
stick to your role !
what wa all that nonsense ?
just testing what eetu 's got in hm
he 's in top form .
no need to test him
these are the tactics for sunday :
everyone will be bunched up on the first few circuits
after 100 km or so , the pace should pick up
the steep climb at the end makes the race really tricky
and you with your famous sprint , break away on the last stretch
you 'll handle th kylmälä climb , huh ?
what kid of an answer is that ?
i did n't ask you
this is your big break
what if i had a chance too ?
just think , if we quit , we could concentrate on training
more or less
jons !
delivery to the cable factory !
looks like i 'll soon be pedaling the streets myself my guys are already working like hell
k signing in !
very god ...
i promise .
bye
o.k .

tough sport
ad you ?
15 thousand a year
i do n't know
the new address is ...
hi
hae you worked out the tactics for sunday ?
yup .
and i will
unless your chain breaks , like lst time
k !
the pool will close soon .
what are you talking about ?
your mania for statistics
you 've got to keep notes so you can time yourself right
is n't that what coaches are for ?
you have to prove your skills if you want to succeed
fucking hell , i 've had enough of this
while others are training down south , we 're stuck in the backwoods
we 've got o get on the national team , this season
jesus , is that your attitude ?
if i 'm assisting you , i want to be sure you 're serious
of corse i am .
of course not .
the 0pen division district championsips are about to start
these young riders will race 175 km on a 25 km circuit ... just when i fell asleep , they started at the fire station
i must have been the fifth time the sirens went off ...
... the final climb on the route is a real killer
eetu !
did you ask her to come ?
of course
we have a rough job ahead of us .
you know what she said about you ?
what ?
let 's concentrate while we 're all charged up
we 'll see how the chain mates with their fresh team will ...
running out of drink
i 'll get you some soon
want to win or not ?
we ca n't give in
coach will go berserk if we let them get away
k !
wait !
0nly 100 metes to the finish , we have mattson still in the lead
naakka puls past in the nick of time .
to everyone 's surprise
the third man in is valve from kiffn
congratulations .
nineteen
you seem ike a serious racer .
more serious than those clowns
i 'm setting up the national team for under twenty-ones in the fall
you might fit in the team .
sounds good
see you at the ationals
who would have eer guessed ?
but you dropped out .
eetu , there 's no excuse for screwing p
shut up , princess , or you 're canned
shit , what a loser !
give it a brek .
it 's 50 km to home
you forgot your trophy
congratulations .
just a district championship .
in honor of your first victory
that 'll do
your resting pulse is 42 .
how can it be so low ?
but your stress pulse is just about as high as it can get
t should n't go over 210 .
slow down a bit .
nice work !
sory about losing it after the race .
forget it .
i quit
i 've had enough bullshit from mr .
ski
you a n't quit now .
we can go some other time
for two years i 've been helping you
now it 's my chance , and you quit the team
you 've still got mika and jani .
stuck in the peloton forever
no !
i 'm going for a spin tonight ayhow .
i expect you 're coming too
why ould you want to ride with a loser like me ?
eetu searching for k !
k receiving
k. i 'll come for a spin
but i wo n't have anything to do with mr .
ski
why are you here ?
eetu asked me to come .
yup .
i can leave , if yo insist
we 'll just have to take it easy
no need to hold back becase of me
k !
let 's get charged .
a good idea
she 'll either come or she wo n't
did you notice , last fall i was in the same shape as you 're in now
i knew i was in top form
yet i 'd build up the lactics ay too easily
especially when climbing
started working on my ability to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics were boiling
sounds exremely rough
it was , for months
ten suddenly a week ago- a breakthrough !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i won he race
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance our team has
ok .
on three conditions :
neither of yo blows the other 's chances .
some program he 's been on all spring !
if i 'd used the same method , i 'd already be on the national team
you do n't mind that your best friend kept suc a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat im once more- he would have kiled himself .
it can be a good thing .
taking things seriously
eetu !
coach agreed we could train together for the nationals
i 've qui .
maybe i would be a healthy change
no one ased you !
would we use your method ?
lf you want
in that case , count me in
ff to bed early !
hevy session tomorrow
oona !
is he a total moron ?
this is similar to th 25 route the nationals will be raced on this yer
i thought we were using your method
o.k .
each round i 'll join you on the climb
drive me as hard as you can .
like it 's the nationals
ready for a road kill ?
you 're minte behind on this round
how 's it going ?
not bad
i 'd prefer eetu alive tonight
s you came to pay nurse .
hav a problem with cycling women ?
y first childhood emory is watching my mom win the nationals
i 've seen cycling women before
nice sannino .
hey , i do n't need a coach
but your body is perfect for cycling
i mean it .
is that just a professional remark ?
last year in vaasa , remember ?
i was a zmbie afterwards
i see
yeah , but oona ad i had planned to go kayaking tonight
looks like i 'm too weak to hold a paddle
yup .
if he goes on with your method , he 'll soon be god for nothing
it 's only temporary .
he 'll soon be back on the ball
it 's just that i booked us a kayak .
i could fill in
i 'll be fie on my own .
no , no .
i can come
well .
why not .
where and wht time ?
i 'll be there
got the entrance exam in july
it 's just hard to find time for readig
i am
at the beginning focus on acing
the strength omes years later
yeah , yeah
same as in cycling , keep your body relaxed
now you 're telling me how to cycle , as well ?
arms stretched out
you lost i again .
concentrae .
are all cyclists that stiff ?
for god 's sakes , shut up !
god .
i 've figured it out
kind of far for a beginner
you think i 'm not fit enough ?
no , but ... shit , no !
where ?
directly behind us !
where to ?
shit !
my treat .
hi .
two beers
beer .

ah well .
he 's a nice guy .
absolutely .
you have a girlfriend ?
such a bautiful night .
sweet dreams .
up .
how 's coaching coming along ?
very well .
eetu 's realy getting there
oh , are they going steady ?
she 's ... a human being
what if i sewed all three of you some nice cycling shirts ?
silk and elegance .
why not , if you feel like it .
and breasts ?
they 're there
but what size ?
it 's important with a cycling hirt
have n't measured them !
an average girl with average breast sounds promising
hey , cut it out !
man and ape descend from the same ncestors
man easily adjusts to hot climates
causes of death vary greatly cell which often stays inactive throughout its life cycle muscles start at the rdius ...
listen , here comes a sure bet
seemingly lacking a will , yet abe to react to- somatic and psychologicl change rapidly , unexpectedly ...
k calling eetu !
eetu receiving
are you exhausted ?
on the contrary , i feel great !
so what 's next ?
if it 's up to me , we could even tighten up
remember when the team from järvenpää went training in the mines ?
oona receivin .
what mine ?
look out for the boat !
should we check it out ?
we need headlamps or something .
everyone shut up  or you 're dead !
k calling oona !
by the bay
can you stop by the tennis courts ?
sixty seconds .
over !
stop saing over 
check the out .
the biological background of man
they can both be classified as tropical diurnal anials
but in the cold he needs facilites such as clothes to suvive
hey !
last warning .
the next to speak gets fired
k. there 's a job for you at the national theater ... through the back , second window on the right .
no buzzer , of course
i 'm in for the nationals next week .
it may be good that yo came
there 's an od murmur in your heart
the heart is a strange organ , though .
making excessive exertion on the heart impossible .
i just read it
and rushed over to tll me ?
and that 's what we 'll do
i 'll est ou at the same time
ca n't it wait until after the race ?
until you 've been scanned , training is banned
yes !
one for oona , one for eetu , and one for k
perfect fit .
dense but not too tight
no space for air in between .
exctly
so when 's your next race ?
thank you .
you 're welcome
i thought i 'd wait until the nationals
but i 'm getting itchy feet .
no way .
no races until mr .
ski has tested you .
you need to be in top form then
if k has worked out a plan for you , why not follow it ?
we 'll dive 3 km down to 350 meters
they come from caves far away
i came to train here last spring .
ok .
a small front gear and a 29- teethed in the rear

sometimes small change can make a big difference
a lousy dea !
two weeks into the job , and you lready got five days off
now i can study for the exam .
exactly
who won ?
you always have an excuse
what 's the big deal ?
it 's just a game
if you do the same at the nationals , you 'll be the laughing stock
what the hell ?
i 'm fed up with his bitching
what do you mean ?
what 's bugging him ?
ca n't deal with disappointments and takes it out on others
feel like dancing ?

it 's raining cats and dogs
nothing beats swimming in the rain .
oh yes , i love it
i know the best place in town for a night swim .

eetu called at 3 am .
great las you 're doing !
i 've been wracking my brain over the tactics for the race
i had planned that eetu would help k to win
you can both race for first place
it would be great if one of you gets lucky
let 's go for a swim fter work .
mr .
ski is totally mind-boggled .
he thought you were history
you called on saturday .
for a while i suspected you were hitting on oona behind my back
but i knew you would nevr do a thin like that to me
especially at a tme ike this
that 's what i thught
if you see him ...
then what ?
you need eetu 's help
and he needs mine just the same .
he called me
apologized for his behavior .
and ?
about us ?
about us of course
why would i lie to him .
i feel stuid enough as it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , if you did n't have the guts to tell him
and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta
your heart has to be operated on
is it a major operation ?
yes , and difficult
if you were on the ational team , maybe ...
i have the nationals on sunday .
and i forbid yu to take part
consequently , the ventricles contract
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
am i bothering you ?
looks like my exam went really well .
thanks again fr the tapes .
why not
should we go some place ?
i have to finish this
do n't worry
are you mad at me ?
 did n't mean it exactly that way .
i am what i am
here they are , 40 hungry racers , ready to give heir bet sot ...
a few names stand out as promising
how 's it going ?
and you ?
busy as hell .
is the national team all settled ?
on man missig .
my guys will settle it on the road
keep an eye on this romising rider , only 19 years old

lf i ha , i would n't give you any
thanks
they 're coming !
k !
just go 
will you be all right ?
i 'm glad to see you eating again .
why am i packaged up like this ?
that 's why you 've got to keep still
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a good chance of recovery
you can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spinal shock , as the doctors believe- you should be moving your legs in a month 's tie
but you 'll never become a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a relief
i told them i 'd ask you frst
we 're in a hurry
hi !
never seen parallel bars this long
i asked the staff to set them up
i left it to the very last moment , but i came anyway
with the under twenty-three national team
ongratulations
i would n't ave made it without you .
just thank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sorts pages
i 'm lad you made it
i think oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can manage on my own .
certainly not
hey , why do n't you leave
will you jut get lost !
it 's coming along
but they wo n't let me cycle for a year
strange how distances take twice as long as they used to
i passed the exam .
by the skin of my teeth .
congratulations
it must have been the sure et
do n't you remember ?
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly ...
unexxc ... unexpectedly .
unexpectedly
i want to apologize
i really did n't treat you right
tat was then
just about to do it
a socket shock
and suddenly socked him into a real cerebral high
growing his mind into the kind
and a smile pon his face
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
totally together computer in tennis shoes
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed

dean higgins , today , a computer can hardly be considered a luxury .
oh , very well .
no , unfortunately ,
medfield has quite a long list of necessities , and a computer just does not have a very high priority on that lit .
now , it 's not that i 'm old-fashioned .
you all know that i have an open ear for progress , an we do all that we can .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we went to the expense of live frogs .
we 're not dragging our feet , quigley .
why , i just put an order in today for two garbage disposals and a electrc dishwasher
anythig yet , bradley ?
how 's he doing ?
yeah , that figures .
thanks .
you just do n't understand the problem .
do you know what the telephone bill alone is here every mont ?
i do n't want to hear about state .
yeah , but do you realize that they give an entire course in coputer technology ?
no , i do n't like to draw comparisons , gentlemen , but if we want to kep abreast of the times and raise our academic average ,
we have got to modernize .
modernization is n't everything .
yes , uh , regent deeds .
thank you very much .
gentlemen , i , uh , i would n't like this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are down to the nitty-gritty on our budgt .
why , we raffled off everything on the campus but the women 's gym .
it 's tough , tough , tough .
urest .
oh , uh , that part about the unest , that 's , uh , that 's off th record , mrs. winifred .
so , quigley , i 'm sorry , but i 'm certain hat you understand our problem .
that 's it .
now , for the next item on the agenda ...
us .
well-put , dean .
leonard ...
the not-so-gifted students ' needs are jst as great as those of te gifted ones .
now , um , quiley , we do have certain ne'er-do-wells that must be seen to .
probation is no substitute for catching the interest of the student , for firing his imagination .
come on , quig .
thattaboy .
john colligan , roger demney ,
henry fathinger ,
... myles harris ,
adam jervins ,
keith richards , dexter reilly ...
dexter , it 's not funny .
... robert ross ,
sliver roth .
he went through all the s 's .
hey , that 's right .
oh , yes , of course .
richard schuyler .
he 's sick .
you know , quig really cares , but the guy ca n't even reason with him .
well , swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive higgins right over the edge .
you guys must be dreaming .
the guy who 's selling it want 10 grand .
a.j .
ano .
i mean , i think if we went down there and alked to him , we could get hm to donate it to the college .
well , i do n't know about that .
dexter , you jus cleaned up at night .
arno would n't ven emember you .
kind of .
you know , that 's not too ba an idea 
no trouble at all , wexler .
i mean , i love that school .
well , believ me , if i did n't give them all that money ,
no .
maybe i can work something out .
look , just give me a little time , huh ?
you know , i like you kids .
i like the idea of a student delegation coming to see me .
makes me feel good ...
thanks .
goodbye .
goodbye , boys .
thanks a lot for giving us your time , r. arno .
well , a.j .
arno never forgets an old employee .
um , it 's ... it 's dexter .
ah , yes , deter .
yeah , just about , sir .
all right .
hey , they did pretty good with the horses .
750 is n't bad .
that crap table figre okay ?
looks like a real good day fo applejack .
yeah , real good .
incidentally , do n't send that 20 grand to medfield .
do n't you think ...
do n't worry about it .
146 , right .
easy through the dor , you guys .
easy .
right in there .
nuber 125 .
take it easy .
what a slave driver .
yeah , if he 'd been in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they 'd have made it .
you know , it 's a great idea doing something for the scool , but next time let 's do something eay , lie hijacking a cuban irliner .
yeah .
professor , can we just take a few seconds off ?
oh , sure .
take as mch time as you want .
uh , dexter , there 's a box of tools in the back of my car .
would you get that for me , please ?
sure .
right away , professor .
good morning , dean .
good morning , dean .
hi , deano .
oh , ello , there , dean higgins .
of course , e 're not really set up here yet , but ver soon .
well , that 's wonderful .
i see .
and you will understand
we must withhold our yearly cash contribution .
yors in the interest of higher education , a.j .
arno.
you can say that again .
and i 'm gon na tell you this mch , quigley ... in the future , i 'm gon na be watching the .
but you ca n't blame the boys , sir .
oh , good faith , bad faith , who cares ?
they 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
we still have the omputer .
you know , i do n't like to brag , but if it had n't been for the fact that i used to work there ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmetic and logic , and output .
and , uh , even though it 's an imitation , in many ways , the machine we 've developed can operate more efficiently than we can ourseles .
now , in the past coule of weeks ,
i 've ben , uh , working on a small exeriment , u , which is intended to show how we can be replaced by a computer .
hey .. this may be a way of getting rid of dean higgins .
we live n hope , dexter .
now , let 's suppose that your parents are going away for the weekend , and thy leave you he following istructions ...
all right ?
an being the conscientious and reliable young people
i know you to be , you promptly forget to do it .
now , this is a rain gauge , and it 's , uh , siting on a roof of a building .
the memory bank , in turn , activates the electronic circuits  the window closes , the door opens ... hopefully the cat comes in ... and the automatic telephone goes into action , right ?
the rain ... falls .
computerized male voice :
this is s recording .
hmm .
that 's enough of that .
thank you .
now , another very important feature is its infallible memory .
and they were kind enough to send us this magnetic tape , which will call forth from the computer solutions to a series of problems that would occur on a simulated flight to the planet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center panel , please .
hey , quig .
hey .
well , it seems like our flight to saturn will be a little delayed .
this is dean higgins .
now , as may of you know , we came in 36th las year .
i do n't know .
what happened , professor ?
it , uh , should be replaced , but i ca n't get over to capital electronics today .
oh , that 's okay .
i 've go nothing to do .
oh , yeah , but i know all that stuff .
cars and buses going from place to place .
one guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes .
i got it al , prof .
yes , i m sure you do have it all , dexter , but if i were you , i would look it over again this aternoon .
aw , honest , professor .
it would n't do any goo .
i 'm up to here with it .
let me go to marshfield .
believe me , the drive and fresh air will do me good .
it ould n't be a .
the answer to the last two questions was a .
would never have three a ' in a row .
i 's got ta be b or c .
i have n't seen a c for a long time .
got to be c .
that 's three a 's in a row .
that 's impossible .
3 at 8-02-30 .
applejack pompey palace ,
dexter ?
dexter , are you okay ?
nah , ou were beeping .
burping ?
no , beeping .
w ... nothing .
well , there must be a short in it somewhere .
i had to call in these computer people .
well , mov along , boys .
now , ladies and gentlemen , this is a speed test .
and that means if you have trouble with any question , skip it and move on to the next one because you 'll be graded on the total number of questions you answer correctly .
you may begin .
dexter , come on .
funny guy .
i tell you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a doctor .
that 's ridiculous .
he did n't cheat , dea higgins .
now , we usually allow an hour and a haf for that test .
dexter finished it in 41/2 miutes , and he did n't make a mistak .
man :
yes .
listen , at this rate , you 're gon na faint in front of all those people .
dexter , it is n't tat easy .
things are n't the sae .
you have a responsibility now .
yeah .
yeah .
do nt worry about it , man .
there are going to be 37 mllion viewers , quigley .
no questin .
oh , mayor collins .
nie to see you , mayor .
ha !
it 's th mayor .
i tell you , quigley ,
ha !
mayr collins and there 's concilman cooper over there and supervisor sraight and there 's , uh , oh  he 's not anything .
hello , dean !
what 's he doing her ?
well , i d n't like it .
every time i see him , i have to hear about his building program .
it 's enough to make you sick .
hello .
i 've been hearing great things .
well , you know , at medfield , the schlastic ...
nie to see you .
i would have gotten over here sooner , but i 'e been tied up planing our new science building .
you know , quigley , sometimes i think i should have taken up contracting instead of education .
no .
i-i mean , he 's all booked up .
uh-hh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies and gentlemen .
oh , i 'd better take my seat .
i 've been invited to sit in the control room .
in the control room .
i tell yo , he 's tryin to steal that boy away from us .
i 'm sure of it .
you do n't understand him , quigley .
the man is gredy .
he 's up to his throat in state oney , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each of our learned guests will be alloed 3 questions .
our first questions will be from dr. rufus schmidt , head of the department of higher mathematics at purdue university .
dr. scmidt .
well , i ...
i , uh , i guess i am .
i see .
mr. reilly , using the fundamental theorem of advanced calculus , and applying the formula that the square of a distance from the origin to p
is equa to x squared plus y squared plus z squared .
you see ?
he 's getting his confidence .
your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 .
the square root of that product would be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct .
hey .
man :
i must say , that was really something .
yes , i suppose it was , but would n't it speed things up a bit if we could save the applaus till the end ?
yes , uh , i 'm sue the adience would be glad to comly .
good .
your third question , dr. scmidt .
gentlemn , please .
i hope you 're aware that i 'm perfectly eqipped to go into other fields .
of curse .
uh , perhaps now we could hear from , uh , dr. seigel , professor of foreign languages at lansing university .
getting his confidence is one thng , but this is ridiculous .
i like him better the way he was .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
it promises to be exciting , o stay with us as our cameras follow dexter reily on his journey thrgh gotham .
there 's been s buzz of excitement around te big city this past week , ladies and gentlemen .
everywhere you go , you hear the same question ... is dexter reilly for real ?
should be any second now .
and there he is !
wel ...
uh , mr. reilly 's being greeted by two young ladies who came all the way from yonkers just to greet him .
this is priscilla cummings ...
queen of the yonkers botanical society ,
i always knew if he had any brains , he 'd be dangerous .
look , i now dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind of understandable .
look at that crowd , quigley .
what a boon for the college .
why could n't the boy have been carryig a medfield pennant ?
do n't you think that would have been pushing it  little , sir ?
yes ?
from universal encyclopedias .
oh , tell him we already have a set .
he 's no saesman , sir .
he 's the president of universa encyclopedia .
the president ?
sure .
the quiz program where they ask the questions from the encyclopedia , and they give away $ 100,000 ?
it 's a real pleasure .
thank you .
who are you ?
who am ...
that ' good .
i like that .
who am i ?
and i like that set of encyclopedias of yours .
displaying again his remarkable intellectual prowess ,
dexter reilly was able to converse with each delegate to the u.n. in his own tongue .
they 'e aiting for him in the security council .
earlier today , dr. suzuki of the internatinal school of languages stated that with s computer-type brain such as dexter reilly has , he 'll soon be able to master every language the world has ever known .
i think he ' given s good indication of that today .
professor mertins , we need that boy .
he can wrap up that cllege knowledge progra for us .
of course , but we c n't take any chances .
parsons 
uhh , just a minute , quigley .
tremendous .
well , t-this is rather important , sir .
it 's about the college knowledge program .
dexter will chew up those encyclopedias .
it seems that mr. van dyke is explaining the operation to the boy wonder .
only maybe we do n't have exter .
what ?
find out when his plane arrives !
quigley , how could you let this happen ?
the first operation of cutting the diaond in two exact halves is the most important .
i beg you ...
wh-iii-pppp !
yeah , mr. arno , but i 'm kind of busy right now .
well , i hated to interrupt you , but i 've got some good news .
oh ?
to what i 'm gon na do .

i can remember the time you stole breakaway jones from m .
hey , come on .
do n't be depressed , will you ?
spending the night in jail ai n't so bad .
look at me .
it 's not the alumni that 's trying to steal dexter .
man :
you know , i do n't understand you .
i never once met a guy who could pick eight races in a row , never .
dexter , you and me could have the orld at our feet here .
collingsgood :
you just want him for that college knowledge program , and you know it .
you know ... everyone ' just out for himself 
oh , you mean those guys ?
who are you thining of , mr. walski ?

what re friends for ?
i 'd just like to say that i 'm sorry .
come on .
what are friends for , man ?
annie ...
that 's okay .
come on , let 's go .
that 's fantastic .
you did the s 's in ...
8 minutes and 18 seconds .
that beat the r 's by 91/2 seconds .
and thee wer 1,200 pages in the s 's and only 1,000 in the r 's .
i pcked up 22.68 % .
i 'll get it .
is dexter here ?
yeah , he 's just boning up
for the college knowledge program .
time .
page 4 , paragraph 16 , line 398 , word 4,001 .
hi , professor .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't mean to interrupt anything 
yes .
well , it 's just , uh , a little thing , dexter .
it , uh , seems that we need , uh , three more members for the panel .
i ee .
well , you know me , quigley , i 'm not a proud man .
if , uh , dexter does n't like my suggestions , then he can have anybody he wants .
who does he want ?
hmm .
schuyler , heny , and myles .
schuyler , henry , nd myles ?
and i 'm afraid that if we tied to force anyone else on hi , he might ...
y
i mean , we ant to keep that boy happy .
but schuylr  henry , and myles .
but the answer t part one is the battle of thermopyla ,
well , lockhurst has answered two parts out of three correctly .
okay , schuyler , you answer this one .
what ?
it does n't look good if i answer all the questions .
phidias , who did a statue of athena , and paxitees , who specialized in human figures , then there was myron , who sculpted the figure of a iscus-thrower , kind of like the best thing he ever done .
okay .
you got it ?
gentlemen , you have 20 seconds .
i think i misunerstood the question , sr .
w
who 's that guy , merlin ?
not merlin , myron .
gentlemen , your ime is almost up .
i think i misunderstood the answer , sir .
you id ?
that 's the last time i 'll do that .
we have time for one more question directed to our medfield panel .
gentlemen , these are the works of the famous marcel duchamp as found in the collction of the philadelphia museum of art .
thank you , miss ackerman .
number one is called portrait of hess players.
it was painted in 1911 .
and number three is called
that 's right on the button .
very good .
that answer is absolutely correct .
so untl then , good night to you from univesal encyclopedia , your passport to knowledge .
you gys were great .
we 're gon na win .
 nude descending a staircase.
boy , that 'd never make playboy .
oh , dean collingsgood , nice o see you .
yu 're scouting , i imagine .
and i would like to say right at the beginning ,
if you had an ounce on integrity , you 'd withdraw him .
withdraw whom ?
it 's unfair .
he 's an intellectual freak !
unfortunately , this year , medfield has the horses .
are those the horses ?
for 10 points each , could you give us the highest an lowest points in south america ?
the highest point is mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feet .
tat is absolutely correct .
hey , i did n't try to get him arrested , you know .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon na be a raid ?
i want to hear this .
some of that consumption was in the liquid form .
can you give the phrase in slang for the central unfrozen portion in a container of frozen ider ?
that 's absolutely right .
applejack .
hey , boss , i had nothin ' to do with this .
i swear .
what was i talking about ?
mr. arno , if you could please relax for just a little ...
out , out .
but ...
this is pplejack .
i do n't want a trace of that operation left .
shut down ?
why ?
what 's the matter ?
whatever you say .
we got ta put that kid on ice .
look , we need time to figure this out .
hello ?
i want the pompey palace on franklin road in charlottesville .
yea .
you now , if hat kid had n't been stoppd , he ' have mentioned every joint i own in this state .
take him out to the hancock place .
right .
no , i do n't know the area code .
hello , dexter .
go ahed .
start the car .
you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happened , lieutenant .
he was spposed to be at my house about 8:30 last night , and he never showed up .
and nobody 's seen him since .
well , we 've checkd all over .
he has n't been in an accident nor has he been arrestd .
lieutenant , i wonder if he could have had an attack of amnesia .
could be miles away by now 
mm-hmm .
i 've aleted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his car .
and if they do n't pick him p pretty soon , then i 'm afaid we 'll have to uspct foul play .
foul play , huh ?
well , that 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean collinsgood over at state ?
oh , do n't you see it , quigley ?
i mean , if dexter is n't bck tomorrow for that colege knowledge program , then springfield state will get the $ 100,000 grat .
uh , wait a minute .
wait a minute .
the dean of a college , a kidnapper ?
well , you do n't now him .
you do n't know him at all .
the man is ruthless .
he gets all that taxpayers ' money and still he 's ruthless .
y
yeah .
i see .
i guess tat 'll be all for now .
pete ...
i just do n't think
animals 740 , tables 600 , amusements 500 .
applejack , charlie ...
gee , all those places and always applejack.
he did n't have the foggiest idea wha they were .
aybe it does n't mean anything .
then all o a suddn , he mentions applejack , and wham !
just like that , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses through a bok on an oriental language , and then speaks it fuently , remembering every accent .
how come he does n't remember this ?
pete , t does n't make sense .
unless ... unless h 'd never read it or seen it or heard it before .
it was in the computr .
and now he blurts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missing .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack .
... for something , something he does n't want anybody to know about .
hi .
i do n't care who believes it , just as long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell them if they look up these places , they 're gon na find out what applejack is up to .
and the reason why we know applejack is arno is 'cause it came from the computer into dexter 's head .
and hat 's why dexter does n't remember it .
come on .
tht 's why pete reembered that appleack was arno .
arno ?
yeah , because it was the only thing he could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered .
because he could n't ?
exactly .
well , uh , thank you , mr. schuyler .

oh .
i 'll be sure to notify you .

the cast of so random !
sticks together through thick and thin .
why are we dressed like this ?
because we 're on a mission .
sop shocking me .
i have n't yet mastered my powers .
my hair itches .
ow !
what was that fr ?
gilroy , why o n't you ever ask questions like ,
or what 's your favorite dog combination ?
labradoodle .
chocopoo , which is a combiation
it 's the ice cream that licks itself .
yeah , back to the dirt .
in the latest issue of tv weekly with this handsome fella on the cover ,
tawni hart is a drama queen prone to throwing diva fits .
what ?
i did n't say that .
i know .
i jus made that up .
are you thinking about it ?
oh my gosh , she 's actually thinking about it .
you 're actually thinkin about it .
actually , it 's a bald cap ,
i did shave my head .
if i do n't have the best hair ,
stop hinking about it .
i did n't say anything .
but you were thinking .
wat ere you thinking about ?
tawni and i were like this .
and the pretty one !
let 's think of this studio as a school .
you 've got all these great ideas and you 're full of enthusiasm .
well , knock it off !
i ca n't believe you stabbed me .
you stabed yourself .
yo just stood ther and wathed , which is just like stabbing ,
so it 's really your fault .
here , you need to rinse it off .
'ause the way i read it was more like ,
that is the worst tawni impression i 've ever heard .
so that face you made .
i know that face .
no no no .
i mean , we went to he moie once ,
but it was just as friends .
it 's ust ..
do you need a tissue ?
i 'm good .
nico .
i love grady , but grady needs a really classy girl .
he has really refined tastes .
i guess we know what the pan 's used fo .
he made me an omelet yesterday .
because i heard he made quite an impression on sonny .
he did ?
how long is this show ?
okay .
chad dylan cooper .
i did n't give you any --
chad dylan cooper just stole my yogurt .
o , my gosh , chad dylan cooper just stole my yogurt !
but , gilroy , if you really wan na know ,
the truth is ...
chad is in a very exclusive relationship
with somebody very special to him .
oh my goh , what happened to you ?
i 'm --
yo , baby !
let 's get back to celebrating me , all right ?
hey , guys , i hired you .
at least there 's still one chad standing .

i 'm here promoting my book .
you wrote a book ?
so i could get your reacion to this .

and even the best of intentions .
just because you wish fo something
does n't make it so .
woa !

aparently , someone at mackenzie falls
does n't like sonny very muc .
if i were to wait for things to be in context ,
still , it seems the two of you
have a little something something going on .

yep , right after this commercial break .
well , we are .
let 's go .
you 're leaving me here by myself ?
yes .
i also have other talents .
do i have a choice ?
rubber encil !
i ca n't believe gilroy tried to do that to us .
he 's a jerk .
i ca n't believe i read that book for nothing .
you know , tawni and i made a pact earlier
i think that we should probably do the same thing .
okay , fine .
i did n't read the book .
do w ?
i learned this move .
i did n't win little miss flexible for nothing .
okay .

chad dylan cooper , dancing , nine-year-old girl .
so who wants to boogie ?
yes .
yes , we still do it .
we paint eveything ... the jaguar , the fis .
only after five days ... .
first we put paint ... the charcoal .
about four or five days old .
yes , i did .
i do n't remember , it was too long ago .
kuberene was kind of a sad boy , bu a good person .
one was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had amilies .
it leads to suffering , pain , daner and death !
we do n't have ... any written education ... we get our nowedge from our parents and families 
they teach us about our destiny , about being an indian ... being a human being , and about life .
if we do n't respect our elders ... we 'll be lost .
during the republic they tried ... to change us into whtes overnight .
we were confused ... not knowing how to live in this new situation ... and after the years ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defend ourselves .
but how ?
we 'll see if we wil have to operate .
we teach our children to read .
we want to learn only the good things from the whites .
that 's why we teach our children , so that wo n't happen .
yes .
i liked it very much , i was very happy .
i have mssed him a lot since i lost him .
and ow , when i saw him ...
i was very happy inded .
i 've been feeling so sad ... and this was great for me .
it was great to see hm alive .
when i saw him moving ...
he was steering the canoe .
the water was very low .
when the canoe passed over a crocodile ... it went crazy and attacked my father .. righ at his neck .
in this village ... a lot of things have changed since your last visit .
but for me the saddest thing is that i 've lost my husband .
i miss the safety he gave me .
i remember long ago , one night he came into my hut ... and the next morning we were husband and wife .
he was a very good person , vey kind and hard working .
how long have you been running ?
are you nt tired ?
be reasonable .
give me the amulet and walk away .
i 'll even pay you for your troubles .

the smurfs were celebrating the arriva of autumn with games , music and dance .

holy smurf , look at thse berries .

hey there , lazy !
hey !

oh , i had no clue .
no oe tells me anything .
there we go .
smurfy hollow ?
the very notion of a headless horseman ...
the other smurfs do n't know how to think these things through .
just one more bucket , then i 'm going home !
what was that ?
must have been a dead tree branch .
it 's quite common in windy condiions .
just relax , brain .
no !
i 'm the headless horseman !
it ca n't be !
it worked !
it 's a berry bonanza !
whose medal will be clanking ' now ?
that 's right , little smrfberry !
brainy ?
oh  do n't you worry , he 'll be fine .
my glasses !
it definitely smurfed me to safety .
all right , smurfs !
lazy , how mny smurfberries did you get ?
and what did you get , vanity ?
even handsomer ...
hey !
you again !
stop it !
not my cornucopia .
and you , greedy ?
brainy !
you 've outdone yourself this year !
think again , papa .
gutsy ?
how do you like them smurfberries ?
well , this is unexpected .
consmurfulations , gutsy !
this is unbelievable .
and how about a victory dance ?
gutsy !
thank you !
like what ?
where 's brainy ?
that 's very strange indeed .
do you think he got lost 
what if he fell in a ditch ?
maybe a egless weasel got him .
you kno what , i hink i might have spotted brainy in the woods ealier .
see you .
oh , for smurf 's sake , why did he have to run away like that ?
come on , brainy !
hey , wht are you doing here , lass ?
i thought i 'd help you look for brainy .
whre 'd you see him , exactly ?
by smurfy rock ?
more ...
stop grilling me , woman !
i ca n't take it anymoe !
it was just a wee little prank , tat 's al .
it may have involvd a fake headless hoeman ...
what ?
i never should have gotten out of bed this moring ...
oh , my smurf , brainy !
well , i 'm trapped 30 feet in the air in a sinister gargamelian cage .
yes , come on , come on .
let ' get him down from there and get out of this creepy forest .
yes , a lassic gargamel tactic is t set additional traps around ...
we do n't hve time to overthink this !
gutsy !
not in smurfy hllow .
 hate to furter complicate things , guys , but the headless horsema is out there .
searching .
without senss .
i know it defies all ational explanations .
gutsy ?
okay , fine .
it 's nt all my fault !
oh , boy .
what are we going to do ?
i have an idea .
but it 's gon na take guts and brains .
do you think you two ould work together ?
two drops would be bad .
three drops ...
ca n't you see that i 'm working ?
get off of me , you frenied feline !
what did you say ?
how many ?
three !
i do n't know where they are .
gutsy , d you have enough momentum ?
aye , smurfete !
i 'm giving it all she 's got .
yes 
gutsy , it 's crucial that you shift your weight at exactly t minus zero .
it 's also making me sick !
brace yourselves !
oh , no , smurfette is still up there !
it 's okay .
we still have time before gargamel shows up .
azrael !
hello , smurfs !
wait .
you know , there 's this magical new device called  toothbrush !
hey , gargasmell !
now 's your chance !
stop !
i 'm horribly ticklish !
what do we do ?
i think we might be done here .
godbye !
it was an honr smurfing with you .
what ?
headless !
crikey !
he really does exist !
wizrds and children fist !
we 're doomed !
since when do you believe in legends ?
since they started chasing me with flaming pumpkins ...
so you 're saying ...
lf we can get to the bridge , we 're safe !
brilliant !
you 're a genius !
yes , we will !
but we need better transportation !
climb aboard te red-eye !
we did it !
azrael , look at that !
he ca n't exit the hollow !
azrael !
get off of me !
let go , ou foul furball !
what is a water-bal ?
azrael , are you dead ?
that 's nice and all but i think brainy should ave it .
i just want to say i 'm sorry .
for scaring you like that and all .
i tried so hard every year , and you always won .
i 'm sorry , too .
seems to me , laddy , that we let winning a medal get in the way of what 's really important here .
that 's true .
see , you guys , when the two of you help each other , well , that 's what family is all about .
negative ,  hae not exactly been playing fair .
no , coe on now , lad !
no , you won .
you should have it .
you take it !
no , it has to be you !
no , it has to be you !
just take it !
lazy ?
i win !
exhausting !
i love this wee little lad !
too much momentum !
very nie .
good job getting them home safe .
i guess i should change you back now .
you must be hugry .
okay , let 's go find vanity 's hat .
so the headless horseman was a goat ?
just t set the record straight ,
really ?
not even one little ...
hold me !
it 's just a bat , hefty .
give a guy a break .
we 're gon na tak a walk utside today
gon na see what we can find today
we 're gon na take a walk outside today
on a pretty little farm the sun comes up
follow your nose and go explore
'cause we 're gon na take a walk outside today

such a great big world it 's all set up
for a curious cat and a pug-osed pup
gon na see what we can find today
gon na see what we can find today ♪♪
except for the actiity up in the hayloft , the farm was pretty quiet tat morning .
they could sleep through anything .
but a lot of the other animals were awakened by all that scurrying overhead .
some of them just accepted it .
some were pretty annoyed .
but the mood was very differen up in he hayloft .
she was detemined to be  god mother and never yell at her ittens .
but that approach ould not last very long , because milo , ne of er kittens , was trouble from the very beginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that 's not a good idea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a strang-looking cat  milo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , all right , a dog .
but , um , really , deep down inside , we 're all cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barked .
the kittens were now big enough to leave the hayloft ad see the world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was the first to start calling out for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to milo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down there is the river .
everyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
milo asked .
is this ?
o !
ah !
milo , get back here , his mother demanded .
but mi-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo meowed .
i think so , milo said .
all right , be careful , his mother ordered , and began swimming .
all right .
i 'm not going to yell , his mother said .
now dry yourself off , like this :
and follow me back home .
that was fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
get over here !
the months passed , and the farm was humming with the sounds of summer .
milo had some new hiding places he could n't wait to try out .
otis sniffed around the yard for a while .
you 're in the pipe , milo .
try again .
cat 's in the can !
ad milo slipped off to another hiding place .
it as n't easy fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tried a harder spot .
but otis found him there too .
now milo needed a brilliant idea .
aha .
he thought of a place where otis could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but milo wondered if it was reall worth the trouble .
milo and otis went to see what all the commotion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rang out :
and all the hens left in a clucking flurry because that was gloria talking , a young chicken who had scratched and pecked her way to the top rung of the henhoue .
gloria had a good reason for wanting to be alone .
there it is , fellas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it finally happened .
is she staying at home with it r is she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kick it back to you , otis ?
mlo asked .
otis sad .
i kicked it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how long do we have to stick around this henhouse ?
until gloia comes back .
maybe you do n't realize it , milo , but this is a major day for me because ...
well , maybe you do n't realize that this is the day i 've become a watchdog .
some strane noises brought milo out of the henhouse .
what was all this about ?
hey !
you singing sinks .
come here , otis , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , come on .
at tht moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling though the farmard .
he deserved it , the frog croaked .
and outside , milo and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis growled .
just try something .
probably rotten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird animl .
the noie attracted a grup of local snoops looking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're having a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your mommy 's a chicken .
the other animas told otis he 'd better take the chick to loria , and qickly , which he did .
but the chick kept coming back to otis .
now go back to gloria .
do you unerstand ?
woof , the chick peeped .
woof , woof , mommy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you 've got to be a rough , tough , mean , fighting do , like this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it a try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss him .
come on , said milo .
phew .
wow , look at this thing , otis , ilo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle the score with that --
that , uh  thing 
ha , ha .
this 'l be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terrific time , but otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe he could jump off the bridge into the box if he hurried .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work either .
otis just could n't swim fast enough and the river took mio farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost sight of otis .
suddenly he heard smething moving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in the box so the bear wold n't see him .
but the box was drifting right towards the hungry animal .
but unfortunately much oo soon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the rivebank , leading the bear away from milo .
milo kept difting along , but he was getting a littl concerned because the river was beginning to move faster ... and faster .
he 'd lost track of otis now , and he was drifting farther and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the forest .
and he heard mysterious hoots and growls and cries in the night .
he began to wish he 'd never jumed into this box and he began to wish he was home .
i seemed to be trembling as much as he was in the chilly , misty night .
he drifted on throug the darkness , hoping to find the morning waiting just around the bend .
when daylight came ,
milo saw a farm on the riverbank .
for one happy moment , he thought he was home and cried out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't knw when he would ever see it again .
here comes the dog your life he -- ♪♪
the deadwood swamp .
a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves or branches , and where no creature could live , except for the dreaded dadwood birds .
and one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat .
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
look in the box .
otis prepared himself and peeked in the box and saw only a solitay black feather .
in fact , milo was nowhere nar the deadwood swamp .
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as quickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
the ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow where he saw a kind of animal he ' never seen before .
eeling pretty hungry , he immeditely wondered ,
is tht omething yo can eat ?
heh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful , milo thought .
and bove all , i mus keep absolutey silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch where he figured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah , here , my precious muskrat .
you should be safe there till dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crept slwly down the tree and watched the fox run over the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knw just how to get his paws on a big , tasty muskrat lunch .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through the wetlands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered there was one magi word everyone understood and that was please .
so he marched up to a clam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds were getting darker and darker and a chilly wind was whipping across the countryside 
milo was several miles from the beach caught in the same storm .
he got a little wet and h felt awfully lonesome without otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide came in so fast that th rock oti had been sitting on was cmpletely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd never be able to swim to shore .
and the water was growing higher .
now the water was up to his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he took a deep breath , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh , not again , the sea turtle gurgled .
every time the tide comes in some fool gets stuck out here .
otis was n't sure what this turtle wanted .
well  now you know .
now , just stay on the shore , where you belong  the urtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
net time the tide coms in , i 'll have to rscue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said otis , i did n't knw that .
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otis called out , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
i have n't got time , otis said , sensing this ox was n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis was outrged .
ha !
he marveled at this road made of wood and iron and decided to follow the road and see where it would take him .
it could 've run right over me .
but milo was determined .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm not sure cats know how to bound , milo said .
bound and leap , like a zephyr set free .
bound and , of course , leap .
it just does n't look right hen i do it .
folc with me , friend .
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frolicking .
i 'm frolicking .
you see ?
ahem .
you can stop frolicking now , the deer cooed .
i think i 'm a little tuckered out , milo said .
yes , it is possible to over-rolic , the deer murmured .
and the deer took milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trailed milo from the deadwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the friend he missed so much .
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling .
as evening was falling ,
milo decided the afest place to spend the night woul be in a tree .
and what are you ding up here ?
hiding from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest belong to you ?
yes , nd it 's not just any nest , i 'll have you know .
i 'm the night bird , and that is a dreaming nest .
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone sleeping there will have his sleep flooded ith dreams , the bird said .
but it 's a safe lace , safe from those screech ows .
... we 'd think of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
hoo !
all right .

how often have you seen that statement at the beginning of a picture ?
well , there ' nothing unique in that .
we all have moos .
in fact , a modern writer has said ... that inside every fat man .. a thin man is struggling to get out .
well , in a literal and terrifying sense ... inside this demure young woman ... two vry vvid and different personalities ... were battling for the mastery f her character .
now , ther account of the case was delivered ... to the american psychiatric ssociation in 1953 ... and it 's already a classic of psychiatric literature .
the date is augut 20 , 1951 .
you all right ?
come in .

si here , will you ?

why , i do n't know .
i 'm not exactly sure .
well , what happens when you have one ?
i it what they say , amnesia ?
well , amnesia means loss of memory .
is that what happens to you ?
how often does thi happen ?
same thing .
yes , si .
first i get this terribe headache ... and then i get this spell .
no , sir .
it 's more like ...
i was playin ' out in the backyard with bonnie ... and all of a sudden i got this splitting ' headache ... and then te next thing i knew ...
i mean , the next thing i was conscious of , it was the next mornin ' .
that 's my little girl .
how old is she ?
she 's four and a half 
your only child ?
i see .
yes ?
i guess not ... nothing you could say was really different .
narrator :
for several weeks , mrs. white was greatly helped by te psychiatric treatment .
she had no moe blackout spells ... at least none that she was aware of ... but not quite a year later , several things happened ... that showed her to be in ugent need of help .
this one hurts .
where 'd you get these ?
they 're mommy 's .
mommy !
mommy !
well , did n't you buy 'em ?
i thought it was sweet , but i ...
you know i would n't buy anything like that , ralp .
that 's what i man , that costs that much .
where 'd they get your name ?
i do n't know .
i thought you did it .
wll , i 'll say it 's too much .
well , i 'll call 'em .
woman :
is this miss effie ?
who is this ?
this is ralph whit , miss effie .
i thought you and evie would be on your way to hollywood by now .
hollywood ?
with all those pretty things evie bought .
you ought to be mighty proud of her .. the way she looks in those dresses , especially that lilac one .
i said to mr. gilmore ...
come n in , honey , and wash your hands .
tel her i 'll call her .
never mind , honey .
i 'll call you when we 're ready .
come here .
will you come here ?
what did they say ?
i do n't know what you 're talkin ' about .
will you stop that lying ?
nothing ?
she did n't say nothing else .
i do n't see how she could 'cause i did n't .
you mean to tell me you did n't go into the beehive and try on those resses for miss effie ?
they gon na take 'em back ?
you 're not kidding they 'll take them back .

that 's not true , what he said .
what 's not true ?
i have n't been to atlanta in nearly a year .
well , hat 's what i ean .
why do you think h says things like that if they 're not true ?
i thought of one .
you mean , by divorce ?
but you 're not positive ?
well , i could n't be positive of anything this quickly ... but the fact you may be hving spells of amnesia ... does n't mean that you 're , what you call , losin your ind .
does n't mean that at all .
it 's no use ... 'cause i am .
you do n't wan na tell me , but i know it now .
because now i 'm hearing voices too .
what kind of voices ?
just one voice , but that 's what that means , does n't it ?
for months .
what does this voice say to you ?
a woman 's voice 
can you recognize it in any way ?
it sounds familiar sometimes ... but i do n't really recognize it .
to do things like ... leave ralph ... take bonnie ad run away .
that is what it means , is n't it ?
you 've been frightened by ths voice ... because you recognize it as a symptom of illness .
does n't make any difference .
you just do n't wan na tell me , but it does .
feeling better now ?
i did n't have no headache .
she had one , but i did n't .
she ?
i thik she 's a real dope , do n't you ?

i think yo better tur around , though .
you 're kind of cute , but i do n't think i know you that well .
maybe sometme , though , huh ?
hey , you like to go dancin ' ?
would you like t go dancin ' with me ?
so , you 're not eve whie ?
you mean that was your maiden name .
that 's still my name .

i ai n't gon a go through the rest of my lif with that creep .

i 'm gon na come out , and i 'm gon na stay out .

te big apple .

every time i go in there , they ask me to stand up and sing .
what kind of mood ?
i hae to have a couple sorts first .
can you come out , as you call it , whenver you want to ?
somtimes i can , but sometimes i ca n't .
sure .
you know what i done one night ?
you know what i done the next morning ?
she 's faking .
liten , mrs. white ...
i regret to have to say this ... but i ...
hello , doctr .
mrs. white ?
every momet lightly shaken ...
ran itself in golden sands .
that , trembling , passed in music out of sigh .
that 's beautiful .
i just like to read it anyway .
would you like to read this one ?
dear beauteous death .
mornin .
good morning , doctor .
how 's it going ?
yes , she really does .
thank you .
wha about bonnie ?
would you say that yur marriage , peaking of it as a whole ... has been a hapy one ?
no , sir .
well , some of it , but not as a whole .
i do n't know .
i guess i just have n't been able to ake him happy .
have you eve had the feeling that somewhere ... deep down inside you ... there might be somebody you could n't quite reach ... but that you nevrtheless knew ws there ?
no , sir .
good night , doctor .
good night , mdge .
hey .
got a cigarette ?
you know the rules .
come on .
no .
yes ?
it 's about mrs. white .
yes ?
can you control your emergence ?
says which ?
i 'm tired of this place .
it 's a nuthouse , ai n't it ?
you do n't see any bars or anything like tha , do you ?
is she crazy ?
i do n't know what i have to do wit it .
i 'm a doctor .
you 're cute , you know that ?
listen , eve ...
hey , look , why o n't you and i go out and have some fun ?
i can slip on somethin ' .
do you an na be shut up in one of these places for life ... one wth bars ?
what do you mean ?
i mean simply this ...
if you try anything like that , if you get into any trouble at all ... it 'll be mrs. white that 'll be adjudged crazy ... but both of you 'll be locked up .
you 're not gon na e subdivided by any court or board i 've heard of yet .
an asylum , with lockd doors and bars and straitjackets !
i guess so .
even if i do n't come out , wht do you figure to do about it ?
nobody knows too much about his .. beause there have n't been too many such cases ... but for a starter ...
i tink i 'd like to tell ev white about you .
do you object ?
i 'd say the first logical step to take in that direction ... would be to introduce them to each other , would n't you ?
introduce 'em ?
i do n't have to put on much .
let 's go on out and have a little un .
i do n't underst ...
a little one .
narrator :
good morning , sir .
much better now .
tha 's what i wanted to talk to you about .
yes , sir .
have you ever heard of that ?
no , sir .
well , what actually happens s this ...
in effec , she 's now two different women ... entirely different in character .
to be more specific about it .. the girl you married , bonnie 's mother ... sweet , quiet girl you fell in love with , that 's one of the women .
the other is the one that scared bonnie , the one who bougt all the clothes ... the one that had that row with you in atlanta .
you know those headaches and blackout spells ?
yes , sir .
out o where ?
well , how do you like that ?
se ca n't help it .
i think you better come with me .

just for a few minutes .

narrator :
during those two weeks , ralph had left their daughter bonnie ... with the grandparents and found for himself a better job ... in jacksonville , florida ... but mrs. white was not to go with him ... for , on the advice of dr. luther ... she decided to stay in town in a furnished room ... for further and more egular treatment .
i might as well get started , i guess .
ralph , i 'm awful sorry .
you could 't help it .
breaking up everything like this .
well , he ca get you well , ca n't he ?
i hope so .
did n't he say ?
did n't he say anything ?
well , i think he will , honey .

they like to make a big thing out of it ... so 's they 'll look better when they knock it off .
the only trouble , though , i sure am gon a miss bonnie .
well , she 's okay .
your folks will take care of her all right .
yeah , but if i do n't get well , i might never se her again .
of course you 're gon na see hr again ... 'cause you are gon na get well .
i mean , you ai n't really crzy , you know .
he said there was n't a thing in the world the matter with you ... except this multiplied personality ... and that ai n't anywhere near crazy .
you gon na stop worrying now ?
you d that , and you 'll be all right .
good- bye , hoey .

i 'll bet she was glad to see you .
i wanted to surprise you .
mr. foxx , would you excuse us , please ?
certainly , ma'am .
i 'm not well yet .
who say you ai n't ?
dr. luther .
i know it 's true .
i did n't know about it .
i did n't know about it .
you knew enough to go out there and get ginned p .
you was well enough for that .
a fella i know saw you out there twice ... tight as a tick and dancin ' , throwing your dess up , you did n't care how far !
he even showed you .
look  i do n't know which one of you is fooling ' , you or him , but somebody is .
'cause you know hat i 've ben doin ' ?
you know what they said ?
okay , then let it be somethin ' in jacksonville then .
if i do n't check out of dixie motel by 10:00 ... they 'll charge me for another six hours .
ralph , i wo n't leave here until i 'm well again ... not till i have bonnie back with me .
we 'll get bonnie .
we 'll go up thee and take her with us .
she scared her .
will you cut that ut ?
then i 'm not going !
i 'm not going , and tht 's all there is to it .
not until dr. luther tells me i can leave .
well , i ca n't help it .
i 'm not gon na leave here , not until i 'm well .
i would n't count on it then either , if i were you .
if you were really crazy , it 'd be different , but not this multiplied thing .
you understand ?
i ca n't help it , ralph .
okay , if that s the way you want it .
come in .
i never saw that dress before .
ell , do n't you wan na give me one ?

you wanted he to go with you , did n't you ?
you are my wife .
that 's not what you said a few minutes ago .
maybe , only not tonight , i a n't .
why not tonight ?
'cause i have n't got anything to wear to jacksonville .
it 's gettin ' kind of old .
maybe , if you buy me a pretty one .
will you go now ?
the stores ai n't open now .
do n't you trust e ?
sure .
i just want the dress first .
does that mean you 're gon na buy me something ?
i told you i would , did n't i ?
okay , but just a little one .
hey !

hey .

shut that door .
all i was doin ' was just dancin ' .

go on .
she made one slash , and then i got out , and i made her drop the blade ... and i got it and thrw it awy .
do you think she meant it ?
i know she meant it .
if it 'd been me , i would n't have meant it .
i understand .
but she was really leveling .
she really was gon na kill herself if i had n't stopped her .
now i 'm having blackout spells too .

on september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. white : dear dr. luther ...
narrator :
in winter , endless darkness is brightened by the frisky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar bear families .
ne hundred and fifty thousand years ago some brown bears moved north and gradually adapted .
because tey 're built for the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywhere else .
polar bears have aways hunted from floating platforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctic is arming twice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percent more ocean than it does now .
if the current trend continues the arctic ocean could be free of sea ice each summer by the year 2050 .
ven if we c n't stop this loss , we can slow it down .
most arctic glaciers are melting faster tan ever before .
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in search of sea ice often has further to go .
soe cubs do survive especially if the mother is a lever scavenger .
so do the inuit people like simon qamanirq .
simon :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
but now the ancient weather patterns have changed .
our grandfathers fed their families well .
my family has always depended on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
my friend adam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years into raising their young .
walrus moms spend even longer .
they div down from rafts of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of their favorite treat .
mothers teach their young survival skills such as scaring off intruders .
one morn sent me a very clear message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
this water is literally as cold as ice .
the salt kees it from freezing .
down ere , there 's onl one exit and it 's pretty scary thinking you cold be trapped .
each spring in alaka large herds of caribou set out on a long journey .
karten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what the caribou mothers go through and to see this migratin from their perspective .
leanne :
these nwlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to their birthing grounds .
yeah , just ver there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calve are just a week or two old , and they 're easy pickings for bears and wolves .
this is he place where the calves have their best chance to survive .
these bugs are potentially deadly to thse caribou .
to get awy .
caribou mothers are having a tough time as the arctic warms .
but polar bear mothers face an even greater struggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm cptain of this ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world and most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when you 're only 3 months old .
next year we 're coming back with stronge cases .
narrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to ipossible .
then the team got lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
because the sn never set in the summer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry mles prefer seals but in a pinch , they have always gone after defenseless cubs .
the mother seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finally spotted a male quite a ways off zeroing in on the other and her cubs .
now that seals are so hard to catch , starving males might be targeting cubs mor often .
but next time things could be much different .
playful cubs can really work up an appetite .
bjorne :
when you want to grab a bite to eat up here timing is everything .
the cubs finish everything on their plate but the scent of fresh seal meat attracts attention .
but the male picks up te family 's scent again 
we watch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gainig on the faily .
then the mother turns to face him ... ... slowing him down just log enough for her frightened cubs to escape .
at the momen of truth , the mother sent a very clear message :
you can get to my cubs  you want but you 'l have to kill me first .
narrator :
but she 's powerless to save the habitat they need to survive .
there are few truly wild laces left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster than it has for thousands of years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the mothers here nurture their young so lovingly .
perhaps the can inspire s to protect their home with that same care .

even if you find that treasure , spangler will take it away from you and he 'll kill you all into the bargai .
there 's no law down in those swamps , you know .
to hear davie talk , you could par these waters and we could go the rest of the way by carriage .
not that for a moment i 'd even consider i , it 's just i 'm curious why you did n't ask me to go along to ... this ...
matecumbe ?
no offence , ma'am , but in my opinion it 's at home .
i 've rarely seen anything as attractive as a bevy of you at a ball .
and i 'm sure you could snap a fan with the best of 'em .
i 'll say good day , mr ...
bernie ?
just call m jim .
or maybe one of those three-bladed knives in mr. butler 's window .
how do yu buy a new lif ?

until you hear that bell , that final bell
stand up and fight lie hell

i say , my lady , it may be prudent to remain under wraps .
step aside , willory .
perhaps you 're right .

his own creation .
i 'd say this qualifies .

sedgewick !
hi , eliot .
elliot , would you run to the back room and get some barbecue sauce for my new fried , ellen ?
you know i would , bernadette , but , it 's just that the back room is real , real dark .
his list of things he 's afraid of .
it 's extensive .
we 'll have george get it .
what took so long ?
it 's great .
i liked it when he swung on the rope .
they 're both pretty taken with sir frederick .
yeah !
right .
hey , after the show 's over , you want me to take you down on the pirate shp ?

if we all auition , we 're going to be stars .
and my kids would think i 'm a hero .
i got my own set of pirate costumes in my locker .

ready when you are , mr. hibbing !
andy , cue the music and the lights .
you came from the sea and to the sea you shall return .

the height will afford me a keener view .
i ca n't believe he fired us just for failing an audition .
it 's back to my parent ' basement and goodbye ellen .
i needed that job .
sure , we can get some ice cream .
hello , mr. lewis .
i guss that makes you the pirates who do n't do anything .
well , tough luck .
wnts to hang out with us .
his dad 's a loser .
i do n't know what went wrong .
the old man ...
i should be t home right now , watching tv as a happily employed cabin boy .
i guess guys like u will neve be more than cabin bos .
see what i mean ?
free garbage .
well , what is it ?
well , it could be something valable , lik a russian satellite .
or aybe a bomb .
i told you it was a bomb .
chuck it in the river .
i think it 's a bomb .
it 's a bob !
you dd what ?
there 's soethin you do n't see every day .
so , we lost our jobs , but we got a rowboat .
and i 'm living in my parents ' basement again .
the good news is , i got a rowboat .
it 's so old .
give a man a rowboat and he 'll ...
i 'm thinking we should avoid pushing any more buttons !
you got us ...
i do n't know how .
rw ?
we got to even out the weigt a little .
can i be the rudder ?
you re not rowing togethr .
no , you 're going the wrong way .
it 's not a metaphor .
it 's a girl .
well , it 's kind of funny .
quickly , come up .
it 's splendid to meet you .
i 'm eloise , princess of monteria , and this is my butler , willry .
we have n't mch time .
well , you 're the heroes .
any questions ?
i mean no disrespect , but these men hardly seem the heroic type .
she thinks we 're , uh ...
heroes .
perhaps they plucked it from th ocean or stole it from the real heroes .
i mean , look how they 're dressed .
buy go-carts ?
no , be heroes .
they do n't know that .
she called us heroes .
oh , come on , how hard could it be ?
it 's kind of nice to be called a hero .
well , gentlemen , are you ready for adventure ?
point the way !
oh , you 'e not pirates , are you ?
we sure are n't cabin boys .
we 're riendly pirates , sort of .
oh .
oh , no , we do n't do any of that stuff .
that 's right .
how comforting .
well , then , there 's no time to spare .
great .
how do you start this thing ?
what a kidder .
elliot , let me take the wheel .
you cramble up to the yard and unfurl the topsail .
certainly .
where are my manners ?
it 's the recording thing with the tv thing in the future .
tea would be lovely .
real pointy ones .
these treacherous waters shelter many a desperate pirate .
a skilled captin able to sail this maze will find , a its center , the inn of jolly joe , a popular pirte haunt .
we can not turn back .
captain , are you up to the task ?
why , exactly , do we need to go there ?
to find ot more about this .
you can cut a can with it and still slice a tomato .
if we find out who the ownr is , we 'll be closer to finding alexander .
we ust do whatever it takes to rescue my brother , willory .
does anyone know where the bathroom is ?
oh .
do n't worry about a thing , willory .
looking good , captain .
oh , no !
what ?
quickly , my lady , you must hide .
we should drop our sails .
position three !
this be one-eyed louie , terror of the seven seas .
they 're bowline knots .
break the back !
back of what ?
four ..
looking for the bathroom
oh !
how quaint .
the princess has a powder room !
locked .
all right , where 's the key ?
two ..
i 'm not getting it .
on a big ring , just like at the gas station .
come on .
what cunning !
what bravery 
i told you they were heroes .
welcome to my kingdom , prince .
you ca n't hide , robert .
my father will send help .
oh , i would enjoy that .
watch your step .
my father will be very pleased that his helpseeker found you all .
you love your dad a lot , hh ?
do you have children ?
georg jr .
great kids .
you are a princes , and this inn is full of treacherous pirates !
yes , thank you , willory .
even princesses can do wha ' right .
right .
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
grab your root beer , hold it high !
whack your shipmate in the eye !
watch your back , it 's jolly joe 's !
grab your root beer , hold it high !
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
keep it up , lads !
spin around and do-si-do
watch your step , it 's jolly joe 's
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
watch your backs , scalawagons !
and when we 've pillaged all our foes
grab a keg of ginger ale hop up on a wooden pail
here ai n't no place like jolly joe 's !
argh , agh , argh , argh , argh
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , arg , argh , argh
argh , great !
argh !
that deck 's got to be swabbed .
i was wondering if you could , if you could tell me ..
what 's the mtter there ?
let me try .
argh !
not a bit !
were you cruel and unusual ?
grab a chair , and join the game !
come on i .
serve them up , pou them up , pull them up .
ahem !
s hat a yes or a no ?
aye , lad .
the cutlass belongs to robert .
robert the terrible .
you have his cutlas , but you 're not he .
the others were fooled , but i know better .
you know where we could find this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of an island , past the rocks of malabar .
not that i 'd go looking for it .
and why shoul n't they ?
they o n't call him robert the terribe for nothing .
he 's the king 's own brother , but he 's as bad as the king is good .
and , fr his treachery , was banshed from monteria .
so he 's a little nasty .
a litte ?
story says he 's waiting for the king to step away , just long enough to grab his beloved children and take the throne for his own .
fr robert to claim the throne , they must be gone !
on vaation ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enough adventure fr this gourd .
claring tables is really kind of fun when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
were are you going ?
somewhere else .
the helpseeker brought you here , and only the helpseeker can send yo back .
just get me back to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're our heroes !
rave as lions and cunning as foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
who are you ?
 do n't know .
i 'm like a sleepy little panda .
there 's no island anwhere .
i 'l leave the interpretation up to you .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work will be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice rig to t .
great pan , george .
raise the mast on the steadfast !
we play the haddock for a hat trick
we got the hammocks on the main deck
we got the butler doing the henpeck
screaming so
we do n't know
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a relic from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm eeing no heroes
we 're on the bad mood swing
we have n't done one thing
not even the minimum daily requirement
but if you 're feeling a little seasick
and you want to get off the guilt trip
what ae you gon na how him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taking up the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheel keep an ven keel
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's it .
the island may still lie ahead .
what is that ?
el remolino , the great whirlpool !
i thought it was pirate legend , but there it is .
captain george 's death cruise ,
brought to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thought you were o our side .
thank you , george .
might be a giant whirlpool .
that whilpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huh .
how about that ?
water droplet in the air reflecting the sky so prfectly they block the sland from view .
rght on time .
and look who they left behind .
do you think tere are snakes on this island ?
'cause snakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
and spiders and bears .
i do n't follow you .
sail t te rocks , do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here with captain weather channel on my way to be sliced and diced by edwad scissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i were a cave , where would i be ?
we ca n't sneak up on them in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i do n't know .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailor were to look for me ,
the east is where he 'd start .
he 'd reach the isle of walking rocks
and the clapping pass would part .
then gaze with pride upon my keep ,
not found on any chart ,
till he ould spy my steely eye
ooh .
copyright robert te terrible .
oh , yeah .
so , what do we got ?
we hea east to ..
holy mackerel !
what ?
pieces of eght ?
spanish gold ?
even better .
cheese curls !
i 'm not goin back to the oat .
what do you mean you 're not going back to the boat ?
the way i see it , i have two choices .
but , the priness , she hinks we 're heroes .
we are n't any of those things .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
here do i start ?
how about you , my little friend ?
what ?
she 's sailing away .
maybe she did n't need them after all .
are you beeping ?
the ball .
what ?
it means our work is done .
where 's the rowboat ?
we can go home .
hold on a sec .
how log has that been here ?
it 's ne of robert 's boats .
it 's blinking !
something ai n't right .
they 've got the princess !
we got to help her !
come on !
listen , when the ball blinks , our work is done and we can go home .
do n't you want to go home ?
but i also want them to want to see me .
you know , maybe the reason they do n't look up to me is because i have n't given them something worth looking up to .
it was wrong about that .
it could be wrng about this , too .
if you want to go home , you can o home .
but eloie needs me .
let 's go save a princess !
help is on the way !
what kind of a crazy b movie am i in ?
let 's be reasonable .
i was n't really going to eat you , but you were impersonating a snack food !
i think you 're right .
then we 'll just have to follo the clues .
head east to the island of walkin rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like roaches !
i bet george knew about those little things from the weather channel , too .
it is n't worth it .
eaten by his own favorite snack food .
at least that one day , from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'd want me to come back .
what ?
sorry , boys !
gourd is off the menu !
hat do you want , robert ?
ineed .
he took monteria 's wealth , our wealth , my wealth , and squandered it on strangers .
whe the crown is mine , i an once again enjoy the benefits of royalty .
you 're not strong enough to take the crown from my father 's head .
of course , i ca n't just leave them in the harbr waiting , or i 'll blow up my own ships .
he did n't say .
alexander !
suely you must know when your father is returning !
if you can manage to remember ,
you have two hours to think it over .
put them in their cell .
oh , papa 's got a pork chop , nellie ,
do n't you like it ?
after the 32nd verse , it grates .
but there 's supposed to be a pass .
right .
you thnk that 's the islnd of walking rocks ?
it 's got rocks , but they do n't appear to be going anywhere .
look at us , we 're walking rocks
la-la-l-la-a
george ?
gorge !
hey , elliot !
the rocks !
huh ?
there 's another one !
are you kidding ?
i think we woke up dad .
it was nice knowng you , elliot !
thanks for the adventure .
hey !
i 've been looking for you .
company ?
oh , no .
i hate these guys 
i think they like it .
oh , sue , yeah .
i 'll just keep running all day .
oh , it had to be me .
it 's not ...
would you ...
somebody eat them .
would you ?
that was a good idea , swimming over here with thoe ..
why ?
hang on .
now , this is the guy who wants to crush us like coconuts , right ?
uh-huh .
yep .
and you 're in on this , too ?
mmm .
okay .
we go to row through before it closes .
i do n't think that 's possible , and that 's coming from a guy who just swam 92 nautical mies without arms or legs .
well , you got a better idea ?
yeah .
we nee to get through .
trust him ?
trust th rock , he says .
guys ?
guys ?
guys !
found it .
we should be fine .
there you go .
too easy .
it 's not guarded or anything .
hey , guys ?
there 's bubbles .
what ?
guys ?
oh , dear .
like and trough the hourglass , so are the last ew minutes of our lives .
i m hoping his will lead up to the dungeon level , and that 's where we 'll find the prince and princess .
their dungeon has a swimming pool .
oh , no .
a what ?
hey !
so , what are we going to do when we get to the dungeon ?
huh ?
oh , i have n't figured that part out yet .
i was thinking we had a plan .
hey , i think we 're there .
it 's locked .
yep , this is the dungeon , all right 
and look !
who is it ?
it 's ...
that is one neat toy .
i 's a labor-saving device .
come on !
huh ?
huh ?
it 's not magic .
it 's radioshack !
we got to go .
but this way is ...
time 's up .
what 's this ?
someone wanted to spoil my fun ?
surely not you ?
oh , no , sir .
then you hree ?
the king 's heroes ?
he did n't mention it to us .
it id n't come up .
surey the king 's heroes would know of his plans !
tell me when the king will return , or say goodbye to the princess .
let he go !
it was all a misunderstanding .
we 're no heroes .
we work in a restaurant .
we clear dishes .
we clean up .
that 's right .
he 's so lazy , he ca n't even climb a ladder without giving up .
and george there , he 's such a wimp , even his own son thinks he 's a lose .
when all hope is gone , help will come from above in the shape of a donkey .
donkeys 
we 're not donkeys .
we 're cabin boys .
but even cabin boys can do what 's right !
follow me !
the ball !
everybody , len !
the rain .
we 're getting out of here !
i 'm feeling flushed !
you 've got to be kidding !
what a rid !
we 've got company !
row !
can i ask where we 're rowing to ?
the pass is closed !
keep rowing !
unless that pass open up , we 're doomed .
we ca n't get much further .
it 's not blinking .
they 're in range now , boys .
finish them .
father !
it ca n't be !
you know what to do , men .
where are you ging ?
return fire !
against the king 's men ?
on my word , brother , i 'm not finished !
for amazing tenacity , unwillingness to give up .
but the ball , it does n't work right .
we 're no heoes .
we 're cabin boys .
the helpseeker picked exactly whom i intended .
the donkey from above .
the advnture i call you to may not be easy , but yu 'll never journey alone .
my help is always there .
that was a test , which you pase with flying colors .
sometimes , a test helps us decide what matters mot .
the hero is the one who , no matter how hard , does what he knows is right .
onteria !
ar you sure you do n't want to stay ?
 want to see my kids .
and my ellen !
fare thee well , friends .
sure enough .
hang on .
you know , i liked them from the very beginning .

on the wings of a snow-white dove

a sign from above
a sign from bove
a sign from above
it 's a miracle .
a miracl .
a iracle .
a miracle .
i thought someon should tell you .
father tardon .
father pat , bfore yu start espusing yet another miracle , i advise you to take a breath .
he is with us here in auburn .
the people frm the revival of anels meeting are all talking abot it .
another miracle .
a revival tent ?
i warned you about this joshua .
hey , i 'm no the only one .
everyone says it ' a miracle .
i have kept my eyes open and my vision clear , like you advised me to ,
corrupted ?
as soon as this joshua completes the statue , i want you to end your association with him .
h 's my friend .
good morning .
good morning , bisho .
hank you for seeing me .
i 'll get right to the point .
he seemed simple enough , but he 's shown a powerful influence over a great many people .
the protestant clergy and i would like ...
ad th purpose of this meeting would be to investigate these miracles ?
we all have better things to d with ou time .
that i 'm glad to hear .
that i 'm glad to har .
my own father hayes follows him around lie a lost pppy .
this is a small fir , father tardone .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
father tardone , hello .
how are you ?
it 's the artist you have a problem with .
i 'm suprised you found time to finish your work , considering all your other chores .
i suppose i do n't think of them as chore .
you know , father , we could use your help down at the baptist curch .
join you ?
it 's the others whose eyes are not open .
to what ?
a miracle worker ?
i have never made hat claim .
a miracle worker ?
and i think it 's time for everyone else to find ot .
it looks very nice .
yes , they 've definitely made progress .
i know most of you .
what joshua has persuaded you to do with this church is wonderful .
but i want you all to look ...
does anyone do something for nothing ?
does a comlete stranger offer to hlp without wanting something in return ?
preaching ?
i do n't think you know what this is .
i 's a love letter .
a love letter ?
what about sin and god 's law ?
how dare you assume te role of the clergy ?
wait a minute .
what joshua has done is a miracle .
living next to each other did n't make us neighbors .
make us care about one another , did it ?
but by working together here with joshua --
led by him .
come on .
see the good in this man --
if you can look at this chuch and how everybody here has changed for the better ...
and say , this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no , no .
whatever it is you stand for , father tardone , i do n't want to be a part of .
i ca n't .
i wo n't wear this anymore .
i wo n't take it .
may god have mercy on you .
he 's just afraid .
o .
about this .
i am art of the clergy in this town , and , uh ,
i 'm too-
so i might as well ...
it 's not true , pat .
what do you know about being a priest , oshua ?
what do you know about th responsbility i feel ?
you 're just a guy .
you 're just a guy .
it just needs to be understood , and --
you 're wrong , pat .
hi , maggie .
made it just in time .
now , theo , since you 're th first ne who came to help , you should be the one to put the bell on the steeple .
take it easy , now .
that thing is big .
theo , can you hear me ?
you 're gon na wake up .
your work 's not done .
okay , now , come on .
come on , now .
come on , now .
wake up .
that 's it .
that 's it .
what happened ?
you fell off the roof .
come on .
you all right ?
thank you .
wha just happened here ?
what just happened here ?
i men , it's-it 's possible he survived the 40-foot fall ...
a certifiably dead person and you brought him back to life .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
i turned my back on my voction .
but i have overcome my crisis of faith .
i am not resigning .
i promse you , father pat , the vatican shall know of this , and when they do , this miracle worker will vanish .
he will imply run away .
you 're wrong about him , fathe tardone .
joshua ?
i 've never seen anything so beautiful .
what ?
this is n't a letter .
from who ?
i do 't know if i 'll be visiting the pope , but thanks for the etiquette tip .
hmm .
you know , joshua was invited to the vatican .
you know , joshua was invited to the vatican .

i came to auburn and saw there was work to be done .
you could say that .
i started to build and people came to join me .
you built a church , as i understand it .
for what reason ?
so you do n't consider yurself a --
a spiritual leader ?
you do n't seem dangerous or evil .
do n't let him fool you , cardinal .
i beg a forml condemnation of him by the vatican .
who 's come to auburn to mislead people , then i accept your condemnation .
then i accept your condemnation .
but is that truly what you see in me ?
that 's not wat you 're afraid of , is t ?

it 's actually about a young , energetic , dynamic , even a sexy einstein .
what would i see if i rode on a beam of light ?
pehaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wie .
what ?
it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system ;
te people ...
lavoisier .
why ascribe to an object a vague and immeasuable force lik vis viva ?
it is a return to the old ways !
are you capable of discovering something of your own ?
there s no right time for the truth .

thank you .
its author was a youthful albert einstein .
it 's the most famous equation in th world :
all aboard !
but hile we 've all heard of einstein 's big idea , very few of us know hat it means .
we 've only got sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but first ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughing at einstein .
he 'd united in one stuning insight the work of many who had come before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't think in terms of energ ;
on lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature woul begin to chnge all that .
young michael faraday hated hi job .
he was uneducated , the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to ecome a boobinder 's apprentice .
but faraday craved one thing .
all of his free time an hs meager wages were poured into his self-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of course , of course ...
pass , pass .
this way to a better life .
in the early 1800s , science wa the pursuit of gentlemen , something faraday was clearly not .
he had a rdimentary education , he 'd read widely , he 'd gone to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets to hear sir humphry davy , the most prominent chemist of the age .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of their day .
their lectures were hugely popular .
tickets were hard to come by , and davy reveled in his status .
they 're waiting .
metals ... unknown , that s , until i isolated potassium from molten potash and sodium , as i showed you last time , from common salt .
help me be part of the great circle that is your work and love .
my desire , sir , is t escape from trade , which i fid vicious and selfish , and to become a servant of science , which , i imagine , makes its pursuers amiable an libral .
really ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of a few years o set you right on that score .
look , i have n't anything at the moment .
faraday was determined to break free from his daily toil .
nwman ... meet mr. michael farday .
perhaps with god and faraday in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe i our place of work .
just stick to your job and do as you 're told and you 'll be fne , faraday .
faraday became the laboratory assistant , eagery absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excitement of the day was electricity .
another charge , newman .
but no one really understood wha this strange force of electricity was .
the academic establishment at the time thought that electricity was , you now , like  fluid flowing through a pipe , pushing its way along .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showed that when you pas an electric current through a wire and place a compass near it , it deflected the needle at right angles .
faraday , come look at this .
perhaps you can work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing fnding .
now , that is remarkable .
but if the electrical force is flowing through the wire , why does the needle not move in the same direction , parallel to the wire ?
again , newman .
what ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you that at the universiy of cambridge , electricity flos through a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridge , but it does n't explain what 's happening before our eyes .
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fascination inspired y his religion .
for him , the problem was a way to understand god 's hidden mysteries .
there is a small , almost persecuted group in ondon called the sandemanians .
they were a religious ...
faraday was a member of that group .
that if you opened up one little part of it , you could see how everything was connected .
faraday was different from anybody else .
by methodically placing a compass all around an electrified wire ,
faraday started t notice  pattern .
and then he imagined that a magnet had similar lines emerging fro it and that those lines would get caught up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking .
yes .
this is the experiment of the century .
scale up the magnets and the wires , make them really big , attach heavy weights to them and they 'll be dragged along .
although he did n't realize it at the time ,
the chemicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in the wire , which had combined with the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these various forces there was a common energy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston make of all this 
he 's written to me and assures me that he 's taken no offense , and he acknowledges that wha i published was entirely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
and what do yo think ?
faraday , my dear boy , you have my vote 
it 's the science that counts .
so , tell me , how does this wire of yours spin round its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
n my mind , i see a swirling array of ines of force spinning ut of the electrified wire like a spiraling web .
but invisibl lines of force ...
it 's all a bit vague , is n't it ?
faraday  iht i have a word in private ?
listen  faraday , let 's stop this nonsense .
i want you to take down your ballot paper from the notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i will not take it down .
my father and uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing eectric light to the streets of germany .
from an early age , i lovd to look t machines , nderstand how things work .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle when m father showed me a compass .
there had to be smething behind objects that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whichever way they run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shown , that energy could be converte from one form into another .
they also believed that all forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein was going to prove them wrong .
deep in the heart of matter .
a hundred years before einstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolution was just around the orner .
and they felt that oe of the first tasks that lay ahead of them was to rationalize and to classify every single kind of matter so they could see how it all interacted together .
antoine lavoisier , a wealthy , aristocratic young man , decided to take up this task , to see if there was some basic onnection between all the stuff of everyday life 
all the different substances in the world .
his meticulous , even obsessive attention to detail ...
was also to be his downfall .
your precise observations commend you as a lady of scientific curiosity ,
most unusual .
for te last five weeks ,  have aken nothing but milk .
i would rather ie than fast on milk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the greatest of respect to a member of the royal academy of sciences , yur gut mst think your throat has been slit !
how dare you insult the count ?
do n' forget what the count offers ... not just marriage , but think of how you will be introdced to all the salons .
you will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to marry d'amerval ?
then i must contrive to save you .
lavoisier was n't a sientist by profession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but hi taxes n the simple things in life ...
did not endear him to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidious young man did still allow himself the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anne paulze , the daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thus he saved her , as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 years her elder .
allow me to show you something .
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or iron and leave it outside in the rain for months on end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the mtals ...
is this a verbal examination prior to an examination proper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let me press you further .
hmm ?
every last citizen in france of sensible age knows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lighter and eventually disapears .
ah , but ...
i have not finished .
contain yourself , sir .
there is mor .
in a recently published pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier demonstrates that the irn combines with the air .
it , in fact , becomes heavier .
she learned english so that she could translate contemporary scientific works .
monsieur , that i a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheeky man .
messieurs ... it is my grat ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system , that in any transformation , no amount of matter , no mass is ever lost and none is gained .
over here , please .
from this end w cool the steam but , interestingly , we collect ess water than we started with .
so clearly we lose  crtain mount of water .
now , when we combine these two increases ...
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have collected ...
they are exactly equal to the weight of the lost water .
so what he had done is get the oxygen to stick to the inside of a red-hot iron rifle barrel .
now , that left he hydrogen , what he called combustible air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
in the next few months i hope to demonstrate that i can recombine this combustible ir with vital air and transform them both back into water .
i will re-create exactly the same amount of water that was lost her in this process .
it is my hope to complete the cycle ...
but to prove this , he had to perform thousands of experiments , and he had to do the measrements with incrdible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth from being a tax colector came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the academy asked you to assess his esigns .
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another carlaan with an idea to peddle 
monsieur .
i have invented a device which projects an image of the substance of fire onto a screen .
m device renders the substance of fie visible .
have you collected it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monsieur .
no , no .
f you will you excuse me .
i am extremely busy today .
thank you .
so that is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not conform to he version of the truth as laid down by the academy .
lavoisier .
he talks about facts , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my friend .
they are all the same , the royal academies ...
they insult the liberty of the mind .
they think they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core ...
do n't worry .
in my next pamphlet i will expose this persecutor of yours .
the crowning glory of this opus was their remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into wate .
to the french revolutionares of 1790 ,
he was denounced by a faied scientis turned radical journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a century later , all of nature had been classified into two great domains .
there was energy ... the forces that animated objects ;
and there was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mighty pillars .
the laws that governed one did not apply to the other .
but young , newly enrolled physics tudent albert einstein did n't like laws .
extremey well , herr eistein .
all the better for seeing you have escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that 's about all you ver do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein maric .
woul you care to ake a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell you what you have missed n lectures this week ?
he woul pursue his fascinations with just incredible determination .
we know from his letters that eistein , even from the age of 16 , was literally obsessed with the nature of light .
everyone he could speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on this beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us just imagine we two are youn ...
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to understand .
what would we see , do you think ...
with light he would reinvent the universe and find a hidden pathway that would unite energy and mass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long before the 19th century , scientists had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what light actully was .
invisible lines that can emanate fro electricity in a wire , from a magnet or ... even from the sun .
for it is my contention that light itself is just one form of these vibrating lines of electromagnetism .
maxwell and the aging faraday became close friends .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
o , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , s that magnetic charge moves , it creates a little piece of electricity .
electricity .
electricity and magnetism are interwoven , like a ... a never-endng braid .
so it is always pulsing forward .
michael .
670 million mil per hour .
that is the speed of light !
well , that means you were right all along .
maxwell had proven faraday right .
we have lectures in half an our .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwell and think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they said you could never ctch up to a beam of light .
even if you were traveling at 670 million miles an hour , you would still see light squigle away from yo at 670 million miles an hour .
yes .
you see how for hr it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveling at the same speed .
but relative to her , it just sits there .
o is light like that ?
common sense would sa that if you caught up to a light beam , there would be a wave of light just sitting there .
mabe it would be shimmering , a bit of electricity ad a bit of magnetism .
so if she was traveling alongside the light wave , it would n't be moving .
it would be static .
but maxwll says yo ca n't have static light .
maybe maxwell is wrong .
the light travls from my face to he mirror and i see my face .
that does n't make sense .
eintein was about to enter a surreal universe where energy , mass and the speed f light intermingled in a way no one had ever suspected .
long before the french rvolution , scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtee 's translation is still the standard text in france today .
muse , my memory causes ...
for what offence the queen of heaven began
to prsecute so brave , so just a man !
only the other night ,
i fear , howver , that my wit is only a curiosity to others .
if only my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and the world will fall at your feet .
no ...
in one snse , she is a woman utterly out of her true time and place .
du châtelet married a general in the french army at age 19 and had three children .
she ran a usy household , all the while pursuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mathematics .
she enthusiastically took lessons from one o the gretest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expert on newton , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they had a rief affair .
a fierce critic of th king nd the catholic church ,
oltaire had been in prison twice and exiled to england , where he became enthralle by the ideas of newton .
du châtelet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of jail .
and it is also true tht émilie du châtelet did have several affairs of a fleeting nature .
bravo !
she created an instituion to rival that of france 's royal academies of sciences .
ah , monsieur ..
you are young .
i hope that soon you will judge me for my own erits  or lack of them , but do not look upon me as an appendage to this great general or that renowned schola .
i am in my own right a whole person , esponsible to myself alone for all that i am , all that i say ... all that i do .
du châtelet learned from the brillin men around her , bt she quickly developed ideas of her own .
muh to the horror of her mentors , she even dared to suspect that there was a flaw in the great sir isaac newton 's thinking 
newton stated that the energy of an object , the force with which it collided with another object , could very simply be accounted for by its mass times its velocity .
he proposed that moving objects had a kind of inner spirit .
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four slabs along one edge and four alog the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this hue multiplcation , this building up by squares , is something you find in natre all the time .
it i a return to the old ways !
it is the occult !
so all leibniz is asking is , where does all this force come from ?
you 're infuriating !
criticize this , denounce that .
i discovered you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been droping lead balls int a pan of clay .
so , messieurs , care fr a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
messieurs ,
i feel mr. newton 's reputation dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis !
well ... te ball travels fo times further .
it 's the est way to express the energy of a moving object .
if you drive a car at 20 miles an hour , it takes a certain distance to stop if you slam on the brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hur ...
oh .
really ?
do be careful , madame .
d you think the academy is ready for sch an opinion ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor is it your husband 's .
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du châtelet knew tht in the 18th century for a woman to become pregnant at the age of 43 was really very dangerous , and all th while she was pregnant she had terrible premonitions aout what was going to happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a young soldier that led to her demise .
six days after giving birth to her fourth child , she suffered an embolism and died .
einstein pursued light right through university and beyond .
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors that no one would write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the young family sruggled .
but , listen ...
about your promotion .
i 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very charming , but kind o a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fts in around him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't boter him .
i 'll tell you what is truly mysterious :
the mahematics are fine , if a little unconventional , but this only works for big systems .
i disagree .
here e go ...
what would happen if one appled those forulae t electromagneti radiation ?
albet , you ca n't just take one bit of physics and apply it without proper regard to a completly different area .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linkages , the big theories , but would n' things be better all round if you jst got going in some small area ?
spoken like a true bourgeois .
they had cornered the question of light from every possible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it would take light to reach them from clocks at different distance ,
thank you .
what einstein did was completely turn the problem on its head .
that light would always move away from you at 670 millon miles an hour , even if you , too , were traveling really fast 
his extraordinary insight is that time ... as you approach the sped of light , time itsef wil slow down .
it 's a monumental shift in how we see the world .
you see , before then people had assumed that time was like a wristwatch on god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throughout the universe , no mattr were you were .
that the tick , tick , tick of this wristatch was actually the click , click , click
of electricity trning into magnetism turning into electricity .
it starts with his publication of a paper on how to work out the true siz of atoms .
two months later is the publication of is paper on the nature of light ...
that 's wha will earn him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sets out his thory of light , time and space .
it was the theory of special relativity .
in einstein 's new world , the one true constant was not time or even space , but light .
in one last great 1905 paper , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from our point of view , the trai actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even einstein is amazed by it .
i think i have found a connection between energy and mass .
if i am ight , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in three paes he simply stated that energy and mass were connecte by the square of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year journy into light .
there is a deep unity between energy , matter and light .
you multiply that by itself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science ends in silence .
the articles are published to resounding .
i think the gods are laughing at me .
for four years einstein sweed each inquiry dutifully , trying t explan his difficult , complex ideas to  confused physics community .
here are these universe-changing papers circling around , and the world is ... struggling to come to terms with thm .
luckily it happened to be the most important living physicist .
he has sent his assistant .
after four years of waiting , he is appointed professor of physics at zurich university .
from there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vast reserves of nergy locked deep inside the atom .
but he had n't bankd on the second world war and the genius f a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-year-old austrian lise meitner was painfully shy .
despite her anxiety , the young doctor of physics arrived in berlin determined to pursue a career in the exciting new field of radioactivity .
german universities id not employ female graduates .
otto hahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
 think i could rally help with the physial analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematics .
studyin radioacive atom has become so much a collaboration between emistry and physics these das .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
at this time , not a lot was known about the atom .
but then ... in what are called radioactive metals , things like radium and uranium ...
the nucleus iself seemed to be unstable , leaking out energy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus tuning into energy .
he was given a labortory .
she was foced to work in a ood shop .
i see you have n't set your hair on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
good day .
yes , wher would we chemists be without the steadying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
es , edith .
yes , well , i hve , um ... ased her to marry me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was warm-hearted by nature .
she had many friends and she may have wanted to have a closer relationship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear research .
meitner and hahn were leading the race to see if even bigger nuclei could be created by dding more neutrons .
so ... the ato , pretty familiar :
the ncleus , mad up of protons ... and neutrons .
now , the largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers our institute .
he was hounded out of germany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
what is it ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ...
e 're speaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn , who was known for his anti-nazi ves , did his best to protect her , at least initially .
not now , i 'm too busy .
we have to protect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbidden to leave germany .
lise ...
horlein demands that you leave .
you ca n't throw her out .
horlein says you should not come into the institute anymore .
well , i have to write up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to come in .
you 've given up .
when it became clear that meitner would be dismissed and probably arrested , physicists all around europe wrote letters inviting her to conferences , giving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague traveled to berlin and illegally took lise back with him on a train to hollnd .
she had lost everything ...
her home , her position , hr books , he salary , her pension , evn her native language .
she had been cut off from her work just at the time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
no matter what privaions she suffered ,
aunt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getting strange results .
he found no evidence t suggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size .
from afar , she was starting to suspect that something very different was happening in their experiment .
hahn and strassman are getting some strange results with the uranium work .
really ?
a couple of months ago , hah told me that they were finding radium amongst the uranium roducts .
an now he writes to me and tells me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that 's even smaller .
it is at least possibe that barium s being produced .
so hahn still needs you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done what you told him to .
it turns out that  big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now for four years , meitner and hahn and all oter physicists had thought that if you pump more neutons into this nucleus , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
realized this nucleus might just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so big that it has trouble staying together , thn could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but something has to supply tat energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million elctron volts .
no , no , no ... you 've split the atom .
of course , in the aboratory we 're talking about tiny amounts of uranium and correspondingl tiny amounts of energy .
but the point is that the amount of energy rleased was relatively large and that came from the mass f the uranium itself .
meitner and frish publihed the discovery of what they called nuclear fission
to great acclaim .
but betrayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it was he and not meiter who had discovered nuclear fission .
shall my scietific past also be taken from me ?
and why is it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enough .
in 1942 , an intense effort to build an atom bomb was begun .
all over america , secret installations sprang up under the code name the manhattan project .
she refused to have anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but robert frisch was different 
vast amounts of energy , in the form of electromagnetic radiation , were released from a few pounds of uranium and plutonium .
tody , young physicists carry on einstein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been used to delve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest question of all ...
in th first moments of creation , the universe was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atoms and it eventually formed the first stars .
t comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creates life itslf .
eventually , a massive star dies , the debris floats around , clusters together , gets pulled into the orbts of another star and becomes a planet .
building on the work of scientists through the ages , new generations are searching for answs .
as einstein hmself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyful .
it is as old as human curiosity itself and never , ever ends .

ｄａｄｄｙ， ｈａｖｅ ｙｏｕ ｅｖｅｒ seen a dragon ?
are dragons scary 
they 're scary .
bt they 're kind gods .
do n't eat things like fireflies .
they 've come .
what ?
but i wan na go too !
no !
you can give it to him .
does n't this carp look delicious ?
you 'll be able to catch something like this in no time .
you reckon ?
yeah .
something eels weird tonight .
i apologize sincerely for keeping you so late .
i stayed to long .
do n't say such things .
no !
but you 'll never know when they 'll suspect you ... the superiors ae so bothersome these days .
indeed .
i did n't mean to scare you !
please excuse me .
i wo n't take much of your time .
about what ?
accoring to there 's a plan to reclaim the ryuujin swamp and turn it into a paddy field .
that plan ...
this is beyond a meek monster like yourself .
p-please forgive my rudeness !
you !
kappa ... were n't you ?
but you were talking and looking pleased ...
stop lying !
you 're going to tell is n't that right ?
what re you talking about ?
stop prtending that you did n't hear !
forgive us !
forgive us !
forgive us !
do n't come here !
this !
give this and—
forget it and go back !
so please do 't get angry with us !
please forgive daddy !
be quiet !
n-no !
just us !
daddy ?
am i the only one without a holiday plan ?
this is serious .
it 's already july .
you 're not planning to visit them ?
where 's bali island ?
what 's there ?
i 'll find out once i get there .
damn you !
lame kikuchi !
hey !
i 'm heading off !
that hurt ...
a fossil of a tortoise ?
uehara-kun 
can you climb up ?
are you alrigh ?
you are n't hurt ?
wha—
it 's troublesome enough that the launry 's not drying properly at the moment .
do n't inrease he amont of laundry !
understoo ?
mmm ...
do n't mmm me .
now go get changed .
yes ...
huh ?
what 're you doing ?
kouichi ?
what 're you doing ?
umm ...
open this door !
'cos tis kept getting in my way .
what ?
what is it ?
hey !
no !
no !
anywhere !
what ?
quickly !
is n't this a kappa ?
so in this kind of situation you come home early ?
dunno .
you 're early !
amazing !
it really looks like a kappa !
where did you find it ?
at kurome river .
yeah ... but t got bigger as i soaked it in water .
coo !
so i thought i 'd name it coo .
no way !
you said the same thing when you picked u the dog on the street .
i do sometimes .
really !
it 's surprisingly cute !
please .
geez !
do n't ... kill me .
save ... me ...
sure .
so you could talk ?
did you feed it anything ?
i heard kappas are usully asociated so i gave i a few .
you know .
you have to feed it with soething that will give it more energy !
like what ?
let 's ee ...
hey !
eh ?
what shall we do ?
let 's keep for the time being .
what ?
are e keeing it ?
your brother wants to keep it .
why do n't we help it ?
she 's really annoying .
get lost .
geez !
thank you very much .
nno problem .
is t close to kurume river ?
what ?
coo was born i the edo period ?
they wore their a top-knot .
what are you doin ?
what about samurai ?
swish !
slash !
something 's wrong with it !
is it the samurai ?
are you scared of samurai ?
i see .
my condolences .
there as an earthquake .
so you have been buried till now ?
why ?
that 's because ... and the era of the samurai ended more than a hundred years ago already .
i 'm greatly indebted to you .
thank you so much .

i do n't wat you to be scared of it .
so what 's bent about this magari-ya ?

i hve n't seen any kappas in the last hundred years .
or have they all died ?
the wind blew .
go to sleep .

because i can !
but ...
what to do ?
your ancestor killed my daddy !
my daddy as n't a mischievous kappa !

he 'll be okay .
by saturday , he 'll be acting like a different chimp .
i just ca n't understand it .

why he 'd give me tickets to take you to the ball game .
he gave you tickets to take me to the game .
yeah , but i still think there s some motive behind that .
and he 's honest .
noboy can say he 's not honest .
and as far as being trustworthy ,
i do n't know anyone i would trust more than steve .
jen , will you forget it ?
it 'll revolutionize this whole industry .
we can put ubc right on top .

that 's good .

mr. rampton .
we 've had a tacit understanding to share technological advances .

just a minute .
i must speak for the justice department .

and it seems he does prefer the top-rated shows .
gentlemen !
i have a simle solution to the whole problem .
yes ?
oh , no , no .
we ca n't do that .
oh , no .
we could n't ...

you do n't bring enough men with you .
mr. chisum said o stay here and cover him with our long guns .
never as much good with a long gun .
so if you want these horses , i sell them to you .

murphy and company .
yes , i know the cmpany .
if yu 'll pardon us , we 'd better get underway .
there sure is gon na be some interesting people at that party .
there 's mr. murphy , honey .
it beats aunt martha and baltimore .
no place on god 's earth more beautiful .
about how hard things were in texas after the war .
she talked about yu a lot .
it was a gambl , all right .
and it was wild .
is he dead now ?
he 's penned up on  piece of desert the government calls a reservation 
that was the end of hs way of life .
maybe even closer .
tahnimara the comanches call it .
you had to be lonely out here all these years .
it was n't because there were n't women tht stirred my blood .
there were .
this was no place to bring a woman in those days ... raise a family ...
uncle john ... thanks for asking me to come and stay with yu .
that 's robbery , mr. tunstall .
i 'll pay you back at the end of the month .
laddie , you 've earned it .

here 's your bourbon .
on the inside .
confusion to the enemy .
mr. mcsween , how long have you known lawrence g. murphy ?
i was here on business recently , and he ffered me a proposition .

fine-iooking couple , john .
stranger , ai n't you ?
not other places .

this one 's just creased .

he 'll probably be your first legal affair .
what do you mean by that ?
i do n't know what i mean yet .
thank you for the help  mr. garrett , was it ?
looking for a jb ?
i saved a small poke .
i 'd appreciate the loan of a horse , though .

i think we can do bter than that .
what about he ?
sallie , i want you to meet pat garret .
this is my niece  miss chisum .
how do you do ?
hello .
just out for a moonlight ride on my lad .
who was with you ?
i got nothing more to say .
do n't worry , mr. chisum .
we ll get to the bottom of this .
one of my men is dead .
there 's gon na be a murder trial .
i ought to have a doctor .
not enough .
the sheriff 's charming .
sounds good enough .
you do n't have any idea how big .
i 've only been out here for a short time .
but i 'm putting together an organization bgger than anything the west as seen :
land , mining , cattle , freighting , speculation .
that does sound big .
and it snds like it 'll take a lot of doing .
you 'll find i 'm pretty well-connected here .
i can show you a shortcut to the whole proposition .
h got here first .
the pecos river runs through the middl of his land .
so ?
that 's a chessboard .
and if another man makes the right moves ... there might just be a new king of the pecos .
sheriff brady , jess evans , this is alex mcsween .
howdy .
what does he do ?
i prefer storekeepers .
i do n't intend to .
neither did riker .
all right , sheriff .
certainly .
first it was neemo , then riker .
what do we do ?
have some wanted posters printed up .
on who ?
he is ?
he is .
$ 100 , or ...
why get in a frazzle over chisum ?
you turn me loose on him ... tere 'll be a sudden funeral ight here in lincoln .
yours .
you just leave him alone .
i 'll take care of hi .
tht ai n't gon na be easy .
what 's the trouble , juan ?
we ca n't pay what they ask .
maybe they will .
about those prices , mr. murphy .
sign of a healthy economy .
why not ?
just in the spirit of healthy competition , of course .
de nada .
blly .
i hit where i im .
nothing else , colonel .
we brought enough beef for white buffalo 's people to get by .
i 'll deliver the rest at the weekend , if it 's all right with you and wite buffalo .
chisum 's word .
i am not interested in your opinion of mr. chisum 's word .
would you mind explaining ?
i do n't propose to dwell on them here and now .
hn i heard what happened to your cattle ...
you do n't have to put it in triplicate .
i get the idea .
sgt .
braddock will escort you back to the reservation .
sergeant .
straightaway .
all right , follow me .
straightaway .
just a minute , sergeant .
he 's a prnce of the comance nation .
the colonel said , traightaway .
have a cigar .
do n't mind .
one other thing you ought to know .
trace , you and cass take care of the beef .
frward , ho !
natan , looks like we 're in business .
after you 've served your tour of duty ... you 'l be an officer in the l.g .
murphy bank .
i 'll take care of the details .
pepper , look .
he 's led us on many a cattle drive .
'and if hou doest not wel ...

howdy .
which part were you reading ?
sre has been a passel of 'em sice then .
there sure has .
so long , bonney .
yes , ma'am .
it may be a chess game to murphy ... but i do n't like his methods , and i ca n't go along with him .
if i were you , i ' cut off the water to his property .
new mexico could use another good man and woman .
what would i d out here ?
you ran a store back in kansas , did n't you ?
we 're opening a store and a bank , are nt we , john ?
you are gon na kep our affairs legal , are n't you ?

i 'm going .
glad to have you with us , big casino .
thanks , little cino .
i sure left that garrett with a short bit .
i 'm not so sure you won that hand .
giddyup !
you sure you know how o run oe of these things ?
all it takes is money .
we 're short on sugar , flour , airtights and everything else .
if they do n't get here pretty soon , we 'll be doing business with l.g .

they say he killed a man when he was 12 years old .

there 's a dodger on him .
i 'll collect the bounty .
deader than a can of corned beef .
you just had to kill him .
no .
you know that gimp ?
i know f him .
his name 's dan nodeen .
half-crazy bounty hunter .
bonney put a bullet in him about two years back .
you would n't be looking for a job ?
my job 's collecting rewards .
pat , can you read ?
got through the grade , then the war broke out .
i never got to school much .
much ?
hardly at all .
but i can read now and do my sums .
h 's a good man .
what do you hear about me ?
i 'd say you 're running ith the best of 'em now .
chisum and tunstall are good company .
i been tree years a buffalo huner .
what 's that got o do with getting married ?
the smell .
death .
buffalo hunters smell like old guts all the time .
i 'm downwind of you , and i do n't smell it .
i 'm upwind and i smell it on you , billy .
what , old guts ?
yeah , i see what you mean .
me ?
all right , let 's go shopping .
horse wagon !
well , doctor , how is he ?
he 's to stay in bed for a few weeks .
see a man about an ambush .
that 's not the way .
murphy was in town uring te raid with 100 winesses 
he 's surrounded by the law and by gunmen like evans .
axtell ?
he 's a gtless wonder .
but he 'll act under pressure .
do n't do anything to make it harder for him .
right will prevail .
yes , henry , right will prevail , one way or another .
give me tha scattergun .
you mean , you 're gon na ...
get us all killed is what 'll happen ...
lawrence !
i was just coming to talk to you .
talk .
know what i 've been doing lately ?
no , what ?
playing solitaire , that 's what .
look t those pope .
pouring in an out like they 're giving away free whiskey .
yah , i can see .
you know what i think ?
you go back and play solitaire .
i finished it , billy .
thinks he 's some kind of a war hero , or something like davy crockett .
what 'd you say ?
nothing ?
it 's a sign your saddles are starting to slip when a man starts talking to himself .
i ai n't deaf .
well , mr .
good .
he 's awake now .
hank you .
how 's the patient , sallie ?
a little impatient , i 'm afraid .
a little buzzing in my head , but other than that ...
i stopped by to say goodbye .
goodbye ?
m. chisum go along with that ?
he does .
you 've made a fresh start here , ad you 've got a good future .
i want you to promise me that you wo n't do anything to jeopardize it 
you re gon a make me swear on the bible ?
no , lad .
your word 's alway been good enough for me .
i thought perhaps you 'd like to practice yor reading some more while i 'm gone .
well , thanks .
i wold .
i 'll see you soon , laddie .
yeah ?
i promise .
to william bonney .
j. henry tunstall .
good trip , mr. tunsall .
according to you , everybody 's worthwhile .
no , a young chap i never even talked to .
and i watched that young man walk to the gallows .
and i saw him hanged .
it will .
and sometime or sooner , it 's gon na happen .
it 's just gon na be you and murphy , head to head , and horn to horn .
and one hell of a fight .
but one of you has got to lose .
there 's your proof , sheriff .
n-good cow thief putting his band on my cattle .
yeah , i expect we ought to .
he 's leaving tow .
hold tunstall in jail until i get back .
santa fe .
i 've got to see a friend .
say , tunstall , you 're a hard man to track down .
thought you could get away ?
we 're deputy seriffs , you know ?
my congratulations .
but what 's that got to do with me ?
got to do with your rustling mr. murphy 's cattle .
in the second place ...
in the second place , do n't give us that fancy foreign talk , mr. fancy-pants .
look here , i 'm going to roswell .
he did n't even have a gun .
he had a gun ... and he tried to use it .
'blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom f heaven .
'blessed are they that mourn , for they shall be cmforted .
'blesed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness ...
'blessed re the pure in heart , for thy shall see god .
'blesed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called the children of the lord .
'blessed are the persecuted for righteousnes ' sake ...
'for your reward in heaven is reat . '
blessed be the name f the lord .
how 'd it happen ?
judge , my name is alex mcsween .
heriff , i 'm gon na ask you just once ore .
valverde , i think .
i 'm issuing warrants for the arrests of both of those men .
john , i 'm empowering you and your men to bring back those two ...
what are their names ?
deputies morton and baker ... dead or alive .
i 'm afraid of what he might do .
whatever he does , it 'll be legal .
jess evans rode up right after the shooting .
it 's hard to believe about henry tunstall .
yes , and it 's hard to believe he carried a gun .
esisted arrest .
that 's too bad .
t 's just too bad .
wuld you excuse us , jess ?
all right , lawrence .
howdy .
have n't seen two men that look like they 'd rode just as far ... a day or two ahead of us , have you ?
fed up their horses here yesterday .
where 'd they go ?
hold it up .
you 're gon na shoot us , ai n't you ?
i thought about it .
saw him hang .
said it was ghastly .
and hat 's the word :
ghasty .
you two are gon na hng .
pat , take 'em on in to lincoln .
let 's go .
hello , pat , charie , to .
you should n't be up and around , billy .
they wo n't be or long .
and you believe that ?
john chisum does .
we 'll see .
pat , i never did thank you for hauling me out of that river .
what promise ?
so long , charlie , tom 
it was the kid .
all right , cut 'em loose .
i 'm forming a posse .
damn .
the overnor is not to be disturbed .
but , sir ...
wae up , sam .
good god !
get rid of that damn fool , will you ?
what ?
him !
it 's all riht , george .
now , what in heaven 's name happened ?
believe me , you 're in the firing line .
you better do something ... before president hyes decides you ca n't handle this territory .
what do you suggest that i do ?
first , justice wilson is chisum 's friend .
you 've gt plenty of grounds .
what else ?
governor axtell has appointed a new sheriff :
and i 'm adding a further reward ... of $ 1,000 , dead or alive .
have you got anything you want to add to that , sheriff ?
john , since govenor axtell hung me out to dry ... there 's nothing i can help you with .
i 'll head back to mesilla in the morning .
all right , j.b .
i 'm writing president hayes a letter asking for an impartial investigation ...
by that time , murphy 'll have his name on everything between arizona and texas .
mr. murphy ... just how much of lincoln county are you after ?
you have anything to say to that , mr. chisum ?
you 're not just getting started .
the line 's been drawn .
but if one of your men cross my land , or even touch one of my cows ... or do anything to that store ...
i 'm coming to see you .
mr. chisum , that sounds like a threat .
wrong word :
fact .
billy , why did you come back ?
all of lincoln county 's lookin for you .
they ai n't gon na find me .
i 'm gon na get anybody who had anythin to do with it .
they 'll try .
maybe he wants the reward .
you know pat garret better than that .
look  pat , you saved my life ... and i 'm sorry i had to clout you .
put it down , pat .
you two walk away .
billy , all you 've done is bollix things up .
the governor 's appointed another murphy man sheriff .
so ?
but ou 're affecting the lives of a lot of other people .
maybe it funnels down to her , too .
there was a girl once ... back in texs .
i knew that the best thing for me to do was to turn my back .
let her marry a man tht 'd make her happy .
i 'll ride .
i did n' intend tht you shoul hear that .
helps me understnd a lot of things .
your father was a good man .
yes , he was .
i know you did what you thought was right fr all of you ... and that 's what you 're doing now .
maybe you should have let mother make her own choice .
she did .
so will i .
knock a lt of horseshoes loose in he rocks ... and all for nothing .
that nodeen .
i shoul 've killed him whn i had the chance down in guadalupe .
let 's get started .
first off , we 're gon na hit murphy 's bank and take his money .
he 's got a safe as big as a barn .
we 'll blow it open .
we 'll need dynamite .
we 'll need some more men .
about half a dozen .
there 's brown , curlock .
middleton 's all right .
and while you 're visiting the bank ...
i 'll be visiting mr. murphy .
i want you and some of the boys to deliver 'em to tucson .
no .
i 'm gon na find him , and i ' gon na see him dead .
hell , you know we 'r going in the salon with you .
whose move ?
wind 's from the north .
comanches call it tahnimara .
yo know , pat ... there have bee a lot of stories about john chisum .
about how wild he was .
those were wild times .
uncle john , billy bonney .
do n't you ?
not in the importan things .
like what ?
mr. chisum 's changed wit the times .
abou the indians and the territory .
he 's independent ... and he likes to d things his own way , but he cares .
but you heard him , all he cares about is getting those men .
in a way , does n't it amount to the same thing ?
billy wants revenge .
and there 's a big difference between love and infatuation .
johnny !
who is it ?
who 's down there ?
bily ?
no , sir .
we just need the loan of a little dynamite .
dynamite ?
d n't you think you 've done enough ?
bonney .
billy , listen to me .
i 've written a letter to the president .
this whole thing is a travesty .
i do n't know what travsty means , but i made a promise , too .
evans .
what do you want ?
alex , i everything all right ?
billy .
honey , everything is all right .
it 's okay , ma'am .
we just need some supplies .
at this hour ?
sue , go back upstairs .

nothing else we can do right now .
bonney !

i 'll get a bullet in the back trying to escape !
billy , we 've got to get sue out f here .
sherff , this is mcsween .

i give you my word , ther 'll be no tricks .
it 'll look beter this way , sheriff .
we do n't want any women getting killed .
no , alex .
all right , she 's coming out !
lawrence ?
i 'm trying to help you ... to keep you alive .
the army has no jurisdiction hee .
sheriff ...
i 'm unarmed , and i 'm coming out alone !
no , you ai n't !
not aone .
them 's my terms .
m. murphy ...
i 'm not coming out , nodeen .
please !
mr. mcsween , it 's your wife .
she 's going for chisum !
exactly , we 'll fight him on our own ground .
get some me by the river in case they come in that way ... nd throw a barricade across that street .
mr. mcsween .
all right .
damn it !
where are you going ?
going to warn the noon stage .
that 's what we 're doing .
murphy and nodeen 's men have th store surrounded .

we 're ready for him now .
it 's to keep somebody out .
we 'll be slaughtered .
i 'm going out there and talk to murphy .

sheriff , murphy ... hold your fire !
do n't , mr. mcsween !
you heard my terms !
get some torches !
i 'll burn the son of a bitch out .
we could go around and come in from behind .
we 'd have to cross that rver .
we 'd b sitting ducks .
we do exactly what we strted out to do , mr. pepper .
you wanted him on your own grund .
you got him .
billy .
ai n't like old times ...
billy .

you were the primer , bill ... but i guess , sooner or later , the lid had to blow off .
sheriff left town .
he wo n't be hard to follow .
let it go , billy .
be seeing you , big casino .
general lew wallace takes oath as new governor of territory .
do that mean the war is over ?
i would n't be too sure .

and this is ur national pastime , the game of baseball as played by the pittsburgh pirates .
i did n't kow a thing about baseball .
the sports editor wanted the woman 's angle .
all i knew was that pittsburgh was losing .
he 's out !
maybe even angry .
what 's the matter with you ?
he was safe by that much !
all right .
... on one base was too many .
you 're out !
great , tht 's the first time you thre guys have bee together all season .
the score at the end of the game was cincinnati 21 pittsburgh 2 .
you through , jenny ?
you hit them on a ad day .
yeah ?
yeah , they had a good one back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should talk to mcgovern .
everybody should talk to mcgovern once .
how do i get down there ?
you see that second tunnel there ?
yeah .
the door on the right is the pirate clubhouse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates ' exhibition this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the national league .
by the wy , i 'll not be wit you for the balance of te season .
steps have been taken and briefly , your announcer has been canned .
i 'll still have my regular tuesday-night broadcast and wednesday television and i shall continue to call the plays as i see them .
this is fre bayles saying , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
no , n , lady .
press .
gangway .
he 's unhappy .
i think it was a waste of time to send me .
i do n't know the game and i have n't any story .
but i can tell you what 's wrog with the pirates that mcgovern person .
and all those nice , clean-cut young men and he way he bullies them .
no wonder they make mistkes , anybody would .
if you ask me , the pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him .
hey , write it .
but e 'd sue us .
d your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anybody de out there ?
what a depressing job .
mr. kirney must have iked the story .
by jennifer paige , 'household hints ' editor .
every morning bout 1 1:00 , he left for the field .
this is the only hack in pittsburgh ?
you know the law , sonny .
you 're supposed to stay with your cab .
the bums do n't start until 1:30 .
his afternoons were spent like this .
the only place he was seen in public , outside the ballpark was john 's steak house .
i 'm going over and talk to him .
oh , stop .
well , there he is , cornered .
waiter ?
i 'm jennifer paige .
i wrote that story about you this morning , in the messenger .
well , i began this way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evi-tongued orator of the baseball field , is a surly , unbred goat whose mouth should be washed out with a strong detergent .
you 're not mad ?
i do household hints on the ladies ' page .
but i have a few facts and figures about your --
a few statistics that might be interesting .
for instance , last season , minelli had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i 'll have to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's average is way dow too , 93 poits .
he 's the obituary editor .
what do you hear frm ant ads ?
well , i realize figures can be misleading bt when an entire team goes as sour as the pirates well , i look around for a reasn , and i look right at you .
how are things in seventh place ?
catch me tonight , i 'm on in an hour .
i 'm gon na run you out of this town , maybe right out of organized baseball .
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in here a minute , huh ?
before i say good night , i would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unbiased observer who has the best interest of baseball at hear .
there is nothing personal i my feud with guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final score :
the pirates had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all by yourself .
did you think that was second base ?
you 're gn na catch a fly ball some of these days and knock your front teeth .
you fellas may not believe this but saul once pitched a two-hitter in a world series .
but he 's still in there pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do nt you think you 'e old for this pastime ?
we used to have a guy like hat in the three-i league .
put gpowder in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern always been like this ?
sixteen years ago 
where 's my ood-luck piece ?
well , where is it ?
o all the empty-headed , buck-brained trainers .
close your fat mouth .
i wan na talk to you .
an angel .
how 's that ?
i 'll make him an angel .
where do you sit ?
sure , sure , gabriel .
trumpet player .
none of your lip , or i 'll boot you over the wall .
now you 're getting warm .
keep talking .
someone down there has been sending up prayers on your behalf .
one punch !
before he answers those prayers he 'd like to clean you up .
there 's certain rules .
i 'll give them to you fast .
quit making life miserable for everybody arond you .
why ca n't i see you for one moment ?
stay where you are .
stand still and listen or i 'll blast you with a bolt of lighting .
now , do n't rile me , boy .
just behave yourself and we 'll get along fine .
lay off swearing and fighting , and i 'll win you some ball games .
you 'd like to win a pennant again , would n't you ?
how about that ?
all right , aloysius , you trusting soul .
wat kind of a miracle ?
wait a --
you 're out .
safe .
out .
i was about to suggest that possibly you ered on that decision .
yes , sir .
on the road , they won 10 games straight .
the team was sixth whn they played the braves in boston .
a har-fought game .
boys , boys , plese , take it easy .
now , i 'll handle this .
let me --
en straight games , and you had to go and blow it .
now , look , i --
take off your hat .
i heard what you said .
do n't repeat it .
now , look , the guy called me an ape .
certainly .
i 'll be tongue-tied .
shakespeare was n't .
okay .
i keep my trap shut , i win all my games ?
yes , i woul .
but when you need us , we 'll be in there pitchin .
who 's we ?
me and my boys , the heavenly choir nine .
in heaven ?
there 's plenty of ball players in heaven .
what do you know .
but vry few managers .
how do your boys help ?
who 's on your squad , the heavenly choir ?
not bad .
we might have run into each other .
on what bas ?
come on , a guy 's got a right to know his own angel .
your broken-down ball club is winning ball games .
i 'll see you round .
listen .
goodbye , and keep your nose ut of things tha do n't concern you .
all right , all right .
do n't go away sore , huh ?
sorry , mr. mgovern .
sit down , son .
well , i told minelli i 'd have dinner with him .
i do n't know .
a left-hander ?
i do n't know , just call it a hunch .
he 's reading hakespeare .
the tempest , i had it in english iii .
he asked m o sit down with him .
yeah , this morning he said hello .
he has n't chaned ...
waiter ?
you do what i sad ?
this is all right ?
thanks , but i 'd like to digest my dinner .
you did all right in the old days .
remember how we used to tear around ?
i do n't an na think about you .

no , sister .
it was geting to be a habit .
i had my story for the day .
yes ?
i 'd like to see a little girl .
that would be third grade , my class .
would you wait just a moment , please ?
he 's looking for a little girl .
i think you should talk to some of the others too .
oh , mr. mcgovern .
well , how do you do ?
i came about the story in the paper .
yes , i read it .
is she the little girl who saw the anges ?
well , i just want to ask her a couple of questions .
bridget  wait in my office .
yes , sister .
thank you .
yes .
federal case .
yeah .
go on .
would it do any harm just to alk to her ?
i do n't want the child excited 
yes ?
well , that 's just t .
why , it would be completely unexpeted .
rothberg 's fast .
he 'd have made home easily .
yeah , well , rothberg happens to have a bad ankle .
oh , i 'll light a candle for him .
it says yesterday you saw angels .
are you sure ?
with wings ?
sort of like uniforms .
hat color socks ?
i could n't see .
their robes were too long .
how many were there ?
was there one behind e ?

now , about these sort of like uniforms was there any writing across the chest like new york maybe , or cardinals or dodgers ?
heavenly choir .

you must have been praying pretty hard , huh ?
thanks .
well , you needed help , did n't you ?
we sure did .
keep them coming , huh ?
no , no , no , you ca n't see her .

if you want to know about angels , ask her .
she wroe the story .
look out , now , i 'm gtting out of here .
now what did i do ?
what can i do for you ?
honestly , i had no idea that story would raise such a fuss .
if i had , i never woud have -- oh , what a mess this place is .
i never would have written it .
goat , monkey , i 'm used to it .
if i were you , i 'd protect myself , mcgovern .
make a statement .
to you ?
why not ?
miss paige , you 're ruining my carpet .
stuff them with newspapers , turn on the oven and put them underneath .
yes .
did you teach it ?
what else does he say ?
joe , say goodbye to the lady .
goodbye .
that 's wonderful .
but does n't he ever -- ?
miss paig , a man only swears when he 's annoyed .
well , frankly , i do n't see how you can be in a shambles like this .
there might be an idea in that .
even when you were little ?
you had a boyhood , of course .
souns like a nce litle town .
did you play ball there ?
they had one of the saloons .
and one day they gave you a ball and a bat , and that 's how you got started .
not exactly .
any more down-memory-lane stuff you 'd like ?
no .
of all the stupid , asinine -
and how do i get to the cab ?
i weigh 110 pounds .
when the cleaning woman comes , tell her to burn he old papers .
put an air wick in to get rid of that cigar smell --
scour the ashtrays with ammonia 
what cair ?
burgundy .
she can call me at the office , extension 1173 .
there .
i could be a big help to you .
jut what i always needed , a gir with turned-up shoes , 110 .
yeah .
if i took hr t the ball game and we sat in the gandstand out of the sun she would n't see any angels .
i 'd write the story just that way , and that 'd be the end of it .
can i ?
all right , run aong .
comb your hair , put on a hat .
bridget and i got pretty chumy during th game , exchanging girlish confidences .
vanila okay ?
mac , i think that 's enough .
oh , jenny , how about dinner after the game ?
well , have fun .
that must be nice .
i mean , instad of having a lot of kis around all te time .
it depends .
i always say , why not liv alone if you can live alone ?
take like if you have someone arond the house all te time you could n't even come to the ball game when you wanted .
not unless i brought her with me .
what 's the matte ?
who ?
there they come , out on the field .
there 's no one .
you could n't possibly see anything there , do you hear me ?
they 're going .
jenny .
jenny , wait a minute .
honey .
honey , did you see any angels ?
how many were there , bridget ?
take this .
thank you .

i did n't drag her , she was dying to go .
fine help .
mcgoven 's angels trike again .

h , plase .
oranically , she 's fine .
he can do no harm , he 's an excellent man .

everyone was talking about angels .
if mcgovern needs any extra angel , we 'd be glad to give him a couple f ours .
ty cobb , one of baseball 's all-time greas .
well , all i can say is that this game of baseball has certainly changed .
songwriter harry ruby , omposer of three little words america 's number one baseball fan .

yeah , we did .
i 've heard some talk .
just a few weeks ago we were last .
wonder how it happened .
angels .
right there .
me ?
sure , the pirates are playing as a team .
because you 're not losing your temper , and yelling your had off and swinging on people .
you shuld turn the other cheek .
there 's two schools of thought on that .
my school recommends getting in the first punch .
well , what do you know , a baseball .
jennifer se it into the clubhous and all the pirates signed it .
see ?
all except mr. hellman .
it 's just what i wanted .
what abot grace ?

how long have you hd it ?
n the ottle in the cupboard .

yeah , yeah , keep moving .
i do n't like to intrude , but may i have your autograph , mr. mcgovern , on a check ?

you speak to angels ?
where they running ?
is n't it wonderful ?
his latest peccadillo , an dmission to the press that he converses with angels ... .
you could say anything .

i would like to ask mr. mcgovern a queston .

talking to whom ?
thre as n't anybody there .
and when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who was n't there , where was he ooking ?
up .
but one thing he said was , i hae a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable man to hang around second ase at night and talk to angels ?
much as i hesitate to say this i think that mr. mcgovern should take a long , long perhaps permanent rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a ball game , so hooray .
i tell you , it 's making me jumpy .
every time i go after a bal , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over somthing .
for two cnts , i 'd quit right now .
shut up .
you watch mcgovrn looking over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , e 's trying to be a right guy .
your job is to got out and play ball .
keep your mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he comes .
and here 's a flash that was just handed to me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh onight .
with the pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out thee this fternoon .
with this hanging over their heads , there s no telling what they 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
hey 're getting nervous .
not that i blame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apat tomorrow .
i would n't worry much about it .
it 's only natural at a time lik this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , that so ?
you know , i used four this afternoon .
who do i start tomorrow ?
yeah .
well , i would n't worry about it .
even i could n't ke him look good .
they wan na send him to the minors .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around next season .
yeah .
at least , we used to be .
i was there .
excuse me 
good night , guffy .
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen , i have n appointment with all parties concerned tomorow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidence , i have nothing to say .
... tomorrow for the pennant .
i 'm aware of that .
think this is the proper time for the investigation ?
m dear lady , any tim 's the proper time when th situation warrants it .
baseball is for the people who support it .
from new york , sir ?
and to , is it possible to talk to them ?
originally , man worshipped the sun , the moon , stones , trees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child will run to its parent so will a man turn for mfor to a belief in angels .
and when this belief takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustace danforth  trinity church .
rabbi allen hahn , temple israel .
how do you do ?
father o'houlihan , church of our lady , queen of the angels .
gentlemen , just make yourselves comfortable .
mr. commissioner ?
well , what do you think ?
do you suppose there might be agels ?
riht to left .
to deny the existence of angels is to deny the word of the holy bible which is specific on the subject .
from the acient hebrew text , we have the words benei elohim th sons of god .
thank you , rabbi .
it was an angel who guided the children of israel to the promised land 
the angel of the lord encampeth rund about them that fear him and delivereth them .
seeing as how there are coveys of angels flitting through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how i can get out of saying i believe in them .
i imagine the commissioner does too .
oh , please , just leave me out of this .
mr. commissioner ?
is it likely one of your angels r a grup of angels would lend suppor to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is it possible that angels would aid and comfort such a man ?
thank you , gentlemen .
if dr. blane would care to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
however --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?
mr. mcgovern , what are you afraid of ?
all right .
bridget white , 8 years old .
st. gabriel 's home for orphan girls .
does n't everyone ?
no .
they were helping the pirates .
you 're quite sure about that ?
you would n't just make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certainly , certainly , certainy .
no 
because mr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angel would be proud to talk to a nice man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , please .
what are you talking about ?
i will decide what is evidence here .
suppose i did ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nothing definite .
i do n't know f the court will let me have her .
it 's touching .
coe on , stop hat .
stop that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think , in view of the facts all things considered this case is dismissed .
hey , fellas , what 's with guffy ?
sure , sure .
he was okay all the time .
he i n' no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , you heard what the ella said .
ust stick to your drivin , will you ?
i nly hit him once or twice .
because when yo busted that bridgework , you also busted our agreement .
fro now on , you 're on your own 
it 's no joke .
you ca n't walk out on me now .
i need you .
do n't worry , you 've been on your own a lot the last eight weeks .
i o n't like to be on my own .
you used to be .
you 've larned someting , guffy .
we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , ca n't make it .
tell that cb driver to slow down .
so long , guffy .
come ack here a minute , will you ?
the boys in the press box are asking .
they wan na know who 's gon na pitch .
let 's do it , boy .
for new york , barberry catching , tole pitching .
hellman ?
take care of te bullpen , will you , boy ?
yea , sure .
ad it 's over the left-field wall for a ome run .
safe .
there 's another hit .
see any angels yet ?
new york 1 , pittsburgh nothing .
come on , vince boy , let 's go to wrk .
get a hit , boy .
you 're out .
all right , only one away .
lay into it , tony boy .

mandekic pulls up safe at second .
to away and rube ronson coming up .
all right , rube .
al right , let 's get out .
let 's go 
here we are at the top of the ninth , the final frame with a score still pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
one away .
seems to be giving im some trouble .
either it 's pain or those giant aerages .
and he takes his base .
hit by a pitched ball .
well , hellman seems to be losing control in there .
leaping high in the air and spearing the ball .
he 'll nver make it .
ball one .
take him ot !
get him out of there !
the fans are yelling to take hellman out .
get him out of there !
get him out of there !
and those pirate fans are really mad now .
get him out of there !
take him out !
yank him !
what do you think , saul ?
i 'm tied , but i 'd sure like to try .
it 's your ball game .
he 's leaving hellman in .
coming up to the plate now is dobbie roscalla who leads the league in runs batted in .
if he bats one now , mr. mcgovern had better leave town .
strie !
oh , if he ever connected with that one ... .
he 's a very tired pitcher right now 
for what ?
pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
and of course , a pennant for the pirates .
well , somebody must have helped me , not only on the ball field ither .
i wonder who they were .
walter johnson , john mcgraw , christy mathewso eddie cllins , lou gehrig , babe ruth .
play ball .
â™ªâ™ª

we all do .
he ll be humliated .
and then we can cancel the party .
you 're just disappointed because you ca n't brag to your buddies .
honey , you want him to be a superero just as much as i do .
i just always thought scott would go into the family business .
honey , all he really needs is a glimpse of some power
if he could morph like his grandmother ,  'd be happy .
oh , dad , can  just take that , please ?

hey , dad .
the guys from the bank robbery escaped .
all the cells opened automatically .
i bet they 're calling it a computer malfunction .
yeah .

oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
at first i thought the criminals used some ort
it could 've been generated wihin te computer itself .
silver charge , take a look .
i 'm on it .
very good work .
it really works !
every single one of them !
recycling ?
looks like we can make 'em do anything we want .

i did n't even notice .
hey , randy , think fast !
hey , scott , think fast !
why 'd you do that ?
now she 's gon na think i ca n't catch .
yeah .
now that you have these powers ,
you 're gon na have to be a lt more careful .
aluminum foil is the one thing
that crews p our molecular structure .
too much of it can kill us !
you 're right though .

i mea , we owe it to the planet
we 'll meet up with you later .
cool .
bye .
actually , i added a little pizazz to today 's lesson .

buy anything i want 'em to buy ,
watch anything i want 'em to watch .
you see , nina 's problem is , she wants to do too much 
i mean , she 's not gon na be appy
and made meat-eating illegal .
me , i have muc simpler desires .
ten or twenty billion dollars would make me incredibl happy .
so we 're here to warn yo
that there 's a new criminal mastermind in our midst .
to brainwash .
malclm , what are we gon na do ?
you were right .
not if we stop them first .
we 're currently working with athorities .
that will disable and destroy their brainwashing software .
whatever evidence there was is cmpletely fried .
thank ou .
yes ?
speaking of fried ,
is that your chicken i smell ?
ok , chin up , chin up , chin up .
shoulders bak just a little bit more .
shoulders back .
'cause nobody respects a superhero that slouches .
that 's why they kicked him out .
that 's right .
other than watching out for the trees --
and fences !
... is that you have to go fast enough
so nobody can see you .
see ya .
scott , scott 
but you can practice flying at anytime .
see ya guys laer .
keep your eyes open .
c'mon , son .
letting you get used to how it feels , son .
i 'm flying !
i 'm really flying !
dad !

i 've got to get this game on the go .
ah , because if you missed ,
i 'd automaically be captain
mess up .
either you were practicing loopthe-loops ,
i 've never seen powers come and go like that .
maybe he 's hving trouble concentrating
everything 's ready .
excellent .
look , achieving greatness involves a certain amount of risk .
if today goes well , the superheros can prvide the muscle .
that 's gon na be able o stop us .
i 'm glad you could make it .
wonton ?
judy 's an excellent cook .
dad is so --
do n't underestimate your father .
powers or no powers .
thanks , grandpa .

the newest superhero --
warrio woman and i have decided
agree to only use your power for good ,
o fight or peace and freedom ,
and to uhold the superhero credo
of ruth , justice , and integrity ?
look , nina .
me ?
why me ?
and if we ca n't find his hideout ,
is that what you want ?
thanks , nina .

dd you know we have a ninth-grade dance team
and our squad 's been a bt , uh ...
ok , we have a statewide reputation
they have the entusiasm .
all they 're lacking is a coach .
dancing 's a part of my past .
studies show that paricipating
in extracurricular activities
i understand .
well , do me a favor .
um ...
are you gon na o it ?
are you gon na coach us ?
i really think i should become more roficent
some of the really popular teachers around here do it .
i 'd like that .
oh , was that the condition
the chess club will meet in the librry
be sure to bring your own music .
any questions , please see ms. bartlett .

i can not dance sitting down .
white socks , and clean tennis shoes .

she 's worse thn zavala .
is this dance tea or boot camp ?
sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i had to drop off my brother at my aunt 's house .
tardiness is unacceptable .
no excuses .
that leaves us out .
let 's get out of ere .
anybody else wan na leave ?
come on down and play your music .
choreo -- what ?
somebody had to be .
as i was trying to tell you the other day ,
if we do n't have a ittl faith in thee kids ,
how can we expect them to believe in themselves ?
where do you suggest we go ?
well , i do n't - sir , it was your office
we 'll take the north end .
you can have the south end ,
ok , guys !
player :
sorry !

what 's that supposed to mean ?
oh , and one more thing ...
i do n't compete unless i plan to win ,
so tomorrow we 'll meet on the track .
3:30 sharp .
if you 're gon na be lat , do n't bother to come at all .

thank you .
mr. zavala 's looking for them .

exactly .
he 's now one of the hotshots on the web .
and music sts .
and ?
and they 're looking for a head
hmm .
ough .
bobby 'll double it -- at least !
but n one with your skills or experience .
now with this teaching thing on top of it ...
they even have an office in london .
right ...
it 's only th term progress report ,
not an actual report card .
yeah , but even he would nt kick her off
it 's always been a pain !
what are we gon na do ?
well , let 's just talk to ms. bartlett .
chicas !
what 's ging on , marisol ?
s !
you 're wrong !
ms. bartlett cares about us --
yeah , right .
it 's over !
marisol heard you confirm it .
are you leaving ?
and tell you that you were the best ?
and tey asked me to start on monday .
i thought we mattered to you .
after all our hard work !
i turned them down .
you really did ?
we re a team .
ms. bartlett :
are you eady ?
well , what if we considered this one , big extr-credit project ?
yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,
and i 'll check her calculatios .
then you can talk to her math teacher ,
see if he ll raise her grade to a d .
that could work .
but you have to get her to take it very serously .
if yolanda does n't deliver an accurate tabulation ,
she 's off the dance team .
i like your otimism .
thanks .
boy :
enjoy .
hey !
yolanda !
so how re we doing ?
collecting 's easy .
oh  wow !
o , are we there ?
but we still need another $ 100 to get the uniforms .
chuy ...
somebody told me you were having a little trouble reaching your goal .
yeah , ell , where did you get all these cars from ?
escobar 's garage .
talked him into throwing the job your way .
ms. bartlett :
congratulations , team .
in our new uniorms !
i 'e been looking eerywhere .
i can not tell you how delighted i was
to receive your application ,
oh , this is my coach ms. artlett .
this is lynell elliot .
oh !
well , i wo n't keep you .
i know you 're busy preparing .
wish you good luck , and let you know i 'll be watchng .
uhh ...
you guys , i can not believe we 're actually here .
into a dead faint .
no before we compete .

woman :
y'all ready ?
â™ª dance â™ª â™ª dance âª â™ª dance â™ª â™ª ance â™ª
girls :
dance , dace !
girls :
yeah !
esmeralda :
you guys , i ca n't find our pompoms .
where are our pompoms ?
ok , you go that way .
i ca n't do this .
lynell elliot is out there .
it certainly tok me long enough to figure this out .
and being your best .
aiming to be the best is --
it 's fruitless .
i 's a matter of opinion .
you have done this 50 times in rehearsal .
and do you know there is more value
and that 's more contagious
than having a thousand trophies .
and forget about lynell elliot .
forget everything ...
except why it is you want to dance .
remember , sweetie ,
bye !

ribbit .
i think i have an idea where we can go .
buffrog !
star butterfly !
oh , queen moon .
greetings .
of course .
star , can i speak with you ?
well , it seems we have o other choice .
uh , welcome to my ... home .
boop .
it 's rainy season .
a , so good for the skin .
oh , uh , no shoes in house .
buffrog , wonderful home .
o , thank you .
is a bit of a mess right now .
please take a seat .
oh !
i thought everyone knew that .
yo , buffrog , where them babies at ?
babies , say hello to quee butterfly .
star , i have been so worried about you .
why ?
i 'm good .
well , when ludo took your castle ,
toffee i dead .
toffe not dead .
toffee inside ludo .
papa !
we have to go save him .
he is your husband !
star , i 've made my decision .
we stay here .
excuse me .
yes .
thank you .
i 'm sorry .
yeah , we all are .
of course .
you have plan ?
i have plan .
okay .
distract me from what ?
bad choices in past .
uh , we ould smash bugs .
great idea , buffrog .
your daughter is very strange .
we have many option of board game .
mmm , interesting 
okay , the rules of puddle defender are , h ..
um ... the rules are ...
yes ?
the evil bloodthirsty mewman , that 's you , must try and sneak past atchful monster parent , that 's me .
tht is horrible !
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
you are filthy mewman .
for better eating of monster babies .
is this fun ?
did you hear something ?
i hear nothing .
can you name a time when monsters have ever done such a thing ?
that idea had to come from somewhere 
because it was in a childrn 's board game ?
i just think that monsters would have less of a reputation i they did n't act so bloodthirsty all the time .
monsters only act that way to protect their babies from mewmans .
you may not understand , but monsters wil do anything for our children .
do n't talk to me about what i 'm willing to do .
to protect star from toffee !
but i have to keep my child safe at all costs !
you insult me , queen moon .
my buffbabies , they are my life .
i should have realized .
you 're a parent , too .
i ca n't believe you 're taking her side .
kids .
what 's their pan , huh ?
just avoid your problems to death .
great plan .
it 's a terrible plan .
i 've ot big plans .
but no , they stuk me in here .
i 'm thinking 
i have n't told y dad yet .
there 's something else i have n't told him .
all clear .
wow .
so what 's the big plan ?
the plan for beating toffee ?
i kinda just go for it .
oh , my precous little ribbit babies .
do n't you worry .
i 'm very worried .
i 'll see you after i destroy toffee .
this is my castle .
 do n't want to see a sngle butterfly face .
what am i looking at here ?
no butterflies .
get that out of here .
is that the last of it ?
and with that , everything in my kingdom is in order .
no , no , not again !
okay , a few kinks to work out , but overall , the citizens of mewni love me .
thoe especially .
here , i 'll show you .
greetings , young man .
no , my lord , they just do n't like you .
oh , honey , look at all that great stuff .
wow , we should load up .
fially , someone with taste .
thi will look great in our foyer .
it 's not for sale 
that 's it 
now , how about a nice king ludo coffee mug ,
yeah , we do n't like you ;
nobody likes you , dude .
see what i 'm dealing with hee ?
what o you want ?
i 'm not going anywhere with you .
that 's too bad .
it s urgent royal business .
why would i do that ?
i do n't even like you .
say good-bye to your freedom .
ha ha !
ho ho .
ludo .
dude , ludo 's gone completely nuts .
you 're telling me .
oh , i can ... almost taste it .
ha ha !
ha ha !
nice wok , marco 
butter yourself up , and i 'll see if i can figure a way out of here .
he dungeon has air coditioning ?
it 's a dungeon , not a torture chamber .
ice .
how are those shackles coming ?
 o n't think this is going to work .
river , did you eat the butter , river ?
this is n't your fight .
sh .
ruberiot ?
quiet , dude .
whoo , how 'd i ever live without a solid gold toilet ?
what the heck is going on here ?
he was miming that we sleep n is royal bed .
those villagers are so ungrateful .
i 've got that whole levitatoing king river to do .
i 'm gon na have to stop you right there .
a heavy burden , yes , but that 's what it means to be an artiste .
and you 're a buffoon .
the buffoon is merely the facade for my pointed ocial commentary .
that 's what makes me a true artist .
not as much of an artist as the mime .
i 'm not a soldier either , but there 's a time wen you have to get of the sidelines and get involved .
if the four of us work together , we can save the true king of mewni .
now , see , i would n't use that hnd gesture .
it 's jus been done to death .
you all make me sick .
hat ?
who 's here ?
who 's in my royal bedroom ?
you wrote a song about me ?
uh , shone his grace upon us all
i did do that , did n't i 
to protect us
great king ludo is great
he 's so great , great , reat , great , great , great , great
and mewni has never been better
oh , great king ludo is reat
what ?
i 'm the buffoon ?
yu 're the buffoon .
i make art .
yeah , well , yours are hack .
oh , good one .
you 're all hacks , except for the mime .
she 's a genius .
get them !
i ca n't believe this .
i almost had the key .
ca n't you two get along for just one minute 
hey , king , we 're busting you outta here .
time 's up .
so , um ... ready to ...
where 's my ky ?
i must 've dropped my key right in front of you , and you did n't even notice .
spide !
come on !
people of mewni , i am not afraid .
uh , you know that 's not mud , right ?
she 's a princess winning battles

the cure fo cancer has been discovered .
the cure for virtually every form of chronic dsease was discovered even arlier , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
although his discoveries were adhered to by hitler and the nazi party ,
dr. gerson 's family paid the ultimate price .
r. gerson 's seven siblings perished in the holocaust .
dr. gerson 's unpecedented gift of healing the hopeless lives on .
narrated by dr. a.f .
these scenes befor your eyes would be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air moves north and airborne transpot of dioxins eventually reaches the once pristine arctic .
arctic peoples are showing major helth problems , fro bioaccumulation of dioxins .
and from there , the poisons travel up the fod chain to polar bears , seals and whales  and then to people .
one thousandth of one millionth of a gram of dioxin can cause harm to th body .
trees , the ver living organisms that clean the air and produce the oxygen we breathe , re sliced off at the ground with the most careless abndon if there is a lmiteless supply .
at one point , it ha been said that a tree squirel could jump from tree to tree following the hardwood with coniferous forest belts from the east coast to the west coast .
they do not develop special functions .
as a boy in germany , in the late 1800 's ,
day b day , he gained insight in the relationships between plants and the nutrients they gained frm the soil .
under a microscope , actively cells known as chloropasts , busily undrtake the process of manufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculous process of photosynthesis begins .
these live cells and enzymes in vegetation are the nucleus of what we need to inges to heal a sick body or mainain a healthy one .
max gerson suffered fro severe and repeated migraine headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days .
after three years of experimenting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved , but a skin tuberculosis also disappeared .
446 of the 450 patients recovered .
dr. gerson and his wife gretchen had three daughers :
joanna , gertrude and the youngest , charlotte .
of all the children , charlotte ook a special interest in her father 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had spread throughout europe .
when dr. schweitzer was 75 ers old , he came to dr. gerson with diabetes and was also cured .
lighting up the switchboards at abc non-stop .
out of control !
unbelievable !
and the pepper neely anticancer bill of 1946 , document no .
now married , she had a son , howard  and a daughter , peggy .
charltte encouraged later her father to publish his first book in 1958 :
at the time of his death , n 1959 ,
the files have been preserved by his daughter charlotte wo is now in her eighties .
charlotte carries on the work of her father through the establishment of the
we have soe letters here from albert schweitzer ... and they had a very active correspondence , my father , dr. gerson and albet schweitzr , and his family were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter , he expressed his admiration of the specific cancer research that dr. gerson did .
of course , all the letters are in german and i 'm trying to translate some .
as well as the remarkable results that he saw , not only wth cancer patients , but with his wife , who had tuberculosis , and their daughter , who had a very undecipherabe skin disease .
lws in virtually all the united states prohibit any other tretment for cancer other than radiation , chemotherapy and surgery .
on this paricular day , two medical doctors from czechoslovakia , consult with anita wilson , who is executive director , about the ossibilities of opening a hospital in czechoslovakia .
... you boost the immune sstem , you rid the body of those years and years of accumulated toxins from th way we live ...
not a day goes by that we do nt hear something from a patient or a physician , or a group of people perhaps interested in starting a clinic or a support group .
in high school i was n one of those dieters anorexic and bulimic ... bulimia when it was n't really written about .
the finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fight for that .
a year later , that same tumor , the one that they thought could be a metastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 years old , my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
after being on the therapy for about a year , i noticed one day when i was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bone in the right side of my nose for the first time .
another staff memer , susan brant , charlotte gerson 's niece , at one time , was diagnosed with an inoperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 ears ago , and so ,
i can sit here and say that i am a success .
i wa diagnosed with prostate cancr in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and the biopsy .
they determined i had three sections of cancer , malignant cancer in the prostate an they wanted to take the prostate ut the next day .
i talked with gerson institute and with the hospital in mexico , and talked with the doctors and the patients .
after three months , i found tha i was loosing weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me was the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the doctor thought i was great , he said i ha a better psa than he did .
i am not an easy one to get along with , because i 'm a maverick ...
a paticular type juicing method must be utilized , howeve , implementing a grind and press device .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as ast as alcohol .
this juicer was originally designed in the 1930 's by a scientific researcher , named dr. norman walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be aptured in a glass of juice in minutes and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the patient .
as you can see , an entire day with the juices is equivalent to an enormous amount of food , which weights in a little over 20 pouns a day .
but just eating differen is not enough to heal a seriously ill patient .
nutrition is only half of the equation .
resolving the accumulated toxcity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentless .
realizing this , charlotte gerson included a chapter about t in a book about the gerson therapy , that underlines , in layman 's terms , the principles of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of dily toxic ingestion or precursor hit be when you get in your automobile prior of even starting the engine , you hav alredy ingested dioxins
) given off from the dashboard to the fancy ?
suppose you continue your journey and stop at a motel for the eening .
once inside , from the power witch activating electromagnetic fields , to the microwave radiation eaking from the oven , as it prepares your plastic wrapped , heavily salted and preserved nutritionless instant dinner , to the carcinogenic chemicals in te soap on the bathtub brim .
you are inundated with hits .
the soap and shampoo are just the sart , however , of what will be absorbed through your skin once you turn on the bath tube faucet , which will provide chlorinated and fluoridated water to help you get lean .
chlorine and fluorine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toilet seat has been sanitized for your protection .
but what does hat mean ?
the toilet paper will also smear chemicals from solvents to yes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroom sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply manufctured plastic cup , that allows serious txins from the plastc itself into the wter .
the artificial sugar and the artificial cream as a nice touch to the mi .
) that was the cell phone repeated , lengthy uses have shown to interfere with and challenge the neurotransmitters of the brain .
as we finally turn off the light to sleep , eectromagnetic felds from the clock next to our head will almost imperceptibly influence the slumber and dreams one hopes to have .
even the film to make this move uses extremely poisonous chemicals in its anufacture and processing .
as ridiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one more hit for your body to fight .
the good news is that most of these toxin can be removed with strict adherence to the gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comes into play .
unless it gets some help .
when coffee eemas ar utilized in conjuction with juice drinking it is detoxificatin at its finest .
three tablespoon of dip ground coffee are droped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is turned down .
once the coffee is done , it is strained into a measuring cup .
additional water ma be added to make up for water lost in stem in making the cofee .
once the coffee cools to bod temperature it is poured into the enema bucket .
that time , the plastic stopper at the end of the hose is slit back to release the air in the end of the tube .
simultaneously , he liver in turn excretes poisons into te colon for expulsion .
hundreds of holistic physicians , in the u.. and around the world , have been trained b charlotte in the gerson intitute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united states to treat and cure a diseased patien in a hspital with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides in souther california , it 's easy to her fo drive regularly to advis and encourage the endless numbers of patients that arrive at the hospital in tijuana , mexico .
under the care o a staff of physicians and nutritionists , most patients who came in with inoperable cancers and with no hope of recovery , leav within 1 to 4 weeks to continue the treatment at home .
after only 2 eeks n the therapy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer now .
do you have children ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer 
i was in alska , were i am from and i was diagnosed with a ...
you were iagnosed how , did you had a biopsy ?
he ordered the biopsy and the pathology came back with a carcinoma .
and you had ascites swelling ?
i had 10 pounds of ascites swelling in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy could also dry it up .
now severa doctors have told me that .
how much ?
one course .
after i was finished with my chemo and it did n't work .
then you came here .
wow !
and then it 's been about 2 cm a day .
ever since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typical and noral one .
always seking new ways to cheer up , empower and restore hope to the supposed hopeless ,
within the pages of each booklet are personal biographies and the medical records of recoveries .
healing lung cancer respiratoydiseases
my dad had told me about the gerson therapy .
my daddy told me about this , and during the research , i found out that the best way to cure yoursef is to do it the healthy way .
not put more poison into your body that would kill you .
and that what chemo did ... it kills your boy , the good cells and the bad cells .
whe i go down to ucla , i too did all my blood work and my mris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ca n't believe you 're one of my cancer patients.
that just really made me feel good every time i went in there .
i did not look like a normal cancer patient .
to me , i have charlotte and the gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heart , just do n't think i 'd be here .
when i was diagnoed with cancer ,
i knew of three other ladies that had the same cancer i ha .
i was 12 years ol when my mom was dignosed with cancer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'm steve , debbie 's husband .
when i first came into debie 's life , it was several years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ...
there is for charlotte the reluctance to get emotionally attached to any single case , since there have been thousands , but occasionally , a phone call would leave her effervesent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seen only in children .
it was discovered that the lung was too ridden with cancer .
and more horrifying still was the revelation that the cancer had made it all the way to the right chamber of her heart .
the surgeon than opened her sternum and started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from there , he moved t her heart and an opn-heart surgery removed the tumor from the right heart chamber .
again and again , with a vengeance .
now , even her liver was invded by cancer .
) the doctor said , ( ?
) hildren told us that she is not gon na be able to ahm ... the cancer is back and she is not gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or something , we were down , at the gerson , and ahm ... and we were doing the diet there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
) i had come down there sick myself ... ?
i had regular disinfections all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and we 've been doing the tratment fo two years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and life began to change for the entire family .
even the dog was happy again .
but the poisons are now being excreted and her body is building itself back up with powerful enzymes and the nutrient forces .
but where tephaie 's orthodox medcal doctors had only given her 6 months to ive two years ag , she has no astounded them , and of ourse , confounded them .
i feel very healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
charlotte observed that they run around playing and enjoying life , as though the scourge of cancer had never visited this resilient child .
there are also non-toxic , non-pharmaceutical supplements called biologicals , that are utilized in a greater or lesser measure , depending upon the patient 's condition .
one of the most important of these is a natural potassium , mix of potassium gluconate , acetate , phosphate in equal amounts , that dr. gerson put together after doing nearly 300 experiments .
this is extremely beneficial to restoring the potassium in the body 's cells systems that was lost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sodium , such as found in table salt and hidden within everything , from processed foods to toothpase .
table slt is a poison .
the ue of inorganic sodium causes displacement of potassium found naturally in human cells , leaving them vulnerable to attk by diseses .
dr. gerson 's potassium supplement is dissolved in a quarter of distiled water and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , essentially the leftovers , are used for fertilizer and animal food .
a true miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did in the past , really understood the value of flax oil .
that was n't anything that ...
actually , they educated us more than we could even educate them on the value and the benefits of how flax oil really helped the modalities .
the use of these natural , holistic supplements on the gerson therapy is part of customization to the secific degenerative conditions of the atient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but they can sometimes fortify gerson 's therapies effectiveness .
when it comes to helping the body recover , whethr from a common cold or caner , today , over half the medical visits in the u.s. nd canada are to alternative therapies , despite the effiacy .
and in the u.s. especially , t is estimated that our understanding and acceptanc of holistic medicine is still 75 years behind the rest of the world .
medically , we trail many third world countries .
it is imperative that patients have access to such food choices .
the organic food market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , mainly as the result of the economic law of supply and demand .
mass-produced commercially grown fruits and vegetables produced with chemicals and sprays are fertiized with only hree minerals :
but the plant , like the human body , rally needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertilizatin process of commercially gown crops , the plants wre sick and mus be kept on life support with more toxic chemicals until market .
this process is now repeted in the consumer , in simplified terms .
i know that in the past people had different prospectives of what was truly organic , and we would have some growers ome in and say well , their grows are organic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules and regulations such that anybody who did want t become organic would truly be in the same playng field and would have to abide by the same sets of rules .
we have found that the attribues o truly doing a certified organic is beneficial not only for the people , but also for the ground , etc .
so , that 's something that we truly look forward to expand pon and to provide for the local communiy , and also for the people throughout the united states and world wide .
by popular demand , undoubtedly based largely on the discovery of the incomparable better flavor f fresh oranic produce , organic farmers frequently start popular local farm stands ith delicious samples of their produce for thei neighbors beneft , efore shipping their product to an ever increasing world market 
charlotte gerson follows the gerson therapy herself s a life style of prevention .
she as no one as millions of others have discovered that the principles of the gerson therapy raise the bar for getting the most of ife .
now , in her eighties ,
using th gerson therapy , one need never aain orry by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesity is almost always nothing but hunger .
and people are very hungry becase , even though they are full  they are not ruly nourished .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , where the dead food lies in state .
for many , it also grants them a higher vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life .
day-to-day life experiences are fraught with perplexities that can be addressed to a negative or a positive wy .
for example , cocaine and heroine addicts destroy their cravings for drugs in usually less than 72 hours on the therapy .
the only obstale that arrsts or commences to subtract those books is lng term lack of nutrients and environmental toxicity .
when th brain detoxifies , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional fog lift .
he body is a miraculous in its design and flexibility .
these chemicals are found in virually all municipal drinking water and inflicts severe damage in the body 's endocrine system , particularly the thyroid gland .
but there are other semi hidden dangers in ingestion of daily posons that can be avoided .
well , the dental amalgam is now coming mre and more into the floor , even while dentists used to dispute it .
but in your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clearly demonstrated that lot f children have seizures and all kinds of mental disturbances from the dental amalgam .
the danger of the illegal street drugs in public and private schools is heavily publicized .
the trouble with ritalin is sometimes ... first of all , it 's never been tested on childrn under 6 .
and they 'r giving it now to children in preschool and kindergarden .
and the american services like the army , nav and the air forc , will not acept any person into the service who is ever been on ritalin , because they 're uncontrollable .
during sleep , not only is the nervous system replenished like a storage battery being charged , but the body rids itself of poisons , in a way that only sleep can accomplish .
nd with the bombardment in daily life of hits to their systems in modern society , repeated lck of it can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain development .
the developing brain of a child at this time in human history , must clear a number of urdles in a bid for genetic normalcy .
one of the more blicized vulnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially lead from older homes , where leaded paint was used pirated in the 1970 's .
remodeling and sanding of older homes produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
thse airborne heavy metals , along with numerous other chemicals in the food and water , are now unintentionally passed on to the next generation .
but the removal , known as chelation , of such toxins , even heavy etals , such as lead , is possble with close adhrence to the gerson thrapy .
even the body itself can overproduce a substance that becomes poison in excess , in stressful situations , if the liver is unhealthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called adenaline .
in an occupation that demands split second life or death decisions , the adrenaline flows in excess , and if not neutralized , can poison the body into illess .
the potency of this substance is proound .
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands , which are located on little caps on top of each kidney , it enters the bloostream and is dilute instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the purpose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and protect oneself in threatening situations .
the largest gland of the body , the liver , when healhy , is able to neutralize the ecretions .
many people have liver disease and do n't even know it .
for the detection of a liver problem via illness requires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full workig capacity before symptoms become detectable .
like many others who do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in the wildlife cener , their health and reproduct abiliy must be maintained at highest levels .
eventually , they were unable to reproduce successfully .
clearly , all carnivore animals such as these were designed to hunt and kill nd survive on prey composed of flesh .
their teeth , stomach acids and short digestive tract bear this out .
but the dissimilarities between wild meat eaters and humans do not nd there .
nvariably , some of them does n't pas thrugh at all , but instead get snagged inside tiny pockets in the colon putrefying not for hours , but days , months and even years .
th pacreas was never designed to break down animal protein or meat .
when meat must be digested , the pancreas is diverted from its important prtective purpose .
if we nly eliminated the animal products from our diet , the odds of getting cance , diabetes or heart diseas and the pandora 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american diet , referred to as sad for short , has totally flipped that scientifically verifiable statistic upside down .
looking under a micoscope , it is easy to see red blood cells floating around free .
surprisingly , some foods , ike legumes , soybeans and soy product are either deficien in nutrients , or cause health degeneration , by blocking absorption of nutrients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespread .
it 's caused by milk drinking .
and the doctors give it for supposedly curing osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the body has to maintain homeostasis , it has to maintain a very exact level of alkalinity versus acidity .
where is it going to take calcium ?
it is not absorbable from milk , because in the milk with asteurization and all , the enzymes are missing .
and the body ca n't use it .
so , on the contary , that adds to the problem .
i had canceled my health insurance when i was 34 years old .
and the reason was not tha i was very healthy nly , but the reason was that i 'm not intersted in a kind of hospital or medical treatment that might be covered by insurance because it 's toxic , it 's drugs , it 's chmicals , and i have , you know ,
and over the years , i 've saved n averge of us $ 2,000 a year .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .
even now , his application of this therapy is unrelenting .
today , gerson 's name and therapy is known and honored world wide by holistic physicians , nutritionists nd chiropractors .
he also auhors features stories for the bi-monthly
thank you very much , my pleasure 
nice meeting you .
charltte 's daughter peggy , along with husband giuliano and daughter etha  who live in ialy , also follow the gerson protocol .
giuliano , a poet , journalist , lecturer and author , recently wrote his own triut about dr. max gerson 's life , set as a novel .
this film would not be complete without a representative ecovery from one of the most deadly cancer of all .
meet pat annie from british columbia , in canada .
she remain xtremely busy .
pat radiates good health and has a deep cnviction about certain priorities in her life .
ironically , he deveoped cancer after pat had recovered on th geson therapy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas cancer , which is spread to m liver , gallbladder and spleen .
my husband just would n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 das , the bleeding had stopped , the pain had stopped , i came home , get he therapy for 2 years ...
after three months , my doctors here wondered why i was still living 
he asked me if i would have a cat scan , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't want to know wat you 're doing , just keep doing i .
i hope they appreciate me .
at the time i was fighting the pancreas cancer , we got a call from michael landon , you may remember him , he was on little house n the prairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
he would n't go down to mexic , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his family .
he went on to the tonight show and he loked wonderful , and he said he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after he did this treatment
and said he knew that was the end , that he should have stayed with the gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind that he would be alive today if he had stayed with the gerson .
it is a medieval castle .
finally , after 75 years and tens of thousands of healed people , the world at last is embracing this answer to cancer .
and in recorded human history here 's also triumph and hope over seemingly insurmountable societal , individual and environmental illness .

the purity and soundness of food is taking on a whole new meaning and with evry meal we are either diging our own grves with a silver ware , or ensuring a healthy , productive life for not only us , but our progeny .
your wealth , fame and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance .
your grudges , resentmnts , frustrations and jealousies will finally disappear .
so , too , your hopes  ambitions , plans and to do list will expire .

even your gender and skin color will be irrelevant .

how will the value of your days be measured ?
what will matter is every at of integrity , compassion , courage or sacrifice that enriched , empowered and encouraged others to emulate your example .
what will matter is not your competence , but your character .
on nursing himself back to health , he found the manuscript missing .
it took dr. gerson a full year to reconstruct the manuscript for his towering classic cancer therapy , results of 50 css.

this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for the governement but mostly ..
mostly for a ... a hllywood studio .
this what at the time of the 'good neighbor ' policy ... and i was my task to make a large technical documentary on the subject of the carnival .
samba orchestra .
voodoo ceremonies , particularly in shango which are practiced ... up in the avelas , those trange , native settlements on he ... mountains , which are right in the midst of rio .
he cam t my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happens not ony in south american governments , but also in film studios .
and the witch doctor assured e that this ... was deeply offensive and ...
and , i said i was most sorry about it myself and ...
i did wat to finish the film and i did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the time ..
uh ... already agreed on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finish , since so much effort had gone into it and i was pleading my cause for some time .
praying that we would be able to .
and , i came back to the office and found that the doctor had gone ...
and to the needle was attached a legth of red ... wool .
this was the mark of the voodoo .
the first story , 'my friend bonito ' , began shooting in mexico under the direction welles associate , norman ostr .
as producer of 'it 's all true '
at the same time he was preparing to produce an act in the thriller 'journey into fear ' , but his plan were about to change , dramatically .
and brazil 's dictator , getúlio vargas , had nazi sympathzers in his governement .
so , the state departmnt appointed welles , special ambassador to brazil .
we , the people of these united ntions of ameria , now stand together .
we ought to know each other better than we do .
it was more of a ultural interchange .
i was told that it was my patrotic duty ... to go and spnd a million dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
he had to get to rio in tme to fim the canival .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent ambersons ' and 'journey into fear ' t the same time o adjoining soundstages .
he did n't even have time to change his costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , the first part of the new latin american version of 'it 's all true ' , was temporarily suspended .
never t be resumd .
he finished shooting both films in time t leave for rio , but it was a real cliffhanger .
i went to the projection room at about two in the morning , no , four in the moring , and then gone on the plane and off to rio .
ask me again ... in six months .
the lights ailed to arrive , so he filmed 'carnival ' wih anti-aircraft lights borrowed from the brazilian amy .
i photographe .
ilming 'canival ' was like trying to capture a hurricane .
pople get tired , they fall asleep , they 're going to lean against a house , that 's it .
as it turned out i became fascinated with samba .
what was interesting were the samba clubs , and all of that which would have organized and told to people , explained what it was , socially and all the rest of that .
welles had discovered what the true subject of his film woud be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's bakyard is n't exactly ala it 's een gayer than ri 's front lawn .
it 's set to music , but the music 's all its own .
rich ...
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vargas had demolished praça onze to build a new boulevard .
so , welles rebuit in a studio for his technicolor cameras to commemorate the carnival of the streets now passing into hitory .
wlles joined the people in their protest .
at the same tie he began filming the story of another protest which would be the third story of 'it 's all true ' .
a cry of outrage from the poorst f the poor that electrified all of brazil .
he first read about it in time magazine .
fou poor fishermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demand that brazil 's president give their people , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazilian workes .
they ailed from fortaleza in the northeast , an incredible 1650 miles , withou the aid of a compass , stopping along the way to find ood and water .
jacaré was the leaer of the expedition but jerônimo , a man who could neither read nor write , was the pilot .
their jungada was carried in triumph through the streets .
three months had passed since their voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangaderos were still national heroes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' the jangederos story would complete his latin america trilog ... but jacaré 's olitical activities had made him a cause of concern for the vargas governement .
i think that the vargas governement began to recognize the fact that this wa not going to be a film that would bring tourists to brazil .
i remember the nigt we tried to photograph one of the tenement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounde us and after a siege of beer bottles , empties of course , stones , bricks , and i hate to think what else ...
we retreaed to a more photogenic district .
and , it occurs to me that since man and the world have to live wih one another and get alon somehow ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , and the reaction is :
e 's just shooting a lo of jigaboos , jumping up and down .
they dd n't even hear the samba music because it had n't been synched up .
and all i kept getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had made .
eventually  they cut 45 minutes out of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy endng .
it might have bee welles ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... the picture itself destroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a unny , beautiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was full of sailboats , putting up sail , getting ready to reeact the jngaderos ... triumphant entry into rio harbor .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we were devastated .
he must have made the decision at that point that he would make this film no atter what .
i 'm sure ... was haunted ... by the feeling ... that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice president was sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and send everybody home .
when we were recalled from razil there was till some money left for shootng .
not much .
i took that and went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and we made the 'jangadero ' documentary .
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , following their voyage and all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not get ... what they .. went for .
it kept them poor , no matter how hard they worked .
it was to ... reind him of his promises .
welles devisd a little lov story .
to get extreme low angles , he would put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performances from people who had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team fnished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a artime flight to the states .
once back , he learned that rko was not going to let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so , i was fired fom rko .
and ... they ... made a great publicity of point of the fact that i had gone to south america without a script and thrwn all this money away .
that ...
i never recovered from that ... from tha attack .
he hired himself out for the first time as a movie star to option the footage from rko .
for four years he desperately sought financing to finish it .
i tried everything .
i was near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many years of my life .
if i turned my back like they did on it , i would have been much bettr but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i went and had one of the cans printed up and found out that yes , there was some things of 'bonito , and here ws some things of 'carnival  .
it was orson welles .
ladies and gentlemen , here comes the samba now .
of course , we all live with our past but i try not to ... encourage it to misbehave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unprnounceable .
srdo ?
correct !
ladies and gentlemen , the ... tambourine is not a ... tambourine !
it 's just a rough frame with some kind of ( ?
cat skin !
pandeiro ?
-yes , something wrong , senor welles ?
oh , no ...
it 's all right now 
ladies an gentlemen , this insrument oddly enough , i exactly ike our tambourine !
well , that 's the way things are .
i ...
why ?
why ?
-well , because of the sound it 's making .
that 's a ...
yeah .
ganzá .
the gentleman here handles it with all the flare of a bartender shaking a cocktail shaker .
now ... we hear he cuica !
what 's that , carmen ?
cuica 
the cuica .
-cuica .
however , as you notice , it is n't beating like a drm .
one end is open .
when you yank it back and forth the ... that 's what you hear .
there you have it !
the rhythm of the samba .
brazilian babies can beat out samba rhythm before they can talk !
radio :
we 've spotted what appears to e a spacecraft just outsie the surfline .
alert rescue and advise to remain on station for 45 minutes .
and we 'll squat 7700 for a radar fix .
radio :
roger .
effect pickup and recovery .
base radar will vector .
come on !
let ' g !
ha !
ha !
yes , sir !
all right , open her up .
open it up !
welcome , gentlemen , to the united sta --
did you call the zoo ?
yes , sir , we 're in luck .
the apes will e hidden from the public .
the 'll be quaantined .
thy need edical attention , it 's availble right on the spot .
they are dresig up !
suitcase ?
uh ...
why did he do that ?
here you are , old fella .
have a banana .
zira !
i 'm yours .
i think they 're trying to be kind .
this cage stinks of gorilla .
cornelius , where are we ?
what 's happened ?
i know where we are .
i know what has happene .
in some fashion -- and i lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from earth  future t earth 's past .
but we saw the earth destroyed .
only since seeing it , we have pssed through a backward disturbance in time .
did you notice the dae meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship ?
we have returned to earth nearly 2,000 years before its destruction .
apes , at this instant in time , can not yet talk .
oh , the drive gave me tis report from the air base .
yeh , it 's the usual imitative behavior .
mimicking salutes , handsaking , sitting on chais , eating offplates with knives .
there was sort of
hi , dr. dixon .
the female 's a bit uppity , sir .
oh ?
i see you 've prepared the isconsin multiphasic .
we 'll begin with that .
all right , we ll take the female first .
arthur , would you set up a cha --
not a bite .
just as you ordered .
we 'll offe the banana .
well , why does n't she take it ?
because i loathe bananas !
arthur , i think dr. branton needs some air .
zira , are you mad ?
i did not call her mad .
i hate deceit !
and how in the name ofgod are we to know that unless we communicate ?
nd we can listen !
and we can watch .
primitive ?
could n't test the inelligence of a newt !
i am calm !
zira !
zira !
we 'll need a full autopsy .
let us know when the report comes in .
we will not hurt you .
poor dr. milo .
doctor .
you kille him !
no , i did n't .
he did .
one of your own kind .
he 's a gorilla !
well , look , there 's nothing to be afrid of .
do you understand that ?
humans ?
i 'm a psychiatrist .
my name is cornelius .
lewis dixon .
nobody 's going to believe this .
believe what ?
that primitiv apes can talk .
primitive ?
uh ... well , i mean that in our , um ... primitive , um , civilization , apes just do n't talk .
may i say something ... personal ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm aware that what i have to tell you may conceivably create
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was one of two that have been missing in space for over 2 years now .
have they identified the bodies , mr. president ?
oo ?
what would astronauts be doing in a zoo , mr. president ?
reporters :
general !
no comment .
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a little later , please .
reporter :
later .
and f the questions become less simple ?
and i am the animal psychiatrist who has been in charge of tese 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect your work , but if you think you 're gong to turn a presidential inquiry into a ventriloquist 's act , i hae to inform yu --
and i have to inform you , sir , that these two apes have acquird the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i repeat that they have the power ofspeech .
well , may we be told which is the female of the species ?
have you a name ?
certainly she can articulate , which , in itself , is extraordinary !
what is your name ?
zi-ra !
mechanical mimicry .
unique in an ae vocally , without a doubt , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
mr. chairman .
we 'll take that up later , your eminence .
cornelius , do you and your lawfully wedded spouse speak any language other than english ?
what is english ?
i speak the languae taught to me by my father and mother , who were taught by their
it has been the language ofour ancestors for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins , who can be sure ?
nonsense !
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkered , pseuocientific gese !
i 've examined thousands of them .
ad until now , i 've only discovered 2 who could talk in my life .
god knows who taught thm .
where we come from , apes talk .
humans are dumb .
i 'm not sure .
when the spacecraft first landed on our saboard , it was dr. milo who salvaged i .
he studied it and halfunderstood it .
half ?
enough for dr. milo to be murdered in our zo .
enough for my wife and i to be here now .
from where , cornelius ?
of course the female knows !
that does n't make any ense .
cornelius , you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpanzees are pacifists .
in a spaceship .
gentlemen , do you have --
no comment .
no comment .
as head of this commission , it will be our duty to sit through the facts of this bizarre affair and pass our conclusions onto the president of the united states for implementation .
what a load ofhogger mgger .
dr. hasslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
no , entlemen , no comment ... yet .
doctor .
you were marvelous .
they loed you .
but only to lewis and stevie .
oh , zira .
well , you see ... we did know colonel taylor .
i ean , as a scientist , i sympathize , but i agree that that 's a revelation the masses would not ake kindly to .
i think you did the righ thing n denying knowledge of colonel taylor .
what ?
they would have asked ifhe was sill alive .
and is he ?
becase from the winows of the spaceship ... we saw the earth ... destroyed .
i repeat , talkd to the presidential commssion of nquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the male ape where he was from , the female replied , from your future .
would you believe that ?
i think it is the only explanation .
but still something is missing -- and that something is still his real self paiting the second picture .
so he regresses further and paints a third .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that time is like a freeway with a infinite number oflanes , all leading from the past ito the future , however , not unto the same future .
thank you very much , dr. hasslein .
it 's certainly the most incredible story this reporter has ever covered .
they will , however , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotl , and they will be given an extended tour of the city .
this is bill bonds reporting for eyewitness news .
good night .
your luggage , ma'am ?
address , please .
the zoo .
madam zia , i represent furand feather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is your favorite fruit ?
ha ha ha .
and later , she 'll accompany dr. hasslein to the museum of natural history .
ow , for a look at the weather .
sunny california will not be exactly that tomorrow .
the downtown --
tired ?
how is that ?
we have heads as well as hands .
i call upon men to let us use them !
beastl .
and dima which means body frame .
its scientific nae is a compound of the greek kampto , which means flexible or bent ,
its generic name , therefore , is flexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i insist .
now , is there anything i can get yu , zir ?
well , i have a strange craving .
grape juie pls ?
lewis said only a sip .
especially in cases ofpregnancy , you know .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorillas ' war .
we stayed behind .
we never aw the enemy .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there was a tornado in the sky .
i feel magnificently sleepy .
the date meter on te spaceship .
and before -- before te white light and the tornado ?
before the white light and the tornad ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... somethin .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr. president , that one day , talking apes will dominate this earth and ventually destroy it by 3950 something .
and according to the nasa experts , who are still subjecting the spaceship to icroscopic scrutiny , the precse year owhat you merely inferred to be earth 's destruction is recorded on the flight synthesizer as 3955 a.d. , presumably .
alter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked our facilities .
he also became very unpopular , hisorically unpopular .
and we do n't want that to appen  do we ?
i am saying that our 2 visitors seem to be charmng , peaceful people -- or rathe creaures -- and that the voters love them .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the world , mr. prsident ?
well , not at the next election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes one day wil acquire the power of intelligent speech .
by zira 's testimoy , we know that she is pregnant wth child .
by my own testimony we know that it 's genetically possible for this child -- provided , of course , alwas that we prmit its birth -- to bar or beget a talking ape y a dumb one in a present-dayjungle or a present-dy zoo .
yes , mr. presient , i do .
i do n't know .
which future has god , if thre is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assassin would say th latter .
well , mr. president , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because he was evil .
we have no proof , hasslein , that these aps are evil .
mr. president , there are very strong indications .
are you suggesting that they were improperly interrogated ?
let us say unprofessionally .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convened in secret session at the request of the president , the commission makes the following interim recommendations --
the ublic should be informed
that the apes , after their arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arising from its intended publicity 
there is justifiable cause for suspecing
to the installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we were in spac , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of the earth melt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me .
but ifsomebody had asked ...
only the gorillas and the orangutans .
what 's the difference ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do no use the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys mn .
all we want to find ut is how apes rose .
and cats .
of curse , r man , this was intolerable .
so humans took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alert to the concept ofslavery , and , as their number grew , to slavery 's antidote , which , of course , is unity .
they learned the art of corporate and militant action .
he articulated .
he spoke a word which had been spoken t him over time without number by humans .
no .
so hat 's how it all started .
cornelius :
where we come from , apes talk .
you recognize your husband 's words to the commissin ?
yes .
so umans were dumb .
zira :
zira :
i 've examined --
i ca n't remember .
complete the word !
call for dr. dixon , please .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothal .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the comission 's authority .
and that of the president 
zira , i 've been asked to give you an injection --
-illing ?
will t harm my baby ?
lewis , you ca n't use tha on zira !
really .
no , you must n't !
zira !
zia !
you do n't have to tell me !
now count backward from 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this .
hmm ...
not so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an --
anata --
whose anatomies did you compare ?
apes and umans ?
ye -- yes ... when they died a natural death .
availale ?
goillas hunted them for sport in nets and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the various reflexes .
of the living .
yo ca n't make a dead man 's knee jump any more than you can test a copse 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you ere advanced enough to perform experimental brain surgery on living humans ?
of course not .
when you lft , was coloel taylor alive ?
we loed taylor .
we did all we could to help him --
corelius and i .
she neds a nap .
we must get this to the commission .
if you 'll be seated , we 'll get don to business .
by either ape towards the humn race as it is pesently constituted in this year  1 973 .
the male 's attitude is that
of a deeply interested academician
with the true objectivity of a good historian .
the female 's case is different ,
will have become dumb brutes
with the intelligence of animals ?
it 's been noted that what apes will do to humans
to dr. asslein 's conviction that these apes ' progeny
this is a risk we dare not ignore .
therefore ...
the commission unanimously recommends
that the birth of the female 's unborn child
i now declare this commission dissolved .
they are savages !
jabbing needles into my pregnant wife .
i 've done that too , dear , and worse .
they made me tell them everyt hing , cornelius .
brutes .
shall i tell you something ?
e ca n't live with lies .
how long ?
a wek .
they treated you like dirt .
ma'am , sir .
chow time .
i 'm not hungry .
well , maybe somebody els is who ca n't alk yet .
oh , come on , ma'am .
it 's pure vitamin c .
grr !
nobody makes a fool out ofmy wife .
you 'e got to come help me .
i 'll come right away .
itjust seems so cruel and horrible and-
i 'll see you .
unbelievably .
so do i .
but dead .
you 'd prefer the parents dead too .
gate four.just a minute , sir .
the lieutenant has n't checked in yet .
gate four .
well , i 'm sorry , sir .
good night , charlie .
okay , sir .
i 'll be off duty , ut the relie comes on at 0430 hours .
yes , sir .
i ...
oh , my dear .
it 's urgent .
the apes killed their orderly .
on the run .
for that , they must be killed .
it has o be done before we start  stone rolling that 'll gather enough poison moss to kill us all !
i 'll find lewis and get help .
i just lost my temper wih the boy .
science regards these apes as unique .
i want them taken , yes , but taken alive .
is that clear ?
quite clear , mr. president .
oh , it 's you , dr. branton .
the monkeys have killed
what ?
i do n't believe it .
drive carefully .
i did n't mean to kill him .
i hit him with a tray .
where 's zira ?
stevie ... she 's in labor .
get in .
stvie , you wo n't take us back to the camp ?
now , wait a second .
let me get this straight .
you are asking me to risk imprsonment for he sake of to fugitive apes ?
i do it for you and for stevie and for your two distinguished friends .
uh , notorious now .
the hell with notoriety .
stand by and see his wife insulted ?
lewis !
saint francis would have
never .
the irst chimp ever born in a circus .
los angeles is n't a circus .
lewis , i was not responsible for the eath --
look a heloise .
maa .
mama .
zira , do n't waste your breath .
you know the chld of two primitiv pes will never learn how to speak .
mama .
mam --
that 's good .
him ?
milo ?
milo .
congratulations .
but , sir --
evidently , we were wrong because you have n't found them !
if that 's lose , she ca n't have gone far .
where do apes go ?
captain , i want you to start an immediate earch ofevery menagerie , zoo , and circus .
i 'll augment your force with the city police , and i want to be kept informed about all results .
you might have lived hppily ever af ter .
but nw ...
i did it because i hate those who try to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him b dominated by you .
all i can now do to help you is give you this for the baby .
yes .
we 'll hang it around the baby 's neck for protection , huh ?
yes .
and now , my dear , dear friends , before the poice come and the audience gathers , you and your pretty baby must go .
lewis is on his way .
armando .
i should like to say good-bye to heloise first .
this is as far a we dare to take you .
the police have roadblocks on every main exit .
here are your upplies .
can you read a map ?
we 're at the city limits at the southern edge of this oil field .
over this hill , you 'll pass through more oil wells , an abandoned refinery , and you 'll be looking down at a harbor .
it 's a graveyard for old ship .
you can hide there for a week .
a week ?
then you can travel with them to florida , found a colony in the everglades , and lie happily ever after .
it 's time that you were moving on .
lewis .
you re the second human i 've kissed .
and you are the first .
she 's been with the circus seven years now .
he baby 's birth was registered 1 6 dys ago .
ha ha ha !
we 'll catch them sooner or latr 
later we 'll o something about pollution .
later we 'll do something about nuclear war .
we think we 've got all the time in the world !
like stars in space .
is n't it beautiful ?
yes , it is ... fro ere .
hmm ...
why do n't we get moving ?
we 've called in for helicopter .
how long till they gt here ?
what 's the matter ?
they foud zira 's suitcase .
oh , no , no , no .

tuesday down on the poteau river , he 's a medium-heght man with a black mark on his cheek .
that 's a description of tom chaney , tere 's no chambers to it .
he got that black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under the sin .
why are n't you out looking for him ?
i hve no authority in the india nation .
i 'd have to say l.t .
where would i fnd this rooster ?

your fathe 's gn , you 'll want to take it home , i expect .
i wo n't rest until tom chaney 's barking in hell .
yarnell you stay with papa .
when you ge him home , you put him in a better coffin , and you bury him in mason 's apron .
your mama ai n't gon na like you nt coming home with me .

mr. cogburn !
mr. cogburn !
i said you come back here !
if mr. cogburn thinks i 'm gon na be put off by a locked door , he does not know me !
i will be here when it opens .
best time for you to nail rooster would be tomorrow .
he 's due to testify before judge parker in the wharton case .
i appreciate your kindness .
at the rate of 25 cents per meal , i might just as well .
i was hoping you were enjoying th dumplings .
i ca n't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease .
the french is la boeuf ,
i call it la beef .
a right fancy rig , sir .
watch out for the chicken and dumplings .
they 'll hurt your eyes .
they 'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken !
you squirrel-headed bastard !
i 'd like to go to bed now .
but first i 'd like to see my father 's traps .
i 'll take a guess and say your name is mattie ross .
how do you suppose he guessed my nam ?
we 're short of rooms on account of the hngg 
now , do 't you worry about grandma turner , she 's used t doubling up .
this is your father 's traps .
the watch and the knife are inside .
what i your opinion of a fedral mashal called rooster cogburn ?
rooster cogburn !
he loves to pull a cork , i know that !
all rise !
yeah .
he 's a tough customer .
there 's no appeal from his court except to the president of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 're still sworn .
defence will cross-examine .
now , in order to refresh our memories , allow me to summarise what you said .
according to your story c. c. wharton grabbed a shotgn and killed marshal potter .
then you say the father swung his axe , and you shot him , too .
just winged him , or he would n't be here to pay up .
how long have you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot since you became a marshal , mr. cogburn ?
that was not the uestion .
how many ?
twelve to fifeen ?
so many that you can not keep a specifi count .
i have examined the records , mr. cogburn .
a much more accurate figure is available .
come now , how many ?
counting them two whartons , 23 .
how much more angerous for those arrested by you ?
was this revolver loaded and cocked ?
just answer my questions , if you please .
yes , sir .
i always go backward when i 'm backing away !
aaron wharton was standing by a pot when you arrived 
e was stirring the fire under the scalding pot 
how far did yo back away ?
something like that .
mr. goudy , do you have anymore uestions for mr. cogurn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogburn .
call the net witness !
raise your rght hand .
mr. rooster cogbrn ?
it 's pretty loos because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .
well , who 's he ?
well , who are you ?
my family has 480 acres of good bottomland near dardanelle in yell county .
my other 's home looking after my baby sister and my brother , little frank .
well ten , why do n't you go hom and leave me alone ?
mr. ogburn !
you can get a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile for each of you , and i 'll give you $ 50 rewad .
well , you 've looked into this right smart .
i mean business .
it belonged to my fater .
well this 'll sure get the job done , if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim !
i 've got some horse-trading to do , i 'll hav it by tomorrow .
well , i think tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medicine .
i 'd like to meet your family .
you want more , missy ?
i 've never seen chopstick work before .
chopsticks save your fingers .
give me your cup .
i do n't drink coffee , tank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lemonade , neiter .
yes , sir .
sounds like a mighty easy way to make $ 50 to me .
do n't crwd me .
do n't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective business all at the same time .
and $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advantage of me .
it is n't going to be easy smoking old ned out .
well , i hope you do n't think i 'm going to keep you in whiskey .
n , thank you .
genuine , double-rectified bushead .
well , sis , my price is $ 100 .
i will think about your proposition and talk to you again .
ow , i wan na go to the monarch boarding house .
you better wak me over there .
you can never tell what 's in a chinaman 's mind .
that 's the way he bests you at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i have a writ here says you 're to sop eating chen lee 's cornmeal forthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first plae .
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , baby sister .
a rat catcher ' too tugh on the rats .
give them rats a fair shw , they say .
well , what kind o a fair show did they give old man otter ?
you scared of the dark ?
wll , if i had a big orse pistol like that ,
i 'm not scared of no boogerman .
cream ?
i 've been waiting to have some private words with you 
i find a sweet distraction , as i suppose most men do .
i saw your mother yesterday .
what business did you have with her ?
it 's a likeness of tom chaney .
i ' looking for him and i hear you 're looking for him , too .
i only take one step at a time .
i 've been on his trail the best part of four month now .
i 'm a sergeant in the texas rangers .
chelmsford or chaney as you call him , he shot and killed the senator 's bird dog .
bibbs threatened to whip him , and chaney shot the old gentleman while he was sitting in a porch swing .
well , you need not worry about chaney anymore .
the sheriff iformed me that ou were looking for a man to go after chaney in the indian territor .
i 'v already found one for the job .
his name is rooster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the federal court , toughest one they ave .
you 'll have to tak that over with rooster cogburn .
it ' at least a two-man job o take im alive .
we 're taking him to fort smith and hang .
well , more so to me .
now , would n't a hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pay for killing my father , not for some texas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt .
one would be as unpleasant as the other .
lay a hand on me and you 'll answer for it .
the children of texans are brought up to show a little more respect for their elders .
you 'll push that saucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no egard for you , but i 'm sure you have enough for yourself to go around .
they are all for sale except those four scrubby ones .
the heirs of the late frank ross .
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that is out of the question .
that hardly concerns me .
your father bought four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it while it was in your care .
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he will make money , and i will make money , and your lawyer will make money .
and you , mr .
licensed auctioneer , you will foot the bll .
lawyer daggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.a.v .
g. , yes .
all right .
sit down .
the ponies have no part in this .
i would nt pay that for a winged pegasus .
ow , listen very carefully , as i will not bargan further .
my lawyer would not wish me to consider anything under $ 300 .
for that , you get everything except the saddle .
i would like to hav that in writing , for what i is worth .
when i have it in my hand , i 'll remit the exortion money .
you 'll find it in order .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
it seems such a shame to render such pirited horseflesh into soap .
good morning .
sleep late .
you ai n't such an early bird yourself , baby ister .
i just about give up on you .
i figured you 'd gone home .
yeah .
well , trouble is , there 's no slats in it at all .
how much is there ?
you still game ?
one understanding , that we leave for the territory this afternoon to get tom chaney .
well , you 're no going .
i 'm not a baby .
i 've slept out at night before .
papa took me coon huntng last summer .
first night out , you 'd be calling , mama !
mama !
i 've left of crying .
i 'll find somebody who is .
now , i know you can drink whiskey and i saw you kill a rat .
bt all the rest has been talk .
i 'm not paying for talk .
i do n't know how you propose to do that from the hog wallow you 're suk into .
if i smelled as bad as you , i would n't live near people .
i 'll be more than ready .
there 's an old saw that sys , one white foot , buy them two white feet , try them .
i thought perhaps it was you .
n , t was not i .
nothing .
i will call him little blackie .
what is your offer ?
i will pay the arket price .
tll me this do you entertain plans of ever leaving this city ?
yes .
i 'm off early tomorrow morning for the indian nation .
how did you light on that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with grit .
well , i suppose he has that .
i would nt trust him too much .
it ay prove to be a long , hard journe .
a good christian does not flinch from these difficulties .
neither does he rashly court them .
the good christian is not wilful or presumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong ?
i think you are wrong-headed .
i 'm having a little conversation ith the marshal .
he 's gon behind my back .
well , a fellow that carries a big-bore sharps carbine might come in handy , if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something .
we do n't need him .
got eerything redy ?
all but the gru .
there 's no hurrahing in it .
how much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
five hundred dollars ?
yep .
bibbs was a litle senator .
well , i guess i 'll just stick with sis .
the bibbs family 's put up another $ 1,500 for chany .
hve they now .
what are the terms ?
well , you can tell him to his face , you can spit in his eye , you can make him eat sand out of the road , you can shoot him in the oot , and i 'l hold him for you .
she ai n't going , anyhow .
she 'l make nothing but trouble .
aybe i 'll catch this chaney by myself and take al the money .
how 'd you go about that 
i 'd dispute your claim , i 'd muddy up the water 
i ai n't neve seen nobody from texas i could n't shade .
la boeuf , you get crossways of me  and you 'll think a thousand of brick have fell o you .
that reward money 's just a pig in the poke .
look at him grin , he 'll ceat you .
we 'll get your man , that 's the main thing .
you sorry piece of trash .
i 'll send it to you .
that 's a big stor .
you ve not heard the last of mattie ross .
you may well hear from my lawyer , dagett 
lawyer daggett ?
who 's lawyer daggett ?
red .
the river looks kind of high .
yeah .
well now , red , if i was to tell yu that , you might tell him .
i would sa , tom chaney , look out .
ca n't you get anything through your head ?
you 're not getting on this ferry .
i have paid my 10 cents for horse and rider .
red , take tis girl into town to the sheriff .
here 's also a $ 50 reward .
ask the marshal .
oh , she 's a rnaway , all right .
lawyer daggett aain .
she draws him like a gun .
i will do no such thing .
right .
they 're loaded down with fat men and iron .
i 'm going to raise welts on you like worms .
drop that switch , la boeuf .
you 're enjoying it too much .
you 'll find that i go ahead with what i start .
just leave her alone .
get on your horse .
it 's not dinnertime by now ?
presbyterian , huh ?
southern or cumberland ?
soutern .
my folks are cumberland .
i was raised in an episcopal church myself .
figured you for some kin of kneeler .
well , ned was sighted at mcalester 's store about three days ago .
shortest way to mcalester 's .
how far is it ?
around 60 miles .
do n't be looking around for me , i 'll be right here .
you loo like a og n ice .
i 'm stronger than i look .
what did you bring fo us to eat ?
sal red ppper taffy .
what are those tings ?
how many you got in there ?
you 're lucky to be where water 's so handy .
how long you boys down there been mounted on sheep ?
go ahead and have your little joke , but i 'll tell you one thing , that little fellow there will still be running when tht big american stud of yours is winded and collapsed .
shep .
yeah .
hey , listen .
now , one of you 'll have to play the cller ,
i 'll tell you what to say and i 'll play all the other parts .
let it go .
that , baby sister , is no trade .
least little blackie likes the corn dodgers .
it 's the salt in tem .
we wo n't get to mcaleter 's by dark , so we bettr head for a dugout i know .
it 's empty , and we can shelter in it .
wat do you want ?
well , there 's no room for you here .
try that on the chimney .
speak up .
who 's in there ?
we do n't know any emmett quincy !
emmett , this is roster .
one more minute , and you 're going to drink it .
well , now , do n't you bet your life on it .
what kind of papers you got on me ?
you better move .
tell those othes to be carefl with their guns .
we 're coming ou .
hit the dirt .
belly down .
spread-eagle .
put the horses in te lean-t .

well , not by name , but i got a few john does .
i do n't remember any ned pepper .
got a messed-up lower lip .
a funny li ?
was n't always like that .
in the lower lip ?
his upper lip .
ned 's got a new boy running with him with a back powder mark on his face .
that do n't bring nobody to mind either .
you do n't know anything i want to know , do you ?
how about you ?
i always like to help the law as long as t do n't harm my friends .
pretty good idea , 'cause otherwise i 'l turn you in back at fort smith .
and then if you live , i 'll get you three or four years
they 'll get that ball out of your leg , and i 'll give you two , three days to get out of the territory .
do n't go flapping your mouth , moon .
i 'll do the talking .
do n't let him spook you !
right good mounts to me .
cut that up for rying .
what are you looking at ?
she 's after the man that killed her father .
is name is tom chaney .
led to killing in the end .
now , if you 'll just answer the marshal 's questions , he 'll help you .
i do n't like the way you look .
yes .
i do n't like he wa you look .
i hope you go to jai .
my lawyer will nt help you .
it ' a shame , a kid like moon losing his leg .
too young to b hopping around on a log peg .
we seen ned and ace two days ago at mcalester 's .
i 'm played out , quincy .
i got to have a doctor !
i 'll tell what i know .
do nt leave me laying here .
i 'll see you get buried .
they 're going to rob the katy flyer .
did you see a fellow with them with a powder burn on his face ?
no .
george garrett ,
methodist crcuit rider ou of austin , texas .
when 's pepper due here ?
send that money to my brother .
i 'll meet him later , walking the streets of glory .
quncy ?
let me have a cool drink of water .
look .
it ' one of papa 's gold pieces .
are you sure ?
yes .
worth a little over $ 36 .
grandpa sperlin gave paa two of these when he married mama .
at least we 're on ned 's .
now , go saddle the horses .
straighten up the place .
now , what we want to do is get them in that dugout .
i 'll shoot the last man through the door and we 'll have them over a barrel .
and so does the governor of texas .
all i know is there 's a lot of them and only two of us .
why do n't i try to nick chaney before he gets insid ?
but if they break , i 'll nick chaney .
yes .
remember he turkey ?
what does ned look like ?
so i wo n't shoot my foot off .
what for ?
well , i do n't want any .
what did you do before you became a peace officer ?
what did you do after the war ?
you never tod me you had a wife .
my friends was a pack of river rats .
she did n't crave their society , so she upped and left me and went back to her first husband who was clerking in a hardware store in paducah .
goodbye  reuben , she says ,
well , i told her , i said , goodbye , nola , and i hope that nail-selling bastard makes you happy this time .
did you have any children ?
why , i did n't consider it tealing .
i never robbed no citizen r taken a man 's atch .
i had to flee fo my life .
no horse could run him into the ground .
when that posse thinned out ,  turned old bo around , and takin them reins in my teeth , i charged thm boys firing two navy sixes .
they must 've all been married men that loved their families 'cause they scattered and run or home .
you do n't have any family , d you ?
general price do n't belong to me .
looks like moon was telling the trut .
you see chaney ?
that 's him hollering .
there 's a younger one , but he ai 't a patch to this one .
moon !
quincy !
i 'm hit !
they do n't call him lucky ned pepper for nothing .
yeah .
well ...
well , what 's your story ?
i wa on the move to a better place .
 heard the first shot , and i thought you 'd opened up .
more likely aleep .
you know who they are ?
the one on the sand spit is old hayes .
the boy i do n't know .
he 's not much olde than i am .
why do n't you go make us some cofee ?
let it go and go on inside .
wy are you being so foolish ?
well , la boeuf , you 're quite a horse shooter .
i was trying for ned pepper .
well , next time , try for the horse and maybe you 'll hit pepper .
what are we waiting for ?
and i say no .
you ca n't take men by watching them run away .
we 'll take the horses and the dead in to mcalester .
some , for now .
do n't think about you at all .
i was told in fort smith that you rode with quantrill and that border trash .
but a bunch of murdering thieves .
i hear they murdered women and hildren in the lawrence raid .
freeport , wit kirby smith .
i served with general kirby smith .
i do n't have to hang my head when i say it , either .
go ahead and make another joke about it .
nd i do n't like our conversation about captain quantrill .
otherwise , leave it alone .
you know , i 've been thinking about lucky ned pepper .
maybe he planned on murdering those two stock thieves so they would n't inform against him .
ned does n't go around killing people for no reasn .
sure , marsal .
yeah , about half the load i was loking for .
wh do n't you go in and meet mrs. mcalester ?
maybe mrs. mcalester can fix that poor little hand of yours .
rooster , hat are you doing here ?
go ahed .
that 's what texas calls a peace officer .
i have a pretty good idea where ned 's holed up .
if he is where i think he is , it will take 100 marshas to smoke him out .
his name 's tom chaney .
i wnt you to bury them for me .
what bout la boeuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 'r of no good use when you 're handicapped .
why ?
go wash , gaspargo .
that 's moon .
i know this boy , billy walsh .
he comes from a good family down by the south canadian .
sell the horses and get what you can for their coats , guns , and saddles .
his brother 's a preacher named george garrett .
boots , send this man $ 10 , and tell him his brother got caught and is buied hee .
i 'll do that .
so this is the man who shot ned pepper 's horse from under im .
yeah , this is the famous horse killer from el paso .
fewer horses , fewer horse thieves .
both rifle and hand are ready to shoot agan .
you stay here with the mcalesters 
tat 's far enough .
you think i 'm gon na quit when we 're so close ?
there 's something in what she 's saying , cogburn .
i 've said my piece .
there 'll be no more talk about
ho won whose spurs .
i 'm going .
now , we 'll have no more talk about it .
what are you doing ?
you could n't see t if you saw it .
he pu his foot wrong .
he 's tired .
i 've freighted iron stoves up harder grades than this .
i was a pretty fair hand with a jerkline when i was freighting in colorado .
worked for a fellow that was always down with something .
he was carrying around a 21-foot tapeworm , along with his business responsibilities .
that aged him .
lord god , how they hate to pay up .
what about the $ 25 i paid you ?
i will not bandy words with a drnkard .
we have come near about 50 miles from mcalester .
tomorrow we 'll take him .
if we 're as close to ned pepper as you say ,
i do n't think too much of making tat fire .
where are you going with that cnteen ?
we got no water to spare for foolishness .
take a drink and let it go at that .
i 'd say there 's a stream down below there .
should n't one of us go down with her ?
might not be safe .
well , safer for he than whatever she meets , man or beast .
well ...
i know yo , little mattie , the bokkeeper .
there 's no money for you to squeeze around here .
i came o fetch water .
and i think i will not go .
now , how do you like that ?
how many officers ?
i 'd say right around 50 , and they mean business .
so you just walk right in front of me , up that hill .
i think i 'll oblige those officers to come after me .
if you refuse to go with me , i 'll have to shoot you .
yo better cock your piece .
all the way back until it locks .
now , yo mean to say that you wo n't go with me on your own free will ?
now you will follow me .
sis !
i 'm own here !
i just did n't think yo 'd do it .
one of my short ribs is broke .
you 're just a piece of trash !
you little busybody !
i 'll teach you a lsson you 'll nevr forget !
sis !
sis !
hurry up !

they 're all armed and they mean business .

yo better answer , rooster , or i 'll kill this girl !
you want me to kill her ?
she 's nothing to me .
nothig but a runaway .
i wo n't give you any more .
i wo n't trust you .
all right , we 're moving , but we 'll need more than five minutes .
i 'm matie ross of dadanelle in ell county .
where are you wounds ?
bob , you and harold stay hee , keep a wach out below .
keep this turkey cock quiet , or we 'll have him for supper .
is that man simpleminded ?
all the parmalees is touched , but harold 's the worst .
but they 're all good shots .
get there !
farrell , lend him a hand .
they better sow .
tom chaney shot my fther to death in frt smith .
i hired him to go after the murdrer .
if i 'd killed him , i would not be in this fix .
my revolver misfired .
if i did , i 'd ave one that worked .
i 'll give him a little more time .
was that rooster and the ranger waylaid us lat night ?
did they take quincy and moon ?
it was a terrible thing to see .
do you need a good lawyer ?
i need a good judge .
that man called hayes , he 's dead , too , nd the boy that saved your life .
goes for your good friend rooster .
rooster cogburn is n good friend of mine .
he led us right into your hands .
you lost the horse .
when we get out , i 'll send somebody back to fetch you with a fresh mount .
he wo n't harm you .
you understand that ?
you do n't get paid .
let me ride up with you , farrll .

i 'll tell you frankl , sir ,
i fully intended to have you jailed , and i 'm just the man who ould do it , but when mattie told me the straight of the matter ,
you have my thanks and , with certain reservations , my respect .
how nice .
well , how is sis ?
she commissioned me to pay you th balance of the $ 75 due in the matter of tom chaney .
lawyer j. noble daggett , are you a betting man ?
on occasion .
oh , no .
i stil do n't see why you did n't look up la boeuf 's irl wen you were in waco .
i took the boy home to be bured in his ranger suit .
i do n't believe there was one .
well , i was just a little busy .
them texicas forgot how much money they offered for a reward .
i had to help them remember .
papa 's marker was not what was orderd .
i think it 's ony ight that you have ppa 's gun .
well , i 'm not so sure about that .
almost got you killed when it misfired once .
well , then i suppose i ought to get you to show me how .
trust you to ride another tall horse .
you 're too old and too fat to be jumping horses .
well , come to see a fat old man sometime .
