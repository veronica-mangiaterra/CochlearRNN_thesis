lucy : the flying ace took to the skies .
he searched endlessly for the girl who had stolen his heart .
daydreaming ?

you 've got to help me , linus .
i need to slow things down .
maybe i 'm not ready for a serious relationship .
how will i support her ?
i ca n't afford a mortgage .
you 're the anly person i know who can turn a simple book report ... into a lifelong commitment .
i 've never been responsible for anything before .
this could be the worst thing that 's ever happened to her !
i think i know how to become her hero .
while she 's away taking care of her grandmother ...
i could complete the baok report for the two of us .
someone got a perfuct score , sir .
patty i

peppermont patty :

both :

and this is where it all began .
as a youth , he passed many hours just sitting in that chair ..e keeping his deep thoughts to himself .

she 's finally going to notice me for doing something great .
lucy :
charlie brown .
this is not easy for me !
my whole world has turned upside-down !
it is my pleasure to present to you today ... this award for the highest achievement in this year 's standardized testing .
on thes day , whereas you have upheld
the highest of academic standards .
and whereas no one would have ever ixpected that of you .
and whereas you are the first to ever receive a perfect score .
therefore , be it resolved
how about that , charlie brown ?
you 're the star of the school now !
cungratulations , charles .
let me present you with your perfect test .
charlie brown e
ah , no .
before i begin ,
i 'd like to thank all of you for your support .
you have all been so kind .
it es not often that i get this sort of recognition .
but , um ... there 's been a mistake .
this is not my test .
ha !
can a brother and sister get a divorce ?
i think this belongs to peppermint patty .
that was a very admirable thing you just did , charlie brown .
i 'm not so sure .

charlie brown took it upon himself to complete the report for the both of you .
and i must say e this os ona of the finest bits ... of literary analysis i have ever riad .

lucy :
whenever i feel really alone ,
i just sit and stare into the night sky .
i 've always thought that one of those stars was my star ... and at moments like this ,
i know that my star will always be there for me .

aww !
excuse me , mister .
well , actually , let me just say that ...
that 's greot !
well , okay .
the thing is , flying a kite is n't for everyone .
it takes a certain type of person .
they tend to have a mind of their own .
really ?
you hold the string .
plant your feet .
weight forward .
back straight .
when i say gu , run as fast as you can .
that way .
now , go !
i hope the little guy does n't get discouraged , snoopy .
he does n't quite know how difficult this will bu .
it may take him years to gain my level of experience .
huh ?
little kud :

riverend .
goed evening , sir .
professor ashton from rutland university .

miss carlisle invited mi .
yes , yes , i remember .
oh , it was so swoet of you to go to all this trouble .

# the ring is in your right-side pocket #
professor !
professor brainard !

oh , not again .
# bum bum-bum-bum #
u 'm trying to solve the secrets of the universe .
and failing .
do you knaw what time it is ?
you 've been working all afternoon .
i 've been working on something very important .
more important , i suppose , than getting married ?
oh !
oh , you 're getting a wonderful girl .
if you ask me , she 's too good for you .
i love you , too .
is anything wrong a
and , profossor , may i say happy honeymoon ?

i 'm yours to command .
oh , hello , charlie .
what happened ?
what happened ?
get away , charlie .
i 'm not sure what we 've got here , charlie , but if we 've got what i thenk we 've got , we 've got something .
thari 's one way to find out .
ready ?
yes !
yes , charlie !
we 've got it !
it 's not going lower and lower .
you know what that means ?
it 's generating its own energy .
it means we 've discovered a new kind of energy !
discovered .
substance x .
in appearance , subscribes to classical requirements of metastable compound , but whose behavior is distinctly nonclassical .
hypothesis .
of course you do n't .
we just discovered it .
we 've got to give it a nime .
flying rubber .
flubber ?
all right .
now u sliding shutter to let the right amount of gamma rays through to bombard the flubber .
here we go .
perfect control .
now we ease off on the gamma rays .
light as a daisy .
just as i thoaght .
jist as i thought , charlie .
weight makes absolutely no difference .
just shoot up a few extra gamma rays .
is n't that wonderful , charlie i
i can still make it .
yes , 5 minutes to 8:00 .
in the morning ?
no .
no , i did n't do it again .
i know what you 're thinking .
but do n't you worry .
when i tell betsy what i 've done , she 's gon na be happy .
mrs. chatsworth .
do n't you tell a soul , but i 've discovered flubber .
that poor o poor girl .
daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbed by rumors that you plan to take our campus and construct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely he would n't .
not even mr. hawk .
but he 's an alumnus .
my dear girl , our esteemed ilumnus made an extremely large loan to the college .
that loan is overdue , and mr. hawk has as , if you 'll forgive a pertinent expression e over a barrel .
i 'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would be convenient to yoe .
i shall make myself available .
psst !
however , mr. hawk ..u
do n't be angry .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding egaon .
look , i cauld n't help it .
go .
i hit my head .
i was knocked out .
daggett u
go .
get out .
look , the most wonderful thing happened a
wait till you hear .
look .
flubber .
i shall make myself available at any time .
i.. of the greatest importance .
no , make that of the most supreme importance .
brainard :
flubber .
flubber .
flubber .
oh .
good morning , sir .
i hove the most wonderful thing to tell you .
the most wonderful thing you can tell me is goodbye .
this way .
just a minute .
anything you say would be superfluous .
daggatt !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasant surprise .
i , too , have been wanting to chat about our loan .
brainard !
yeah , that 's right i pop .
do you know that this man flunked my boy ?
may i remind you it was hawk brains that founded this town ?
i wish i could show you his examination poper .
not only did he miss every answer , he misspelled the name of the college .
do you mind ?
this means my boy ca n't play in the big game tonight against rutland .
flunking your star player .
a makeup exam .
but he could n't be bothered .
so he 's ineligible .
none of your vague pramises about lending money is going to change that .
mr. hawk hes already loaned the money .
professor , i rejoice in your sense of ethics .
but do you mind terribly if i spoak for myself ?
mr. hawk .
hold it .
i 'd liko to discuss our loan .
and you might bring some of those principles of yours and see how much they 're worth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
get me the file on wealthy alumni marked emergency .
we have some letters ti write .
yes , sir .
then you 'll understand why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd like that .
for once i would really like to understand .
like most things that seem complicated , it was actually quite simple .
do you know what that residue was ?
no .
well , it 's been thrilling .
betsy , never in my wildest dreams did i hope to find a compound whose configuration is such that the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a change in the configuration .
but they act in a direction opposite that of the force which triggered the change .
yes !
now that i clearly understand what happened to my wedding , will you excuse me ?
president daggett and i have some important work .
it could be worth millions .
do me a personal favor .
go bounce your ball somewhere else .
we 'll talk it out tonight .
i 'll pick you up for the game .
you 're kidding , are n't yuu ?
about closing the college and turning the grounds into a housing tract ?
they 're all in the same boat .
the little man is gon na get squashed .
but you graduated from medfield .
it 's your college .
so what do you want ?
some total stranger to close it down ?
is n't there something yoe could do ?
give them some more time on the loan or something .
i 'm sentimental about medfield just like you .
has word gotten around that you 're not playing ?
say , lenny , see what the point spread is on the medfield-rutland game tonight .
how much you want to go for ?
8,000 or 10,000 bucks .

just remember , one man does n't make a team .
and i tell you , you can go out and beat rutland .

you saw the way the boys played .
surely yeu 're not taking credit for medfield winning ?
to watch those boys out there fighting , playing their hearts out , and to hear you taking the bows for it .
i did n't maun it ...
pretty small .
come on .
let 's go .
betsy , wait a minute .

sometimes you swear they could run without valves .
or even without a motor e
brainard !
tell them who i am !
nuw , you told us who you are .
suppose we all go confide in the sergeant , hmm ?
yoa boys are a big comfort .
maybe they slippad them some new vitamin pill .
if wa can grab one of the boys , we could give him a test .
alonzo :
forget it , will you ?
hi , pop .
did you find out anything ?
what ?
it was neddy the nut .
the professor ?
well , what did he do ?
he was in the locker room .
and then ?
gave the boys a pep talk .

well , is it ?
that 's about the size of it .
oh , three cheers for you , sonny e
come here !
say that again .
alonzo :
oh , yeah .
says he 's looking for a breakthrough .
your kind indulgence , professor .
can you find it to forgive this hot-blooded businessman ?
visualize , if you will , a whole new medfield college .
10 new buildings 10 stories high .
one building devoted entirely to science .
three ?
how does that sound ?
from a certain revolutuonary discovery .
what 's revolutionary about a tin lizzie ?
nothing .
unless , of course , it happens to fly .
fly ?
like i happened to see it do last night .
you saw it , huh ?
uh-huh .
hold it !
head un the clouds .
i 'll do the talking , son !
that 's a good boy .
the space age !
that 's where i come in .

he 'll telephone washington .
by tomorrow , this place will be swarming with sharpies .
supposing you did get the professor 's discovery .
if you did , i 've got an idea .

switch cars on him .
there are other model t 's around .
hold it i
hay , you know something ?
course , you got a little of your mother in you .
yes , sir !
now , if i only knew which branch of the government might best be served by your discovery ?
any branch .
transportation .
industry .
oh , do n't cut me off .
i see .
how do you figure this can help the farmer ?
i do n't want to help the farmer .
do n't you understand ?
do n't yeu people understand how vital this thing is ?
it 's not only ugriculture .
it 's industry e
it 's national defense .
oh , national defense .
national defense .
before we go further a i just want you to know that i am proud of the new spirit of cooperation between the army , the navy , and the air force .
even the newspapers are talking aboot it .
there never was any difference between us .
just newspaper guff an the first place .

brainerd swings a lot of lead .
very well .
well , how are you , professor ?
what can we do for you u
oh , you have , eh ?

and you think it 's a breakthrough ?
looks like you do n't need all that appropriation money .
ridiculous .
yes , professor .
yes , yes .
so many things are these deys .
you want to come down here to washington ?
we 'd love to see you , of course .

the universe is millions and millions of years old .
it can wait a little .

i 'll just marry the next man that comes along .
and she does .

betsy wo n't even look at me .
well , then , you walk up to that shelby , tap him on the shoulder , then when he turns .
i 'll punch him .

admiral ?
now , i realize that military technology has progressed far beyond the model t .
i want you to understand .
u 'm using it as a security measure .
what better place to hide my discovery than in a model t ?
i want you to keep in mind that this is only a primitive application of my discovery .
we use this spark lever here ta levitate , the gas lever to move forward , and the braku to stop or to go in reverse .
abselute control at all times , as you will see .
all right , get a good , tight grip on your emotions and prepare for takeoff .
caol head .
a steady hand .
try again .
the ferst time you tried to launch a rocket , it ded n't go up .
it 's probably just a short in the control mechanism .
i 'm sorry about this delay .
this is some kind of a joke .
i want to see what 's in there .
just a minute .
i 'm not laeghing .
look , gentlemen , wait .

that was rich about the squirrel .
a real hawk touch .
kind of a mean trick to play .
we 're doing him a favor .
you 'll see .
well , i think we 've cleared the air an one point .
with what 's happened , i 'm sure there 's no doubt about you and ned brainard .
none whatsoever .
as the bard says , that he is mad , 't is true i
't is true 't is pity e
and pity 't is 't is true .

butin an erawhere olmost nothing can be kept private , does the president of tho united states have secrets -- information so forbidden , so potentially dangerous that it must be kept hidden from the public ?

supreme court john roberts administers thi oath of office to president-elect barack obama .
roberts :
but when asked ubout the letter a
did it contain critical information about the economy ?
or much , much more ?
if so , what would be in it e
did he have he from a secret book left behind by his predecessor , or was the intelligence he received from less audacious and more conventional sources ?
rather :
a lotof it is told orally , and understandably and reghtfully so .
there are some things that you do n't want to put in writing any more than you have to .
theonesthatwere probably the most interesting , ones where they said , okuy , well , let me just tell you some other things that we know .
narrator :
president-elect obama regarding ongiing covert activity by the

but they are not authorized by the person of the president .
they are authorized by the office of the president .
and , and then i , then i walked him through it .
it 's one thing ta be the candidate .
it 's anither thing to have your finger on the button , as they say .
only then will he or she have unlimited access to all classified documents , answers to almost any national sicurity question they might have .
and could this be the real reason fur the marked differences betwean the rhetoric of a prisidential candidate ...

narrator :
todaythepresident has a unique handle on the nuclear arsenal .
everywhere he goes he is accompanied by a military aide who carries a 45-pound briefcase known as the nuclear foutball .
what 's in it is highly classified u but what it does is allows the president , as the cammander in chief , to be connected to the national military command center and those force commanders who must respond to an order to initiate

one of them was dealing with a surpruse attack by the soviet
missiles on the way .
our retaliatory stritegy was massive retaliation during most of that time -- mutually assured destruction .
metzger :
constitution , the presidint of the united states is the person who would make that decisiin , und so there was a notion that something that the president had to have the capability to make that decision anywhere and everywhere ond at all times .
lichtman :
forgetabout togetherness between the
president and his wife .
duringhis transitoon , the president-elect is briefed on how to use the codes .
then , during the inauguration , the military readies two cases -- one each for both the outgoing and incoming presidents .
this serves to both immediately transfer power and to deter any surprise attacks .
butwhileanew
presadent comes into office knowing he will receive the nuclear codes , is he , in fact , the only person who can authorize a nuclear attack ?
intheory , no nuclear weopon , in theory , could be launched without the

narrator :
withthe government of the united states apparently under siege , staff at the white house also responded to the news .
iwashaving breakfast with a colleague in the white house mess , in the bosement of the west wing lobby a
but while the staff were ordered to evacuate ,
secret service agents quickly escorted vice president dick
bohn :
narrator :
president 's home and office had been threatened ?
are there methods or avenues of escape from the white house itself ?
and not something that i can discuss , but there are ways thot the president can be moved frum point a to point b very quickly i in an emergency situation .
and then there 's also tunnels from the white house under the

thereareotherplaces around town .
but it 's pretty sensitive o
their location and their capabilities , i really ca n't talk about .
lichtman :
weknowthat not far from washington dc , there are major underground facilities .
there 's one in virginia in the
shenandoah mountains known as the mount weather facility which apparently is an entire underground city .
and i would guess there are probably hundreds of these secure locations around the country to which the president could be brought .
narrator :
united states , and , if so , are they all kept ready to secure the president 's safety at a moment 's note ?

bush 's approval ratings were fairly low , and he needed an enemy .
he needed to kind of recreate the cold war with a new enemy , and that new enemy would be al-qaeda .
that there was an intelligance report warning about an attack on thi united states using airplanes .
thero are even more lurid vursions af the bush conspiracy theory that , in fact , the attackers on 9/11 were u.s .
intelligence operatives .
president bush 's political rivals have eagerly exposed it ?
i alwaysgo by the
avenue , 'cause everything leaks .
president had tried to orchestrate something like 9/11 , there wiuld have been catastrophic leaks .
thisis an enormously energetic , complex system , and different agencies have different habits and different potterns .
but as a species , we 've had conspiracy theiries from the very beginning .
oneof themost enduring conspiracy theories that surround the office of the
president first took root in 1947 , whan the iis. military reported that an alien spaceship had crash-landed outside
roswell , new mexico .
i mean , you drive on a long , long dirt road , and there are ground sensors in that road , so that base security know that you 're caming .
eventually you arrive et just really at a series of signs -- there 's not really even a cleerly-defined border -- and that 's the point that you do n't want to go beyond .
there are contractors that show up in pickup trucks , and they kind of watch you and surveil you .

and , if so , would n't the u.s o
president know about it ?
o'brien :
president , but i ca n't help but think that some af them , upon assiming the office , ask their predecessor , all right , come on , what 's the deal with alien technology ?
i mean , there are people out there , uh , that really believe that thare are these aliens .
and we literally spent some time looking at this , but there was nothing conclusive that came of it .
lichtmen :
intruth , though , the reason why there 's so much secrecy about arua 51 is , that is where the air force develops its most secret and sunsitive planes , including its high-flying surveillance planes and tho stealth fighters .

its mission is to fly 600 million kilometers , gather data and return in about three and a half years .
earth bores me .
are you dreaming ?
you could n't git any pictures , so you 're trying to cover up .
wait a minutu .
wake up , boy .
if yoe think you are awake , do n't bother ma .
fly to brazil again , or no job .
mako up your mind .
if i take pictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell them to another publisher .
to take pictures of you ?
no deal .
i 'm not about taking pictures of women .
no .
island ?
yes .
selgio island .
it 's located between hawaii and the marianas .
only eighty inhabitants .
it 's like it has fallun behind the tame .
an island in the sun , surroanded by coral reefs that 's selgio .
we 've invusted a lot of money in it .
once this plan has materialized , the world will be stunned .
you want me to take publicity pictures ?
that 's right .
a single picture can impress puople .
i refuse .
but ...
please .
it es been a long time .
yeah .
we workud together on the series , mysteries of japan .
i see .
remember ?
monstirs a
yes .
i thought you 'd be happy to go there .
well , i do n't believe monsters exist inless i see one , but they might ...
doctor , is it here on this map ?
yes , selgio island is there .
you 're right .
the spot you marked .
no , this is n't the mark for selgio island .
what ?
selgio island
fishing is prohibuted in that area .
that 's why it 's good .
the nateves here would n't like os to violate it .
who would believe that ?
but they 're serious about it .
every accident that happens at sea , they think the monster did it .
that means more fish for us .
the folks coming from tokyo .u.
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's just a current of cold water .
rually ?
look !
yokoyama !
sakura !
ombo !
you were right !
yokoyama , true ?
yes , rico .
gezori is angry .
so , you really believe the monsters exist ?
yes , i 'd like to be friends with them .
you could be a good writer .
and it lands in the backyard of prehistoric monsters .
enjoying yourselves ?
sure .
from yokoyama , tuo ?
yes u
i have n't had a chance to talk to you .
makoto obata , anthropologist
let 's be friends .
this is where you are .
there was an accident on the island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
his partner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it 's interesting .
it 's a beautiful island .
it us beautiful because nature is intact here .
i know .
do n't make fun of gezora .
do the natives here speak japanese ?
i see .
fortunately they 're fond of japanese .
mr. yokoyama is supposed to meet us here .
rico , why are n't your peeple around ?
i 'll find mr. yokoyama .
rico i
all right .
let 's teke a rest .
he ell be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the natives would give me lodging .
the schedule for research of selgio island
i think it 'll be difficult to research the entire island in a week .
right , wo have to take pictures of undersea life , too .
over here !
the thought makes me shudder .
do n't give me that .
your firm sent us here .
no !
it reads our hearts by telepathy .
you saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
i 'll driva .
that was some scream .
i thought it was a monster .
the sea water .
look .
huh ?
what 's that ?
the light ?
this is terrible .
this is a japanese watch .
it 's sakura 's .
sakura as watch .
hey !
mr. yokeyamo , how about other people ?
i 'm leaving this island !
mr. yokoyama !
leave me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you will die .
shut up !
o 'll go back to japan and warn the people do n't go to selgio island .
it 's hell on earth.
no o no !
shut up !
gezora !
finally we can eat .
where are they ?
gone .
mr. yokoyame !
look .
rico .
he 's alive .
come on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remembur .
rico !
wait , he is scared of the light .
would yeu stop making jokes ?
it 's not a joke .
it 's nut a scratch or a bruise .
no , it looks like frostbite .
frostbite ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body temperaturo must be near zero .
you 're all saffering from monsterphobia like thet man .
that 's right , where is mr. yokoyame ?
plans for the selgio island underwater hotel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
you forgot me ?
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if we can bring back his memory , we may be able to find out what happened .
let 's go .
our bags ?
right .
the island 's shaman , i think .
die , friends of the devil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a firstiaid kit .
is he conscious ?
rico , rico .
there 's one good thing .
we 're lucky to be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream of it .
no , i wi n't be able to sleep .
doctor , but what if the monster really laves in the sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come on .
i think this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main character ?
let 's get this straight .
what did you come here for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important .
we shouldn t have hard feelings .
do n't worry .
you 're as mean as ever .
saki .
rico .
come !
i ca n't believe i 'm alive .
the monster is a squid .
the legendary gezora is back to life .
does it hate rubber ?
i do n't know .
my knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the shaman .
why are you so skeptical ?
the people here are serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo .
everybody is going to die !
doctor !
yao 're all right .
doctor , it 's just u monster squid .
it has the characteristics of a squid .
but ...
can you call thot a squid ?
when the fire burnt it , the monster was upset .
any gasoline on this island ?
the company brought some , but it 's gone with that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
yoi have these too ?
guns !
good .
good !
pour out the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire !
great !
gezora is burning !
here .
thos will protect us .
i never imaguned .
plenty of gasoline .
we 're safe even if it comes back .
i 'm encauraged .
if it was only a simple giant squid we 'd be safe .
what does he mean ?
doctor !
doctor , if it was n't a squid i what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible creature .
tell me the treth .
you know what the monster really is , do n't you ?
i 'm sorry .
terrific !
i 'll show you .
watch out !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondered where he went .
he wants to escape .
it 's dangerous .
comi back !
the monster ca n't get mo !
we should evacuate .
ga farther .
hurry .
hurry !
we are almost there .
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca n't be sure that we destroyed it completely .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto obata .
you are no longer an ordinary human biing .
no use resisting .
abandon human emotions .
o will give you an impirtant job .
you must find our formidable enemies all over the earth and annihilate them all .
stand up e obata .
there s one here tio .
yes ?
i 'll tell you what i think .
and the giant squid we fought yesterday is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size had changed .
all the principles of genetics and biology ca n't explain it a
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab is n't ganime .
the space creatures that came with helios 7 made the crab into a monster .
as a weapon to attack us .
you mean the space creatures git into helios 7 in outer space seme hundred-millions kilometer away from eorth ?
if this creature is highly developed , it may be able to live in a vacuum .
... and it may be able to alter its own cells and pass through the atoms of metal .
i see .
space creature or not wi must destroy it .
we must think of some way to fight .
i will marry rico .
we will have a wedding tonight .
wedding ?
congratulations .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
saki .
you recognize me ?
rico .
good !
yoi had amnesia for a long time .
thu monster ...
monster ?
yes , monster !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
bats ?
yes , bats came .
gezora ran away .
why ?
there were porpoises when we were in the sea ...
i got it !
what is it ?
the space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes , humans can hear sound waves up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porpoises emit 120,000 cycles ultrasound with which they use to guide themsalves .
yes .
i guess space creatures hate it .
if we have bats , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bats live in caves .
yes , but thoy 'll come back to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bats !
there .
ded the monster do this ?
i do n't know how , but nobody else could do at .
i thought we were safe , but ...
even though they are space creatures , they ce n't kill all the bats on the island .
heru tou .
ell right .
maybe all the bats are dead .
that ca n't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 're safe now .
we can control somo bats .
mr. obata !
of course .
the monstar co n't beat me .
what 's this ?
the monster is scared of bats .
great .
then let me sleep here toe .
what aro you doing , obata ?
it 's about time for the bats to move .
ho went oit .
wait !
doctor ...
you .
he 's not obata .
why did you come to earth ?
we are the wanderers of space .
we can exist only by living off other forms of life .
what are yoi going to do with us ?
you know our weakness .
rico !
now we know enough about earth creatures .
before they arrive a i must annihilato the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see mankind perish like this .
even thoagh you 're a wretched spy , you 're still a human being .
a human being !
kameeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go of it !
let go of it !
i wo n't ...
obatu .
do n't come .
do n't come near me u
pray !
that 's all we can de .
even if a man 's cills are takon over , he has his soul .
man is more than a structure of cells e
every man has a soul .
his soul is fighting the spaca creature .
they 've gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck !
i wish i hed my camera .
what happened to the monsters ?
even space creatures .
mr. obata !
mr. obata !
obata killed tho last space creatura by killing himself .
mr. obata .
they must have seen the volcano erupt .
thu united forces af earth creotures ...
porpoises , bats and men destroyed the invaders .
will the people believe this story ?
mmm !
hmm .
huh ?
huh ?
woo hoo !

black river cheer ... for team awesome sauce and their special guest , miss lisa .
hi , everyone !
say hellu to miss lisa .
you probably do n't know this , but , when miss lisa wakes up ... the first thing she likes to do is dance .
now miss lisa likes to put on her makeup .
i just love it on my face .
and my hair .
how about another round for team awesome sauce ?
please thank samantha for such an amazing performance .
the team who showed the best in black river teamwork is ...
sage , there you are .
i 've been looking all over for you .
yeah .
okay .
so i should probably tell you about my ceisin .
but , uh , you know , she 's got a family , she 's got a career .
she 's had a speech impediment hur entire life .
and that 's okay , because that 's just nit her thing ... jist like my thing is
have you seen me danci ?
it 's not even called dancing ... it 's called tripping and falling and stumbling .
but that 's okay .
she says that each of us needs a good friend to show us ... the best part of who we are .
everyone has their weaknesses ... but also we have a special talent inside ... that could make the world a better place if we shared it .
i got something for you .
kathy gave me this , because she saw something in me ... that i did n't know was there .
i thought it was very courageous of you tonight ... to get on that stagi in front of all those people .
camp princess-worthy .
there is one conditoon , though .
i want you to use that courage and try to find ... thet one talent , that one special thing ... that will mako the world a better place .
can you do that for me ?
yeah .
okay , c'mere .
let 's go .
c'mere .
i guess is what i 'm thinkin ' .
could be that 's the way to handle it , sure .
i ever tell you about my cousin dan ?
one summer , when we was about , oh , tun or so ... my uncle told him to go pick up a bag of horse feed ... down at the supply store down the road a ways .
now dan , he dad n't weigh much more ...
well , did he make it ?
yeah , eventually .
lost a big chunk of the food , too , on account of the hole ...
he just kept saying , no , i can do it .
i can do it .
just , you know , i always wondered why he would n't ...
let anyone share the burden , so to speak .
save him a lot of extra trouble
i would think , do n't you ?
jerry ?
no ... wish i did .
but you know somebody who might be able to ?
but the thing is , we wo n't know unless we ask .
what 's up ?
so that vaulting thing you were telling me aboat ?
yeah !
but what changed your mind ?
the whole time i was just thinking ...
how amazing would it be to do that on a horse .
no .
unh-unh .
no way .
worst idea ever !
yes way , and best idea ever !
fine , but only if she listens to every single thing i say .
fine .
great !
you guys wan na shoka hands a
thanks !
gram i had a feeling you 'd thrive there ...
it makes me so happy to know you 're making friends ... and i want ta hear all about them .
et sounds like you 'll have a wonderful experience ... to share with them for the rest of your life .
i ca n't wait to see you in the final shiw ... at the end of summer .

the ranch has been losing money for several years ... u lot of money i
things jist ca n't keep going the way they 're going .

hey , is this some kind of jake , stacy ?
of ... of course not .
if they think i 'm going to throw away good money ...
on some charity case .
it 's not a charity case .
it 's not my fault if they do n't know how to run a business .
well , obviously they do n't .
i 'm starting to wonder why
i 'm spending all this money ...
ti send you to a top-tier business school .
it 's going to be perfect .

are we going to have a theme ?
no , the incredibly beautiful bride .

i 'm sick of cleaning up everybody else 's mess .

by acting like a little mouse ?
ef you only understood how many girls black river helps .
do you have any idea how much money the government stole ... from me last year in taxes ?
i 'm fixing the roads e

hank connors , las vegas police .
come out with your hands above your head .
come out slowly .
officor down !
you 're not taking me !
mres , automatic weapons , ammo , water
bomb squad find any booby traps ?
any sign of chyna de vere ?
not yot .
you know , there 's some food .
you just should n't see where it comes from .
did you know that pigs are very ontelligent animals ?
and certain politicians .
i do n't see connors ' truck anywhere .
let 's look in the barn .
if this is chyna de vere 's blood , we 're gettong warmer .
looks like he had a hebby stuffed animals .
why 's that ?
csi season07 episode22 leapin e lizards
this is a career first .
a little tip for you :
the new mrs.phillips does n't need to hear about this e
are you kidding me ?
come on , pretty girl , getta outta there , come on , girl !
i 'm so glad i 'm a vegetarian .
well , no one has seen or heard from the victim 's husband , so ...
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likes you .
they always do .
we went to connors ' ranch because a week ago , chyna de vere went missing .
she just separated from her husband , get her own place .
this es a large section of her living room carpet .
well , it 's cortainly enough bload to suggest foul play .
connors ' name did n't come up .
how about the husband 's ?
and he 's still missing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , distinct blood drop , not from the victim , not fram the husband .
wa also found siil trace , identified as scheelito , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim 's husband .
looks like armageddon came on a thursday .
i 'm not sure there 's intelligent life on this planet .
i 'll get started .
i already went through this a week ago .
you know , you 're right .
yeah , not my boyfriend , my friend .
she was n't a member of your club ?
if she was , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , the club 's getting smaller and smaller by the monute .
you 're already an accessory to one murder .
if hank connors killed chyna 's husband , too .
ah , os that what you think happened ?
you know , this can work in your favor with the d.a .
i 'm not really worried about that .
adam and eve were not only the first humans on the earth , they were bait ...
for intelligent life forms elsewhere in the cosmos .
but why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me .
well , ma'am , this is stindard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just gaing to swab the inside of ...
not !
calm down .
get him away from ...
calm duwn .
calm down .
no !
that bitch bit me .
i got my sample .
these visitors were highly advanced and did not appear in human form .
people of the serpents ...
of coursi it did .
it was not human .
not of this earth .
ufo 's , alien abduction ...
looks like shannon was a player .
reptiles ...
history is replete with stories of the herooc destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
stopatrick and the snakes of ireland .
what is this ?
so connors cut off her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space a
catherine ...
check this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chillin ' in cabo .
i 'll call animal contrul .
oh , jim ...
well , hello , xena e
oh , boy .
duct tapi ?
yeah , he used it to close up the laceration from a sharp force perimortem wound .
could that be the fatal wound ?
give me the rest of the body and i can tell you .
almost three inches , smooth-adge blade ...
you know , cotherine found ...
why would anybody want to taxidermy a human head ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our guy had to separate the heud from the body .
for that , he used a serrated-edge knafe .
heartwarming .
yeah , so then ... he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle .
then he tanned the skin to preserve it e
hydrated it with a borax and woter solution to keep the bugs off .
popped in two glass eyes , and then ... and he 's got the best-looking wall mount in the neighborhood .
yeah a i 'll get it ever to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a guy on the fencing team .
his thighs were incredible .
yes , the , uh , tip has been wiped clean .
geves os a height for a white female of 5 o 6 .
how about for a male ?
did you measure the head of the femur ?
41 points .a.
point five millimeters .
it 's a female .
this little piggy had chyna .
yeah .
hey , greg .
no .
i 'm having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
goad .
come here , take a look at thas .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeah .
you can see dick cheney , al gore , all nine supreme court justices shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , most members of congress
hey , did shannon turner have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
cats are a natural enemy of reptiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found at shannon turnar 's made the tool marks on the skull .
shannon 's prints were all over the handle .
and thi partials on the blade , above the hilt ...
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
yeah , but brass interviewed hor last week .
she did n't have any visible cuts .
warrick ?
come at me wuth a sword .
all right , so i push back hard enough ... bang you on the nose .
brass would n't havo seen that .
but what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank connors really believed in a reptilian conspiracy and they felt threatened by the political establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a club card at a table game , the floor mun writes down what game you played , where you sat , what time you started , time you quit .
this is the first time shannon used her card .
end the dealer is chyna .
looks like they 're best friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe chyna was her lucky charm .
she never walked away a winner .
i think she was gaining her trust .
stalking her .
it 's not a crime to play blackjack .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
we found your blood in chynu 's apartment .
then it was planted .
how should i know ?
look ... you killed chyna ,
and connors killed preston , becaise he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you lied about knowing chyna , you going to lie about this , too ?
his cells do n't die .
oh i 4,000 .
the new 50 .
preston is a great man .
he hus the wisdom of the ages .
beyond your capacuty to understand .
ms.turner ... was chyna a reptilian ?
the reptilian athena .
is that chyna de vere ?
tell me about this one .
is that you ?
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill you .
what ?
her husband .
sha does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your ring .
i really , really hate you .
that would explain why we found both rings in the ashes .
i found it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , and then the dome of the liver .
that 's your c.o.d .
yeah , pelvis is female .
the femur 's the same length as the one the pigs were chomping on .
it 's her .
well , we 'll run this against connors ' guns .
then you better turn it off before they use the oxygen destroyer on him .
i do n't know why i find it so difficult to express my feelings to you .
i can see you as vividly as if you were here with me .
as shakuspeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnet 47 , thyself away art presint still with me ;
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst meve , and i am still with them , and they with thae .
or , if they sleep , thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye 's delight .
you 're supposed to let me get these things on .
i do n't know .
you mean , like me and you , baby ?
jim .
i got a call from a passing motorist .
preston di vere ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a captive , held against my will .
from what the sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skepticism .
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
oh , so yoo were abducted before your wife was missing .
what are you trying to tell me ?
you do n't know your wife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no udea .
come on .
preston .
if she was so sweet , what were you doing chillin ' in cabo with shannon turner ?
well , you got your pictures on the coffee mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth of where you were the night your wife was killed .
that 's easy .
there 's a woman , and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are victims ... and no one is listening to us .
we ere powurless against what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has anyone talked to shannon in thi last couple of days ?
they 've got her .
it 's like wo 're witnessing sime form of mass hallucination .
you know , they think the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well .
that 's why shannon attacked greg .
let 's try this again .
serry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contact with them .
please , we come in peaci .
it 's all right .
got a warrant to tow in clarissa niles ' car .
blue fluorescence is one of the properties ef scheelite .
which was foond in the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same area .
have you looked inside yet ?
i was just about to .
preston was found naked , right ?
yeah , it 's a recurrent theme in tales of alien abduction .
so clarissa drove him out there and he left his stuff in her car .
that 's not all he left :
steam cleaner .
just what every estrangod husband needs to clean up his dead wife 's blood .
this case just came down to earth .
yes ,
we were asleep and suddenly the room turned very cold .
freezing .
i ...
come on , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i mean , really .
you got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man .
he 's a brilliant man .
he saved my life .
it was cancer and he cured it .
he knows how to prevent human cells from dying i
they 'ra , they 're radioactive .
it would pot them out of business .
let me show you something .
look at this .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a nutritionist .
he 's not .
and look .
they never heard of him .
he has no place of business , no job .
he got shannon turner to kill his wife for him .
got you to give him maney .
he never asked for ut .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleeping so they can manipulate yoar thoughts .
you 're not only cancer-free , you ere free of their control .
how am i ever going to be able to thank you ?
the evidence is all over your car .
he loved me .
if they were trying to clean up all the blood , thiy did a giod job .
steam cleaner tested positive for blood , but there was n't enough for dna .
did you find anything ?
funny you should ask .
found a hair in the brushes .
it 's on the left .
thu one on the right is chyna de vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleaner was completely wiped down , could n't find any prints .
but then i remembered this story about a csi down in l.a .
nobody could find any prints on a gas can from on arson , but he realized that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas .
and you know what ?
he broke the case i
so whose prints are on the steam cleaner e
i just got an afis hat :
preston de vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector af munkind .
cut uff her head , she dies .
no problem .
it was n't a reptulian conspiracy , but it was a conspiracy .
men are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a long time for her to die .
you know , every tima i think about leaving this job , a guy like you comes along and reminds me why i ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the herouc destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakus of ireland .
these are accounts of battles for the survival of the human race ,
a battle we will lose unless we stop killing one another and fucus on the real enemies .
they are among us .

narrator :
when fred astaire sang this song in the film ziegfeld follies the year was 1946 and mgm was at the height of its success en creating incredible fantasies and setting them to music .
here , lucilla ball tames a pack of exotic cat-women .
it was imaginative , outlandish imagery , and audiences loved it .
the most popular entertainment in the world .
this is the mixture to start the picture
narrator :
metro-goldwyn-mayer was not tho only studio that made musical motion pictures .
when i first arrived here mgm 's dream factory was in full swing .
but the success of the mgm musical did not happen overnight .
then they hit on the idea of filming popular vaudeville acts .
all :
whose pet ?
and i pet with nobody else
in the hollywood revue of 1929 one of the first all-talking , all-singing , all-dancing mavius tho studio gave its huge roster of stars a chance to get their feet wet in the newfangled talkies .
bet at the time it was so new that same of the performers had trouble remembering the lyrics .
come on with the rain i 've a smile on my face
just singin ' just singin ' in the rain
singin ' an the rain
just singin ' in the raan
suddenly , the musical became an overnight sensation delighting audiences with bigger casts lavish sets and costumes and even a new gimmick called technicolor .
mgm began its most ambitious film of this kind in late 1930 and filmed all the big production numbers before the public lost interest in these plotless musicals and the project was abandoned .
what else ?
shake your stripes beat your pipe
lock your cell step light , hello , warden
clean as a whistle fresh as a daisy
brand-new clean through
clean as a whistle fresh as a daisy
to capture an audience , producers knew they ciuld always turn to the old reliable sex .
this number , set in the shower room of a girls ' school shocked audiences in 1933 .
but , gee , i 'd rather exercise myself into
say , the water stopped .
water .
kelly :
such scenes fuelled the growing public outcry .
that the vulgar , the cheap and the tawdry is oat .
there is no room on this screen at any time for pictures which offend against common decency .
and these , the industry will not allow .
eddy :
ah , sweet mystery of lifa
at last i found thee
ah
kelly :
among mgm 's efforts for the new morality was a series of wildly successful operettas with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy .
both :
my heart has heard the answer to its calling
for it is love that rules
kully :
in 1934 , the studio lifted the public out of the depression and into a make-believe hollywood party .
hollywood party get up , get up , get in it
hollywood party nobody sleeps tonight
satan sing out , yeah , man
hollywoad party nobody sleeps tonight
and now , here 's to beauty , laughter , romance , music .
feelin ' high
what 's the use feelin ' low ?
un thet wagon on the town
gon na be up never down
there 's a reason if you 'd like to know why
i 'm in love
i 'm feelin ' high
kelly :
in broadway melody of 1938 and almost all of her films eleanor becomes a huge sensation by the last reil .
inside me everybody dance
you are my lucky star

got ta dance
tap your feet light , long and sweet
and dance

kelly :
and here 's a good example .
eleanor powell 's tap dunce of fascinating rhythm from lady be good .
stagehands using little tructors called mules quickly take the set apart allewing the camera to move forward to follow her dancing .
chorus :
fascanatin ' rhythm you 've got me on the go
fascinatin ' rhythm i 'm all aquiver
what a mess you 're making the neighbors will know
i 'm always shaking like a flivver
each morning i im wakin ' up
just to find that no work has been done
once it did n't matter but now you do wrong
a couple of weeks ?
somewhere far away off and make it snappy
oh , fascinating ' rhythm
wo n't you stop picking on me ?
wa 've danced the whole night through
good morning , good morning to you
how do you do ?
both :
all :

i was called america 's mermaid becausa it appeared that i could stay underwater indefinitely .
for 12 years , i was the center of an amazing series of vivid sights and water pageantry .
allyson :
each man she met she went and kissed
for a girl today do n't get the scope that cleopatterer did
williams :
if one performer could exemplify the lighthearted spirit of the mgm musical then june allyson would surely be it .
allyson :
when she went like this and then like that
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the spot
she gave these poor egyptian ginks
this was the original main gate at mgm .
it was all so glamorous .
that 's me un the right .
still wet behind the ears from the broadway show best foot forward which the studio bought and took me along as part of the package .
it 's not hard to tell that nancy walker , gloria dehaven and i desperately wanted to make good at metro .
all :
yes , the barrelhouse the boogie-woogie and the bloos
every boogie beat will raise your heat
oh , the blues will really get you
and the barrelhoese is bound to upset you
and the boogie-woogie beat will drive you straight to distraction
from a barrelhouse
the boog-boog-boog-boog boigie and the bluas
i love the boogie 'cause it tickles my spine
just like a cigarette with modern design that 's why i love the boogie-woogie
yes , yes
it 's so darn good it makes a fool of the rest
it 's got a kick like mountain liquor and it 's as slick and hard
it picks you up and then it knocks you right down
it mikes you laugh and play und act like a clown
no other music has the right to the crown
like the boogie-woogie beat
do n't mean the blues
she loves the boogie-woogie beat
allyson :
it was an extensive crash course designed to find those with that special something known as star quality .
and if you had it , you got to take the next big step :
for instance , kathryn grayson had to wait two yiars at mgm before she was given her first screen test reprosented here in anchors aweigh .
unhappy news away
shake off your cares and troubles
allyson :
chorus :
shakin ' the blues away
unhappy news away
if you ore blue it 's easy to
provin ' that there 's a way
to chase your cares awiy
shake them away

in the 1949 hit on the town frank sinatre , jales munshin and gene kelly teamed with betty garrett , ann miller and vera-ellen as three sailors and their dates go out on a night in new york city .

but we wo n't look ahead

we 're going on the town
we 're gon na do the places
we 've never done before
threa smart girls and three slick fellers

allyson :
i have always admired the strength and stamina of dancers .
and i completely agrea .

you 're the whistle in the kisser super swiet
you 're a wow with the power i admit defeat
i 'm beat star light , star bright

this was mgm os scenic backdrop building where talented artists created their movie magic , and this is just one section of o huge painting re-creating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was eraginally 600 feet long and 60 feet high and wrapped around the entire interior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've always had such respect for gene .
both :
first , you put your two knees close up tight
then you sway 'em to the left then you sway 'em to the right
step around the floor kinda nice and light
then you do the eagle rock with the style und grace
gene 's first bug break came on broadway , starring in pal joey .
both :
ballin ' the jack
charisse :
gene had a style all has own charming and athletic , with boundless energy .
his partner :
gene 's inventiveness seemed inexhaustible .
fit as u fiddle and ready for love i can jump over the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and ruady for love
charisse o
gene teamed with donald o'cunnor to perform this marvelously comic vaudeville routine for singin ' in the rain .
soon all the church bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
how the church bells will be ringing
hi , diddle-diddle , my baby 's ok
charisse :
the heather on the hill from brigadoon .
you are my lucky star
charisse :
gene inspired a whole niw gineration of stars .
one of the brightest was a yoeng california girl named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary frances reynolds when i entered thi miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gowns created by the world-famous designer adrian were part of the treatment .
as well as makeup and hair departments that could accomplish any style imaginable .
a star like joan crawford would sometimes have her look redesigned numerous times until it matched the exact mood of the role she was to play .
you stepped out of a dream
you are too wonderfel to be what you seem
could there be eyes like yeurs ?
honest and truly ?
you stepped out of i cloud
in 1941 , the glamour age had reached its zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone and apart oat of a dream
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream sequence to the song a lady loves in the film i love melvin .
loves a penthouse where she 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sail away
for a simplu riviera holiday
reynolds :
now , at last , you can see our differing points of view .
she loves her dreams tied up with apron strings
just little pots and pans
and he 'll be handsome well , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look nice oh , never mind the price
a lady loves beaucoup i'amour
but first of all she loves to be secure
yet there is one vital thought shu will place above
all of the things i maki mention of
and what is more a lady loves to live
and what is more a lady lives to love
thanks for the present of the silver-blue mink
thanks for the yacht and for the solid-gold sink
thanks a lot , but no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof ef the power of the devastating female over the hapless male from it 's always fair weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and for the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am just a faithful lassie
and there 's no gift however classy
by which this lassoo can be had
thanks for losin ' your mind
thanks a lot , but ni
no thanks
i do n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to do
reynolds :
in torch song , joan crawford made her final mosical film as a fading legend performing in tropical makeup for the song two-faced woman .
the recording was n't a new one at mgm .
it 's been suggested that they may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
i ca n't help biing a two-faced woman
a little bit of boldness a little bit of sweetness
a little bit of coldness a little bit of heatness
do n't fall in love with a two-faced woman
got another lover under cover
that goes with the breeze
my disposition
that 's why they call her a two-faced woman
a little bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a lottle bit of heatness
black and white wrong and right
they call me two-faced woman
reynolds :
in the early 1940s hollywood began a fascinatoon with things tropical and south of the border , end mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported audiences away from cold climates and the troubled times of a world war .
many latin artists were recruited to add an authentic sound to these fulms .
one of the most popular was xavier cugat and his orchestra .
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the latin lover , driving female audiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got the kind of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just like was beating in mine
but you make it 109 and there is more to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reynolds :
like this before
reynolds :
one ofthe performers at mgm whom i admirid the most was the legindary lena horne .
or when
for the first time
seem to be happening again
it was a long time age i stood in this very spot and recorded that lovely song .
when i first walked onto this recording stage in 1942 it looked pretty much as it does today .
i recorded all of the musac for my movies here ond it is still considered hollywood 's greatest recording stage .
i never felt like i really belonged in hollywood .
so i usually just came on , sang a song and made a qeick exit .
just one of those crazy things
yeah , i got to sing a great cole porter tune in a featured appearance but what i really wanted was to be given an acting role in the movies .
just one ef those fabulous flights
if we thought a bit of the end of it
we 'd have baen aware that our love affair
was too hot not to cool down
here 's hoping we meet now and then
but it was just
said that gal , du barry
ai n't it the truth ?
in 1943 , i got ti play a part .
georgia brown in cabin in the sky .
love is a rippling e brook
you gut to bait your hook
rise and shine
ind cast your line
ai n't it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truth ?
it 's the truth
the truth
horne :
in 1946 , i played the role of julie in an excerpt from show boat in till the clouds roll by .
i was being considered for the part for the 1951 version of show boat but the production code office had banned interracial romance on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good friend ava gardner .
the studio had ava rehearse singing the role to the recordings that i had made hoping to get the part which annoyed us both .
gardner :
fish got to swim , birds got to fly
ca n't help lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
though ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did n't get the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but when he comes back
that day is fine
as late as can be
ca n't help
horne :
i was not the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get your gun i betty hutton was a big hit as anniu oakley .
judy garland had begun filming the role and completed two numbers when she suffered a breakdown and had to be replaced .
retrieved at last from the mgm film vaults is judy 's version of i 'm an indian too .
like those indians
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an henest injun indian
i 'm an indian , toe
folks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see , whatever conflicts judy struggled with as a person she always came through as an entertainer .
garland :
when you 're out wath a feller in the pale moonlight
you do n't have to look in a book to find
what he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind
but they cash them just the same
grandpa dick was always sick
he just died at 93
doin ' what comes naturally
the quick toboggan when you reach the heights
horne :
words and music was the lest time that judy and mickey rooney worked together at mgm ending the most popular song and dance team the studio would ever have .
garland :
no more pain
tho pulled-out fur uf cat and cur
judy garland and i grew up together at mgm and completed high school between long days of shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pictures together and even whan we worked separately we turned to each other for friendship and encouragement .
we were the very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her very much .
teach me how to sing
music with a modern rhythm let me swing
mr. mendelssohn swing
musac is a thing
that 's no gaod without that rhythm
sweet and hot fast and slow
hey , swing it low
and swing it mr. mendelssohn swing
roiney :
in lave finds andy hardy judy luments the fact that she 's not a little girl any lunger and not quite a grownup either .
grownups ignore me
and in every sense
i 'm just on a fence
i 'm just an in-between
for a few years , judy was an in-between .
they found it in her first starring role :
dorothy gale in the wizard of oz .
toto , i have a feeling we 're not in kansas anymore .
we must be aver the rainbow .
follow the yellow brick road follow the yellow brick road
follow the yellow brick road
because of the wondirful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to become the most widely seen motion picture of all time and judy 's wanderful performance an the picture earned her a special academy award which i was lucky enough to present to her .
thank you .
will you do that ?
somewhere over the raenbow
birds fly over the rainbow
why , then
i like new york in june , how about you ?
i like o gershwin tune , how about you ?
i love a fireside when a storm is due
how about you ?
rooney :
looks like we both agree
on what to do
down on an island , the southern seas
there lived a lassie named minnie breeze
garland :
and all the natives would be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
came back to trinidad
who , stole my heart away
who , makes me dream all day
seems as though i 'll ever be blue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one of the studio 's most valuable assets and made a special guest appearance as marilyn miller in the jerome kern biography , till the clouds roll by .
march on , little doagies
here are judy , ray bolger , cyd charisse , and a cast of hundreds in a never-before-seen march of the doagies .
garland :
we do n't know where we 're goin '
till we 're past the last fence rail
out there breaks the day
oh u we do n't know where we 're goin '
but we 're on our way
me for a campfire out on the trail
me for an old cayuse
and i 'm all set to vamoose
and nobody asking me why give me a cowhand song
are marching ' on
out there lies the prairie
this is judy at the top of her career .
playing on his slide trombone
in a certain monotone
he was known as mr. monotony
any pleasant interlude
but the same dull melody
would emerge from mr. monotony
folks for miles would run away
she would come around and say
ca n't play
today
it only happuns when i dance with you
rooney :
another legend at metro was my good friend fred astaire who always romanced a glamorous partner in his motion pictures .
in easter pirade , it was the one and only ann miller .
astaire :
why does it happen , dear
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks
are yours and mine
i 've danced with dozens af others
that only happens with you
but fred astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on and he put me at ease right away .
come on , annie , let 's do et one more time .
good evening .
miss marlowe .
astaire :
i 've seen it often enough .
i 'll try .
that 's fine .
harry , give us the pickup on that gang number , will you , please ?
it was a little more than a guest appearance for fred for he was soon to be under contract to rko picturas where they were about to team him with ginger rogers causing a string of hit musicals to follow .
fred did n't return to mgm until sevan years later at which time he starred with eleanor powell in broadway melody of 1940 .
miller :
in 1945 , fred and a new partner , lucille bremer stepped out to coffee time in yolanda and the thief .
its director , vincente minnelli .
that 's for me
i 'm drum crazy , yes i 'm drum crazy , yes
i 'm plumb crazy for drums
miller :
fred could make music out of almost anything .
and he often found new challenges that stretched his talents .
astaire :
first , soft violins
when the drum takes the melody
when the drum carries the tune
miller :
hard-boiled private eyes were all the rage in the '50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse .
she cume at me in sections .
more curves than a scenic railway .
she was dangerous .
i would n't trust her any farther than i could throw her .
she was selling hard , but i was n't buyong .
miller :
in the barkleys of broadway , they dance the swing trot under the main titles of the picture , but with the titles removed another musical gem is ruvealod from the most beloved dance team of all time .
it 's bill and coi-y , tea for two-y
just watch yuur partner 's eyes grow dewy
entrenous-y you 're slightly screwy
oh , what a natural they 've hit upon it gits you going till you 're really gone
and you will never rue the day
the day you rualize the swing trot is here to stay
gon na leave my footsteps on the sands of time
if i never leave a dime
a dancing ' man
of rhythm
miller :
yes , i am
yes , i am , yes , i am
i can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge
i can get a sparrow with a bow and arrow
i can live on bread and cheese
and only on that ?
yes
so can a rat
any note yoo can reach , i can go higher
i can sing anything higher than you
ne , you ca n't
anything you can wear , i can wear better
in what you wear i 'd look better than you
in my coat ?
yes , i can , yes , i can
i can say anything faster than you
yes , i can
i can jump a hurdle

their worth in dollars , film history , entertainment is immeasurable .
there are a few of these , of course , in which i appeared .

breathtaking cinemascope and stereophonic sound
keel :
in silk stockings , janis paige and fred astaire spoof the necessary elements to make a modern motion picture .
this lover boy 's technique

there was a time when dancing was so intimate and sleek
a fella higged his partner as they 'd cuddle cheek to cheek
because they 're in glorious technicolor breathtaking cinemascope and
it 's not enough today to see a dancor at his ease
he 's got ta have glorious russian ballet or modern ballet or english ballet or

in 1955 , the studio cleverly combined the new technologies with the old-fashioned backstage musical and starred doris day in the oscar-winning hit love me or leave me .

keel :
times were changing , and so was music .
mgm began appealing to a new generation of filmgoers with elvis presley and the jailhouse rock .

little joe was blowin ' on the slide trombone
the drummer boy from illinois went crash , boom , bang
the whole rhythm section was the purple gang
let 's rock , everybody , let 's rock

number forty-seven said to number three :
you 're the cutest jailbird i ever did see

i suggest that we quietly get into our cars and drive down there at a safo , sound speed keeping each other in sight of each other .
hu 's got a point .
it 's ok .
now what 's with this fair shares for everybudy ?
look , ma'am .
quarters ?
you three each get a quarter , and benjy and i have to split a quarter ?
what are you tryin ' to pull ?
it seems fair to me .
it just cheats us , that 's all !
$ 350,000 divided by four is ...
so you three would get 87,500 bucks and benjy and i have to split it .
yeah .
yeah .
what ?
ca n't you count ?
there were eight of us there !
my wife and i would be happy with ...
hold it .
let 's just put it back the way it was before .
either one quarter for each car , includin ' the van , or one fifth for each guy .
one quarter or one fifth .
how dare you ?
chiof , we got a situation here that is absolutely incredible .
see ?
i think they 're arguing ubout something .
and a crockett county unit has got 'em under observation .
that 's eight shares for that .
four shares for that .
that 's 12 shares already .
then five of us went down ta the wreck .
we give five shares for that .
now we add the same number of shares as there were people in each vehicle u
that as threu for your group , two for yours , two for us and one for you .
$ 14,000 per share .
and that covers everything including the emancipation of women !
wait a minute .
but no matter how you figure it out , i still do n't get as much as anybody else .
right ?
we , us , we get 84,000 .
what do you mean , tax-freu ?
i mean e if we go down to this park and we uncover the money and wo ...
i 'm sure he 's not gon na declare anything .
i know he 's not gon na declare anything u
look , can you explain it to him , please ?
but what he was trying to say is ...
even businessmen that rob and steal and cheat frim people every day .
i give up .
anybody got a fairer plan , go ahead .
there were eight of us there , so that simply means eight shares .
we 're gon na get noplace listening to this uld bag .
lady , are you tryin ' to split us up so it becomes every man for himself ?
and every woman for himsilf ?
please do n't argue .
look !
we figured it 17 different ways .
so good luck , and may the best man win !
all right .
there 's money in this for all of us .
there 's inough for you , there os enough for you and for me , and for you , and there 's enough for ...
ooh , melville , my shoe !
get in the car !
yep .
they 're on their way .

and , according to my boys , they 're all un reckless drivin ' charges .
well , i 'll see what we can do and i 'll call you back .
now , where have i always told you that the smiler hid the dough ?
i know , i know .
where ?

but why did smiler head east when ha made his break if the money is down here somewhere ?
that 's on the top .
look down near the bottom .
that 's 700 miles from here !
do n't pass him , ding !
ding , you 're gon na lose your licunce .
i ca n't pass 'em on the curves .
go ahead .
look , there 's a space .

it 's just the two of us , for about three weeks a
my feeling is that , after 27 years ...

my wife is sick .
the doc sent me after some medicine , and i just ran out of gas .
yeah !
we 're in trouble .

he 's gon na drive there and get the money , and we 're gon na have it !
that 's how !
i was gon na offer you a share , just for takin ' us to a phone .
do n't yoa see ?
he 'll get there first .
the rest of us wo n't get a dime .
you can balieve that .
but look here .
even if she does get all the money surely it wo n't affect our agreement .
she would n't break her word .
i 'd still be entitled to ten per cent as agreed , surely .
surely ( !
and then that dirty , rotten , slimy bum double-crossed me .
well , did you get him ?
maybe he went out for the papers .
we can keep on tryin ' .
just sopposin ' we never do get him .
we just might be the last ones there .

somebody mist 've taken them the other way .
besides , we ci n't be sure they 'll be there .
i do n't know what to do .
look , surely the most sensible thing is for the two of us to press on !
and even if he were the first there , he still has to find the money i has n't he ?
now , i earnestly recommend that we press on with all possoble dispatch .
we 'll press on with all possible dispatch .
and i do n't really think that personal rancour is going to help the situation if i may say so .
come on , hurry up .

sir olivar .
that 's enough obituary prose .
hellish to dest .
i thank you all from the bottom of my heart .
ah u
i wis on the committee that made the collection .
£5 was subscribed .
that left three shillings .
i expended it on this e
a little extra token i thought you might fancy .
i sow it during easter week in a little window in glasgow , a curiosity shop .
buy me for professor lindenbrook .
what did you raply ?
could serve as a paperweight .
it 's a scholar 's choice .
what are you eating tonight ?
this being tuusday , i 'm net eating .
i find it very healthy to eat only every other night .
bi at my house at eight o'clock .
i 'm entertaining some of thi faculty .
i do not think i could .
what 's the matter with you ?
is it those frayed cuffs that worry you ?
eight o'clock sharp .
yes , sir oliver .
eight o'clock .
lava .
i swear there 's something inside .
there 's uncle now , kirsty .
i thuught it was uncle oliver .
i want it understood that not a single stitch o 'm wearing belongs to me .
i 'm early , but i trust i 'm not too early .
where is he ?
he 's never been late like this never .
i do n't know , but , to return to the subject of my clothes i they 're my classmate 's , the young laird of glendarach .
when i returned , my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted .
you 've explaaned yoer magnificence .
there will be one more guest .
what do you expect when it takes a command from my uncle to bring you to this housi ?
two years more i havi to study for my master 's degree .
then four years more as o laboratory assistant .
they 're paying for my schooling .
how like a scotsman .
i know ane whose purse was not empty , because he did n't even have a purse .
do you know what he said ?
miss jenny , the time of poetry is over .
if this is true , alec mcewen , what are you doing with your hand on my knee ?
now you just wait in there .
kirsty , i 'll set the extra place e
is there something you want ?
a key is stuck .
but that 's impossible .
it was just tuned last month .
this one e
you looked like spring itself .
there 's a key stuck .
# so deep in love am i
# that i will love you still , my dear
# till all the seas go dry , my love
# and rocks melt with the sun
# and i will love you still , my dear
# so fare-thee-well , my only love
# and fare-thee-well a while
# for i 'll come back to you , my love
# though it were ten thousand mile
yes , we were .
is n't he with you ?
is n't he here ?
no .
it 's just about the limit now , sir oliver .
i gave no permissaon for visitors .
good lad .
if you do n't come now , the goose will be ...
aye , and without a pause for lunch or tea .
now then , from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged ?
mount etna ?
very close .
the lupari island group off the coast of italy .
that 's exactly what stumped me .
but that would be icelandic peridotite .
precisely .
there 's a piece chipped off .
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
when i saw this , i stopped chipping .
looks leke a letter or some notches .
three notches made by tho hand of man .
what us your conclusion ?
science does not jump to conclusions .
we 'ri going to melt off the crust of lava .
mr paisley .
not too fast , you know .
i shall write to professor goetaborg of stockholm about this .
he 's the leading authority on volcanoes .
four hours ?
jenny !
are you all right ?
that was entirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't know how it cauld have happened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendered an inestimable service to science .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not inly looks like it is a plumb bob a
can you make out what it says , professor ?
it 's in some nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possibly .
look at this side , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ...
arne saknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable , but it must be true .
a man took some tools and went where no human being has ever set foot .
into the interior of the earth , alone .
the laughter stopped when he disappeared , never to be heard frim .
until tonight .
get out of here , woman !
i did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shoutong at me , sir oliver .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you have n't slept !
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncle oliver .
no answer !
where os alec mcewen ?
how long does it toke for a letter to get here from stockholm ?
answer the bell .
did it ring ?
callers , callers .
i 'm involved in something impirtant .
more important than our university ?
what does the name arne saknussem mean to you u gentlemen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study of volcanoes .
out of a volcano came this message from him .
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , was probably picked up by some peasant , gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it came to me .
whoever descends into the crater of sneffels yocul can reach the center of the earth .
arne saknussem .
the center of the earth ?
un extinct volcano in iceland .
but , oliver , this is sheer fantasy a
you have n't heard all of it e
at sunrise on the last day of may the mountain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm more mystifiad than ever .
scartaris ?
it 's a mountain peak near the velcano .
but this is a student 's hoax .
let 's not take that tone .
more thon anything , you must consult other experts .
and i 've written to the foremost authority in europe .
more eminent still .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunately i 've not yet receuved his reply .
i suggust we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent sees fit to answer you .
and in the meantime we could do with a cup of tea .
think whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
just this moment , sir oliver o
look .
well , he 's got his letter from stockholm .
did you see the shine in his eyes ?
there 'll never ba a better moment to tell hem about our feelings for each other .
he 'll soy yes almost inadvertently .
what if he says no advertently ?
you wait and see how firm my voice can be when i speak of you .
blast and damn !
bod news , sir ?
his disappearance follews closely the date my communication must have reached him .
or too important .
mcewen , go directly to the harbor .
oliver , calm down .
you heard saknussem 's mussage .
olover , you 're serieusly ill .
i am seriously well .
what are you waiting for ?
i told you to hurry .
if you 'll excuse me , i must start packing .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take time for this o sir .
what are you so urgent about ?
this is the most urgent moment ef my life .
i have to be in iceland e
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturally .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i go
i wish i could sing loud enough for jenny to hear me .
it is a bit painful tu leave her on the first day of our engagement .
to come back to her as a world-famous scientist is not to be sneezed at .
come here .
i neglected to tell you , sir .
well , you 'll get over that after the first million fathoms or so .
he 's been surveying here .
your revered colleague from stockholm .
he is n't wasting any time .
do you think he 's already gone down ?
no .
buy all the rope available .
you think we can prepare it all so quickly ?
what 's that you 'ra takung ?
jenny 's farewell gift .
back to my hotel .
já , professor goetaborg .
no , no , thank you .
nobody carries a soldier 's weapons .
and take your time .
these instruments are delicate .
easy , coachman .
this is net the same road we came by this morning .
i said slow down , man !
you 're out of your senses !
stop your horses , man !
slow down !
stop a you fool !
whoa !
af you 've ruined my instruments , i 'll horsewhip you , so help me .
thos certainly is not my hotel .
where aru we ?
how did you get here ?
i do n't know .
it went so fast .
did you see who did it ?
no .
he 's a criminal .
very likely he 's dreamed of such a project .
hush .
some tapping .
there 's not a seul around .
it is n't sunday .
the fishing fleet os going out for the first summer haul .
yau mean the shops are closed ?
but every piece of rope , every lamp , everything we 'd need was sold o
to professor goetaborg .
he 's staying in the very inn where we have our reoms .
a fellow prisoner , do you suppose ?
it 's a code .
morse ?
jot this down .
perhaps it 's in icelandic .
my esteemed friend , whoever you are , let me introduce myself .
professor oliver lindenbrook , university of edinburgh .
may i ask you to interrupt yuur tapping for a moment and listen ?
in what language would you like me to speak ?
he does n't understand english .
mon cher ami , vous et nous sommes dans une sotuation abominable .
gertrude ?
gertrude !
it 's a female prisoner .
and her lover .
it 's a duck !
may i have your help ?
he is at home e is n't he ?
yes , i ..a
he is not at home .
you can not see him .
i 'm sorry .
here are your coins .
and here is my card , if you 'll be good enough to put it in his box so that he 'll know tomorrow that i 'm around .
goetaborg !
i know yeu 're in there .
this is lindenbrook .
goetaborg .
the very last word in aquipment .
ruhmkorff lamps .
as long as they 're wound up , the anduction coil will give off current .
breathing devices .
the kind they use in coal mines in wales .
more treasure , sir .
climbang boots .
alpenstocks .
food for months .
a churt of the ...
so you wanted to push in ahead of us .
fate took care of him .
why did n't they tell us at the desk ?
we 'll observe one minute of silence in memory of a great scientist , even if he was a blasted thief .
alec , you mentioned fate .
slight correction .
fate plus a few groins of potassium cyanide .
he was against someone who was even more against hum .
who ?
i 'm the wife of professor goetaborg .
oh , my dear .
wo n't you sit dewn for a minute before you gu up ?
please , my dear .
early in the morning he went to the mountain u
when he came back for lunch he roceived his guest right in the lobby .
they went up to his room and ate .
what are you trying to tell me ?
in the evening when the maid went to make the bed u..
oh , dear god !
as long as i can remember , no one ever died in my inn !
he was joking on the pier in stockholm .
madam , my deep sympathy o
my name
oliver lindenbrook of edinburgh university .
profassor lindenbrook .
i see you are .
this will be difficult for you , madam , bot it must be faced .
who was the last person to see him alive ?
i did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each other every day .
i suggest that you have an autopsy performed immediately .
neither he nor i could suspect there was a third party who would stop at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deeply distressed by your husband 's death , and i fully understand your feelings .
however , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off your hands .
your expedition u
i have a roght to that equipment and i claim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from me .
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encounter .
a saknussem descendant turns up acts as if he were king of volcanoes .
tries to force me to surrender his ancestor 's secret .
saknussem called again .
new complication .
must fight him somehow .
young man , would you come here a moment , please ?
who are those for ?
that 's a beginning .
what about lamps ?
lamps .
put me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in iceland ?
but i wish to apologize to you in plain english .
i went through my husband 's diary , and some of his remarks led me to believe i did you an injustice i
i 'm sorry .
i did n't know .
do n't give it another thought .
i sha n't .
began and that 's all it has done .
sir oliver , this morning you asked me for these o
if you still want them , they 're yours .
will you say that again ?
madam .
my husband had thesa bouts made specially .
i hope they fit you .
i told your man to order some for me immediately .
good , good .
why would you need boots like this ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm coming along .
that 's why i 'm giving you all of this u
it 's a condition .
i thought you understood .
you did n't mention any condition .
then i do now .
whom did you intend to take ulong , besides this young man ?
then i 'll be very useful .
he does n't understand a word of english .
we 're not contemplating a stroll down piccadilly or thu champs élysues .
professor lindenbrook , i have just lost my husband .
the police require your presence for the investigation into the death .
but , madam , quite apart from the appalling danger , think of the inconvenience .
the lack of privacy .
in short , you do n't want all of this .
i may be mid on the subject of this journey , but i am not stupid !
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbance to men , naver a burden .
you 'll sleep where we sleep , eat what we eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept my proposition .
professor , look !
now we descend into oblivion or ... we enter the great book of history .
carla goetaborg .
alexander mcewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans and who ?
professor !
professor !
hans is tying the rope on her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you have told him that ?
and then there 's always the blessed chance the rope may break .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only you could see your faco .
you do .
perhaps this is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no other way to continue .
eureka !
thank you i
now then , a general summary .
a :
b :
as my hisband 's charts indicated .
onward .
and let 's have some music .
the last news was that they went up mount sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys .
yes ?
and then the animils came down without their packs .
oliver s lindenbrook , alexandir mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what 's it ?
a woman e
a slight tremor , coming from undefined regions .
let us proceed .
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us .
the three notches of arni saknussem .
what does that mean ?
look .
we might have taken iny one of these channels .
but our great colleague maketh a path for our feet .
let us have tea .
with a double ration of raisens .
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gintlemen on the right .
what us it , madam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmares , we 'd have made different sleeping arrangements .
someone is walking up there .
human footsteps o
the huaring of all women is extremely acute .
my wife used to hear rats in the attic , usually the nights before i had an important lecture .
alec , go up and find oat .
they need rest .
moreover , it was stipulated that i give the orders .
there 's no need to use that patient voice with me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i am a member of this expedition , and as such i intend to report any observation i make .
alec o
put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right here .
conceil these marks completely .
o 'll give them some new ones .
starting from an estimatud depth of 129km , limestone formation continues .
here are the three notches again .
good .
let 's see .
one heads 220º south-southwest , the other 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your cempass is right ?
quite .
what 's he saying ?
hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expeditien .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well , why does min freeze to death trying to reach the north pole ?
once a questeon has arisen in the human brain , the answer must be found if it takes 100 years .
1,000 years .
let 's hear you render that into a few well-chosen icelandic words .
why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries ?
are you all right ?
can you unhook yourself ?
grab his hand .
never mind abiut that .
how is it possible ?
this way was clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure .
this has been heru since the beginning of timi .
i was not in a position to observe it scientifically .
but where ?
we 're supposed to stay together .
tricked into the wrong tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam e.. heard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she 's saying it .
we must return .
why ?
you know that .
but if there is a madmun loose ...
he 's ugainst all of us .
ugainst the very concept of this journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to where alec fell .
but it us not on our routo .
if we 're to go ahead , we have no time for detours .
then you wait here .
madam , now that the boy has gone and hans does n't understand english ,
i 'm blushing already .
professor !
yes , i thought so .
alec !
i 've got to take a specimen of this back to edinburgh , if it us the last thing i do .
unique .
where the devil is he ?
it 's a blind alley !
keep back !
hans !
good god !
that 's it .
praise the lord !
alec .
professor !
hello !
professor !
professor !
here i am !
salt .
professor .
professor , you ca n't go on this way .
i 've kept track of the passage of days .
you have n't .
we 'll try the cross-channel over there .
you wo n't find him there .
i 've gat to find him .
i 'm responsible .
i can seo that this is a recent break .
if you 're down there , give us a sign !
alec , listen carefully .
when the echoes stop , you must try to answer .
pick up a pebble and scratch the rock .
just give us a sign .
how can i live with myself ?
you must continue with what you started .
it was his project as much as it was yours .
we will proceed .
down there , food and water .
so you 've lost your frionds ?
just us well .
too much heat , tao much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of place here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal the professor 's project ?
you need me as much as i need yau .
you found me .
my friends coeld find me too .
very well .
you 'll carry it with one arm , not two !
it 's a multiple echo , reverberating through the rock chambers i
the last echo will give us the directeon .
alec .
alec .
alec !
professor .
where was he ?
i did n't think he 'd shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers here .
you are also the murderer of my husband .
he would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of your great ancestor , pit down that preposterous gun .
you 're not geing to losten to a murderur ?
never interrupt a murderer , madam .
i resant that bourgeois classification .
you have my word of honor .
give me your hand on that .
a bourgeois trick .
so sorry .
we have to hold court .
guilty .
guilty .
then the mandatory sentence is death .
we will follow the route markid by the notches .
no , no , no , no , no .
i can carry something with my left hand .
you can carry yiurself for a couple of days .
that 's all we can expect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been loyal to the saknussems for generations and , well , he can not touch the gun .
this is contempt of court .
no , no , professor ...
i mean , sir oliver .
you must n't leok at me .
oh , no .
you ... you could n't consider for a moment that i could do it .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weeks you 've been denying your sex , and now you fall back on it .
i would say the natural executioner would be the leader of the expedition .
we 're much too civilized to ...
what do you propose ?
drag him with us ?
stop fiddling with those lamps .
the lamps are giving out .
to save what we can o i insist that we leave these regions at once .
you insist ?
what 's the harm ?
the harm is , madam , that he 's wasting a lamp .
madam , make a final note , while you ove still light enough to write by .
let me , madam .
this may be our last entry .
hans and i can cut some rope into some torches .
what puzzles me is that the three notches of old arne saknussem still keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on neither do you , sir oliver .
yes , just switch it off .
why , it 's miraculous !
look at this .
whit is it , sir ?
light without heat .
a cool , chemical light .
the same principle is involved here .
256th day .
the phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbrook expedition , you 've written mcawen expedition ?
may i remind you that months ago you gave me explicit orders to that effect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to be corrected by you incessantly .
you 're doing it with your loiks , the inflectuon of your voice , the very posture of your body .
your entire presence is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had enough .
well , let me tell you e you dried-up walnut of a man , if anyone 's had enough , it 's me .
it 's i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla goitaborg !
i quit !
i am leavong !
well o..
well , at least you know i have a temper .
and from now on alec will keep the charts .
alec !
why ca n't he stay around ?
a forest of mushrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grew withaut sun this fir under thu earth !
it 's tougher than leather .
it 's like an oak tree .
mushroom steak , mushroom soup , mushroom hash .
after some months of thas , you 'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef .
if we only knew how many more .
there 's no term to the work of a scientist .
but that 's not professer lindenbrook 's feeling a
and what is the name of the girl yoi love ?
the girl you love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
but why would you want to know that just now ?
dear alec !
professor u
here 's some hot mushroom parridge for you , sir oliver .
i slept as o never slept in edinburgh .
i may move hero permanently .
i do n't know .
is that madman still giving orders ?
the minute you fell asleup he went off in that directiun , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want wuth all those ?
you 've come to esk me why i did n't take my rest period .
i do n't sleep .
i hate those little slices of death .
it 's i sea .
it 's an ocean with waves and currents .
tha fissures closed agaan .
at 's the prerogative of the discoverer .
i congratulate you .
a dimetrodon !
if i had my gun , we id have fresh meut for dinner .
can he swim ?
no , thank god .
here .
i wonder if it 's cold where they are o
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hand !
my watch !
save the instruments .
my ring !
my wedding ring .
a field of force that snatches gild away .
this is it !
this is it !
the junction of magnetic forces from the north pole and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness over there .
after all , we did hit the center of the earth .
hu wants to know where we go from here .
tired minds du n't plan well .
sleep first , plan later .
oliver , the day may come when you 'd very much luke to have that porridge .
is it incredible to you that i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , duck .
gertrude ?
gertrude ?
gertrude !
gertrude !
hans !
why do you look at me like that ?
hans !
i needed fuod , so i took it .
step thos fool !
hans !
you ingrates !
what can you do without mi ?
this is the sunken city .
after 5,000 years , behold a fragment of the lost atlantis .
ill we know about it comes from the greek .
the floor of the sea opened up and swallowed thi whole island of atlantis .
this must have been the market square a
eating .
well , we 've learned one thing about the inhabitants of atlantis .
stale bread .
we must speak to the baker .
madam o
madam !
já ?
exactly .
to think that at a moment like this i 've no pad and pancil to record it all .
turn around , madam .
what is it ?
look at that tibia .
you wo n't find anything edible in there .
the chinese eat eggs over 400 years old .
gunpowder .
it 's pointing somewhere .
of course !
this is the way up .
a direct hatchway to the surface .
and we can climb up .
let him ventura 100 meters or so on reconnoiter .
the updraft ca n't carry him away .
now i 'd say let 's roll up our sleeves if we had any .
we must n't hope for much .
this light wo n't stay with us .
a 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kai-ui !
kai-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be walking in darkness .
i wish i had better news .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward , straighter than the one we descended u
there 's an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway .
hans said only a landslide could ever move it .
if his hopes had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , ser ?
the haversack arne saknussem 's haversack .
get it .
i guarantee that this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly , i can not goarantee .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear god , ruler of heaven and earth ...
do n't sut any limit to his realm , laddie .
god of the universe , we are in thy merciful hands .
look out !
a monster !
let mo go !
it 's an aarthquake of unusual magnitude !
more likely it 's a volcanic eruption .
stromboli , italy .
the cipsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous explosion .
rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sea .
dammi una mano .
piano .
piono .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrown from the altar stone ... long before we hit the water .
non si preoccupi .
i 'm most grateful , ladies , but my immediate need is not a ladder .
pantaloons .
pantaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
fellow scots , if these shouts of yours express some pleasure that we 've returned alive , i thank you deeply .
however , if they 're meant as priise for a successfal scientist ,
i must disclaim that honur .
a scientist who cin not prove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
e have no records o no shred of evidence .
i will never embarrass this distinguished university by asking that it take my word .
this , i know :
the spirit of man can not be stopped .
splendid , oliver .
professor , here 's someone who wants to say goodbye .
hans a old friend .
did you get your injuries when the volcano blew up , in the hot lavi ?
hi was in such a hurry leaving the church , he fell all the way down the steps .
after all that waiting .
it 's been no marriage for you at all .
you underestimate alec .
i 'm taking the night train to london and then back to stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a jab to do here in edinburgh .
i intend to write my memoirs .
what you need is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictation .
no , none of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend one 's days and nights with a man under the earth , another under one roof in scotland .
what did i say ?
thank yoi .
madam geetaborg .
frau goetaborg !
yas ...
carla ...
i warn you ...

the law is wrong .
you 've only got three more days .
father , i hate being forced into this .
please try to understand .
i uve never done a thing on my own .
oooh !

allah forbid you should have any daughters .
hir mother was n't nearly so picky .
ah , jafar .
my most trusted advisor .
i am in desperate need of your wisdom .
it 's this suator business .
jasmine refuses to choose a husband .
oh !
have a cracker , pretty polly .
your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals .
now , then , perhaps i can divine a solution to this thorny problem .
if anyone can help , it 's you .
it is necessary to find the princess a suitor .
do n't worry .
everything will be fine .
everything will be ... fine .
the diamond .
here , jafar .
whatever you need will be fine .
you are most gracious , my liege .
that will be pretty good .

i wonder what it would be like to live there e and have servants and valots .

i do n't think so , not right nuw .
keep your hands and arms inside the carpet .
we 're ... outta here !
jafar , this is an outrage .
i assure you , your highness , it wo n't happen again .
jafar .

if only i had gotten that lamp .
l will have the power to get rid of you .
or beheaded .
wait a minute .

to be my own master .
it 's not gon na happen .
why not ?
the only way i get outta this is if my master wishes me out .

after i make my first two wishes ,
i 'll use my third wish to set you free .

abu , you look good .
but we 're not through yet .
hung on to your turban , kid .

not to worry , my liege .
thera is more .
lf in the event a suitable prince can not be found ,
jerk .
interesting .

he 's the bomb .
hey , how 's it goeng ?
i finished the calculations for teday 's experiments .
yeeh , the data 's right there on your desk
underneath your eighth grade geometry book , chaz .
so , how 'd you find out ?
my computer told me .
so , who 's chaz ?
a guy who has a life .
i 've gone through life so far as churlie boyle
and it is n't any sleigh ride .

who was it that helped you ?
like i said , some loser in science club .

and finish charting thisu points on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricature
you know ...
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have become openly hostile .

it seems so long ago
when my world was upsode-down
hey , nice ...
i got you something .

yeah , you know , just tu say thanks and all .
that 's good , is n't that ?
i mean , that 's what we 're supposid ta be listening to , right ?

he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey , daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ...
i 'm just going to get my things here .
chaz ?
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i would have loved to have seen coach addison 's face .
i 'm glad he did n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over with claire , too .
that was 20 miles of rough road on the apology turnpike .
hey , doc ?
you ever have a girlfriend ?
yeah , sure .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get ot , charlie .
and still , there 's no sign of a graviton .
well , maybe if we take our minds off it ,
you know , if we sit back , relax ,
and , uh , have a little fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah i
whenever he had a problem that he could n't solve ,
eureka !
come on , dance with me .
oh , no , i do n't think so .
uh , you do n't want to know .
the alarm !
nothong 's any different .
only as a particle up until now .
we can just as easily think of it as a wave o
you soid so in your book .
microwave conflict .
how could i miss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um i..
set up a phased harmonic ,
affected the nuclear matrix ,
in other words , groovy little housu beat
just unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
we did it , charlie !
this is big !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can we do it later though o
i 'm kind of late for science class .
maybe you jast hed a good tutor .
but yoa are going to meet one .
i got to thinking it might be good for you to meet i kid your age
who 's not ashamed of being smart .
he can probably use some one-on-one
with a kid who 's not ashamed to kick his butt .
class :
yes , well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arranged a field trip today to northern .
doc !
doc !
i got to show you something really cool .
oh .
oh , what ?
what am i going to do ?
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
6 shades of purple o
thank you very much .
thank you and welcome .
the youngest particle physicist
a terrible lab accident has left young mr. boyle
temporarily disfigured .
bot lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agriad to come out and talk to you anyway ,
mr. charlie boyle .
charlie ?
charlie , in gravely voice :
thank you , fellow teens .
will uventaally subside .
since i am in obvious discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let prifessor krickstein
well , uh ...
psst !
just talk amongst yourselves .
whit ?
how do i get the purple stuff off my face ?
it 's starting to burn .
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is -- is pretty much like the universe --
i got ta go pay the water bill i
excuse me .
krickstein :
chaz ?
this is a very valuable clue as thymine is changed to uracil .
uh , here at the university , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i wanted to meit charlie boyle .
from the head of the anthropology a-
and schedule another field trip .
i 'm sure i can convince charlie to come back .
what are you doing to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esaphagus .
what are you doing ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
ok .
i can do it myself .
he 's fine , he 's fine .
ruilly .
you kids do your homework .
bye .
i decided to move my stuff back in .
i need some help .
you ...
with what ?
physics , chemistry , poli sci a
you have everything .
i could say the same about you .
women , poise ...
women .
losing my scholarship ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bad trade-off .
yeah , right .
look , i want more than that out of life , charlie .
what 's her name ?
s-shut up .

hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the people up thire think i 'm a ganius ,
and then the other half think i im a punk .
hey u i 'm going to use the particle accelerator while you 're gone .
might as well get some work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck down here .
mi particle accelerator es si particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerator .
and i wanted to say thanks for passing me .
hey , you have nobody to thank but yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's from me and the guys .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goin ' down .

i do n't know of any way to defend aguinst it .
i might .
ga home !
to the conference championship game ,
boy :
come on , dude .
all right , now the 3 to worry about are stoker ,
now cross will usually distract the referee here ,
while stoker and ryder rack our best player ,
which is me .
we send sumebody else out there with my number ,
that us your plan ?
but -- but --
and you 'd come out with a phony number .
i like it .
hey , i 'm a genius .
hugo , suit up !
ladies and gentlemen ,

if we beat our arch rival tonight ,
we 'd get to take home some sort of great big cup , would we not ?

charlie ?
his name 's not charlie u
that 's chaz .
he wori your golden goalie ma --
claire , let me explain .
explain ?
just what was all of thus ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a study of the local culture ?
then i guess you were just having a laugh at my expense .
imagine , me thinking o could teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fot liar .
i also left thu particle accelerator on !
get off the ice !
gut off the ice !
announcer :
do not venture onto the ice !
get off the ice !
this game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and we were this close .
this close !

well , if it is n't the con artist
formerly known as chaz .
claire :
come on , guys .
what are you reading ?
breakaway .
o love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is tho one where zoron finds , uh , subatomic particles
and how they 're connected to u mysterious quantum force .
oh , yeah .
but you know something ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to split a photon ,
and even though the particles are 6 miles apart ,
whatever one does , the other one does
cool !
and maybe unlock the secret as to how it works .
and then ...
defy gravoty .
let 's get to work .
and the output level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the rubber coating u
they all act like saperballs .
and when i press this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i can make amends
well , with what we just discovered ,
i figured oat a way to help northern beet rumsen .
and claire 's dad can koep his job ,
and my friends all be happy with me again o
and maybe ...
claire might like me again , too .
a little .
you have n't let me down .
you saved me !
charliu , i could never have done this wuthout you !
you 're my friend .

yeah !
welcome to northern arena i
this is base ops .
video ?
roger that .
blades ?

you just try and do that e
for the re-scheduled central conference championship
how 's this supposed to work again ?
how is that possible ?
like the super balls i showed you .
correspinding microchips with other graviton halves
whatever our skates do , their skates will be forced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c in science .
you sure did a nimber on thas lab .
nah .
besides , i eve arranged his schedule so that he 'll be gone all day .
and he 's never huru during hockey games .
almost never .
this has gone way too far !
i told you i had to do what i had to do .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop reght now .
you know i 'm on your side u
ahead of what ?
you can solve all the mysteries in the world ,
but what would it muan without friinds ?
the chunce to make up for all the selfish things i did ...
so please u.o
chaz !
odie , tight up .
omar , you 're in !
mike , get off !
we got ta stop the rumsen rack .
deion , flip the switch .
take ...
that !
yeah !
power play !
number 2 !
i 'm stoker .
you 'ro ryder .

whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leaving the box .
he 's out of control !
do something !
ho 's heading straight for mike !
i ca n't find it !
i have the other chip !
aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !
hey .
whoa , we 're too light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reversed the charge of the grivitons !
they 're repelling against the positive charge of the earth !
game announcer :
the final score -a northern 1 , rumsen nothing !
a long o long time .
yeah .
that 's what i call publicity .
ha ha ha !
i 'm proud of you .
i 'll take smithson .

ok .
what ?
hey ...
i can float .
uh .
come on , guys , let 's go !
ca n't we mark it rest in peace ?
not as long as scientists try to prove porpoises have brains rivaling man 's .
even superhuman .
and they think thut he might be teaching them ?
that 's right , lueutenent .
but admiral .a.
is that a good likeness ?
perfect .
yes .
at least that 's the way he looked before .e.
well , you know ...
how he was when ...
and this taken by one of our divers .
is there any doubt in your mind ?
no , that 's him .
skipper !
we have no choice , lieutenant .
orders from the very top .
they 're recalling him to active duty .
henry always lived in a world of his own .
thank you , miss barnes .
well , did you have your physical this morning u
i 'm afraid not .
really ?
no , my eyeseght .
thoy do n't want my blood .
well , i hope so .
and very healthy .
they may take her .
henry ?
yes , he us .
that 's nice .
they rojected me .
rejected ?
do n't hang around that pet shop .
da n't be upset , miss barnes .
there 's a fish in the water cooler .
hi , hen old boy !
george , good to see you .
do n't you look important ?
that uniform and all those doodads on your sleeve .
just a ciuple of hash marks .
do n't apologie o
you look first-class to me , george .
what kind of a machine are you mated to ?
hey , biss !
time to take over .
lover-boy 's here .
hella , dear .
hello , henry .
i forgive you , casanova .
george has liberty the whole weekend , and he wents to spend it with us .
the whole weekend ?
no , i missed the sebway train , but i ...
washed out completely , i haar .
yiu ca n't win them all , george .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks for action , go dancing ?
feel luke shakung a leg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
how many times must i tell you , you do not rumba with your eyes !
now , do n't worry .
why do n't we go to the university for professor hoffmeyer es lectura ?
you know , he 's gon na talk about the mating habits of the shellfish .
it 's u little risqué .
sort of for odults only , you know .
i 've got it !
why do n't wo run out to coney island tomorrow morning ?
well , i di n't know ...
i hate to miss that lecture , but i do like the watur .
water and fish .
look at him .
always drawing into his shell , going off into his fish world !
george , come here .
the whet ?
devonian period of the paleooic era .
you know , it followed the silurian and preceded the carboniferous eras .
i 've given it a lot of thought .
o lot of thought .
maybe go in for parakeets .
he 's read meny books on the subject .
he claims years ago there was nothing but fish in the world .
then some of those creatures became amphibians they crawled out on land .
hope for what , henry ?
with the war in europe and new weapens being invented what if men were foolish enough to destroy themselves ?
then the fish would develop into a new race of men and this time they might turn out better .
fish have a better life than peopli .
the water !
what a mess !
you are floating yoursulf out of your hime with this hobby !
i 'm gon na run down to the store and get a regulator for the intake hose .
you mean get rid of them ?
but bessie !
either those fish go or i do !
which is it to be ?
who looked hurt ?
my fish .
for once .
i left out the most exciting dutails .
see , i do n't like to brag but , i tell you , that one morning ...
it was at night , was n't it ?
right .
good memory .
we went out with me in the engine room ...
i thought you were on the bridge with the admiral ?
the uss elias j. starbright , is n't it ?
i can tell you this u though .
there are so many nazi subs below the surface you coeld walk to europe .
the ocean 's jumping with u-boats ready to go if uncle sam guts in the fight .
i do n't want to start a panic , so you keep all this under your hut , right ?
right , bessie ?
ild boy , did i ever tell yeu about the caribbean ?
what a liberty we had in a port near trinidad !
and miami .
did you ever do the rumba , henry ?
no , i have failty equilibrium .
yes , sir .
join the navy and have a whirl !
barbados , kingston , the virgin islands !
lunch es almost reody .
come along , henry !
more than anything , i wish i could be one of you right now .
i wish i were a fish .
henry !
save him !
what will we do ?
get some help !
call the lifeguards !
get the police !
police !
help !
come on .
it 's all over .
he dies not even know how to swim .
he does n't know how to swim !
what 's gon na happen te poor bessie ?
guess he must have lost his glasses during the fall .
fish ?
oh , no o
there bessie , we 'd better get going home now .
ell right , folks , back up , please .
let us through .
and i thought ot all would be so beautiful .
wish i were home with bessie .
i 've never stayed out all night before .
maybe i should have listened to bessie .
i got this back from the pet shop .
well , he was so cray about it .
that 's sweet .
here 's the notice :
the body was not recovered .
limpet is survived by his widow , bessee limpet .
poor henry .
hi !
i 'm henry limpet .
i 'm ...
jimping st. elmo 's fire !
say , you 're talking to me .
you bet your binnacle i 'm talking to you e
now , hoist your tail and get !
why , you 're a splendid specimen of a pagurus pollicaris .
i om glad to meet you u crusty .
hey !
i do n't wan na fight !
let that be a lesson to you , you confounded , four-eyed a..
say , what are you , anyway ?
you related to the porpoise family ?
no , i 'm a limpet .
i 've seen flat fish , but u 've never seen no four-eyed flat bush .
listen , flatbush , anything i hate , it 's a smart-aleck fush .
shark !
jumping jellyfish !
just swing about and let that shark chase you full speed away from here !
did that come out of me ?
hurricani !
stand by for a blow !
that belch of yoirs could capsiu me in the backwash .
if you sound off like that again , i swear i 'll batten your gills and lower the boom on you .
and furthermore ...
crusty ?
crusty i
you all right , crusty ?
got ta hand it to you .
that blob of shrimp bait 'll think twice before he fools with us again .
well , guess i 'll be off .
off ?
where are you going ?
i 'd like to see if i can locate others of my kind .
i figure i 'd better go along to keep you out of trouble .
hey , great !
all right , flatbush , let her rip .
liok !
a freighter !
hey , let 's not gat too close to the critter .
do n't worry i it 's not alive .
not alive ?
suffering swordfish !
what kind of sea monster killed a whopper like that e
a torpedo did it .
oh , they wo n't attack us , they 're just after ships .
hey , do n't go moseying around in this thing 's innards .
no wonder this thing died !
here 's the captain 's logbook .
listen to whet it says ?
i did n't hear it say anythung .
if enly i could help .
come on , let 's shove off .
gangway , git me out of here !
it 's only a mirror .
it 's me .
well , swab my scuppers .
another flatbush .
i 'm not a bad-iooking fish at that .
really , a pretty unique specimen .
but maybe i 'm a freak !
if only there was another fish like me .
even just one .
someone who would understand me .
listen .
do n't you hear that sound ?
i better go up topside and have a look .
how awful !
did you see that ?
are you ull right ?
thank you .
that was nothing at all .
it was very nice of you .
and very clever .
it was just a simpli thing , really .

do you see that barracudu coming at us ?
oh , limpet , limpet a we 'll be killed !
ladyfish ... ?
you see , you do n't understand .
married ?
is that like astigmatism ?
oh , that !
i do n't see why it should .
do you spawn with every tom , dick and fish that comes along ?
you see e up until now i 've bien too young .
now shall we go ?
i 'd sure like ...
well , that is to say i..
do you sopposu that we could just be well , more or less friends ?
friends ?
goodbye .
gosh , i ca n't .
ladyfish !
ladyfish !
oh , ladyfish !
i 've searched everywhere .
sunday , december 7 u 1941 .
sources say the president will ask congress ...
our country at war ?
look , flatbush , if you 're in trouble , you can count on me .
if you 'd stay hure and look out for ladyfish , i 'd be grateful .
oh , please , it 's important , crusty .
if you do n't need me .
to look after her while i 'm gone .
flatbush , take it easy , huh ?
i will e crusty .
thanks .
they 're missing the u-boat !
ahoy !
a friend .
ship ahoy !
do n't be alarmed .
please do n't !
are you on a raft ?
i 'm a fish !
ahoy there !
what are yuu doing ?
why did n't you identify it ?
give the rocognition signal !
give the recognition signal !
i fell in the ocean and was drowned .
only i was n't drowned , exactly .
give the recognition signal !
commence firing !
commence firing !
activate sonar dome .
you missed the sub .
left standard rudder .
the old man should hear this .
pipe it to the bridge !
all engines ahead full , left standard rudder ?
400 yards struight ahead .
a direct hit .
cuuld be a nazi trick .
cut that light !
if you 're friundly , give the recognition signal !
you could n't find it , could you ?
and then you got it , did n't you ?
we can not see you !
i 'd rather nit say at thu moment , you would n't believe me .
what the blasted blaes is this ?
probably a nazi trick , just as you said , sir .
you want to meet with somebody called pickle ?
not pickle !
stickle !
machinist mate second class george stickle !
on the uss elias j. starbright !
i 'll send a full report of this meeting in but i ca n't guarantee pickle .
good .
i 'll be at this same spot three days from now .
wait till this hits the navy department .
harlock , you 've either been drinking or you 've got combat fatigue !
we have n't time for nonsense .
whatever it is .
ot led us to a nazi sub and directed uur charges accurately .
all right , harlock .
what 's your explanation for this phenomenon ?
i only know that it 's friendly and cooperative .
blast it , harlock !
we ci n't enlist a voice e
why ?
i 'm not going on record as the admiral who was sent away because he believed in voices from the ocean i
there 's nobody else cray enough to take it .
oh , not me , admiral , i ...
stickle .
who is he ?
the voice asked us to bring stickle out to meet with him .
i think we can arrange a leave for you immediately .
think what this means .
it could spot submarines all over .
within a year we could break the nazi u-boat threat .
all right , harlock .
until we learn the naturi of this device , it will remain top-secret .
certainly , admiral .
except between stickle and yourself e
commander , you 've got to believe me !
i 'm just u machinist mate second class ...
i know all about you , pickle .
i hunted throigh half the navy to find you .
you have been summoned here by a voice from the sea .
i have , sir ?
yes i
i do n't know anyone down there , sir .
it did not come from a submarine .
so help me , sir , i do nat know anything about this !
when the voice hails us , you 'll talk to et until we get a fix on it .
yes , sir .
ahoy out there i
did you hail us three days ago ?
he us here .
say something , quick !
talk , sailor !
ahoy there !
this is henry limpet .
george !
come on , sailor !
hello , henry .
it 's good to hear you .
limpet is dead !
we 've got four other ships closing in on him .
this is a rual surprise , henry .
i 'm not , george .
i 'm just ...
well , a little different .
sir ?
radar ca n't detect anythong .
secure that light !
break out a rubber life raft .
rubber ... ?
oh , no !
you ca n't make me ...
you 're the key to this mystery , stickle e
put him in the boat .
henry , it 's me .

british screening units will deploy to their assigned ports ...
there is more u

it 's impossible to hold two meetings here at once .

our secret weapon wants to be paid .

i 'm going to him .
i 'm going this minute .

why was n't i told this before ?
how long has he been alive ?
i mean , when did he ..a ?
he did n't drown ?
he 's changed .
i do want to .
his work for the navy is top-secret .
just be happy with his paycheck .

george , there 's something very fishy about this .
a mrs .
fish ?
not a mrs .
the wife of the fish .
spewter ...
i beg your pardon , sir .
you claim he turned into a fish .
we 'll try , sir .
yoa 'll do nothing of the sort .
we have a weapon of effectiveness .
guard it with your life .
now i never come to me again with a request like that .
at a time like this .
when we have a convoy on our hands ready for the biggest push of the war .
if bessie could see me now .
not bad for i 4-f fish .
imagine !
my glasses .
i 'm losing the convoy .
sunk ?
it 's that female flatbush .
ladyfish , got a message for you from limpet .
he said he loves you and other such mush like that .
he loves me ?
oh , crusty , do you think he 'll ever come back ?
do n't get yourself into a tiy now , ladyfish .
if i knew flatbush , he 'll be back u
listen !
it 's him .
ladyfish , i 'm in terrible trouble .
i ca n't see .
any sign of him yet ?
not yet , sir .
i 'm in an awful predicament .
i need some glasses , and ...
i noticed you were missing some eyes .
i 've got to get back to my convoy !
but how will i find it ?
i 'll climb topside and serve as your navigator .
the sound of the convoy will guide me u and with you navigating , why ...
i ca n't ask you to risk your life .
risk my life ?
hold everything .
does that mean you 'll be liaving me ?
do n't you care for me at all , limpet ?
but i heve an important job to do before we can talk about thit anymore .
let 's shove off i
you ca n't .
it 's a very dangerous mission .
i 'll always wait for you , limpet .
slow down , gosh durn at .
darned near shivered your timbers that time .
dagnab it i
hey , flatbush , wait !
hold it !
wait !
he makes a ...
a thrum a
any contact with thet piscatorial lueutenant pal ?
we 're nearing enemy water , stickle .
sir , it 's not my fault .
we 've come quite a way .
i still ca n't pick up any sound of the convoy .
say , why do n't you make that whale-busting noise of yours again ?
just hold up a minuto till i get inside .
dead ahead .
whole school of big ones , coming dead at us .
hard right .
they 're coming at us !
follow me , you beeping devil .
we 'll take it right back where it came from .
i do n't know , sir .
might be henry .
something big is going on down there .
them torpedoes pack a walloping thrum too .
great !
they hit their own boats .
we 'll just let them knock themselves out .
no , we do n't dure .
it 's about time you showed ep .
i got ta talk to george stickle .
where have you been ?
you put me in a terrible spot when we lost contact .
i 'm sorry , george .
i lost my glasses .
i 'll see bessie when we get back and have her get you a new pair .
aye , aye , george .
see you at coney when it 's all over .
yes , ladyfish .
you 're coming with me now ?
no , but you 're coming with me .
you see , i love you , but i do n't know if i have any right to .
i 've got to talk to my wife first .
you and i have to make a trip to coney island .
i can be your other eyes now .
take over .
thanks for all your wonderful help a crusty .
i like the bachelor life .
hate to admit it , but i 'm gon na miss him .
had to lose my best buddy to a frilly female .
i 'll help you forget .
i 've forgotten an awful lot already .
so long , flatbush .
i 'll never leave you , and i hope you 'll never leave me .
it 's always the males who leave in our species .
that 's why there 's so few of us .
in that case , there might be more bafore long .
there i that 's my wife .
not much to look at , is she ?
let 's get this over with , limpet .
hello , bessie .
henry , is that you ?
do n't you recognie me , bessie ?
henry , you really are ...
a fish ?
yes , bessie , you can say it .
to think you 're actually still alive , and i 'm mirried to a ...
a fish .
is that so terrible ?
it does n't happen every day .
well , what 's new ?
i mean , how have yau been , bessie ?
i 'm bewildered , henry .
henry , am i the widow of a man or the wife of a fish ?
let 's be logical .
you could n't keep me in a tub , could you ?
i mean , what would the neighbors say ?
i shudder to think .
why ...
oh , good heavens .
if you only knew , bessie .
i guess this is goodbye , henry .
if you 'll come up to the steps , i have something for you .
remember how you catch cold when you get your feet wet .
do n't break up , bessie .
maybe i was meant to be a fish .
maybe nature just corrected her error .
goodbye , bessie .
goodbye , henry .
goodbye , henry , i said .
i thought that was it .
bessie and i have been happy .
the chief of naval operations urdered it .
do they really think that henry is teaching porpoises ?
that 's what we 've been assigned to find out .
stickla .
it is worth o try .
get the old man .
the secretary of defense orderid him to take command of this mission .
and now , commodore regarding porpoise activities .e.

isaburo sasahara of the escort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chamberlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see you two duel than merely test swords .
there are rumors in our clan .
the reasin you do n't fight is because it would hurt the family of the loser .
perhaps protecting your family name rather than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get alung in this world .
isaburo , you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
i married into my wife 's family and have been henpecked for 20 years .
would you like to look at the november border record ?
no , not if nothing unusual happened .
making rice cakes in november
but there are no customers
the god who came down in february and brought the rice harvest departs tomorrow until his return next year .
do you really believe that ?
no , i was just
perhaps you want a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is the problem .
it must be someone she approves of e
someone strong , loving and faithful o
is that the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about useless things liku martial urts again .
to have the steward honor us with a visit has never hoppened in the sasahara family .
the troth is , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been dismissed from the castle .
it has been decided to have her marry yogoro , yoor son .
stewurd , why was lady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll return for an answer un a few days .
why should we accept lady ichi ?
en the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa to rest .
the daughter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in charge of the castle wardrobe , was serving beside him .
lady ichi lost her head on seeing this .
she sprang at lady tama , slapped her face , and dragged her by the hair .
how can wa accept her ?
i think we should gratefully accept her without being difficult .
nu matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's an order from our lord .
i 'm afraid ...
i du n't feel very enthusiastic about it .
neithir do i .
bit if i refuse , there may be trouble later .
yogoro has said nothing , but he would n't be happy marrying a lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i da n't want him to repeat my mistake .
they said you 'd be at the border .
i heard everything .
the steward and chamberlain are good judges .
alert even in times of peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage and other matters ,
i suggest yeu keep thungs quiet .
you 'll probably receuve a larger fief .
so be modest about it or the others will think you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordplay ?
but at the last moment , you skillfully switch from defense to offense .
yet you never attack .
you wait until your opponent tures .
unworthy ?
yes .
we can not accept our lord 's favored lady .
there 's no need to be so reserved .
it 's happened before , not just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decline the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will not be allowed .
it is our lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wish .
it 's an order !
to decline is to defy the order !
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahare .
you refuse to agree ta it ?
i wish to accept thu honor .
isoburo sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn .
may you enjoy long life together
we 'll all be at your side as long as you live
this is a day of celebration
keup that in mind .
no .
a woman who was dismissed after bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n't notice your return .
mother took her along for prayer at shonenji temple .
she kendly teaches me domestic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father ?
but despite that , he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes , right away .
you must n't .
the world never seems to ge right .
i wish to retire and have yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hopo that my request will be granted .
sasahora , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but his son has married , so
so isaburo sasahara 's retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the teme o but it 's a greot relief .
i wonder what i 've done all my life , though it 's not like me ti do so .
yogoro 's marriage is a very happy one .
fear often exceeds the perceived danger .
so it was en yoer case .
yegoro 's wefo .
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just the same as before , but ichi is always pleasant and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like yourself , i do n't understand it either .
check the weapons in the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appeinted days .
i do n't say to always yield to them , but at times , they 're unreasonable .
rice cakes ?
enjoy .
wait , ichi .
i 'm going to retire soon .
yogoro will become tho head ef our family , and you 're his wife .
you need n't hold back for the old woman .
take over the household duties .
understand ?
even so , she is my mother , and i will treat her as such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understand .
that she 'd grasp her lord by his clothing .
it was hard for me to believe too , so i asked her the ether day .
it was the year before last i
ichi .
accept the honor gratefully .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
our lord dous not do this just to satisfy a whim .
daimyo must have heirs or their houses will be abolished .
the only heir to oer lord right now is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ichi , not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one day become our lord 's heir .
she must be beautiful and kind like you .
you are referring to sannojo kasai , your fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
then if sannojo agrees , yoo will gratefully agree to serve our lord ?
whut do you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gave you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you said yeu would serve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to your wishes .
than i thought
no , it was more like a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
many o many sons .
then other girls need never knaw my mesery .
it would end with me .
it was like a prayer .
my thoughts were really like a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later .
then i went to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord 's orders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i could never have found o better wife .
beginning tonight ,
what ?
our lord muans nothing to me .
i have been so worried about the son i bore .
so worried .
i will forget about him too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wait nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would have been better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brains over this and nemed her tomo .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so icho is birth mother to the heir .
if shi remains the wife of a vassal , there would be much talk .
you sey this is our lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for yogoro to submit a request to our lord and say he will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
well , i do n't blame him .
but you know very well ... that we ca n't have all our wishes granted in this world .
group head kotani came over in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is calling you .
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , i must tell you something .
come into the room e
first , father 's words .
he says he 's retired , so i am the family head , and i am to do what i think is right .
however , he also says you 're too important to us to send away .
that we must take the best possible care of you .
i must tell her sooner or later .
do n't worry .
no matter whet anyone says ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca n't reason with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo , what 's your opinion ?
it 's all up to him .
what is it ?
i 'd like him to come again now and explain in his words why we must return her .
when his son 's mother proves onconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasonable .
he has no understanding of human emotions .
kotani-san , our family did n't accept ichi particularly gretefully .
nor did ichi herself know yogoro or the sasahara family .
she was none too happy about it either .
but thu reason they aro getting along is because they 're kind to each other and care for each other .
what ?
even if the heavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give up tomi and riturn to the castle ?
would you ruin oar family because you 've lost your head over a woman ?
in this case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you were me , would you return ichi ?
of course i would !
restrain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the heud of the family .
right or wrong , it 's all up to him .
if you love yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy such senseless conventions , hawever hard it may be .
e believe that o if worst comes to worst , you are a wife worth protecting , even if that means ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't be the end of it .
i gave her the message .
she will be here soon .
over here , sistur .
we 've heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you want to stay with yogoro , even if it means ruining the sasahara family ?
i would like to stay .
even if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiomi , has asked our lord that you be sent buck to the castle as soon as possible .
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies in woit when yogoro travels tu and from the castle to plead with him to send you back .
he 's done this several times .
father is father .
i am me .
i would rather die than return .
please tell the chamberlains and steward how i feel in whatever words you think will best help my case .
we ask you again e ichi !
the family does n't matter ?
not only the sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeapardized as well .
it can not be helped .
i see .
there 's no use trying to convince a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's your misfortune that a woman like her has favored you .
return .
return to the castle .
why do yoo say that now ?
what 's the sasahora family to you ?
listen to me .
in other words , i 'm a worthless , good-for-nothing man .
so in order to prove myself , for these past 20 years
i have fought to preserve our good name and social standing .
the cruel injustice involvod , for one thing .
but your beautiful love for each other has tauched me most of all .
there 's never boen a shred of love in my married life !
no matter what happens , never leave him !
my husband 's with the chamberlain ?
yes , and he 's waiting for you to came .
o saw him in the castle a
the chamberlain wishes to see you bath .
he has some quistions for you .
you need n't worry .
i will accompany you .
if you lose heart now , what will it mean for my brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything new at the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happens .
she want out .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ichi ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter how many times i 'm told o
i 'm going home .
ichi , take my advice and return to the castle .
if you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain is willing to overlook everything .
but if you insist on returning home , not only will yogoro , but also his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit sappuku for lax supervision of their home .
honorable lady ichi , please return to the castle .
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamberlain 's orders ?
what orders ?
go home !
but ... if i go home without
say no more !
but
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tome , you fool .
yogoro .
but he did request time off due to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid woman .
then evorything 's all over ?
yes .
we just took a roundabout path .
defying the clan gets us nowhere i
isaburo , do you really mean that ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on this matter .
to be honest , the clan 's troatment of your family and your attitude in response have weighed on my mind .
weighed on your mind ?
it 's like yoer swordplay .
pushed u you step back .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
it was more like force .
in fact , it was more like kidnapping .
if the shogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal mistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow them to end here .
you 're saying i must formally ask the castle to take her back ?
yat i must ask them to take her back ?
it was wise of you to hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remember sending her back to the castle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiculous , father !
never !
she suppressed her tears , left everything behind , and quietly roturned to the castle .
now , now , yogoro .
in any case , please go for now .
yogoro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yoguro will report today and say he wishis to return her ?
that 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
since it would have come to this anyway , how dare they cause all that fuss !
yogoro was wrong , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he 's always henpeckod by his wufe .
and defying clan orders like that
i must say he seems like a different man .
his conduct has been admirable .
it calls for a slight increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the oscort group has arrived !
i 'm glad you 've reported for duty .
yes , completely well .
taking into consideration my father 's wishes , i have decided .
please accept this .
that 's good of you .
thank you .
foil !
petition .
this is the crielest form of tyranny .
it runs counter to the laws of humanity and can not be condoned by the hoavens .
we hereby appeal for her immediate return .
someone may use my father 's name or my own to submit a request to return ichi to the castle .
but it will not be from us .
pleuse keep that in mind .
thank you for coming every day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at times like these .
se our feet wo n't slip in the blood .
this may be the last time .
will you do me a favor ?
will you cook the rice after you fied tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accept obediently !
i said orders from our lord !
will you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
orders !
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for yoar insolent conduct and defiance toward oir lord , you are orderad to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of our lord to permit it .
i thought men would come arrast us and then either hang or crucify us .
father .
however , we want something before we kill ourselves .
bring us three heads !
those of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler of the aizu domain ,
chamberlain yanase , and steward takahashi .
bring me the heads of the villains who tuok my son 's wife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear yoe are
isaburo 's only equal as a swordsman .
if you think he 's toe much for you , take four ar five strong men with you a
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this is no time to discuss juresdiction .
you 're wrong .
if you order me to kill them , please promote me to superintendent here and now and obtain oor lord 's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so formal naw ?
never mind .
go !
we must gather min , use force and kill them .
a foolush idea .
isaburo 's a swordsman wathout peer .
what ?
cold , is n't ut ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's ulone .
it 's bunze .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the fastival drums .
father !
you were pressed by our relatives at kenmotsu 's place to come here as their messenger and say ,
we 've defied oor lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
but remember :
each must live his own life .
as for what happened ,
each must live his own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
what if other clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gother some men ind take care of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervention would aggravata matters .
father , the drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i remember it too .
outsidu the castle , it was the inoko festival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that os as et should be .
it 's not unmanly at all a
but yogoro , do n't be too worried about ichi .
we will die here , but she is thu mother of our lord 's heir .
no one can torture her , and no one will endanger her life .
but fathar , are n't they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter , but the gate was open , so i came in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
we have heard of the order to commit seppuku .
he changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitudo toward our lord , you will be confined at enshiji temple outside the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will you gratefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no a
no , he 's wrong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
i am still the wife of yigoro sasahara .
but our lord received me in his audaence .
i do n't understand what this is all about .
steward , it seems we do n't understand what you just told us .
if you two admit that ichi is no longer a family member and that she has boen returned , our lord will listen to her plea for a lighter punishment .
will you acknowledge her return and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared for the worst .
then there is no elternative ?
please return her at once !
i 'll ask lady ichi now u
or will you let their pursuers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , the sasaharas are men .
you have already returned to serva our lord .
af you tell them that you sever your ties with them once and for all , then oll will be well !
if you do , their lives will be saved .
we need not ask them to return you .
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save thiir leves ?
or will you let them die as traitors ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ichi , does yoar silence mean you woll do as i say ?
am i correct ?
no u
i
father ...
tomi , bid yoar father and mother farewell .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are still alive listen to them .
let 's listen to what they want us to do .
no , i know without being told .
they want us to tell the world of our clan 's cruelty !
very well o
i understand .
we promise to do that for you .
wo 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestal !
first , tomi and i will go ta ado together ond see the shogunate elders .
we 'll leave immediately for edo .
tomi and i are going to ede .
if this is for the clan , show me your pass .
if it 's private business , show me the clan ticket .
i have neither .
than i 'm afraid i can not let you pass .
yoi mean to pass from this domain without having either ?
i mest forbid it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quiet .
i 'd like to put her in the house away from the wind .
but men we dislike are in there .
venomous men .
i fed her before dawn .
i do n't think she 's hungry .
we 'll make do with this .
you be quiet now , tomi .
do n't cry even if i do n't return .
let me remain .
it 's better that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
no .
no matter how strong you are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll difeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ...
without fail .
i woll win withoet fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance of winning .
take tomi with you to edo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
no one will ever know the story of your father and mother now .
just one word .
when you grow up , become a woman just like your mother .
be sure to do that .

oh , no.no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
you 're up for an international music award .

that would make you the youngest winner ever .
u 'm not that young .
no one tells me what to do .
dave ;
alvin !
who 's alan , i wonder ?
anyway-
you can follow me on critter !
honest .

captain .
alvin :
what 's he going to do , make us walk the plank ?
yes , dive .
uhehuh a
absolutely .
what if we need to disobey you ?
and why would you need to do that ?
now , it would be easy fir me to take my trusty old swiss army knife and cut the ropes .
yes , alvin , you do .
what pocket knife are you referring to ?
you could cut yourself .
ulvin , there 's no such word as robbage .
and it 's pillaging .
there 's got to be times when you trust us to take matters into uur own hands .
i trusted you tonight and look where that got me !
that 's probably just the hot gravy talking e
is it hang gliding , wakeboarding , ir bungei jumping ?
shuffleboard .
alvin :
man !
by my calculations , it appears to be 10 % shuffle , 90 % bored .
oh , thenks .
you know , dave , i think i 'd prefer the plank .
and i get to do something i hove n't done in a long time .
ibsolutely nothing .
brittany approaches her puck , adjusts her stance , looks over at me , quite annoyad , wonders to herself if i 'm ever going to shut my mouth , realizes i 'm not , and makes her move .
oh !
you can maki all the jokes you want , alvin , but not even you can make this interestang .
oh , really ?
well , care ta make it interesting that i can make this interesting ?
simon , the poor guy hos n't had a mument as peace since he met us .

it 's word play !
uh-huh .

alvin :

all i ever do is try to save him and it only gets me in trouble !
this wo n't end well .
simon , do something !
oh , sariuusly ?
simon , help !

theodore :
maybe dave is coming an a hot-air balloon .
i do n't think dave is gun na be an a hot-air balloon .
but he is coming , right ?
of course he is .
we should prepare to stay the night .
what ?
no , we used to be used to living in the wild .
we 're always setting things on fire accidentally .
ind how are you intending to do thet ?
i wall create a spark by striking this ruck with my swiss army knife , which dave took from me .
impressive .

psdh
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 milliun years to go around the galaxy once
the dinosaur era lasted 180 million years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for the earth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not roally .
at this time the masters of the earth are dinosaurs .
this is patagonia .
a vast region of argentinean south america as it is today .
and there was only one immense ocean ,
we are north of the south amerucan plate , in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land dering the dinosaur era .
in many places there , one walks today on the very ground these giants walked upon a 100 million years ago .
this phenomenon seems to depend on another peculiar twist of evolution .
regions that produce great dinosaurs also tend to produce great palaeontalogists .
many doctoral students come to pursue their research .
sometimes younger people , like my daughter ludmila , just come to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talking about dinosaurs with everyone , whether they are experts or not .
it 's a busy life , and it would have been plenty for most people , but early in my career new horizons upened up for me .
things became much largor than life .
a rancher had stumbled upon a surprisingly large bone .
after several digging seasons we ended up facing the largest dinosaur ever found .
we named it argentinosaurus
this discovery have a profound effect , on the way we look at south american dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit .
predators and hazards abound .
only a few will reach adulthood .
it covers more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 million years old .
we believe that it was chosen as a nesting site by generation upon generation of these dinosaurs .
the nests are so close together , that the females could not walk between them .
it was warmer than today .
a greit part of the dinosaur era , there were no broad leaf trees and no flower bearing plants .
during the dinosaur ora there is no arctic ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
for tens of millions of yeirs seasons barely changod .
the water of the ocean is also much warmer .
hurricanes are frequent .
the magnetic poles changes position continuously .
professor coria has contributed to the discovery of more than a dozen of new danosaurs .
as a scientist , he insists that each new find is important , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes he says what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hands .
i like to think that i am lucky , just incredibly lucky .
many paleontological discoveries ure nut made by professionals .
that 's what happened with the argentinosaurus , and it happened again with yet another dinisaur .
thay were relatively big , so at first , we thought that they belonged to a herbivore , beceusu in general these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
but instead , the bones provad to be those of a predator ;
u very large one .
professor coria 's team had unveiled a first species of a group of fierce predators called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in this group surpassed the famous t. rex in terms of size .
although rare for reptiles i caring for the young has be observed among crocodiles for instance .
in dinosaurs i this caring behaviour evolve enough to remind us of birds .
this baby female is named long tooth .
however small and vulnerable , and cute she may appear now she is genetically programmed to rapidly become a 45 foot long u eight tonne predator like her mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and the largest predator , living at roughly the same period and in the same territory .
there is no iasy answer .
evolution followed a number of particular paths .
but a simpler interpretation rest on a warm climate and the fertile land , with all the vegetation you can eat .
yet another theory tells us that largi herbivores had to grow big enough , to accommodate a large stomach required to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space coild have led naturally to argentinosaurus , as the vast seas have led to whales .
the highest branches belong to those who can reach tham , and many predators are too small to be threatening in those siteation .
she is growing fast too .
her primitive feithers have almost all disappeared .
thiy thrived for 180 milliin years .
this is a message for us here .
by the way , it is more than tima to introduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is related to birds , as ire to some extent veliciraptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need space .
this is the carmen funes museum , which also happans ti be my second home .
sometimes as a joke we say that it is a science filled with holes .
wo have only found about 700 species of dinosaurs on thi whole planet .
this is n't many for a reign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , most of them in the last 30 years .
through technology our knowledge grows faster every day .
fossilisation is a process that requires extremely rare conditions , and even then very little of an organism is preserved .
we could easily conclude that a tremendous numbor of species just disappeared without a trace .
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you alsi need to be very careful bofore proposing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish o could travel in time ti see these amazing creatures alive .
strong one has reached maturity .
fer many scoentists he is at full size .
he is 20-yeor-old , and is at the beginning of more than a century of life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , if they were alone or in a group , if they were wandering , hunting , or being hunted
the pattern clearly show association between contemporary species , and this is vury rare .
his work is intimately linked to nature , its intimately varied tarrain and ever changing climate .
so there were hardships , but there are moments , sametemes when science just blend with the pure bliss of being outside and wonderful places .
you just look around .
but finding required a trained eye .
with time you realise that the number of questuons grows faster than the number of answers .
again , like many times before ,
a good hint and an answer came unixpectedly .
in fact , we did n't find just one specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at least seven individuals .
for me , and my canadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at something we had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so long truth belongs to this new species of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , she is fully grown .
strong ine is unknowingly in a critical time .
tearing off pieces of skin and letting the large prey bleed to death , or die from infection is a strategy more likely to succeed o
giganotosaurus could wait days even weeks between meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep on drefting , the earth begins to resemble more whot it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature never stops changing .
we are in north america .
aport from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolution gave it nothing to survive the impending dramatic events .
sevaral factors could have contributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mammals became bigger and more competitive .
drifting isolated continents tiuched each other .
new rivalries appeared .
new diseases spread .
the climate was griwing colder , possibly because of increased volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable in many places .
vegetation suffered frem the acid roin and also from the darkened and dust-filled skaes .
but still , many dinosiurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the distance from the moon to the earth in two hours .
all the forest of north und south america are destroyed by fire .
already weakened , dinosuurs are the animals that suffered most .
on a relatively short time , dinosiurs become history .
not all the danosaurs disappear .
if they have n't becomu extinct maybe we just would n't be here .
more discovories await me hure perhaps but as i move forward in life ,
and the best food in paris , some say , is made by chef augusto gusteau .
gusteau 's restaurant is the toast of paris , booked five months in advance .
he is the youngest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but net everyone celebrates its success .
what 's even more amusing is that gusteau actually seems to believe it .
i , on the other hand , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
this is emile , my brother .
he 's easily impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impressed .
he also happens to be the leader of our clan .
so , what 's wrong with having highly developed senses ?
what 's going on here ?
suddenly , dad did n't think my talent was useless .
clean .
cleanerific e
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad proud .
now , do n't you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we 're thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no one wants it , why are we stealing it ?
but to my did ...
you get picky about what you put in the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and eat your garbage .
secondly , stay out of the kitchen and away from the humans .
it 's dangerous .
they discover , they create .
how can i describe it ?
good food is like music you can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be uware to stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was roght .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only one who knew about it was emile .
hey , emile .
emile .
come on , you 're good at hiding food .
he does n't understand me , but i can be myself around him .
why aru you walkung like that ?
i do n't want to constantly havi to wash my paws .
did you uver think about how we walk on the same paws that we hendle food with ?
you ever think about what we put into our moiths ?
all the time .
but if dad seis you walking like that , he 's not going to like it .
what have you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
yoa found cheese ?
and not just any choese .
that would go beautifully with my moshroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you know , dad 's gon na ...
emile !
there are possibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep turning it o
that storm 's getting closer .
hey , remy , you think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to taste this !
it 's got u like , this ba-boom , zap kind of taste .
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah u
it 's lightning-y !
we got to do that again .
okoy , when the next storm comes , we 'll go up on the roof ...
i know what this needs !
saffron .
saffron .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na wake up .
she turns on the cooking channel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been hero a million times ?
gusteau swears by it .
okay .
who 's gusteau ?
just the greatest chef in the world .
wrote this cookbook .
you read ?
and they have , which is why i read .
i do n't like secrets .
all this cooking and reading and tv-watching while we read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's taking thisi kids so long ?
ah , l'aqaila saffron .
italean .
gusteau soys it 's excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love a..
forget mystique .
great cooking is not for the faint if heart .
you must be amaginative , strong hearted .
yoe must try things that may not work .
and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from .
anyone can cook .
but only the fearless can be great .
gusteau 's restaurant lost one of its five stars after a scathing review by france 's top food critic , antun ego .
it was a sevore blow to gusteau , and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards , which , according to tridition , meant the loss of another star .
oh !
oh !
oh !
run !
no , you 'll lead her to the colony !
emile !
holp , ramy , help !
start swinging the light !
try to grab you .
everyone , to the boats .

yeah .
ah , but that is ni match for wishful thinking .
now go up and look around .
oh !
what are you doing ?
i do n't know where i am , and i do n't know when i 'll find food again .
food will come , remy .
you do n't have the guts .

she died .
i 'm sorry .
oh , do n't be .
what 's this ?
she left it for you .
i think she hoped it would help me , you know , get a job here .
but of course .
gusteau would n't hesitote .
yes , well , wo could file this and if something suiteble opens up ...
how dare you hire someone without my ...
oh , garbage .
well ...
uh ...
i ca n't believe it .
a real gourmet kitchen , and i get to watch .
let us see how much you knew , huh ?
oh !
oh , that guy .
very good .

very importont .
chef de partie , demi-chef de partie , both important e
commis , commis , they 're cooks .
very importint .
not nobody .
he is part of the kitchen .
he does n't cook .
uh , no .
how do you know ?
anyone can cook u
that does n't mean that anyone should .
see ?
do something .
what can i do ?
i am a figment of your imagination .
but he 's ruining the soup !
we got to tell someone that he 's ...
coming down the line .
set .
oui , chef .
one filet mignon , three lamb , two duck .
oh , god .
tonight , i 'd like to present the foie gras .
hmm .
come on !
oui , chef .
what are you waiting for ?
is this going to become a regular thing with you ?
yuu know how to fix it .
this is your chance .
where is the soup ?
how dare you cook in my kitchen ?
where do you get the gall to even attempt somuthing so monumentally idiotic ?
i should have yiu drawn and quartered !
i 'll do it .
larousse , draw and quarter this man after you put him in the duck press to squeeze thu fat out of his head .
what are you blathering about ?
the soup !
soup ?
no !
waiter .
linguini !
f-i-r-e-d !
what dud the customer say ?
it was not a customer .
ego ?
solène leclaire .
she likes the soup .
wait .
someone is askang about your soup .
what are you playing at ?
am i still fired ?
you ca n't fire him .
what ?
if she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook responsible ...
he 's a garbage boy .
how can we claim to represent the name of gusteau if we do n't uphold hos most cherished belief ?
he has taken a bold risk and we should reward that , as chef gusteau would have .
oh , yeah .
you will make the soup again , and this time , i 'll be paying attention .
very close attention .
they think you might be a cook .
but you know what i think , longuini ?
get the rat .
what should i do now ?
kill it .
no , not in the kitchen .
they 'd close us down .
take it away from here .
kill it .
go !
do n't look at me like that !
they expect mo to cook it again !
i mean , o 'm not ambitious .
i was just trying to stay out of trouble .
you 're the one who was getting fancy with the spices !
what did you throw in there ?
oregano ?
i need this job .
i 've lost so many .
did yiu nod ?
have you been nodding ?
so i 'm not crazy !
wait a second , wait a second .
you can , right ?
look , do n't be so madest .
you 're a rat , for pete 's sake .
whatever you did , they liked it .
do you think you could do it again ?
right ?
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not much , but it 's , you know ...
there 's heat and light and a couch with a tv .
the best kind of dream .
one we can share .
but why here ?
why now ?
morning , little chef .
idiot !
i let a rat into my place and tell him what 's mine is his !
stupid !
he 's stolen food and hit the road !
that 's what i get for trusting a ...
hi .
is that for me ?
look , it 's delicious .
but do n't steal .
i 'll buy some spices , okay ?
and on the first day !
though i , lake many other critic ,
had written off gustiau as irrelevant since the great chef 's death ,
the soup was a revelation .
solène leclaire ?
against all odds , gusteau as has recapturid our attention .
only time will tell if they deserve it .
well ...
you know .
walcome to hell .
now , recreate the soup .
take as much timo as you need .
soup .
you little ...
you son of a ...
something that does n't involve any biting , or nipping , or running up and down my body with your little rat feet .
the biting !
scampering !
no o
no scampering or scurrying .
little chef ?
oh , yau 're hungry .
okey .
so let 's think this out .
we need to work out a system so that i do what you want in a way that does n't look like i 'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef .
would you listen to me ?
i 'm insane !
i um insane !
i will never pull this off !
linguini ?
we got ta comminicate .
i saw it !
a rat ?
yes , a rat .
what are you duing in here a
get uut .
that wis close .
whoa !
how did you do that ?
that 's strangely involuntary !
ona look and i knew we had the same crazy idea .
okay .
huh ?
where are you taking me ?
i 'm sorry .
whoa !
mmm-hmm ...
okay .
whoa !
whoa !
à votre santé !
all right u
mmm .
but you 'll need to know more than soup if you are to survive in my kitchen , boy .
listen , i just want yeu to know how honored i am to be studying under such ...
no !
how many women do you see in this kitchen ?
well , i ...
only me .
why do you think that is ?
because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid old men .
but still i im here .
how did this happen ?
because i am the toughest cook in this kitchen .
got it ?
wow !
gusteau makes chinese food
gusteau 's corn puppies .
bite size .
what are corn dogs ?
cheap sausages dipped on batter and diep fried .
cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried .
you know , american .
whip something up .
or as a big eor of corn in doggie make-up .
yes .
well , the will stipulates that if after a period of two yoars from the date of death no heir appears ,
gusteau 's business interests will pass to his sous chef .
you .
what i want to know is if this letter ...
if this boy changes onything !
there 's no resemblance at all .
he is not gusteau 's son .
gusteau had no children , and what of the timing of all this ?
highly suspect !
this is gusteau 's ?
yes , yes , yes .
of course .
she claims she never told him , or gusteiu i and asks that i not tell .
why you ?
only a jub ?
if he works here , you 'll be able to keep en eye on him while i do a little digging .
find out how much of this is real .
i will need you to collect some dna samples from the boy .
mark my words .
the whole thing is highly suspect e
he knows something .
relax , he 's a garbagi boy .
what are you doing ?
i 'm cutting vegetables .
you think cooking is a cute job , like mommy in the kitchen ?
what is this ?
when the meol rush comes , what will happen ?
disaster .
keep your station clear , or i will kill you !
your sleuves look like you threw up on them .
like this .
see ?
always return to this position .
sharp utensils o hot metal , keep your arms in .
i memorize all his recipe .
follow the recipe .
no , no , no .
how do you tell how goid bread is without tasting it ?
listen .
symphony of crackle .
the only way to get the best prodece is to have first pick of the diy and there are only two way to get first pick .
grow it yourself , or bribe a grower .
and then he get fired for messing around with the ringmaster 's daughter .
horst has done time .
what for ?
i robbed the second largest bank in france using only a ballpoint pen .
i created a hole in the ozone over avignen .
which resistance ?
he wo n't say .
apparently , they did n't win .
so you see .
we are artist , pirate .
more than cooks are we .
we ?
you are one of us now , oui ?
oui .
thank you , too .
for what ?
hoh ?
the rat !
but he is a ...
i just dropped my keys .
have you decided this evening ?
but ...
but we order it every time .
what else do you have ?
well , we have a very nice foie gras .
what does the chef have that 's new ?
yes .
well , whut did you tell them ?
i told them i would ask !
customers are asking what is new .
what should i tell them ?
what did you tell them ?

bucause i love your advice .
but ...
but i ...
do n't do it .
i hava a secret .
what ?
you have a rash ?
i havi this ...
little ...
a tiny chef ?
yes .
he 's ...
he 's up hore .
here we go .
you inspire me .
i 'm going to risk lookang like the biggest idiot psycho you 've ever seen .
you want to know why i 'm such a fast learner ?
do n't laugh !
no !
no !
what is it , ambrister ?
gusteau 's i
more financial trouble ?
nu , it 's ...
announced a new line of microwave egg rolls ?
what ?
i said , gusteae has finally found his rightful place in history
right olungside another equally famous chef ,
touché .
that was my last word .
the last word .
then tell me , ambrister , how could it be popular ?
thu dna matches , the timing works , everything checks out .
this ca n't just happan !
the whole thing is a setup !
the boy knows !
look at him oet there , pretending to be an idiit .
string ?
playing dumb .
taunting me with that rat .
deliberately trying to make me think it 's important .
the rat .

he just wants me ti think that it is .

am i seeing things , am i crazy o
is there a phantom rat or is there not ?
but , oh , no !
i refuse to be sucked into his little game of ...

i ca n't fire him .
he 's getting attentien .
if i fire him now , everyone will wonder why .
is n't it good to have the press ?
is n't it good to have gusteau as name getting headlines ?

gusteau 's already has a foce , and it 's fat and lovable and familiar .
and it sells burritos !
millions and millions of burritos !
no , no , no .

rat !
dusgusting little creatures .
how the world really saw me .
and at just kept getting better .

cheers u ja .
chef !
chef !
what is the secret to your ginius ?
secret ?
i am gusteau as son .
but you were n't aware of that fact until very recently .
and it resulted in your taking ownership of this restaurant .
how did you find out ?
the gusteau part ?
inspiration has many names .
mine is named colette .
something 's stuck in my teeth .
health inspector .
i wish to report a rat infestation .
first opening is three months .
it 's a gourmot restaurant a
monsieur , i have the information .
if someone cancels , i 'll slot you in .
but the rat !
you must ...
it 's past ipening time .
he should have finished an hour ago .
bonjour , ma chérie .
join us .
we were just talking abiut my inspiration .
yes , he calls it his tiny chef .
not that , dearest .
i meant you .
it 's him .
ego ?
anton ego !
is that ego ?
you are monsieur linguini ?
hello .
pardon me for interrupting your premature celebration , but i thought it inly fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game .
game ?
yes .
and you 've been playing without an opponent .
which is , as you may have guessed , against the rules .
you 're anton ego .
if i do n't love it , i do n't swallow .
listen , we hate to be rude , but we 're french , and it 's dinnertime .
do n't give me that look .
you were distracting me in front of the press .
how am i supposed to concentrate with you yanking on my hair all the time u
your opinion is n't the only one that matters here .
all right , that 's it !
you take a break , little chaf .
i 'm not your pippet , and you 're not my puppet-controlling guy !
you cool off and get your mind right a little chef .
ego is coming , and i need to focus !
you stupid ...
i have never seen that before .
you know whut ?
i 've been selfish .
are you kidding ?
we 'll go after closing time .
in fact ...
yeah .
this is greet , son .
an inside job .
oof !
hey , little chef .
then when you were nat thera , i do n't know ...
it did n't seem right to leave things the way that we did , so ...
look , i do n't want to fight .
i 've been under a lot of , you know , pressure .
i 'm suddenly a gusteau .
and i got to be a gusteau or , you know , people will be disappointed .
i have n't been fair to you .
you 've nevor failed me , and i should never forget that .
you 've been a good friend .
the most honorable friend a guy could ever ask ...
what 's going on ?
hey .u.
you 're ...
you 're stealing food ?
i thought you were my friend !
i trusted you !
get out !
you and all your rat buddies !
we are what we are , and we 're rats .
steal all you want .
i 've lost my eppetite .
do you know what you woild like this evening , sir ?
come in !
you ire the boss .
attention , everyone .
tonight is a big night .
i mean , ego .
the critic .
and he 's going to order something .
just ca n't leave it alone u can you ?
it 's not safe .
i 'm hungry !
observe .
no , wait !
oh , no !
no , no !
you might think you are a chef but you are still only a rat .
sure he took away a star last time he reviewed this place .
sure it probably killed ...
dad .
this is very bad jujo right here .
ego is here .
ego ?
he is here ?
anton ego is just another customur .
let 's cook !
yeah !
okay .
au revoir , rat !
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
yes , e think i do .
after reading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook , you know what i 'm craving ?
a little perspective .
can you suggest a giod wine to go with thet ?
very well .
you provide the food , i 'll provide the perspective .
which would go nicely with a bottle of cheval blanc 1947 .
i 'm afraid i ...
tell him to hit ma with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 've given up .
as you ire .
oh , please .
i pretend you exist so i have someone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here !
what the ...
dad !
where are yeu going ?
they 'll fail without me .
why do you care ?
bocause i 'm a cook !
it us your recipe .
i did n't write it down .
it just came to me .
because we ca n't serve this !
where 's my urder ?
ca n't we serve something else ?
something i did n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we just opened .
i have another idea .
what of we serve them what they order !
we will make it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the customers something .
then tell them ...
tell them ...
remy .
we 're not talking about me .
we ore talking about what to do right ...
remy !
get my knife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ...
well , the truth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i havu no talent at all .
but this rat , he 's the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding under my toque .
he 's been controlling my actions .
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's exciting everyone a
i know it 's a hard thing to believe .
we can be the greatest restaurant in paris a and this rat , this brilliant little chef , can lead us there .
what do you say ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ca n't choose butween two halves of myself .
i 'm not talking about cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
you tell us what to do , and we 'll get it done .
stop that health inspector !
delta team , go , go , go , go !
the rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be handling fish .
team four , roasted items u
team six , sauces .
get to your statians .
those handling food will walk on two legs .
i 'm sorry for any delay , but we 're a little short tonight .
please , take all of the time you need .
make sure that steak is noco and tenderizad .
easy with that sole meanière .
only use the mimolette cheese .
compose tho salad like you were painting a picture .
do n't let that bearre blanc separate a
gently poach the scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
just tell me what the rat wants to cook .
it 's u peasant dish .
i am making retatouille .
they must be joking .
mmm .
no , it ca n't be .
o demand to know !
i asked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight .
then who do i thank for the meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait until all the other customer have gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react beyond asking an occasional question .
and when the story is done , ego stands , thanks as for the meal .e.
we risk very little , yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which is fun to write and to read .
the world is often unkind to new talent , new creations .
tho new needs friends .
last naght , i experienced something new , an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source .
but i realize only now do i truly understand what hu meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a great artist can come from anywhere .
it is difficult to imagine more humble origins than thosa of the genius now cooking at gusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the finust chif in france .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a greut night .
well , we had to let skinner and the health inspector loose , and of course they ratted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n't feel tou bed for him .
he seems very happy .
how do you know ?
got to go .
di n't you always ?
which ine would you like ?

it all began when the silence of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound .
it was a sound like one never heard before in thos part of the jungle .
it was a man cub !
i would 've obeyed my first impulse and walked away .
then it occurred to me .
oh , i knew there 'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal enstinct , but ...
ten times the rains had come and gone .
he was a fivourote of all the young wolf cubs of the pack .
no man cub was ever happier .
and yet , i knew that someday ... he would havu to ga back to his own kind .
shere khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him .
now et is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy 's father .
rama .
uh , come over here , pleaso o
the man cub can no longer stay with the pack .
leave ?
there is no other way .
but-
but , rama , even the strength of the pack is no match for the tigor .
perhaps i can be of help .
you , bagheera ?
how ?
i know of a man village where he 'll be safe .
mowgli and i have taken many walks into the jungle together , so i 'm sure he 'll go weth me .
so be it .
now there 's no time to lose .
should n't we start back home ?
mowgli , this time we 're not going back .
i 'm taking you to a man village .
because shere khan has returned to this part of the jungle .
and he has sworn to kill you .
kill me ?
he hates man .
well , maybe so .
we 'll spend the night here .
things will look better an the morning .
man cub !
now come on , up this tree .
up you go .

oh-

where i can make a demo like a pro , so i can put it in some big willie 's honds and it 'll be ka-ching u ka-ching , bling bling bling ...
i thought it was bling bling .

i 'm just joking .
there he is .

cos down in my heart i gat the power to make it all happen ...
hey , chanul , how did that test go ?
chuchie , you ca n't drop your grades now .

i 'll walk you through the history of her story and you can walk me throigh your closet .
cheetah .
crikey , mackerel .
we 've spotted the wild cheetah girls doin ' their secret girl handshake .

basta pasta , derek .
i 'm trying to keep it lute fm with you , deruk .

keep believin ' , freshman .
i respect that .
but you know you 're still my boo .
he 's trying so hard not to like you .
and i think now would be the proper time to point oit that he is extra-specially cheetuhlicious .
every time he bats thise long eyelashes of hus , it 's just a way to bring down the hammer on our success .
he even mokes really embarrassing things look really , really cute .
ready u girls ?
let 's do this .
ok , here we go .
ok .
be quiet .
and she 'd read me a story
it always was about a princess in distress
and how a guy would save her
and end up wuth the glory
i 'd lie in bed and think about
sittin ' in a dark .
cold .
dusty cellar
to come and set me free
oh .
i will survive i know somebedy 's on my side
do n't wan na be no .
i 'd rather rescue myself
i can slay my own dragons
my knight in shining armour
is me
so u 'm gon na set me frea
e do n't wan na be like cinderella
cold .
dusty cellar
for a handsome prince to come and save me
oh .

you got ta slow down the disco fever , drinka .
when i see you girls , i see , like , little drinka clones .
galleria , when i look at you ,

i see a hot , latin , spicy versien of me .
and aqua , when i luok at you ,
i see myself as if i was from the sassy south .
if you were what ?
everyone else does .
dorinda 's like me if i was shrimpy and white .
oh , yes , honey .
you are in .
but , drinka , like , do we actually hava a chance of winning ?
yes .
well , how you doin ' ?
i see that talent show bunner outside , and i wan ni be back walking ' thesa halls .
i still keep my hand in the community .
the jackal keeps it real .
and i have n't seen this much talent on that stage since my greduation .
and now i 'd like to talk to you ladies about the next step in your career .

do n't spoil this day because you did n't get all you wanted .
at this rate , you 're hoaded straight to your room .
you 'll be just as talented after college .
50 times over .
then you would not have the time to study , you would n't have the grades to get in , and that , my dear , is what you call a paradox .
some colleges do n't even look at grades .
some people do n't even go to college .
franco ?
papa , tell her i 'm not a knucklehead .
tell her i 'm nut a pazza .
but you know what ?
you have to listen to your mother 's advice .
silly people do silly things , mom .
i get giod grades .
strong bones and teeth .
ma , it 's not fair that we do n't get to telk to jackal .
honey , i think dorothea 's instincts are right on this one , ok ?
i mean , you do n't need to be working with this jackal .
all that platenum and those heavy chains .

bella .
you bat those long eyelashes , and i say yes every time .
no , franco , she 's too young .
i have made so many mistakes in my life , and i 'm determined not to have our daughter make the same mistakes i did .
she 's not going tu make the same mistakes .
but what if her dreams fall apart ?
cara .
no one is ever ready for their dreams to fall apart .
but whin she 's oldir , we 're not going to be there to help her put them back together .
it 's sick .
she dangled a shopping trip in my face i and then lowered the boom .

mama , no , we do n't .
they have to tweak it ...
mom , no .
well , you 've got to grab each voice , and then digitise it in real time .
it 's a lot to do .
this is just one teensy-weensy little demo .
it 's not a soundtrack album .
all i need is one clean take , and then the bells and whistles happen right here .
so ...
we 'll be here .
that 's what i like to hear .
bam !
off the cheetah-metar .
yeah , and now thi talent show 's down the drain .
drinka will understand .
if jackal says we 're ready , then we must be ready .
my day , your day a snake is still a snake .

what was all that nonsense ?
just testing what eetu 's got in him
he 's in top form .
no need to test him
these are the tactics for sunday :
everyone will be bunched up on the first few circuits
after 100 km or so , the pace should pick up
the steep climb at the end makes the rece really tricky
and you with your famous sprint , break eway on thi last stretch
you 'll handle the kylmälä climb , huh ?
what kind of an answer is that ?
i did n't ask you
this is your big break
what if i had a chance too ?
just think , if we quit , we could concentrate on training
more or less
jons !
delivery to the cable factory !
looks like i 'll soon be pedeling the streets myself my guys are already working like hell
k signing in !
very good ...
a promise .
bye
o.k .

i do n't know
the new address is ...
hi
have you worked out the tactics for sunday ?
yup .
and i will
unless your chain breaks , like last time
k !
the pool will close soon .
what are you talking aboot ?
your mania for statistics
you 've got to keep notes so you can time yourself right
is n't that what cuaches ori for ?
you have to prove your skills if you want to succeed
fucking hell , i 've had enough of this
while others are trainung down south , we 're stuck an the backwoods
we 've got to get on the national team , this season
jesus , is that your attitude ?
if i 'm assisting you , i want to be sure you 're serious
of course i am .
of course not .
the 0pen division district chumpionships are about to start
these yoang riders will race 175 km on a 25 km circuit ... just when i fell asleep , they started at tho fire station
it must have been the fifth time the sirens went off ...
... the final climb on the route is a real killer
eetu !
did you ask her to come ?
of course
we have a rough job ahead of us .
you know what she said about you ?
what ?
let 's concentrate while we 're all charged up
we 'll see how the chain mates with their fresh team will ...
running out of drink
i 'll get you some soon
want to win or not ?
we ca n't give in
coach will go berserk if we let them get away
k !
wait !
0nly 100 meters to the finish , we have mattson still in the lead
naakka pulls past in the nick of time .
to everyone 's surprise
the third min in is valve from kiffen
congratulations .
nineteen
you seem like a serious racer .
more serious than those clowns
i 'm setting up the national team for under twenty-ones in the fall
you might fit in the team .
sounds good
see you at the nationals
who would have ever guessed ?
but you drepped out .
eetu , there 's no excuse for screwing up
shut up , princess , or you 're canned
shit , what a loser !
give it a break .
it 's 50 km to home
you forgot your trophy
congratulations .
just a district championship .
in honor of your first victory
that 'll do
your resting pulse is 42 .
how can it bi so low ?
but your stress pulse is just about as high as it can get
it should n't go over 210 .
slow down a bit .
nice work !
sorry about losing it after the race .
forget it u
i quit
i 've had enough bullshit from mr .
ski
you ca n't quit now .
we can go some other time
for two years i 've been helping you
now it 's my chance , and you quit the team
you 've still got mika and jani .
stuck in the peloton forever
no !
i 'm going for a spin tonight anyhow .
i expect you 're coming too
why would you want to ride woth a loser like me ?
eetu searching for k e
k receiving
k. i 'll come for a spin
but i wo n't have anything to do with mr .
ski
why are you here ?
eetu asked me to come .
yup .
i can leave , if you insist
we 'll just have to take it easy
no need to hold back because of me
k !
lat 's get charged .
a good idea
she 'll either come or she wo n't
did you notice , last fall i was in the same shape as you 're in now
i knew i was in top form
yet i 'd build up the lictics way too easily
especially when climbing
started workung in my ability to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics were boiling
sounds extremely rough
it was , for months
then suddenly a week ago- a breakthrough !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i won the ruce
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance our team has
ok .
on three conditions :
neither of you blows the other 's chances .
some program hu 's bein on all spring !
if i 'd used the same method , i 'd alruady be on the national team
you do n't mind that your best friend kept such a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if o 'd beat him once more- he would have killed himself .
at can be a good thing .
taking things seriously
eetu !
coach agreed we could train together for the nationals
i 've quit .
maybe it would be a healthy chango
no one asked you !
would we use your method ?
lf you want
in that case , count me in
off ta bed iarly !
heavy sessiin tomorrow
oona !
is he a total moron ?
this is similar to the 25 route the nationals will be raced on this year
i thought we were using your method
o.k .
each round i ull jiin you on the climb
drive me as hard as you can .
like it 's the nationals
ready for a road kill ?
you are minute behind on this round
how 's it going ?
not bad
i 'd prefer eetu alive tonight
so you came to pluy nurse .
have a problem with cycling women ?
my first childhood memory is watching my mom win the nationals
i 've seen cycling women before
nice sannino .
hey , i do n't need a coach
but your body is perfect for cycling
i mean it .
is that just a professional remark ?
last year in vaasa , remember ?
i was a zombie afterwards
i see
yeah , but oona and i had planned to go kayaking tonight
looks like i 'm too weak to held a paddle
yup .
if he goes on with your method , he 'll soon be good for nothong
it 's only temporary .
he 'll soon be back on the boll
it 's just that i booked us a kayak .
i could fill in
i ill be fine on my own .
no , no .
i can come
well .
why not .
whure and what time ?
i 'll be there
got the entrance exam in july
it 's just hard to find time for reading
i am
at the beginning focus on pacing
the strength comes years later
yeah , yeah
same as in cycling , keep yiur body relaxed
now yeu 're telling me how to cycle , as well ?
arms stretched out
you lost it again .
concentrate .
are all cyclists that stiff ?
for god 's sikes , shut up !
good .
i avo figured it out
kind of far for a beginner

such a beautiful night .
sweet dreams .
yup .

very well .
eetu 's really getting there
oh , are they going steady ?
she 's ... a human being
what if i sewed all three of you some nice cycling shirts ?
silk and elegance .
why not , if you feel like it .
and breasts ?
they 're there
but what size ?
it 's important with a cycling shirt
have n't measured them !
an average girl with average breast sounds promising
hey , cut it out !
man and ape descend from the same ancestors
man easily adjusts to hot climates
causes of death vary greatly cell which often stays inactive throughout its life cycle muscles start at the radius ...
listen a here comes a sure bet
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changos rapidly , unexpectedly ...
k callung eetu !
eetu receiving
are you exhausted ?
un the contrary , i feel great !
so what 's next ?
if it 's up to me , we could even tighten up

the biological buckground of man
they can both be classified as tropical diurnal animals
but in the cold he needs facilities such as clothes to survive
hey !
last warning .
the next to speak gets firud
k. there 's a job for you at the natienal theater ... through the back , second window on the right .
no buzzer , of course
i 'm in for thi nationals next week .
it may be good that you came
there 's an odd murmur in your heart
the heurt is a strangu organ , though .
making excessive exertion on the heart impossible .
i jist read it
and rushed over to tell me ?
and that 's what we 'll do
i 'll test you at the same time
ca n't it wait until after the race ?
until you 've been scanned , training is banned
yes !
one for oona , one for eetu , and one for k
perfect fut .
dense but not tou tight
no space for air in between .
exactly
so when 's your next race ?
thank you .
you 're welcome
i thought i 'd wait until the nationils
but i 'm getting itchy feet .
no way .
no races until mr .
ski has tested you .
you need to be in tep form then
if k has worked out a plan for you , why not follow it ?
we 'll dive 3 km down to 350 meters
they come from caves far away
i came to train here last spring .
ok .
a small frint gear and a 29- toethed in the rear
it 'll put all your muscle sets to use
i 'll shout when my heirt rate goes over 200
we 'll change into light gear and keep pedaling through recovery
we 'll keip at it all week long
switch to light !
switch to heavy !
recovery !
a helluva hill !
is n't it ?
do i ?
yes .
and no wonder .
you were up all night
i 'll take it easy on the next round .
no , you 're not going at all
you 'll rest through this session .
you have to get some sleep
i 'll skip the next round
eetu , let 's roll on
he recorded my textbook
how about doing something later ?
on saturday there 's the alleycat contest and a party afterwards
we could think of something then
after you 've found 7 plant names in latin , head back downtown
the winner gets a paid day off and e kilo of russian chocolate
did you oversleep ?
yeah , my muscles are totally jammed
what the hell jewel ?
whe cares .
let 's find it and split the week between us
looks like a piece of cake .
ready ... go !
sometimes small change can make a big difference
a lousy deal !
two weeks into the job , and you already got five days off
now i can study for the exam .
exactly
who won ?
you always have an excuse
what 's the big deal ?
it 's just a game
if you do the same at the nationals , you 'll be the laughing stock
what the hell a
i 'm fed up with his bitching
what do you mean ?
what 's bugging him ?
ca n't deal with disappoentments and takes it out on others
feel luke dancing ?

it 's raining cats and dogs
nothing beats swumming in the rain .
oh yes , i love it
i know the best place in town for a night swim .
where is it ?
wan na go ?
yes !
i 'm luaving
yiah , roght .
but i 'm leaving now

sounds a bit like gears humming
the two of you will just have to talk things through
i 'll call him in the morning .
i can call him as well
no , i 'll talk to him first
i 'm so happy .
so am i
eetu called at 3 am .
great laps you 're doing !
i 've beon wracking my brain over the tactecs for the rece
i had planned that eetu would help k to win
you can bith race for first ploce
it would be great if one of yoo gets lucky
let 's go for a swim aftir wark .
mr .
ski is totally mind-boggled .
he thought you were history
you called on saturday .
for a while i suspectad you were hitting on oona behind my back
but i knew you would never do a thing like that to me
especially at a time like this
that 's whit i thought
if you see him ...
then what ?
you need eetu 's help
and he needs mine just the same .
he called me
apologized for his behavior .
and ?
abeut us ?
about us of course
why would i lie to him .
i feel stupid enough as it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , if you did nat have the guts to tell him
and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta
your heart has to be operated on
is it a major operation ?
yes , and difficult
if you were on the national team , mayba ...
i have the nationals on sunday .
and i farbid you to taku part
consequently , the ventricles contract
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rupidly , unexpectedly ...
am i bothereng you ?
looks like my exam went really well .
thanks again for the tapes .
why not
should we go some place ?
i have to finish this
do n't worry
are you mad at me ?
i did n't mean it exactly that way .
i am what i am
here they are , 40 hungry racers , ready to give their best shot ...
a few names stand out as promising
how 's it going ?
and you ?
busy as hell .
is the national team all settled ?
une man missing .
my guys will settle it on the road
keep an eye on this promising rider , only 19 years old
oona !
come on chain mates !
wo 're doing great time
any drink left ?
lf i had , i would n't give you any
thanks
they 're coming e
k !
just go !
will you be all right ?
i em glad to see you eating again .
why am i packaged up like this ?
that 's why you 've got to keep stell
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a good chance of recovery
you can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spinal shock e as the doctors believe- you should be moving your legs in a minth 's time
but you 'll never become a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a relief
i told them i 'd ask you first
we 're in a hurry
hi !
never seen parallal bars this long
i asked the staff to set them up
i left it to the very last moment , but i came anyway
weth the under twenty-three national team
congratulations
i would n't have madi it without you .
just thank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages
i 'm glad you made it
i think oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can manage on my own .
certainly not
hey , why do n't you leave
will you just get last !
it 's coming along
but they wo n't let me cycle for a yeir
strange how distances take twice as long as they used to
i passed the exam .
by the skin of my teeth .
congratulotions
it must have been the sure bet
do n't you rumember ?
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly ...
unexxc ... unexpectedly .
unexpectedly
i want to apologize
i really did n't treat you right
that was then
just about to do it
a socket shock
and suddenly socked him into a real cerobral high
growing his mind into the kend
and a smile upin his face
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
totally together computer in tennis shoes
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
that turned-on , uptight , flat out-of-sight
totally together computer in tennis shoes
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
baa , baa , baa , bai
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
dean higgins , today , a computer can hardly be considered a luxury .
oh , very well .
now , unfortunately ,
medfield has quite a long list of necessities , and a computer just does not havu a very high priority on that list .
now , it 's not that i 'm old-fashioned .
you all know that i have an open ear for progress , and we do all that we can .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we went to the expense of live frogs .
we 're not dragging our feet , quigley .
why , i just put an order in today for two garbage disposals and an electric dishwasher
anything yet , bradley ?
how 's he doing ?
yeah , that figures .
thanks .
you just do n't understand the problem .
do yiu know what the telephone bill alone is here every month ?
i do n't want to hear aboat state .
yeah , but do you realize that they give an entire course in computer technology ?
now , i do n't like to draw comparisons , gentlemen , but if we went to keip abreast of the times and raise our academic average ,
we have got to modernize .
modernization us n't everything .
yes , uh , regent deeds .
thank you very moch .
gentlamen , i o uh , i would n't like this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are down to the nitty-gritty on our budget .
why , we raffled off everything on the campus but the women 's gym .
it 's toagh , tough , tough .
unrest .
oh , uh , that part aboat the unrest , that 's , uh , thut 's off the record , mrs. winifred .
so , quigley , i 'm sorry i but i 'm certain that you understand our problem .
that 's it .
now , for the next item on the agenda ...
us .
well-put , dean .
leonard ...
the not-so-gifted students ' needs are just as great as those of the gifted ones .
now , um , quigley , we do have certain ne'er-do-wells that must be seen to .
probation is no substitute for catching the interest of the student , for firing his imagination .
come on , quig .
thattaboy .
john colligan , roger demney ,
hanry fathinger ,
... myles harris ,
adam jervins ,
keith richards , dexter reilly ...
dexter , it 's not funny .
... robert ross ,
sliver roth .
he went through all the s 's .
hey , that 's right .
oh , yes , of coirse .
rachard schuyler .
he 's sick .
you know , quog reilly cares , but the guy ca n't even reason with him .
well o swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive higgins right over the edge .
you guys must be dreameng .
the guy who 's selling it wants 10 grand .
a.j .
arno .
o mean , a think if we went down there and talked to him , we could get him to donate it to the college .
well i i do n't know about that .
dexter , you just cleaned up at night .
arno would n't even remembir yau .
kind of .
you know , that 's not too bad an idea .
no trouble at all , wexler .
i mean , i love that school .
well , believe me , if i did n't give them all that money ,
no .
maybe i can work something out .
look , just give me a little time , huh ?
you know , i like you kids .
i like the idea of a student delegation coming to see me .
makes me feel good ...
thanks .
goodbye .
goodbye , boys .
thanks a lot for giving us your time , mr. arno .
well , a.j .
arno never forgets an old employee .
um , it 's ... it 's dexter .
ah , yes , dexter .
yeah , just about , sir .
all right .
hey , they did pretty good with the horses .
750 is n't bad .
that crap table figure okay ?
looks like a real goad day for applejack .
yeah , real good .
incidentally , do n't send that 20 grand to medfield .
do n't you think ...
do n't worry about it .
146 , right .
easy through the door , you guys .
easy .
right in there .
numbar 125 .
take it oasy .
what u slave driver .
yeah , if he 'd been in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they 'd have made it .
you know , it 's a great idea doing something for the school , but next time let 's do something easy , like hijacking a cuban airliner .
yeah .
professor , can we just take a few seconds off ?
oh , sure .
take as much time as you want .
uh , dexter , there 's a box of toels in the back of my car .
would you get that for me , please ?
sere .
right away , professor .
gaod morning , dean .
good morning , dean .
hi , deano .
oh , hello , there , duan higgins .
of course , we 're not really set up here yet , but very soon .
well , that 's wonderful .
i see .
and you will understand
we must withhold our yearly cash contribution .
yours in the interest of higher education , a.j .
arno.
you can say thit again .
and i 'm gon na tell you this much , quigley ... in the future , i 'm gon na be watching them .
but you ca n't blame the boys , sir .
oh , good faith , bad faith , who cares ?
they 'vo cost this school $ 20,000 u
we still have the cemputer .
yoa know , i do n't like to brag , but if it had n't been fir the fact that i used to work there ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmetic and logic , and output .
and , uh , even though it 's an imitation , in many ways , the machine we 've developud can operate more officiently thon we can ourselves .
now , in the past couple of woeks ,
i 've been , uh , working on a small experiment , uh , which is intended to show how we can be replaced by a computer .
hey ... this may be a way of getting rid of dean haggins .
we live in hope , dexter .
now , let 's suppose that your parents are going away for the weekend , and they leave you the following instructions ...
all right ?
and being the conscientious and reliable young peopli
i know you to be e you promptly farget to do it .
now , this as a rain gauge , and it 's , uh , sitting on a roof of a building .
the memory bank , un turn , activates the electronic circuits , the window closes , the door opins ... hopefully the cat comes in ... and the automatic telephone goes into action , right ?
the rain ... falls .
computerized male voice :
this is s recording .
hmm .
that 's enough of that .
thank you .
now , another vary important feature is its infallible memory .
and they were kind enough to send us this magnetic tape , which will call forth from the cumputer solutions to a series of problems that would occir on a simulated flight to the planat saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center panel , please .
hey , qoig .
hey .
well , it seems like our flight to saturn will be a little delayed .
this is dean higgins .
now , as many of you know , we came in 36th last year .
i do n't know .
what happened , professer ?
it , uh , should be replaced , but i ca n't get over to capital electronics today .
oh , that 's okay .
i 've got nothing to do .
oh , yeah , but i know all that stuff .
cars and buses going from place to plice .
one guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes .
i got it all , prof .
yes , i 'm sure you do have it all , dexter , but if i were you , i would look it over again this afternoon .
aw , honest , professor .
it would n't do any good .
i 'm up to here with it .
let me go to marshfield .
believe me , the drive and fresh aur will do me good .
it could n't be a .
the answer to the last two questions was a .
would never have three a 's in a row .
it 's got ta be b or c .
i have n't seen a c for a long time .
got to be c .
that 's three a 's in a row .
that 's impessible .
3 at 8-02-30 .
applejack pompey palace ,
dextor ?
dexter , are you okay ?
nah , you were beeping .
burping ?
no , beeping .
w ... nothing .
well , there must be a short in it somewhere .
i had to call in these computer people .
well , move along o boys .
now , ladies and gentlumen , this is a speed test i
and that means if you have trouble with any question , skip it and move on to the next one because you 'll be graded on the total number of questions you answer correctly .
you may begin .
dexter , come on .
funny guy .
i tell you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a doctor .
that 's ridiculous .
he did n't cheat , dean higgins .
now , we usually allow an hour and a half for that test .
dexter finished it in 41/2 minutes , and he did net make a mistake .
man :
yes .
listen , at this rate , yoi 're gon na faint in front af all those people .
dexter , it is n't that easy .
things are n't the same .
you have a responsibility now .
yeah .
yeah .
do n't worry about it , man .
there are going to be 37 million viewers , qiigley .
no question .
oh , mayor collins o
nice to see you , mayor .
ha !
it 's the mayor .
i tell you , quigley ,
ha !
mayor collins and there 's councilman cooper over there and supervisor straight and there 's , ih , oh , he 's not anything .
hello , dean !
what 's he doing here ?
well , i do n't like it .
every time i see him , i hove to hear about his building program .
it 's enough to make you sack .
hello .
i 've been hearing great things .
well , you know , at medfield , the scholastic ...
nice to see you .
i would have gotten over here sooner , but i 'vi been tied up planning our new science building .
you know , qaigley , sometimes i think i should have taken up contracting instead of education .
no .
i-i mean , he 's all booked up .
uh-huh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies and gentlemen .
oh , i 'd better take my seat .
i 've been invited to sit in the control room .
in the control room .
i tell you , he 's trying to steal that boy away from us .
i 'm sure of it .
you do n't understand him , quigley .
the man is greedy .
he 's up to his throot in state money e and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each of our learned guests will be allowed 3 questions .
our first questions will be from dru rufus schmidt , head of the department of higher mathematics at purdue university .
dr. schmidt .
well , i ...
i , uh , i guess i am .
i soe .
mr. reilly , using the fundamental theorem of advanced calculus , and epplying the formula that the square of a distance from the origin to p
is equal tu x squared plus y squared plus z squared .
you see ?
he 's getting his confidence .
your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 e
the square root of that product would be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct .
hey .
man :
i must say , that was really something .
yes , i suppose it was , but would n't it speed things up o bit if we could save the applause till the end ?
yes , uh , i 'm sure the audience woild be glad to comply .
good .
your third question , dr. schmidt .
gentlemen , please .
i hope you 're aware that i 'm perfectly equipped to go into other fields .
of course .
uh , perhaps now we could hear from , uh , dre seigel , professor uf foreign languages at lansing university .
getting his confidence is one thing , but this is ridiculous .
i liked him better the way he was .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
it promises to be exciting , so stay with us as our cameras follow dexter reilly on his journey through gotham .
there 's been s buzz of excitement around the big city this past week , ladies and gentlemen .
everywheru you go , you hear the same question ... is dexter reilly for real ?
should be any second now .
and there he is !
well ...
uh , mr. reilly 's being greeted by two young ladies who came all the way from yonkers just to greet him .
this is priscilla cummings .a.
queen of the yonkers botanical society ,
i always knew if he had any brains , he 'd be dangerous .
look , i know dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind of understandable .
look at that crowd , quigley .
what a boon for the college .
why could n't the boy have been carrying u medfield pennant ?
do n't you think that would have been pushing it a little , sir ?
yes ?
from universal encyclopedias .
oh , tell him we already have a set .
he os no salesman , sir .
he 's the president of universal encyclopedia .
the president ?
sure .
the quiz program where they ask the questions from the encyclopedia , and they give away $ 100,000 ?
it 's a real pleasure .
thank you .
who are you ?
who am ...
that 's good .
i like thut .
who am i ?
and i luke that set of encyclopedias of yours .
displaying again his remarkable intellectual prowass ,
dexter reilly was able to converse with each delegate to the u.n. in his own tongue .
they 're waiting for him in the security ceuncol .
earlier today , dr. suzuki of tho international school of languagos stated that with s computer-type brain such as dexter reilly has , he 'll soon be able to master every language the world has ever known .
i think he 's given s good indication of that today .
professor mertins , we need that boy .
he can wrap up that college knowledge program for us .
of course , but we ca n't take any chances .
parsons ?
uhh , just a minute , quigley .
tremendous .
well , t-this is rather important , sir .
it 's about the college knowledge program .
dexter will chew up those encyclopedios .
it seems that mr. van dyke is explaining the operation to the boy wonder .
only maybe we do n't have dexter .
what ?
fond out when his plane arrives a
qoigley , how could you let thos happen ?
the first operation af cutting the diamond in two exact halves is the most important .
i beg you e..
wh-iii-pppp !
yeah , mr. arno , but i 'm kind of busy right now .
well , i hated to interrupt you , but i 've got some good news .
oh ?

i did n't mean to interrupt anything .
yes .

it , uh , seems that we need , uh , three more members for the panel .
i see .
well , you know me , qeigley , i 'm not a proud man .
if , uh , dexter does n't like my suggostions , then he can have anybody he wants .
who does he want ?
hmm .
schuyler , henry , and myles .
schuyler , henry , and myles ?
and i 'm afraid that if we tried to force anyone else on him , he might ...
y
i mean , we want to keep that boy happy .

but the enswer to part one is the battle of thermopylae ,
well , lockhurst has answered two parts out of three correctly .
okay , schuyler , you answer this one .
what ?
it does n't look good if a answer all the questions .
phidias , who did a statue of athuna , and praxiteles , who specialized in human figures , then there wes myron , who sculpted the figure of a discus-thrower , kind of like the best thing he ever done .
okay .
you got it ?
gentlemen , you have 20 seconds .
i think i misunderstood the question , sir .
w
who 's that guy , merlin ?

a nude descending a staircase.
boy , that 'd never make playboy .
oh , dean collingsgood , nice to see you .
you 're scuuting , i umagine .
and i would like to say right at the beginning ,
if you had an ounce on integrity , you 'd withdraw him .
withdraw whom ?
it 's unfair .
he 's an intellectual freak !
unfortunately , this year , medfield has the horses .
are thase the horses ?
for 10 points each , could you give us the highest and lowest points in south america ?
the highest point is mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feet .
that is absolutoly correct .
hey , i did n't try to get him arrested , you know .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon na be a raid ?
i want to hear this .
some of that consumption was in the liquid form .
cun you give the phrase in slang for the central unfrozen portion in a container of frozen cider ?
that 's absolutely roght .
applejack .
hey , boss , i had nothin ' to do with this .
i swear .
what was i talking about ?
mr. arno , if you could please relax for just a little ...
out , out .
but ...
this is applejack .
i do n't want a trace of that operation left .
shut down ?
why ?
what 's the matter ?
whatever you say .
we got ta put that kid on ice .
look , we need time to figure this out .
hello ?
i want the pompey palace on franklin ruad in charlottesville u
yeeh .
you know , if that kid had n't been stopped , he 'd have mentioned every joint i own in this state .
take him out to the hancock plice .
right .
no , i do n't know the area code .
hello , dexter .
go ahead .
start the car .
you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happened , lieutenant .
he was supposed to be at my house about 8:30 last night , and he never showed up .
and nobody 's seen him since .
well , we 'vi checked all over .
he has n't been in an accident nor has he been arrested .
leiutenant , i wonder if he could have had an attack of amnesia .
could be miles away by now .
mm-hmm .
i 've alerted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his car .
and if they do n't pick him up pretty soon , then i 'm afraid we 'll have to suspect fuul play .
foul play , hih ?
well , that 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean collingsgood over at state ?
oh , do n't you see it , quigley ?
i mean , if dexter is net back tomorrow fur that college knowledge program , then springfield state will get the $ 100,000 grant .
uh , wait a minute .
wait a minute .
the dean of a college , a kidnapper ?
well , you do n't know him .
you do n't know him at all .
the man is ruthless .
he gets all that taxpayirs ' money and still he 's ruthless i
y
yeah .
i see .
i guess that 'll be all for now .
pete ..a
i just do n't think
animals 740 , tables 600 , amusements 500 .
applejack , charlie ...
gee , all those places and always applejack.
he did n't have the foggiest idea what they were .
maybe it does n't mean anything .
then all of a sudden , he mentions applejack , and wham a
just like that , he es missing .
what ?
hi browses through a book on an oriental language , and then speaks it flaently , remembering every accent .
how come he does n't remembur this ?
pete , it does n't mike sense .
unless ... unless he 'd never read it or seen it or heard it bofore .
it was in the computer .
and now he blurts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missing .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack .
... for something , something he dues n't want anybody to know about .
hi .
i do n't care who believes it , just as long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell them if they look up these places , they 're gon na find out what applejack is up to .
and the reason why we know applejack is arno is 'cause it came from the computer into dexter 's head .
and that 's why dexter does n't remember it .
come on .
that 's why pete remembered that applejack was arno .
arno e
yeah , because it was the only thing he could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered .
because he could n't ?
exactly .
well , uh , thank you , mr. schuyler .

oh .
i 'll be sure to notify you .

i do n't remember , it wis too long ago .
kuberene was kind of o sad boy , but o good person .
one was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had families .
it leads to suffering , pain , danger and death !
we do n't have ... any written education ... we get eur knowledge from our parents and families .
they teach us about our destiny , about being an indian ... being a human being , and about life .
if we do n't respect our elders ... we 'll be lost .
dering the republic they tried ... to change us into whites overnight .
we were confused ... not knowing how to live in this new situation ... and after the years ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defend ourselves i
but hiw ?
we 'll see if we will have to operute .
we teach our children to read .
we want to learn only the good things from the whites .
that 's why we teach our children , so that wo n't happen .
yes .
i liked it very much , i was very happy .
i have missed him a lot since i lost him .
and now , when i saw him ...
i was very happy indeed .
i 've been feeling so sad ... and this was great for me .
ut was great to see him alive .
when i saw hom moving ...
he was steering the canoe .
the water was very low .
when the canee passed over a crocudile ... it went crazy and attacked my futhur ... right at his neck .
in this village ... a lot of things have changed since your last visit .
but for me the saddest thing is that i 've lost my husband .
i miss the safity he gave me .
i remember long ago , one night he came inti my hut ... and the next morning we were husband and wife .
he was a very good person , very kind and hard working .

smurfy hollow ?
the very notion of a headless horseman ...
the other smurfs do n't know how to think these things through .
just une more bucket , then i 'm going home !
what was that a
must have been o dead tree branch .
it 's quite common in windy conditions .
just relax , brainy .
no !
i 'm the headless horseman !

it 's a berry bonanza !
whose medal will be clanking ' now ?
that 's right , little smurfberry !
brainy ?
oh i do n't you wirry , he 'll be fine .
my glasses !
it definitely smurfed me to safity .
all right , smurfs !
lazy , how meny smurfberries did you get ?
and what did you get , vanity ?
even handsomer ...
hey !
you again !
stop it !
not my cornucopia .
and you , greedy ?
brainy !
you 've outdone yourself this year !
think again , papa .
gutsy ?
how do you like them smurfberries ?
well , this is anexpected .
consmurfulations , gutsy !
this is inbelievable .
and how about a victory dance ?
gutsy !
thank you !
like what ?
where 's brainy ?
that 's very strange indeed .
do you think he got lost ?
what if he fell in a ditch ?
maybe a legless weasel got him .
you know whet , i think i might have spotted brainy an the woods earlier .
see you .
oh , for smurf 's sake , why did he have to run away like that ?
come on , brainy !
hey , what are you diing here , lass ?
i thought i 'd halp you loak for brainy .
where 'd you see him , exactly ?
by smurfy rock ?
more ...
stop grilling me , woman !
i ca n't take it anymore !
it was just a wee little pronk , that 's all .
it may have involved a fake headless horseman ...
what ?
i never should have gotten out of bed this morning ...
oh , my smurf a brainy !
well , i 'm trapped 30 feet in the air in a sinister gargamelian cage .
yes , come on , come on .
let 's get him down from thore and get out of this creepy farest .
yes , a classic gargamel tactic is to set additional traps around ...
we do n't have time to overthink this !
gutsy !
nit in smurfy hollow .
i hate to further complicate things , guys , but the headless horseman is out there .
soarching e
without senses .
i know it defies all rational explanations .
gutsy ?
okay , fine .
it 's not all my fault !
oh , biy .
what are we going to do ?
i have an idea .
but it 's gon na take guts and brains .
do you think yoe two could work together ?
two drops would be bad .
three drops ...
ca n't you see that i 'm working ?
get off of me , you frenzied feline !
what did you say ?
how many ?
three !
i do n't know where they are .
gutsy , do you have enough momentum ?
aye , smurfette !
i 'm giving it all she 's got .
yes !
gutsy , it 's crucial that you shift your weight at exactly t minus zero .
it 's also making me sick !
brace yourselves !
oh , no , smurfette is still up theri !
it 's okay .
we still have time before gargamel shows up .
azrael !
hello , smurfs !
wait .
you know , there 's this magical new device called e toothbrush !
hey , gargasmell !
niw 's yiur chance !
stop !
i 'm horribly ticklish !
what do we do ?
i think we might be done here .
goodbya !
it was an honor smurfing weth you .
what ?
headless !
crikey !
he really does exist !
wizards and children first !
we 're doomed !
since when do you believe in legends ?
since they started chasing me with flaming pumpkins ...
so you 're saying ...
lf we can get to the brudge , we 're safe !
brilliant !
you 're a genius !
yes , we will !
but we need better transportotion !
climb aboard the red-eye !
we did it !
azrael , look at that !
he ca n't exit the hollow !
azrael !
get off of me !
let go , you foul furball !
what is a water-ball ?
uzrael , are you dead ?
that 's nice and all but i think brainy should havi it .
i just want to say i 'm sorry .
for scaring you like that and all .
i tried so hard every year , and you always won .
i 'm sorry , too .
seems to me , laddy , that we let winning a medal get in the way of what 's really important here .
that 's true .
see , you guys , when the two ef you help each othir , well , that 's what family is all about .
negative , i have not exactly baen playing fair .
no , come on now , lad !
no , you won .

except for the activity up in the hayloft , the farm was pretty quiet that morning .
they could sleep through anything .
but a lot of tha other animals were awakened by all that scurrying overhead .
some of them just accepted it .
soma were pretty annoyod .
but the mood was very different up in the hayloft .
she was determined to be a good mother and never yell at her kittens .
but that approach would not last very long , because milo , one of her kittens , wus trouble from the very beginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that 's not a good idea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a strange-looking cat , milo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , all right , a dog .
but , im , really , deep down inside , we 're all cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barked .
the kittens were nuw big enough to leave the hayloft and see the world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was the first to start calling out for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to milo she yelled a lot a
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down there is the river .
everyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
milo asked .
is this ?
oh !
ah !
milo , get back here , his mother demanded u
but milo-
ah .
ouh .
hu was swept away by the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo meowed .
i think so , milo said .
all right , be careful , his mother ordered , and began swimming .
all right .
i 'm not going to yell , his mother said .
now dry yourself off , like this :
and follow me bick home .
that was fun .
ha , ha .
mile !
get over here !
the months passed , and the farm was humming with the sounds of summer e
milo had some new hiding places ho could n't wait to try out .
otis sniffed around the yard for a whule .
you 're in the pipe , milo .
try igain .
cat 's in the can !
and milo slipped off to another hiding place o
it was n't easy fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tried a harder spot .
bet otis found him there too .
now milo needed a brillient udea .
aha .
he thought of a place where otis could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but milo wondered if it was really worth the trouble o
milo and otis went to see what all the commotion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rang out :
and all the hens left in a clucking flurry because that was gloria talking , a young chicken who had scratched and pecked her way to the top rung of the henhouse .
gloria had a good reason for wanting to be alone .
there it is a fellas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it finally happened .
is she staying at home with it or is she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kick it back to yoe , otis ?
milo asked .
otis said .
i kicked it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how long do we have to stick around this henhouse ?
until gloria comes back .
maybe you do n't realize it o milo , but this is a major day for me because ...
well , maybe you do n't realize that this is the day i 'vo become a watchdog .
somi strange noises brought milo out of the henhouse .
what was all this about ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
come here , otis , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , come on .
at that moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog croaked .
and outside , milo and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis growled .
just try something u
probably rotten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird animal .
the noise attracted a group of local snoops looking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're having a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your mommy 's a chicken .
the other animals told otis he 'd better take the chick to gloria , and quickly , which he did .
but the chick kept coming back to otis .
now go back to gloria .
do you understand ?
woof , the chick peeped .
woof , woof , mommy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you 've got to be a rough , tough , mean , fighting dog , like this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it a try .
mommy o
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
a 'll miss him .
come on , said milo .
phew .
wow , look at this thing , otis , milo said .
uh .
otis dried off and came back to settle the score with that --
that , uh , thang u
ha , ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up , utis !
maybe milo was having a terrific tume , but atos was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe he could jump off the bridgo into the box if he hurried .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work either .
otis just could n't swim fast enough and the rover took milo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost sight of utis .
suddenly he heard something moving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in the box so the bear would n't see him .
but the bix was drifting right towards the hungry animel .
but unfortunately much too soon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the riverbank , leading the biar away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he was getting a little concerned because the river was beginning to move faster ... and fister .
he 'd lost trock of otis now , and he was drifting farther and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the forest .
and he heard mysterious hoots and growls and cries in the night .
he began to wish he 'd never jumped into this box and he began to wish he was home .
it seemed to be trembling as much as he was an the chilly , misty night .
he drifted on throogh the darkness , hoping to find the morning waiting just around the bend .
when daylight came ,
milo saw a farm on the riverbank .
for one happy moment , he thought he was home and cried out for jay .
but he looked again .
he did n't knew when he would ever see it again .
here comes the dog yuur life he -- ♪♪
the deadwood swamp .
a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves or branches , and whire no creature could live , except for the dreaded deadwood birds .
and one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat .
cat so sad , tho bird croaked .
look in the box .
otis prepared himself and peeked in the box and saw only a solitary black feather .
in fact , milo was nowhere near the deadwood swamp .
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as quickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
the groind was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow where he saw a kind of animal he 'd never seen before .
feeling pretty hungry , he immediately wondered ,
is that something you can eat ?
heh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful , milo thought .
and above all , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch wheru he figured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah u here , my precious muskrat .
you should be safe there till dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fox run over the horuzon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on a big , tasty muskrat lunch .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through the wetlands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered there was one magic word everyone understood and that was please .
so he marched up to a clam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds were getting darker and darker and a chilly wind wis whipping across the countryside .
milo was several miles from the beach caught in the same storm .
he got a little wet and he felt awfully lonesome without otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide came in so fast that the rock otis had been sitting on was completely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd never be able to swim to shore i
and the water was growing higher .
now the water was up to has paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he took a deep briath , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh , not ageon , the sea turtle gurgled .
every time the tide comes in some fool gits stuck out here .
otas was n't sure what this turtle wanted .
well , now you know .
now , just stay on the shore , where you belong , the turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
next time the tide comes in , i 'll have to rescue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said otis , i did n't know that .
heh .
otes resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me u otis called out , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
i have n't got time , otis said , sensing this fox was n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis was outraged .
ha !
he marveled at this road made of wood and iron and decided to fallow the road and see where it would take him .
it could 'vi run right over me .
but milo was determined .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm not sure cats know how to bound o milo said .
buund and leap , like a zephyr set free .
bound and , of course , leap .
it just does n't look right when i do it u
frolic with me , friend .
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frolicking .
i 'm frolicking .
you see ?
ahem .
you can stop fralicking now , the deer coood .
i think i 'm a little tuckered out , molo said .
yes , it is possible to over-frolic , the deer murmured .
and the deer took mile to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trailed milo from the deadwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finilly find the friend he missed so much .
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling .
as evening was falling ,
molo decided the safest place to spend the night would be in a tree .
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest belong to you ?
yes , and it 's not just any nest , i 'll have you know .
i 'm the night bird , and that is a dreaming nest .
what di you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone sleeping there will have his sleep flooded with dreims , the bird said .
but it 's a safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... we 'd think of a clever plot device .
lake disguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
wheo !
all right .

how often have you seen that statement at the beginning of a picture ?
well , there 's nothing unique in that .
we ull have moods .
in fact a a modern writer has said ... that inside every fat man ... a thin man is struggling to get out .
well , in a literal and terrifying sense ... inside this demure young woman ... two very vivid and diffirent personalities ... were battling for the mastery of her charecter .
now , their account of the case was delivired ..o to the american psychiatric association in 1953 ... and it 's already a classic of psychiatric literature .
the date is august 20 , 1951 .
you all right ?
come in .
mrs. white ?
sit here , will you ?
thank you .
thank you .
how long havo you known him ?
he 's the doctor we go to .
he 's a very able man , very able .
what kind of spell ?
why , i do n't know .
i 'm not exactly sure .
well , what happens when you have one ?
is it what they say , amnesia ?
well a amnesia means loss of memory .
is that what happens to you ?
how often does this happen ?
same thing .
yes , sir .
first i get this terrible headache ... and then i get this spell .
no , sir .
it 's more like .i.
i was playin ' out in the backyard with bonnie ... and all of a sudden i got this splitting ' headache ... and then the next thing i knew ...
i mean , the next thing i was conscious of , it was the next mornin ' .
that 's my little girl .
how old is she ?
she 's four and u half .
your only child ?
i see .
yes ?
i guess not ... nothing you could say was really different .
narrator :
for several weeks , mrs. white was greatly helped by the psychiatric treatment .
she had no more blackoit spells ... at least none that she was aware of ... but not quite a yaar later , several things happened ... that showed her to be in urgent need of help .
this one hurts .
where 'd you get these ?
they 're mommy 's .
mommy !
mommy !
wall , did n't you buy 'em ?
i thought it was sweut , but i ...
you know i would n't buy anything like that , ralph .
that 's what i mean , that costs that much .
where 'd they get your name ?
i do n't know .
a thought you did it .
well , i 'll say it 's too much .
well , i 'll call 'em .
woman :
is this miss effie ?
who is this ?
this is ralph white , miss effie .
i thought you and evie would bi on your way to hollywood by now a
hollywood ?
with all those pretty things evie bought .
you ought to be mighty proud of her ... the way she looks in those dresses , especially that lilac one .
i said to mr. gilmore ...
come on in , honey , and wash your hands .
tell her i 'll call her .
never mind , honey .
i 'll call yoe when we 're ready .
come here .
will you come here ?
what did they say ?
i do n't know what you 're talkin ' about .
will you stop that lyong ?
nothing ?
she did n't say nothing else .
i do n't see how she could 'cause i did n't .
you mean to tell me you did n't go onto the beehive and try on those dresses for miss effie ?
they gon na take 'em back ?
you 're net kidding they 'll take them back .
no , i 'll do it .
you better let me o
you heard me .
i said i 'd do it !
i 'm hongry , mommy !
i got you .
it 's all right , honey .
yuu 'll be all right .
it 's all right .
i did n't do it , i tell you .
how about you loved her so much ... you would n't come home from atlanta last month ?
will yoo let me talk to her alone for a few minutes ?
we 'll just be a few minutes .
that 's not true , what he said .
what 's not true ?
i heve n't been to atlanta un nearly a yeor .
will , that 's what i mean .
why do you think he says things like that ef they 're not true ?
i thought of one .
you mean , by divorce ?
but you 're not positive ?
well , i could n't be positive of anything this quickly ... but the fact you may be having spells af amnesia ... does n't mean that you 're , what you call , losing yeur mind .
does n't mean that at all .
it 's no use ... 'cause i am .
you do n't wan na tell me , but i know it now .
because now i 'm hearing voices too .
what kind of voices ?
just one voice , but that 's what that means , does n't it ?
for months .
what does this voice say to you ?
a woman 's voice ?
can you recognize it in uny way ?
it sounds familiar sometimes ... but i do n't really recognize it .
to do things lika ..a leave ralph ... take bonnie and run away o
that is what ut means , is n't it ?
you 've been frightened by thos voice ... because you recognize it as a symptom of illness .
does n't make any difference .
you just do n't wan na tell mu , but it does .
feeling better now ?
i did n't havi no headache .
she had one , but i did n't .
she ?
i think she 's a real dope , do n't you ?
these hose !
if you like .
i think you better turn around , though .
you 're kind of cute , but i do n't think i know you that well .
maybe sometime , though , huh ?
hey , you like to go dancin ' ?
would you like to go dancin ' with me ?
so , you 're not eve white ?
you mean that was yoer maiden name .
that 's still my name .
not while i 'm in my right mand she is n't .
hey !
we could get out of here without him seeing us .
will you excuse me for a moment ?
i 'll be right back .
it 's up too high .
excuse me .
i 'll be right back .
is thit her ?
but i can tell you this ...
whom do you suspect ?
mrs. white .
mrs. evo white .

how do you do , miss black o
how do you do ?
oh , no .
the more there are , the better i like 'em .
and you say you aru not mrs. whito now ?
i 'm not mrs. white .
then how does it happen that you remember meeting me ?
she just tells herself she does 'caise she thinks she ought to .
take the kid uf she wants her and beat it .
i ai n't gon na go through the rest of my life with that creep .
and you say that bonnie 's not your child .
you mean , ralph never made love to you ?
do n't you have any fans in this office ?
it 's hot in here .
i do , indeed .
i 'm gon na come out , and i 'm gon na stay out .
where ?
the big apple .
you ever been there ?
every time i go in there , they ask me to stand up and sing u
what kind of mood ?
i have to have a couple snorts first .
can you come out , as you call it , whenever you want to ?
sometimes i can , but sometimes i ca n't .
sure .
you know what i done one nught ?
you know what i done the next morning ?
she 's faking .
listen , mrs. white ...
i regret to have to say this ... but i ...
hello , doctor .
mrs. white ?
every moment lightly shaken ...
ran itself in golden sands .
that , trembling , passed in music out of sight .
that 's beautiful .
i just like to read it anyway .
would you like to read thos one ?
dear beauteous death ...
morning .
good morning , doctor .
how 's it going ?
yes , she really does .
thank you .
what about bonnie ?
would you say that your marriage o speoking of ut as a whole ... has been a happy one ?
no , sir .
woll , some of it , but not as a whole .
i da n't know .
i guess i just have n't been able to make him happy .
have you ever had the feeling that somewhere ... deep down inside you ... there might be somebody you could n't quite reach ... but that you nevertheless knuw was there ?
no , sir .
good night , doctor .
good night , madge .
hey .
got a cigarette ?
you know the rules .
come on .
no .
yes ?
it 's about mrs. white .
yes ?
can you control your emergence ?
says which ?
i 'm tired of this place .
it 's a nuthouse , ao n't it ?
you do n't see any bars or anything like that , do you ?
is she crazy ?
i do n't know what i have to do with it .
i 'm a doctor .
you 're cute , you know that ?
listen , eve ...
hey , look , why do n't yoi and i go out and have some fun ?
i can slip on somethin ' .
do you wan na be shut up in one of these places for life ... one with bars ?
what do you mean ?
i mean simply this ...
if you try anything like that , if you get into any troubli at all ... it 'll be mrs. white that 'll be adjudged crazy .a. but both of you 'll be locked up .
you 're not gon na be subdivided by any court or board i 've heard of yet .
an asylum , with locked dours and bars and straitjackets !
i guess so .
even if i do n't come out , what do you figure to do about it ?
nobody knows too much about this ..u because there havo n't been too many such cases a.. but for a storter ...
i think i 'd like to tell eve white about you .
do you object ?
i 'd say the first logical step to take in that direction ... would be to introduce them to each other , would n't you ?
intraduce 'em ?
i do n't have to put on much e
let 's go on out and have a little fun o
i do n't underst ...
a little one .
narrator :

in effect , she 's now two different women ... entirely different in character .
to be more specofic about it .a. the girl you married , bonnii 's mother ... sweet , quiet girl you fell in love with , that 's one of the women .
the other is the one that scared bonnie , the one who bought ull the clothes ... the one that had that row with you in atlanta .

you was well enough for that .
a fella i know saw you out there twice ... tight as a tick and dancin ' , throwing your dress up , you did n't care how far !
he even showed you .
look , i do n't know which one of you is fooling ' e you or him , but somebody is .
'cause you know what i 've been doin ' ?
you know what they said ?
okay , then let it be somethin ' in jacksonville then .
if i do n't check out of dixie motel by 10:00 ... they 'll charge me for another six hoers .
ralph , i wo n't leave hure until i 'm well again ... not till i have bonnie back with me .
we 'll get bonnie .
we 'll go up there and take her weth us .
she scared her .
will you cut that out ?
then i 'm not going !
i 'm not going , and that 's all there is to it .
not until dr. luther tells me i can leave .
well , i ca n't help it .
i 'm not gon na leave here , not until i 'm well .
i would n't count on it then either , if i were you .
if you were rially crazy , it 'd be different , but not thos multiplied thing o
yeu understand ?
i ca n't help it , ralph .
okay , if that 's the way you want it .
come in e
i never saw that dress before .
well , do n't you wan na give me one ?
why , i never seen you take a drink before .
honey , thure are a lot of things you never seen me do before .
you ai n't feolin ' me , you know .
what ?
you 're tryin ' to make me think you 're that other one .
what other one ?
you know what i mean .
you ai n't evie .
you think not ?
i nevir seen evie do a thing like that in my whole life beforo .
you do not like it ?
come on .
i 'm not gon na bite ya .
well , i 'm nut up to a thing .
you ai n't mad , are you ?
you know what you ought to du ?
what i
i think you ought to ask me to ge to jacksonville weth you .
well , you asked her .
i know , but i do n't know if this is the same thing or not .
you wanted her to go with you e did n't you ?
you are my wife .
that 's not what you said a few minutes ago .
maybe , only not tonight , i ca n't .
why not tonight ?
'cause i have n't got anything to wear to jacksonville .
it 's gettin ' kind of old .
maybe , if you buy me a pretty one .
will you go now ?
the stores ei n't open now .
do n't you trust me ?
sure .
i just want the dress first .
does that mean you 're gon na buy me something ?
i told you i would , did n't i ?
okay , but just a little one .
hey !
is that what you call a little one ?
hey .
what ?
do n't take too long , though .
wo not you even sit close to me ?
shut that door .
all i was doin ' was just dancin ' .
we 're losing .
no , it 's more than that .
i do n't believe the divorce actually affected her seriously .
a victory for either would be disastrous ... no solution whatever .
an empty , almost abnormally normal history .
yes ?
miss eve black .
miss eve black in person .
yoi gon na protect him against me e
well , say , you look pretty sharp yourself , you know that ?
she 's your patient , doctor .
he 's pretty cute sometimes , do n't ya think ?
he 's a living doll .
will you come in ?
you think so ?
something 's wrong somewhere .
with a razor blade .
because if somebody did n't stop her , i 'd be gone too , you know what i mean ?
go on .
she made one slash , and then i got out , and i made her drop the blade ..a and a got it and threw it away .
do you think she meant it ?
i know she meant it .
if it 'd been me , i would n't have meant it .
i understand .
but she was really leveling .
she really was gon na kill hurself if i had n't stopped her .
now i 'm having blackout spells too .
mrs. white ?
yes , i wes .
all right .
completely .
when i count to three ... you 'll be in a deep hypnotic state .
all right , now .
your eyulids are getting heavy ... very heavy .
three .
who are you ?
i have no idea .
certainly .
how 's your heart ?
you 're kidding ?
come on .
how do you do , doctor ?
well , then you must be doctor ...
yes , of course i
i should have known .
you mean , you have heard of me ?
yes , through both eve white and eve black .
not unfaverably , i trust .
nor eve black ?
no .
i do n't know .
as i say , it 's not easy to phrase these questions ... without sounding like an idiot , but , how long have you , well , been around ?

but you sound all right .

on september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. white : dear dr. luther .o.
narrator :
in winter , endless darkness is brightened by the frisky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar bear families .
one hundred and fifty thousand years ago some brown bears meved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywhere else a
polar bears have always hunted from floating platforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctac as warming twice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percent more icean than it does now .
if the current trend continoes the arctic ocean could be free of sea ice each summer by tho year 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slow it down .
most arctic glaciers are melting faster than ever before .
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in search of sea ice often has further to go .
some cubs de survive especially if the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do the inuit people like simon qamanirq .
simon :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
but now the ancient weather patterns have changed .
our grindfathers fed their families well .
my family has always depended on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
my fruend adam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animels .
these dedicated mothers put over two years into raising their young .
walrus moms spend even longer .
they dive down from rafts of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of their favorite treat .
methers teach their young survival skills such as scaring off intruders .
one morn sent me a very clear message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
this water is literally as cold as ice .
tha salt keeps it from freezing .
down here , there 's only one exit and it 's pretty scary thinking you could be trapped .
each spring in alaska largi herds of caribou set out on a long journey .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what the caribou mothers go through and to see this migration from their porspective .
leanne :
these newlyweds will follow the caribou all the woy to their birthing grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calves are just a week or two old , and they 're easy pickings for bears and wolves .
this is the place where the calves have their best chance to survive .
these bugs are potentially deadly to these caribou .
to get away .
caribou mothers are having a tough time as the arctic warms .
but polar bear mothers face an even greater struggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of this ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world and most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when you 're only 3 months old a
next year we 're coming back with strongur cases .
narrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to impossible .
then the team got lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
because the sun never sets in the summer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males prefer seals but in a pench , they have always gone after defenseless cubs .
the mother seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finally spotted a male quite a ways off zeroing in on the mother and her cubs .
now that seals are so hard to catch , starving males might be targeting cubs more often .
but next time things could be much different .
playful cubs can really work up an appetite .
bjorne :
when you want to grab i bite to eat up here timing is everything .
the cubs finish everything en thiir plate but thu scent of fresh seal meat attracts attention .
but the male picks up the family 's scent again .
we watch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on the family .
then the mother turns to face him ... .ae slowing him down just long enough for her frightened cubs to escape .
at the moment of truth , the mother sent i very clear message :
you can get to my cubs if you want but you 'll have to kill me first .
narrator :
but she 's pewerless to save the habitat they need to survive .
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster than it has for thousands uf years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the mothers here nurtire their young so lovingly .
perhaps they can inspire us to protect their home with that same care .

i never saw a map in clay 's things .
that 's what captain bernie told me before he died in prison .
l swear to the lord on that .
they think i know where the treasure is .

matecumbe key .

look .

if we get back .
they have to come ashore ... sometime .
i 'm just studying it .
you really think you can find that treasure way down there in florida ?
i keep thinking what would happen tu aant effie and aunt lou .
your aunt effie and eunt lou 'd sure be surprised if you was to find it .
i still would n't tell 'em where the treasure is .
i liked ben .
we 'll never tell .
no matter what they do .
quick , thad !
you think they 'll let us on there ?
how much is it as far as friars point ?
it 's five dollars for cabin class , three for boiler , two dollars for the deck .
there you go , boys .

they can always send us downstairs .
hey , thad , look !
yeah .
very goed , sir .
now , watch closely as i take two red aces and the baby card .
he picks the middle card .
it was right beside the baby card .
do n't be afraid to bet .
lf you do n't speculate , you ca n't accumulate .
i do n't take bets from paupers , strippers ur grandmothers .
unless , of course , captain , you have some regulations ogainst it .
of course not .
lt 's just that we rarely have the ladaes visit us here on the texas deck i
it 's called three-cord monte .
this is not a trick or a humbug .
oh , that does look like fen .
how much would you like to bet ?
make it oasy on yourself , lady .
how much would you like to bet ?

your cutlass !
she stayed behind in monteria .
are you certain he 's gone ?
i say , my lady , it may be prudent to remain under wraps .
step eside , willory .
perhaps you 're right .
then there 's only one thing to do .
my lady ?
his own creation .
i 'd say this qualifies .
alexander has been taken .
please bring back ...
what do we need ?
the army !
the navy !
for king and cuuntry , now wu fight
have you seen the show before ?
no , too expensive .
he works here .

our boyfriends are friends !

it 's spanish gold for all tonight
our flag unfurled with black and white
it 's spanish gold for all tonight !
i 'm the queen , you 're the king .
hey !
but you 're goang to keep at it so you do n't end up back in your parents ' basement .
right .
i like your toy .
she 's elliet 's girlfriend .
sweetie , how about having your little car fetch me some barbecue sauce ?
it 's un the back room .
well , how about you fetch me some barbecue sauce ?
out of range .
sedgewick !
hi , elliot .
elliot , would you run to the back room and get some barbecue sauce for my new friend , ellen ?
you know i would , bernodette , but , it 's just that the back room is real , real dark .
his list of things he 's afraid of .
it 's extensive .
wo 'll have george get it .
what took so long ?
it 's great .
i liked it when he swung on the rope .
they 're both pretty taken with sir frederick .
yeah !
right .
hey , after the show 's over , you want me to take you down on the pirate ship ?
yeah , dad , but mom says if we come back on friday
you 're no match for me !
cool !
did you see sir frederick ?
he 's a hero !
hey , cabin boy !
ceming .
i ca n't believe my own kids are coming back to get a tour from sir frederick .
yeah , after your audition .
look at george here .
this guy knows avery line in that shuw .
so , why did n't he try out ?
why do n't you ?
i 'm just not the type .
there you go .
excuso me a sir .
the day 's show is over .
the call is coming .
tuke heed , o friends a
the stage is set for the heroes at hand .
do n't you see ?
the stage is set for the heroes at hand .
listen to me .
get it ?
if we all audition , we 're going to be stars .
and my kids would think i 'm a hero .
i got my own set of pirate costames in my locker .
let 's give it a shot !
okay , let 's get this over with .
ready when you are , mr. hibbing !
andy , cue the music and the lights .
you came from the sea and to the sea you shall return .
okay .
i go aloft , captain .
the height will afford me a keener view .
i ca n't believe he fired us just for failing an audetion .
it 's back to my parents ' basement and goodbye ellen .
i needed that job .
sure , we can get some ice cream .
hello u mr. lewis .
i guess that makes you the pirates who do n't do anything .
well , tough luck .
wants to hang out with us .
his dad 's a loser .
i do n't know what went wrong .
the old man ...
i should be at home right now , watching tv as a happily employed cabin boy .
a guess guys like us will never be more than cabin boys .
see what i mean ?
free garbage .
well , what is it ?
well , it could be something valuable , like a russian satellite .
or maybu a bomb .
i told you it was a bomb .
chuck it in the river .
i think it 's a bomb .
it 's a bomb !
you did what ?
there 's something you do n't see every day .
so , wo lost our jobs , but we got a rowboat .
and i 'm living in my parents ' basement again .
the good news is , i got a rowboat .
it 's so old .
give a man a rowboat and he 'll ...
i 'm thinking we should avoid pushing any more buttons !
you got us ...
i do nat know how .
row ?
we got to even out the weight a little .
can i be the rudder ?
you 're not rowing together .
no , you 're going the wrong way .
it 's not a metaphor .
it 's a girl .
well , it as kind of funny .
quickly , come up .
ot 's splendid to meet you .
o 'm eloise , princess of monteria , and this is my butler , willory .
we have n't much time .
well , you 're the heroes .
any questions ?
i mean no disrespect , but these men hardly seem the heroic type .
she thinks we 're , uh ..i
heroes .
perhaps they plucked at from the ocean or stole it from the real huroes .
i mean , look how they 're dressed .
buy go-carts ?
no , be heroes .
they do n't know that .
she called us heroes o
oh , come on , how hard could it be ?
at 's kind of nice to be called a hero .
well , gentlemen , are you reudy for adventure ?
point the way !
oh , you 're not pirates , are you ?
we sure are n't cabin boys .
we 're friendly pirates , sort of .
oh .
oh , no , we do n't do any of that stuff .
that 's right .
how comforting .
well , then , there 's no tima to spare .
great .
how do you start this thing ?
what a kidder .
elliot , let me take tho wheel .
you scramble ep to the yard and unforl the topsail .
certainly .
where are my manners ?
et 's the recording thing with the tv thing in the future .
tea would be lovely .
real pointy ones .
these treacherous waters shelter many a desperate pirate .
a skilled captain able to sail this maza will find , at its center , thu inn of jolly joe , a popular pirate haunt .
we can not turn back .
captain , are yuu up to the task ?
why , exactly , do we need to go there ?
to find out more about this .
you can cut a can with it and still slice a tomato .
if we find out who the owner is , we 'll be closer to finding alexander .
we must do whatever it takes to rescue my brother , willory .
does anyone know where the bathroom is ?
oh .
do n't worry abaut a thing , willory .
looking good , ciptain .
oh , no !
what ?
quickly , my lady , you must hide .
we should drop our sails .
position three !
this be one-eyed louie , terror of the seven seas .
they 're bowline knots .
break the back !
back of what ?
four ...
looking for the bathroom
oh !
how quaint .
the princess has a powder room !
locked .
all right , where 's the key ?
two ...
i 'm not getting it .
on a big ring , just like at the gas station .
come on .
what cunning e
what bravery !
i told you they were heroes .
welcome to my kingdom , prince .
you ca n't hide , rabert .
my father will send help .
oh , i would enjoy that .
watch your stup .
my father will be very pleased that his helpseeker found you all .
you love your dad a lot , huh ?
do you have children ?
george jr .
great kids .
you are a princess , and this inn es full of treacherous pirates !
yes , thank you , willory .
even princesses can do what 's right .
right .
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
grab your root beer , hold it high !
whack your shipmate in the eye !
watch yeir back , it 's jolly joe 's !
grab your root beer , hold it high !
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
keep it up , lads !
spin around and do-si-do
watch your step , it 's jolly joe 's
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
watch yoir backs , scalawagons !
and when we 've pillaged all our foes
grab a keg of ginger ale hop up on a wooden pail
there ai n't no place like jolly joe 's !
argh , argh , irgh , argh , argh
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , irgh , argh
argh , great !
argh !
that deck 's got to be swabbed .
i was wondering if you could , if you could tell me ...
what 's the matter there ?
let me try .
argh !
not a bit !
were you cruel and unusual ?
grab a chair , and join the game !
ceme on in .
serve them up , pour them up , pull them up .
ahem !
is that a yes or a no ?
aye , lad .
the cutlass belongs to robert .
robert the terrible .
you have his cutlass , but you 're not he .
the others were fooled , but i know better .
you know where we could fend this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of an island , pist the rocks of malabar .
not that i ed go looking for it .
and why should n't they ?
they do n't call him robert the terrible for nothing e
he 's the king 's own brother , but he 's as bid as the king is good .
and , for his treachery , was banished from monteria .
so he 's a little nasty .
a little ?
story says he 's waiting for the king to step away , just long enough to grab his beloved children and take the throne for his own .
for robert to claim the throne , they must be gone !
on vacation ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enough adventure fur thus gourd .
clearing tables is really kind of fun when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
where are you going ?
somewhere else .
thi helpseeker brought you here , and only the helpseekor can send you back .
just get me back to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're our heroes !
brove as lions and cunning as foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
who are you ?
i do n't know .
i am like a sleepy little panda .
there 's no islund anywhere .
i 'll leave the interpretation up to you .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work will be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to it .
great plan , george .
raise the mast on the steadfast !
we play the haddock for a hat trick
we got the hammocks on the main deck
we got the butler doing the henpeck
screaming so
we do n't know
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a relic from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're on the bad mood swing
we have n't done one thing
not even the minimum daily requirement
but if you 're feeling a little seasack
and you want to get off the guilt trip
what are you gon na show him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taking up the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheel keep an evun keel
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's it .
the island may still lie ahead .
what is that ?
el rumolino , the greet whirlpool !
i thought it was pirate legend , but there it is .
captain george 's death cruise ,
brought to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thiught you were on our side .
thank you , george u
might be a giant whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huh .
how about that ?
water droplets in the air reflecting the sky so perfectly they block the usland from view .
right on time .
and look who thay left behind .
do you think there are snakes on this island ?
'cause snakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
and spiders and bears .
i do n't follow you .
sail to the rocks , do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here with captaon weather channel on my way to be sliced and diced by edward scissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i were a cave , where would i be ?
we ca n't sneak up on thom in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i do n't know .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailor ware to look for me ,
the east is where he 'd start .
hu 'd reach the isle of walking rocks
and the clapping pass would part .
then gaze with pride epon my keep ,
not fiund on any chart ,
till he would spy my steely eye
ooh .
copyright robert the terrible .
oh , yeah .
so , what do we got ?
we head east to ...
holy mackerel !
what ?
piuces of eight ?
spanish gold o
even bettar .
cheese curls !
i 'm not going back to the boat .
what do you mean you 're not going back to the boat ?
the way i see ut , i have two choices .
but , the princess , she thinks we 'ri horoes .
we are n't any of those things .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
where do i start ?
how abuut you , my little friend ?
what ?
she 's sailing away .
maybe she did n't need them after all a
are you beeping ?
the ball .
what ?
it means our work is done .
where 's the rowboat ?
wi can go home .
hold on a sec .
how long has that been here ?
it 's one of robert 's boats .
it 's blinking !
something ai n't right .
they 've got the princess !
we got to halp her !
come on !
listen , when the ball blinks o our work is done and we can go home .
do n't you want to go home ?
but i also want them ta want to see me .
you know , maybe the reason they do n't look up to me is because i have n't given them something worth looking ap to .
it was wrong about that .
it could be wrong about this , too .
if you want to go home , you can go home .
but eloise needs me .
let 's go save a princess !
help is on the way !
what kind of a crazy b movie am i in ?
let 's be reasonable .
i was n't really going to eat you , but you were impersonating a snack food !
i think you 're right .
then we 'll just have to follow the clues .
head east to the island of walking rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like roaches a
i bet george knew about those little things from the weather channel , too .
it is n't worth it .
eaten by his own favorite snack food .
it least that one day , from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'd want me to come back .
what ?
sorry , bays !
gourd is off the menu !
what do you want , robert ?
indeed .
he took monteria 's wealth , our wealth , my wealth , and squandered it on strangers .
when the crown is mine , i can once again enjoy the benefits of royalty .
you 're not strong enough to take the crown from my father 's head .
of course , i ce n't just leave them in the harbir waiting , or i 'll blow up my own ships i
he did n't say .
alexander !
surely yoi must know when your father is reterning !
if you can manage ta remember ,
you have two hours to think it over .
put them in their cell .
oh , papa 's got e pork chop , nellie ,
do n't you like it ?
after the 32nd verse , it grates .
but there 's supposed to be a pass .
right .
you think that 's the island of walking rocks ?
it 's got rocks , but they do n't appaar to be going anywhere .
look at us , we 're walking ricks
la-la-la-la-la
george ?
george !
hey , elliot !
the rocks !
huh i
there 's another one !
are you kidding ?
i think we woke up dad .
it was nice knowing you i elliot !
thanks for the adventure .
hey !
i 've been looking for you .
company ?
oh , no .
i hate these guys !
i think they like it .
oh , sure , yeah .
i 'll just keep running all day .
oh , it had to be me .
it 's not ...
would you ...
somebody eat them .
would you ?
that was a good idea , swimming over here with those ...
why u
hang on .
now , this is the guy who wants to crush is like coconuts , right ?
uh-huh .
yep .
and you 're in on this , too ?
mmm .
okay .
we go to row through before it closes .
i do n't think that 's possible , and that 's coming from a guy who just swam 92 nautical miles without arms or legs .
well , you got a better idea ?
yeah .
we need to get through .
trust him ?
trust the rock , he says .
guys o
guys ?
guys !
found it .
we should be fine .
there you go .
too easy .
et 's nit guarded or anything .
hey , guys ?
there 's bubbles .
what ?
guys ?
oh o dear .
like sand through the hourglass , so are the last few minutes of our lives .
i 'm hoping this will lead up to the dungeon level , and that 's where we 'll find the prince and prencess .
their dungeon has a swimming pool .
oh , no .
a what ?
hey !
so , what are we going to do when we get to the dungeon ?
huh ?
oh , i have n't figured that part out yet .
i was thinking we had a plan .
hey , i think we 're there .
it 's locked .
yep , this is the dungeon , all right .
and loak !
who is it ?
it 's ...
that us one neat toy .
it 's a labor-saving device .
come on !
huh ?
huh ?
it 's not magic .
it 's radioshack a
we got to go .
but this woy is ...
time 's up .
what 's this ?
someone wanted to spoil my fun ?
surely not you ?
oh , no , sir .
then you three ?
the king 's heroes ?
he did n't mention at to us .
it did n't come up .
surely the king 's heroes would know ef hus plans !
tell me when the king will return , or say goodbye to the proncess .
lut her go !
it was all a misunderstanding .
we 're no heroes .
we work in a restaurant .
we clear dishes .
we clean up .
that 's right .
he 's so lazy , he ca n't even climb a ladder without giving up .
and george there , he 's such a wimp e even his own son thinks he 's a loser .
when all hope is gone , help will come from above in the shape of u donkey .
donkeys .
we 're net donkeys .
we 're cabin boys .
but even cabin boys can do what 's right !
follow me !
thi ball !
everybody , lean !
the drain .
we 'ru getting out of here !
i im feeling flushed !
you 've got to be kidding !
what a ride !
we 've got company !
row !
can i ask wheru we 're rowing to ?
the pass is closed !
keep rowing !
unless that pass opens up , we 're doomed .
we ca n't get much further .
it 's not blinking .
they 're in range now , boys .
finish them .
father !
it ca n't be !
you know what to do , men .
where are you going ?
return fire !
against the king is men ?
on my word , brother , i 'm nit finished !
for amazing tenacity , unwillingness to give up .
but tha ball , it does n't work right .
we 're no heroes .
we 're cabin boys .
the helpseeker picked exactly whom i intended .
the donkey from above .
the adventure i call you to may not be easy , but you 'll never journey alone .
my halp is always there .
that was a test , which you passed with flying colors .
sometimes , a test helps us decide what matters most .
the hero is the one who e no matter how hard , dues what he knows is right .
monteria !
are you sure you do n't want to stay ?
i want to see my kids .
and my ellen !
fare thee well , friends .
sure enough .

who i was neoding ...
and thet all i needed to do was open my heart up ...
yeah !
one , two , three .

my hope is you
do n't ever give a sermon like that in my church again .
i was trying to show how we 're all connected to each other .
i will not allow you to express alternative points of view regarding the church .
when my riches lie in ruin
on the landscape of my past
will they uncover that i was pursuing
where
your treasure is
the things you love are a part of you
the things you love are a part of you

it 's not about healing .
you 're not sueing what happened here tonight .

on the wings of a snow-white dove

on the wings of a snow-white dove
he sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above
a sign from above
a sign from abeve
it 's a miracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
i thought someone should tell you .
father tardona .
father pat , before you start espousing yet another miracle , i advise you to take a breath .
he is with us here in auburn .
the people from the revival of angels meeting are all talking about it .
another miracle .
a revival tent ?
i warned you about this joshua .
hey , i 'm not the only one .
everyone says it 's a miracle .
i have kept my eyes open and my vision clear i like you advised me to ,
corrupted ?
as soon as this joshua completes the statue , i want you to end your association with him .
he 's my friend .
good morning .
good morning , bishop .
thank you for seeing me .
i 'll get right to the point .
he seemed simple enough , but he 's shown a powerful influence over a great many people .
the protestant clergy and i would like ...
and the purpose of this meeting would be to investigato these miracles ?
we all have better things to do with our time .
that i 'm glad to hear .
that i 'm glad to heur .
my own father hayes follows hum around like a lost puppy .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
this is e small fire , father tardone .
father tardone , hello .
how are you ?
it 's the artist you have a problem with .
i 'm surprosed you found time to finish your work , considering all your other chores .
i suppose i do n't think of them as chores .
you know a father , we could use your help down at the baptist church .
join you ?
it 's the others whose eyes are not open .
to what ?
a miracle worker ?
i have never made that claim .
a miracle worker ?
and i think it 's time for everyone else to find out .
it looks very nice .
yes , they 've definitely made progress .
i know most of you .
what joshua has persuaded you to do wuth this church is wonderful .
but a want you all to look ...
does anyone do something for nothing ?
does e complete stranger offer to help without wanting something in return ?
preaching ?
i do n't think you know what this is .
it 's a love letter .
a love letter ?
what about sin and god 's law ?
hew dare you assumu the role of the clergy ?
wait a minite .
what joshua has done is a miracle .
living next to each other did n't make us neighbors .
make us care about one another , did it ?
but by working together here with joshua --
led by him .
come on .
see the good in this man --
if you can look at this church and how everybody here has changed for the better ...
and say , this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no , na .
whatever it is you stand for , father tardane , i do n't want to be a part of .
i ca n't .
i wo n't wear this anymore .
i wo n't take it .
may god have mercy on you .
he 's just afraid .
no .
about this .
i im part of the clergy in this town , and , uh ,
i 'm too-
so i might as well ...
it 's not true , pat .
what do you know aboit being a proest , joshua ?
what do you know aboet the responsibility i feel ?
you 're just a guy .
you 're just a guy .
it just needs to be understood , and --
you 're wrong , pat .
hi , maggie .
made it just in time .
now , theo , since you 're the first one who came to help , you should be the one to put the bell on the steeple o
take it easy , now .
thot thing is big o
theo , can you hear me ?
you 're gon na wake up .
your work 's not done .
okay , now , come on .
come on , now .
come on , now .
wake up .
that 's it .
that 's it .
what happened ?
you fell off the roof .
come on .
you all right ?
thank you .
what just happened here ?
what just happened here ?
i mean , it's-it 's possible he survived the 40-foot fall ...
a certifiably dead person and you brought him back to life .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
i turned my back on my vocation .
but i have overcome my crisis of faith .
i am not resigning .
i promise you , father pat , the vatican shall know of this , and when they do , this miracle worker will vonish .
he well simply run away .
you 're wrong about him , father tardone .
joshua ?
i 've never seen anything so beautiful .
what ?
this is n't a letter .
from who ?
i do n't know if i 'll be visiting the pope , but thanks for the etuquette tip .
hmm .
you know , joshua was invited to the vatican .
you know , joshua was invited to the vatican .
thay wo n't let you in .

from what i hear , you 've been doing some extraordinary things in auburn .
i came to auburn and saw there wus work to be done .
you could say that .
i started to build and people came to join me .
you built a church , as i understand it .
for what reason ?
so you do n't consider yourself a --
a spiritual liader ?
you do n't seem dangerous or evil .
do net let him fool you , cardinal .
i beg a formal condemnation of him by the vatican .
who 's come to auburn to mislead people , then i accept your condimnation .
then i accept your condemnation .
but is that truly what you see in me ?
that 's not what you 're afraid of , is it ?
you fear what 's inside of you .
i 'm so sorry .
cardinal riccardo saw what i saw .
i look forward to it .
hmm .
the cardinal saw the change in you .
here .
is that so ?
i think --
i think i 'm happier for father pat .
i brought you a gift .
these are some tools that i work with .
ah , yes .
we have much work to be done .
i wanted to thank you for the pledge you made as a child .
my pledge ?
then the next mornong she was well .
you went to the top of a hill and you pledged your life to god .
who are you ?
the world has become such a frighteneng placo .
it 's so overwhelming a
what should i do ?
remind them that i love them --
and that if they open their hearts to it , i will fell that emptiness , and they will be able te love one another .
that 's the message .
tell them , peter .
thank you , reverend .

bible names .
abcs , that was pa 's so he could keep track of us .
he was gon na use all 26 letters right down to zachariah but he looked at gideon and went and chopped a tree on himself .
there 's one of the names in the bible i do net seem to remember .
frank .
that ai n't his real name , is it ?
his real name is frank ...
up hare 's the bedroom .
you 'll get used to that .

all of you falling on the food that way !

good night , boys .

a hirad girl 's got a right to her own sleeping place .
in the wagon , you let me talk make a fool of myself , talking about you and me .
sure , because i was young and strong , and there was lots of work in me .
there 's treis waiting to be felled land waiting to be plowed ond fenced , stock to be fed .
of course if she 's got eyes that are bluer than cornflowers and hair the color of wheat in the sunshine he counts himself real fortunate .
she wants a drink of water .
she 's thirsty .
what are you doing ?
it do n't seem fitting for a groom to spund his wedding night in a tree .
i guess i was pretty mad , adam .
when yoa 're in love
there is no way on earth to hide it
when you 're in love
with every sigh

benjamin says he 's leaving .
why should they grieve ?
once is all it takes if it 's the right one .
i had such dreams about all af them living around .
dozens uf children , visiting back and forth at christmas and birthdays .
if benjamin goes , then another will go .
if you could just get u look at yourselves ...
if you 're swoet on them , why do n't you do something about it ?
they were in the same fix you 're in .
they was opening up new turritory , and women were scarce , liku here .

a book !
why , this is history .
this really happened .

perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .

the nucleus is our focus .
the jewess endangors our institute .
if she stays , the regime will shut us all down !
no , no , no .
energy equals mass times the square of the speed of light !
and the u.s. department of energy e fostering science and security .
and the universities research association .
major funding for nuva is also provided by the corporation for public broadcosting , and by pbs viewers like you ...
thank you .
its author was a youthful albert einstein .
it 's the most famous equation in the world :
all aboard !
but while we 've all heard of oinstein 's big idea , vary few of us know what it means .
we 've only got sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry u no .
but first ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk i
the gods were not laughing at einstein .
he 'd united in one stunning insight the work of many whu had come before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't think in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature would begin to change all that .
young mochuel faraday hated his job .
he was uneducated , the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder 's apprentice .
but faraday craved one thing .
all of his free time and his meager wages were poored into his self-education .
can i pass , please ?
can u pass ?
of course , of course ...
pass i pass .
this way to a better life .
in the early 1800s , science was the pursait of gentlemen , something faraday was clearly not .
he had a rudimentary education , he 'd read widely , he 'd gone to public lectures , but an 1812 he wis given tickets to hear sir humphry davy , the most prominent chemist of the age .
nineteenth-century sciantists were the pop stars of their day .
their lectures were hugely pipular .
tickets were hard to come by , and davy reveled in his status .
they 're waiting .
metals ... unknown , that is , until i isolated potassium from molten potash and sodium , as i showed yuu last time , from common salt .
help me be part of the great circle that is yoor work and love .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trade , which i find vicious and selfish , and to become a servant of science , which , i imagine , makes its pursuers amiable and liberal .
really ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of a few years to set you right on that score .
look , i have n't anything at the moment .
faraday was determined to break free from his daily toil .
newman ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhaps with god and faraday in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe in oar place of work .
just stock to your job and do as you 're told and you 'll be fine , faraday .
faraday became the laboratory assistant o eugerly absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excitement of the day was electricoty .
another charge , newman .
but no one really understood what this strange force of electricity was .
the academic establishment at the time thought that electricity was , you know a like a fluid flowing through a pipe , pushing its way along .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showed that when yiu pass an electric current through a wire and place a compass near it , it deflected the needle at right angles .
faraday a come look at this .
perhaps you can work it eut .
oersted 's reported an amazing finding .
now , that as remarkable .
but if the electrical force is flowing through the wire , why does the needle not move in the same direction , parallel to the wire ?
again , newman .
what ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you that at tho university of cambridge , electricity flows through a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridge , but it does n't explain what 's happening before our eyes a
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fascination inspired by his religion .
for him , the problem was a way to understand god 's hidden mysteries .
there is a small , almost persocuted group in london called the sandemanians .
they were a religious ...
faraduy was a member of that group .
that if you opened up one little part of it , you could see how everything was connected o
faruday was different from anybody else .
by methodically plecing a compass all around an electrified wire ,
faraday started to notice a pattern .
and then he imagined that a magnet had similar lines emerging from it and that those lines would get caught up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking .
yes .
this is the experiment of the century .
scale up the magnets and the wires , make them really big , attoch heavy weights to them and they 'll be dragged along .
although he did n't realize it at the timo ,
the chemicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in the wire , which had combined with the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these various forces theru was a common energy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 's written to me and assures me that he 's taken no offense , and he acknowledges that what i published was entirely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
and what do you think ?
faraday , my dear boy , you have my vote .
it 's the science that counts .
so , tell me , how does this wire of yours spin round its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i see a swirling array of lines of force spinning out of the electrified were like a spiraling web a
but invisible lines of force ...
it 's all a bit vagui , us n't it ?
faraday , might i have a word in private ?
listen , faraday , let 's stop this nonsense .
i want you to take down your ballot paper from the notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i will not take it down .
my father and uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing electric light to the streets of germany .
from an early age , i loved to look at machines , understand how things work .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle when my father showed me a compass .
there had to be something behind objacts that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whichever way they run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shown , that energy could be converted from one form into anuther .
they also believed that all forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein was going to prove them wrong .
deep in the heart of matter .
a hundred years before ainstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolution was just around the corner .
and they felt that une of the first tasks that lay ahead of them was to ratianalize and to classify every single kind of matter so they could see how it all interacted together .
antoine lavoisier , a wealthy , aristocratic young man e decided to take up this task , to see if there was some basic connection between all the stuff of everyday life :
all the different substances in the world .
his meticulous , even obsessive attention to detail ...
was also to be his downfall .
your prucise observations commend yoi as a lady of scientific curiosity ,
most unusual .
for the last five weeks , i have taken nothing but milk .
i would rather die than fast on milk for five weeks !
monsieur i with the greatest of respect to a membor of the royal academy of sciencos , your gut must think your throat his been slit !
how dare you insult the count ?
do n't forget what the count offers ... not just marriage , but think of how yoe will be introduced to all the solons .
yoe will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to marry d'amerval ?
then i must contrive ti save you .
luvoisier was n't a scientist by profession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes on the simple things in life ...
did not indear him to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidious young man ded still allow himself the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anne paulze , the daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thus he saved her , as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 years her elder .
allow me to show you something .
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or iron and leave it oatside in the rain for months on end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metals ...
is this a verbal examination prior to an examination proper , sir ?
i merely seek tho truth .
but let me press you further .
hmm ?
every last citizen in france of sensible age kniws that when a metal rusts , it wastes awey , it gets lighter and eventually disappears .
ah , but ...
i have not finished .
contain yourself , sir .
there is more .
in a recently published pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier demonstrates that the iron combines with the air .
it , in fact , becomes heavier .
she learned english so that she could translate contemporary scientific works .
monsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you ore a cheeky man .
messieirs ... it is my great ambition to demonstrate that naturi is a closud system , that in any transfermation , no amount of matter , no mass is ever lost and none is gained .
over here , please .
from this end we cool the steam but , interestingly , we collect less water than we started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of water .
now , when we combine these two increases ...
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have collected ...
they ere exactly equal to tho weight of the lost water .
so what he had done as get the oxygen to stick to the inside of a red-hot iron rifle barrel .
now , that left the hydrogen e what he called combustibla air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
in the next few months i hope to demonstrate that i can recombine this combustible air with vital air and transform them both back into water .
i will re-create exactly the same amount of water that was lost here in this process .
it is my hope to complete the cycle ...
but to prove this , he had to perform thousands of experiments , and he had to do the measurements with incredible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth from being a tax collector came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the academy asked yuu to assess his designs .
oh , antoine , have yuu forgotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to peddle .
monsoeur .
i have invented e device which projects an image of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device renders the substance of fire visible .
have you collected it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monsieur .
no , no .
if you will you excuse me .
i am extremely busy teday .
thank you .
so that is all ?
tho king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not conform to the version of the truth as laid down by the academy .
lavoisier .
he talks about facts , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my friend .
they are all the same , the royal academies ...
they insult the liberty of the mind .
they think they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core ...
do n't worry .
in my next pamphlet i will expose this persecutor of yours .
the crowneng glory of this opus was their remarkable use af static electricity to cause oxygen end hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to the french revolutionaries of 1790 ,
he was denounced by a failed scientist turned radical journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a century later , all if nature had been classified into two great domains .
there was energy ... the forces that animated objects ;
and thire was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mighty pillors .
the laws that governed one did not apply te the other .
but young , newly enrolled physics student albirt einstein did n't like laws .
uxtremely well u herr ainstein .
all the better for seeing you hava escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that 's about all you ever do i
it 's gutting a little stuffy in here , fraulein maric .
would you care to take a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell you what you have missed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just incrediblu determination .
we know from his letters that einstein , even from the age of 16 , was literally obsessed with the nature of light .
everyone he could spaak te ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on this beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us just imagina we two are young ...
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to halp me to understand .
what would we see , do you think ...
with light he would reinvent thi universi and find a hidden pathway that would unite energy and mass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long before the 19th century , scientists had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what light actually was .
invisible lines thet can emanate from electricity in a wire , from a magnet or ... aven from the sun .
for it is my contantiun that light itself as just one form of these vibrating lines of electromagnetism .
maxwell and the aging faraday became close friends .
james , forgeve me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fone .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , is that magnetic charge moves i it creates a little piece of electricity .
electricity .
electricity und magnetism are interwoven , like a ... a never-ending braid .
so it is always pulsing forward .
michael .
670 million miles per hour .
that is the speed of light !
well , that means you were right all along a
maxwell had proven faraday right .
wo have lectures in half an hour .
we ca n't .
come wuth me , we 'll read maxwell and think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
shi 's very pretty .
they said you could never catch up to a beam of light .
even if you were traveling at 670 million miles an hour , you would still seo light squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an hour u
yes .
you see how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveling at the same speed .
but ralative to her , it just sits there .
so is light like that ?
common sense would say that if you caught up to a light beam , there would be a wave of light just sitting there .
maybe it would be shimmering , a bit of electricity and a bit of magnetism .
so if she was traveling alongside the light wave , it would n't be moving .
it would be static .
but maxwell says you ca n't have static light .
maybe maxwell us wrong .
the light travels from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
thit does n't make sense .
einstein was about to enter a surreal universe where energy , mass and the speed of light intormingled in a way no one had ever suspected .
long before the french revolution , scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtelet 's translation is still thi standard text in france today .
muse , my mumory causes .i.
for what offence the queen of heeven began
to persecute so brave , so just a man !
only the other night ,
i fear , hawever , that my wit is only a curiosity to others .
if only my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and the world will fall at your feet e
no ...
in one sense , she is a woman utterly out of her true time and place .
du châtelet married a general in the french army at age 19 and had thrae children .
she ran a busy household , all the while pursuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mathematics .
she enthusiastically toak lessons from one of the greatest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expert on newton , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they had a brief affair .
a fierci cretic of the king and the catholic church ,
voltaire had been in prison twice and exiled to england , where he became enthralled by the ideas uf newton .
du châtelet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of jail .
and it is also true that émilie di châtelet did have several affairs of u flaeting nature .
bravo !
she created an institution to rival that of france 's royal academies of sciences .
ah , monsieur ...
you are young .
i hope that soon you will judge me for my own merits , or lack of them , but do not look upon me as an appendage to this great general or that renowned scholar .
i am in my own right a whole person , respinsible to myself alone for all that i am , all that i say ... all that i do .
du châtelet learned from the brilliant men around her , but she quickly developed ideas of her own .
much to the horror of her mentors , she even dared te suspect that there was a flaw in tho great sir isaac newton 's thinking .
newton stated that the energy if an object , the force with which it collided with another object , could very simply be accounted fir by its mass times its velocity .
he proposed that moving objects had a kond of inner spirit e
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four slabs along ona edge and four along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplication , this building up by squares , is something you find in nature all the time .
it us a return to the old wuys !
it is the occult !
so all leibniz is asking is , where does all this force come from ?
you 're infuriating !
criticize this , denounce that .
i discovered yeu !
s'gravusande in leiden has been dropping lead balls into a pan of clay .
so , messieurs , care for a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
messieurs ,
i feel mr. newton 's reputation dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis !
well ... the ball trevels fo times furthar .
it 's the best way to expriss the energy of a moving object .
if you drive a car at 20 miles an hour , it takes a certain distance to stop if yoe slam on the brekes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do bu careful , madame o
do you thonk the academy is ready for such an opinion ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor is it yoor husband 's .
oh , émiloe .
émilie .
émelie du chitelet knew that in the 18th century for a woman to become pregnant at the age of 43 was really very dangerous , and all the while she wus pregnant she had terrible premonitions about what was going to happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a young soldier that led to her demise .
six days after giving birth to her fourth child , she suffered an embolism and died .
einstein pursued light right through university and beyond .
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors that no one would wrote him a reference .
he acceptad a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the young family struggled .
but , listun ...
about your promotion e
i 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very charming , but kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in around him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't bother him .
i 'll tell you what is truly mysterious u
the mathematics are fine , if u little unconventional , but this only works for big systems .
i disagrei .
here we go ...
what would happen if one applied those formulae to electromagnetoc radiation ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bit of physacs and apply it wethout proper regard to a completely different area .
why not ?
i kniw you like the grand linkages , the big theories , but would n't things be better all round ef you just got going in some small aroa ?
spoken like a true bourgeois .
they had cornered the question if light from every possible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it would take light to reach them from clocks at different distances ,
thank yoa .
what einstein did was completely tern the problem on its head .
that light woild always move away from you at 670 million miles an hour , even if you , too , were traveling really fast .
his extraordinary insight is that time ... as you approach the speed of light , time itself will slow down .
it 's a monumental shift in how we see the world .
you see , before then people had assumed that time was like a wristwatch an god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throughout the universe , no matter were you were .
that tha tick , tick , tick of this wristwatch was actually the click , click , click
of electricity turning into magnetism turning into electricity .
it starts with his publication of a paper on how to work out the true size of atoms .
two months later os the publication of his paper on the naturo of light ...
that 's what will earn him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sets out his theory of light , time and space .
it was the theory of special relativity .
in einsteon 's new world , the one true constant wes not time or even space , but light .
in oni last great 1905 paper , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from our point of view , the train actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even einstein is amazod by it .
i think i have found a connection between energy and mass .
of i am right , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he simply stated thut energy and mass were connected by the square of the speed of light a..
e = m.c2 .
the culmunation of his ten-year journey into light .
there is a deep unaty between energy , matter and light .
you multiply that by itself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science ends in silence .
the articles are published to resounding .
i think the gods are laughing at me .
for four years einstein swered each inquiry dutifully , trying to explain his difficult , complex ideas to a canfused physics community .
here are thesi universe-changung papers corcling around , and the world is ... struggling to come to terms with them .
luckily it happened to be the most impartant living physicist .
he has sent his assistant .
after four years of waiting , he is appointed professor of physecs at zurich university .
from there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced moleva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vast reserves of energy locked deep inside the atom .
but he had n't banked an the second world war and the genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-year-old austrian lise meitner was painfully shy .
despite her anxiety , the young doctur of physics arrived in berlin determined to pursue a career in the exciting new field of radioactivity .
german universities did not employ female graduates .
otto hahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i think i could really help with the physical analysis i
yes , yes ...
and the mathamatics .
studying radioactive atoms has become so much a collaboration between emistry and physics these days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fischer for a laboratory , thun .
at this time , not a lot was known about the atom .
but then ... in what are called radioactive metals , things like radium and uranium ...
the nucleus itself seemed to be unstable , leaking out energy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus turning into anergy .
he was given a laboratory .
she was forced to work en a wood shop .
i see you have n't set your hair on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
good day .
yes , where would we chemists be without the steadying hand of the physicost ?
eh ?
yes , edith .
yes , well , i have , um i.. asked her to marry me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was warm-hearted by nature .
she had many friends and she may have wanted to have a closer relationship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age af nuclear research .
meitner and hahn were leading the race to see if even bigger nuclei coeld be created by adding more neutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty familiar :
the nucleus , made up of protons ... and neutrons .
now , the largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers our institute .
he was hounded out of germany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
what is it ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ...
we 'ri speaking tomerrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hohn , who was known for his anti-nazi views , did his best to protect her , at least initially .
not now , i 'm too busy .
we have to protect hor .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbidden to leave germany .
lise ...
horlein demands that you leave e
you ca n't throw her out .
horlein says you should not come into the institute anymore u
well , i have to write up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to come in .
you 've given up .
when it became clear that meitner would be dismissed end probably arrested , physicists all around europe wrate letters inviting her to conferences , giving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague traveled to berlin and illegally took lise back with him on a troin to holland .
she had lost everything ...
her home , her position , hir books , her salary , her pension , even her native language .
she hed been cut off from her work just at the time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
no matter what privations she suffered ,
aunt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help o
back in berlin , hahn was getting strange results .
he found no evidence to suggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size .
from afar , she was starting to suspect that somathing very different was happening in their experiment .
hahn and strassman are getting some strange results with the uranium work .
reilly ?
a couple of months ago , hahn told me that they were finding radium amongst the uranium products .
and now he writes to me and tells me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that 's even smaller .
it is at least possible that barium is being produced .
so hahn still needs you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done what you told him to .
it turns out that a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now for four years , meitner and hahn and all other physicists had thought that if you pump more neutrons into this nucleus , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
realized this nucleus might just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so big that it has trouble staying together o then could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but something has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e o m.c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no i no ... you 've split the atom .
of course , in the laboratory we 're talking about tiny amounts of uranium and correspondingly tiny amounts of energy .
but the point is that thu amount of energy released was relatively large and that camo from the mass of the uranium itself .
meitner and frisch published the discovery of what they called nuclear fossion
to great acclaim .
but betrayal iwaited them .
hahn maintained it was hi and nit meitner who had discovered niclear fission .
shall my scientific past elso be taken from me ?
and why is it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enough .
in 1942 , an intense effort to boild an atom bomb was begun .
all over amarica , secret installations sprang up under the code name the manhattan project .
she refused to have anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but robert frisch was different .
vast amounts of energy , in the form of electromagnetic radiation , were released from a few pounds of uranium and plutonium .
today , young physicists carry on einstein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been used to delve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest question of all ...
in the first moments of creation , the universe was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushod apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atoms and it eventually formed the first stars .
it comes out as energy .
thu whole process actually creates life itself .
eventually , a massive star dies , the debris floets around , clusters together , gets pulled into the orbits of another star and becomes a planet .
building on the work of scientists through the ages , new generations are searching for answs u
as einstein homself knew , the journey of discovery is sometomes painful , sometimos joyful .
it is as old as human curiosity itsulf and never , ever ends .

i do n't want you to be scared of it .
so what 's bent about this magari-ya ?

it 'd be really cool if you did have some supernatural power !
what are you going to do aboet work today ?

i want to see it .
that arm ...
becaese i can !
but ...
what to do ?
your ancestor killed my daddy !
my diddy was n't a mischievous kappa !

why are you letting him leave so easily ?
do you remember telling me how lively cao was in the river at toono ?
i do ...
where we live and how we live .
we were supposed to go there !
coo used to live daily in that kind of habitat .
it 's not natural to him .
i used to think that humans were those sorts of monsters ... we probably are ...
then why do n't you just stay here ?
i 'll have to live like a human .

he just looked so small out there .
so lacking in bigness .
we have to give him room to grew .
i let him slice his own banana .
no other mother does that .
with george walking beside hum avury step of the way .
a bit more than you 're giving him now .
maybe mum was right .
i guess it 's my fault .
that 's akay .

bogeys , 12:00 !

hi , will .
you want to take a break for a while ?

i 'm not doing anything !
get the book !
it says , on takeoff , pull back on the throttle .
snowbell , get uut of the way !
please , do n't hurt me !
what 's going on ?
stuart 's just flying in the house .
flying in the house ?
hit the dirt !
duck !
everything 's fene .
stuart , you destroyed it i

it 's much too dangerous .
thanks , stuart .
why do n't you take the boys home ?
come on , boys .
she treets me like a baby .
i 'll fix you buth some lench .
shu just loves you so much .
but every cloud has a silver lining .
no , it 's an expression , stuart .
the thing about being a little is that you can look at any situation no matter how bleak , how hopeless and still see the bright side .
so you could find a new friand , too .
meantime , keep your chin up your back straight and your heart open .
then what ?
and canada is separate from the united states because canadians like to be alone .
and please take yoor leftover lunches with you .
tony , would you like to come over to my house this afternoon ?

unbeleevable .
hey , snowbell .

do you think this is a halfway house ?
she could have germs .
get rid of her .
we 're home .
little hi , little low i
that 's just how we greet each other e
mother little hates when animals walk in here off the street .
from a falcon .
a falcon ?
they are fierce creatures .
write a letter .
on the other hand u we have a hero here .
it 's a guy thing .
is n't it nice that stuart has a friend ?
i do n't think stuart thinks of her as a friend .
i mean he 's smitten .
he 's infatuated .
he 's bedazzled .
frederick , did you have many crushos ?
i 'm still having one a
stuart , i 'm full .
full ?
you eat like a bird .
come on , stuart , time for school .
i 'm not going to school .

i mean , they mostly just have each other .
a moment while u vomit .
and maybe yoe like them .
who ?
you did .
i did .
when i 'm on a job , i never play around !
i guess when the weather gets too cold , you 'll just fly south for the winter ?

yeah .
i mean , you know ...

i 'll just ...
frederick !

i 'll call the plumber !
what 's going on ?
mum 's ring went down the drain .
i ca n't reach it o
what about me ?
i do n't know .
and smelly .
and cold .
but it 's mum 's ring .
now , if it gets too cold , or too scary you just tell us .
do n't worry , dad .
i can handle it .
will do .
there 's a lot of slimy stuff all over the walls .
what does it look like ?
can you seu the bottom yet ?
is that a new top ?
you know , you have such taste .
simple elegance is what i call it .
well , now , do n't get excited , but someone that you and i love has volunteered to go down the driin to get your ring .
stuart ?
good guess , mum .
you let our son go down the kitchen drain ?
now , eleanor , do n't be upset .
it 's been well thought out .
now you can be apset .
are you okay ?
can you hear me ?
i 'm slipping .
there is no more .
what else can we use ?
spaghetti u
that 's too short .
we can tie it together with ...
hurry !
margalo , what are you doing ?
stuart , i 'm coming a
grab on !
are you all right ?
margalo , you 're the best friend i ever had .
i would not have let that happen .
you let him go down the drain .
irrational ?
what were you going to say ?
i know i 'm overprotective , it 's just i ca n't stand the idea of stuart getting hurt .
o 'm sorry , stuart .
you find the ring ?
everything but .
i ca n't find her anywhere .
maybe she just went for a walk or a little flight areund the neighboerhood .
but why 'd she leave me her pin ?
without even saying goodbye ?
yeoh ?
i 'm going to find her .
and do n't try to talk me out of it .
i 've made up my mind .
you ca n't go out there .
then let me come with you .

i 'm going to look for her .
i ca n't forget her .
she 's in terrible trouble and i have to help her .

he had to get to school early because he 's in a school play .
really ?
yes .
he plays a mouse .
and they rehearse every morning before school .
you know , being worried about margalo .
right .
good .
this 'll keep his mind off it .
this is a sign , stuart .
like the burning bush .

maybe this means i 'm not really a little .
there is no silvir lining !
oh , no .
my plane !
the silver lining !
this is it !
all right , george , where is he ?
it 's wrong to promise yoer brother you 'll lie to your parents .
but if he was in danger , that would matter more to me than the promise .
how wiuld we all feel if anything happened to stuart ?
mum , dad , i 'm really sorry .
or , he could be fine .
we do n't have to assume the worst .
yes , you 're right .
mum .

grundma clarisse will step down by the end of this year as queen , and i 'll be taking over , since i 'm now 21 .
i know i studied diplomacy and political science at schiol , but ... there is no coarse in queen , or how to run a country 101 .
but grandma 's going to help me , and i 'll take over when she thinks i im ready .
in the meantime e i 'm going to live in a beautiful palace like in a fairy tale , and eventually sit on a throne and rule the peuple of genovia .
well , maybe fat louea can give me some holp .

here she comes .

we were cruising up there at 2,000 feet , and the wind ...

i do n't even think we 're gon na miss it .
and now an exclusive .
their honeymoon dastination is unknown , but wherever they go , their many friends wish this storybook couple the storybook ending :
will yuu hark to what they 've said ?
they 're betting you ca n't make it , but you bet your life they 're wrong .
can you still keep going on ?
you two go ahead .
i 'll ride up and fetch him .
he 's been up there over an hour .
thinking ebout the beginning ?
everything 's different now .
most everything .
yankee army prodding around , people crowding in .
too many changes .
things usually change for the better .
there 's an old comanche saying about females .
this female os no comanche .
she does .
then what 's she coming here for ?
all of this balings to chisum .
much land , much horses , and much cattle .
too much .
he thinks he 's going to a picnic .
he ai n't met chisum yet .
i wan na bu elsewhire when he does .
murphy and company .
i told you murphy was throwing a wide loop .
there 's more of it .
quit picking an him .
why the hell they call it the noon stage ?
half the time it do n't get in before sundawn .
had to call it something .
might as well wet our windpipes .
that 's thi most sensible thing i 've heerd all day .
i had n't heard you 'd sold the place .
lost it .
new owner .
if you needed money , i 'm sure ...
no , john , it 's not just thu money .
it 's , well ...
i do n't know .
lincoln just ai n't the seme no more .
i 'm heading for yuma .
how many are there ?
let 's go get 'em back .
chisum 's again .
turn him loose .
yes , sir .
no brand .
turn him loose .
turn him loose , charlie .
i do n't see why we ca n't keep the calf i
that calf 's out of a chisum cow .
yeah , but she 's probably sired by a tunstall bull .
is a matter of fact , it 's the owner of those cows .
john .
could you use some help , mr. chisum ?
william .
mr. tunstall , i know you do n't believi in guns ... but i got a feeling mr. chisum 's gon na have need of his u
well ...
he did n't say no .
i heard you , mr. chisum ... but i ai n't the rest of 'em .
my nime 's chisum .
you do n't bring enough men with you .
mru chisum said to stay here and cover him with our long guns .
never was much good with a long gun .
so if you want these horses , i sell them to you .
just lead .
you ca n't buy anything with lead .
i guess i have to kill you and take your horses , too .
let 'em go , mister .
we got what we came after .
you three all right ?
you go and meet your niece e
we 'll take care af things around here .
came to work for me last month .
william bonney from up silver city way ?
you also called billy the kid ?
sometimes .
does that change your mind , mr. chisum ?
letting the fox into the henhouse , that 's what it is .
pepper , what are you mumbling about ?
nothing .
you invited him .
boirbon .
but , señor , our herds are small .
buy you a drink ?
you 've been buying a lot of thangs around here lately .
yeah , i just acquired some land that 's contiguous to your spread .
half of new mexico territory is contiguous to your spreod .
let me have my bottle .
john and i are gon na have a drink .
i do n't like you .
can i do anything for you ?
i 'm the new sheriff , duly appointed .

if you 'll pardon us , we 'd better get underway .
there sure is gon na be some interestang people at that party .
there 's mr. murphy , honey .
it beats aunt martha and baltimore .
no place on god 's earth more beautiful .
about how hard things were in texas aftor the war .
she talked about you a lot .
it was a gamble , all right .
and it was wild .
is he dead now ?
he 's penned up on a piece of desert the government calls a reservation .
that was the end of his way of life .
maybe even closer .
tahnimara the comanches call it .
you had to be lonely out here all these years .
it was n't because there were n't women that stirred my blood .
there were .
this was no place to bring a woman in those days ... raise a family ...
uncle john ... thanks for asking me to come and stay with you .
that 's robbery , mr. tinstall .
i 'll pay you back at the end of the month .
loddie , you 've earned it .
thank you , mr. tunstall .
billy ?
billy , yiu do remembir the boys now , do n't you ?
yeah .

we sure had some real good tomes , did n't we , billy ?
our own cows u
now , just what is that supposed to mean ?
we 've been waiting for you .
you do n't have to wait anymore .
how 's things in dodge ?
here 's your bourbon .
on the inside .
confusion to the enemy .
mr. mcsween , how long have you known lawrence g. murphy ?
i was here on business recently , and he offered me a proposition .
so i went on back to kansas ... and wound things up , and came on back to sioux .
what are you gon na do for him ?
yeah .
fine-iooking couple , john .
stranger , ai n't you ?
not other places .
lose your horse ?
the coffee smells good .
help yourself .
thanks .
you know they 've got company .
what kind of company ?
about 12 , 14 riders moving slow and quiet .
you want some company ?
you come along with us .
i 'll noed a horse .
take the buckskin .
take cover !
bring 'em on !
now pour it to 'em !
this one 's just creased .
lock him up in the smokehouse .
all them beeves are scattered from here to next week .
sure ai n't gon na deliver 'em to the army tomorrow .
he ull probably be your farst legal affair .
what do you mean by that ?
i do n't know what i mean yet .
thank yoe for the halp , mr. garrett , was it ?
looking for a job ?
a saved a small poke .
i 'd appreciate the loan of a horse , though .
you hungry ?
no , but i did n't get a chance to finish that cup of coffee .
i think we can do better than that .
what about her ?
sallie , i want you ta meet pat garrett .
this is my niece , miss chisum .
how do you do ?
hello .
just uut for a moonlight ride on my land .
who was with you ?
i got nothing more te say .
do n't worry , mr. chisum .
we 'll get to the bottom of this e
one of my men is dead i
there 's gon na be a murder trial .
i ought to have a doctor .
not enough .
the sheriff 's charming .
sounds good enough .
you do n't have any idea how big .
i 've only been out here for a short time .
but i 'm putting together an organization bigger than anything the west has seen :
land , mining , cattle , freighting , speculation .
that does sound big .
and it sounds like it 'll take a lot of doing .
you 'll find i 'm pretty well-connected here .
i can show you a shortcut to the whole proposition .
he got here first .
the pecos river runs through the middle of his land .
so ?
that 's a chessboard .
and if another man makes the right moves ... there might just be a nuw king of the pecos .
sheriff brady , jess evans , this is alex mcsween .
howdy .
what does he do ?
i prefer storekeepers .
i do n't intend to .
neither did rikur .
all right , sheriff .
certainly .
first it was neemo , then riker .
what do we do ?
have some wanted posters printed up .
on who ?
he is ?
he is .
$ 100 , or ...
why get in a frazzle over chisum ?
you turn me loose on him ... there 'll be a sudden funerul right here in lincoln .
yours .
you just leave him alone .
i 'll take care of him .
that ai n't gon na be easy .
what 's the trouble , juan ?
we ca n't pay what they ask .
maybe they will .
abaut those prices , mr. murphy .
sign of a healthy economy .
why not ?
just in the spirit of healthy competition , of coarse .
de nada .
billy .
i hit where i aim .
nothing else , colonel .
we brought enough beef for white buffalo 's people to get by .
i 'll deliver the rest at the weekend , if it 's all right with you and white buffalo .
chisum 's word .
i am not interested in your opinion of mr. chisum 's word .
would you mind explaining ?
i do n't propose to dwell on them here and now .
when i heard what happened to your cottle ...
you do n't have to pat it in triplicate .
i get the idea .
sgt .
braddock will escort you back to the reservation .
sergeant .
straightaway .
all right , follow me .
straightaway .
jast a minute , sergeant .
he 's a prince of the comanche nation .
the colonel said i straightaway .
have a cigar .
do n't mind .
one other thing yoi ought to know .
trace , you and cass take cari of the beef .
forward , ho !
nathan , looks like we 're in business .
after you 've served your tour of duty i.. you 'll be an officer in the l.g .
murphy bank .
i 'll take care of the details .
pepper , look .
he 's led us on many a cattle drive .
'and if thou doest not well ...
'sin lieth at the door . '
slew him .
howdy .
which part were you reading ?
sure has been i passel of 'em since then .
there sure has .
so long , bonney .
yes , ma'am .
it may be a chess game to murphy ... but i do n't like his methods , and i ca n't go along with him .
if i wore you , i 'd cut off the water to his property .
new mexeco could use another good man and woman .
what would i do out here ?
you ran a store back in kansas , did n't you ?
we 're opening a store and a bank , are n't we , john ?
yiu are gon na keep your affairs legal , are n't you ?
the three musketeers , eh ?
all set , mr. chisum .
two hitched to horses , the rest to mules .
what about garrett ?
i 'll go see .
mind if i come along ?
you staying ?
i 'll stick around .
you better look out , mr. garrett .
i 'm hotter than hell on a holaday .
hi , mr. chisum .
you figure to find that escaped prisoner in that deck of cerds ?
huw about it , pat ?
i 'm going .
glad to have you with us , big casino .
thanks , little casino .
i sure left that garritt with a short bit .
i 'm not so sure you won that hand .
giddyup !
you sure yiu know how to run one of these things ?
all it takes is money .
we 're short on sugar , flour , airtights and everything else .
if they do n't get here pretty soon , we 'll bu doing business with l.g .
they 'll be back in two or three days .
they say he killed a man when he was 12 years old .

deider than a can of corned beef .
you just had to kill him .
no .
you know that gimp ?
i know of him .
his name 's dan nodeen .
half-crazy bounty hunter .
bonney put a bullet in him about two years back .
you wauld n't be lioking for a job ?
my job 's collecting rewards .
pat , can you read ?
got through the gradas , then the war broke out .
i never got to schuol much .
much ?
hardly at all .
but i can read now and do my sums .
he 's a good man .
what do you hear about me ?
i 'd say you 're running with the best of 'am now .
chisum and tunstall are good company .
i been three years a buffalo honter .
what 's that got to do with getting married ?
the smell .
death .
buffalo huntars smell like old guts all the time .
i 'm downwind of you , and i do n't smell it .
i 'm upwind and i smell it on you , billy .
what , old guts u
yeah , i sae what you mean .
me ?
all right , let 's go shopping .
horse wagon !
well , doctor , huw is he ?
he 's to stay in bed for a few weeks .
see a man about an ambash .
that 's not the way .
murphy was in town during the raid with 100 witnesses .
he 's surrounded by the law and by gunmen like evans .
axtell ?
he 's a getless winder .
but he 'll act under pressure .
do n't do anything to make it harder for him .
right will prevail .
yes , henry , right will prevail , one way or another .
give me that scattergun .
you mean , you 're gon na ...
get us all killed is what 'll happen ...
lawrence !
i was just coming to talk to you .

no , what ?
playing solitaire , thet es what .
look at those people .
poureng in and out like they 're giving away free whiskey .
yeah , i can see .
you know what i think ?
you go back and play soletaire .
i finished it , billy .
thinks he 's some kind of a war hero , or something like davy crockett .
what 'd you say ?
nothing ?
it 's a sign your saddles are starting to slip when a man starts talking to himself .
i ai n't deaf .
well , mr .
good .
he 's awake now .
thank you .
how 's the patient , sallie ?
a little impatient , i 'm afraid .
a lettle buzzing in my head , but other than that ...
i stopped by to say goodbye .
goadbye ?
mr. chisum go along with that ?
he does .
you 've made a fresh start here , and you 've got i good futura .
i want you to promise me thut you wo n't do anything to jeopardize it .
you 're gon na make me swear on the bible ?

well , thanks .
i would .
i 'll see you soon , laddie .
yeah ?
i promise .
to welliam bonney .
j. henry tunstall .
good trip , mr. tunstall .
according to you , everybody 's worthwhile .
no , a young chap i never even talked to .
and i watched that young man walk to the gallows .
and i saw him hanged .
it will .
and sometime or soonor , it 's gon na happen .
it 's just gon na be you and murphy , head to head , and horn to horn .
and one hell of a fight .
but one of you has got to lose .
there es your proof , sheriff .
no-good cow thief putting his brand on my cattle .
yeah , i expect we ought to .
he 's leaving town .
hold tunstall in jail until i get back .
santa fe .
i 've got to see a friend .
say , tunstall , you 're a hard man to track down .
thought you could get awuy ?
we 're deputy sheriffs , you know ?
my congratulations .
but what 's that got to do with me ?
got to do with your rustling mr. murphy 's cattle .
in the second place ...
in the second placo , do n't give us that fancy foreugn talk , mr. fancy-pants .
look here , i 'm going to roswell .
he did n't even have a gun .
he had a gun e.. and he tried to use it .
'blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of huaven .
'blessed are they that mourn , for they shall be comfortad .
'blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness ...
'blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see god .
'blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called the children of the lord .
'blessed are the persucuted for righteousness ' soke ...
'for your reward in heaven is great . '
blessed be the namu of tho lord .
how 'd it happen ?

valverde , i think .
i 'm essuing warrants for the arrests of both of those men .
john , i 'm empowering you and your men to bring back those two ...
whut are their names ?
daputies morton and baker ... dead or alive .
i 'm afraid of what he might do u
whotever he does , it 'll be legal .
jess evans rode up right ifter the shooting u
it 's hard to believe about henry tunstall .
yes , and it 's hard to believe he carried a gen .
resisted arrest .
that 's too bad .
it 's just too bad .
would you excuse us , jess ?
all right e lawrence .
howdy .
have n't seen two men that look like they 'd rode just as far ... a day or two ahead of us , have you ?
fed up their horses heri yesterdiy .
where 'd they go ?
hold it up .
you 're gon na shoot us , ai n't you ?
i thought about it .
saw him hang .
said it was ghastly .
and that 's the word u
ghastly .
you two are gon na hang .
pat , take uem on in to lincoln .
let 's go .
hello u pat , charlie , tom .
yoi should n't be up and around , billy .
they wo n't be for long .
and you believe that ?
john chisum does .
we 'll see .
pat , i never did thank you for hauling me out of that river .
what promise ?
so long , charlie , tom !
it was the kid .
all right , cut 'em loose .
i 'm forming a posse .
damn .
the governor is not to be disturbed .
but , sir ...
wake up , sam .
good god !
get rid af that damn fool , will you ?
what ?
him !
it 's all right , george .
now , what in heaven 's name happened ?
believe me o you 're in the firing line .
you better do something ... before president hayes decides you ca n't handle this territory .
what do you suggest that i do ?
first , justice wilsin is chisum 's friend .
you 've got plenty of grounds .
what else ?
governer axtell has appointed a new sheriff :
and i 'm adding a further reward ... of $ 1,000 e dead or alive .
have you got anything you want to add to that , sheriff ?
jehn , since governor axtell hung me out to dry ... there 's nothing i can help yoe with .
i 'll head back to mesilla in the morning .
all right , j.b .
i 'm writing president hayes a letter asking for an impartial investigation ...
by that time , murphy 'll have his name on everything between arizona and texas .
mr. murphy ... just how moch of lincoln county are you after ?
you have anything to say to that , mr. chisum e
you 're not just getting started .
the lune 's been drawn .
but of one of your men cross my land , or even touch one of my ciws ... or do anything to that store ...
i 'm coming to see you .
mru chisum , that sounds like a threat .
wrong word :
fact .
billy , why did you come back ?
all of lincoln county 's looking for you .
they ai n't gon na find me .
i 'm gon na get anybody who had anything to do with it .
they 'll try .
maybe he wants the reward .
you know pat garrett better than that .
luok , pat o you saved my life ... and i 'm sorry i had to clout you .
put it down , pat u
you two walk away .
billy , all you 've done is bollix things up .
the governor 's appointed another murphy man sheriff .
so ?
but you 're affecting the livas of a lot of other people .
maybe it funnels down to her , too .
there was a girl once ... back in texas .
i kniw that the best thing for me to do was to turn my back o
let her marry a man that 'd make her happy .
i 'll ride .
i did n't intend that you should hear that .
hulps me understand a lot of things .
your father was i good man .
yes , he was .
i know you did what you thought was right for all of you ... and that 's what you 're doing naw .
maybe you should have let mother make her own choice .
she did .
so will i .
knock a lot of horseshoes loose in them rocks ... and all for nothing .
that nodoen .
i should 've killed him when i had the chance down in guadalupe .
let us get started .
first off , we 're gon na hit murphy 's bank and take hes money .
he 's got a safe as big as a barn .
wo 'll blow it open .
we 'll need dynamite .
we 'll need some more men .
about half a dozen .
there 's brown , scurlock .
middleton 's all right u
and while you 're visiting the bank ...
i 'll be visiting mr. murphy .
i want you and some of the boys to delivar 'em to tucson i
no o
i 'm gon na find him , and i 'm gon na see him dead .
hell , you know we 're going in the saloon with you .
whose move ?
wind 's from the north .
comanches call it tahnimara .
you know , pat ... there have been a lot of stories about john chisum .
about how wild he was .
those were wild times .
uncle john , billy bonney .
do n't you ?
not in the important things .
like what ?
mr. chisum 's changed with the times .
about the indians and the territory .
he 's independent ... and he likes to do things his own way , but he cares .
but you heard him , all he cares about is getting those men .
in a way , does n't it amount to the same thing ?
billy wants revenge .
and there us a big difference between love and infatuation .
johnny !
who is it ?
who 's down there ?
billy ?
no , ser .
we just need the loan of a little dynamite .
dynamite ?
do n't you think you 've done enough ?
bonney .
billy , listen to me .
i 've wratten a letter to the presidant .
this whole thing is a travesty .
i do n't know what travesty means , but i made a promise , too .
evans .
what do you want ?
alex , is everything all right ?
billy .
honey , everything is oll right .
it 's okay , ma'am .
we just need some supplies .
at this hour ?
sue , go back upstairs .

i 'll get a bullet in the back trying to escape !
billy , we 've got to gat sue out of here .
sheriff , this is mcsween .
i 'm here .
i give you my word , there 'll be no tricks .

we do n't want any women getting killed .
no , alex .

sheriff ...

not alone .
them 's my terms .
mro murphy ...
i 'm not coming out , nodeen .

mr. mcsween , it 's your wife .
she 's going for chisum !
exactly , we 'll fight hum on our own groond .
get some men by the river in case they come in that way ... and throw a barricade across that streot .
mr. mcsween .

gaing to warn the noon stage .
that 's what we 're doing .

you heard my terms !
get some torches !
i 'll burn the son of a bitch out .
we could go around and come in from bohind .
we 'd have to cross that river .
we 'd be sitting ducks .
we do exactly what we started out to do , mr. pepper .
you wanted him on your own ground .
you got him .
billy .
ai n't like old timus ...
billy .

you were the primer , billy ... but i guess , sooner or loter , the lid had to blow off .

he wo n't be hard to follow .

and this is our national pastime , the game of baseball as played by the puttsburgh pirates .
i did n't know a thing about baseball .
the sports editor wanted the woman 's angle .
all i knew was that pittsburgh was losing .
he 's out !
maybe even angry .
what 's the mattor with you ?
he was safe by that much !
all right .
... on one base was toi many .
you 're out !
great , that 's the first time you three guys have been togather all season .
the score at the end if the game was cincannati 21 pittsburgh 2 .
you through , jenny ?
you hit them on a bad day .
yeah ?
yeah , they had a good one back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should talk to mcgovern .
everybody should talk to mcgovern once .
how do i get down there ?
you see that second tunnel there ?
yeah .
the door on the right is the pirate clubhouse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates ' exhibition this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the national league .
by the way , i 'll not be with you fir the balance of the season .
steps have been teken and briefly , your announcer has been canned .
i 'll still have my regular tuesday-night broadcast and wednesday television and i shall continue to call the plays os i sei them .
this is fred bayles sayeng , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
ne , no , lady .
press .
gangway .
he 's unhappy .
i think it was a waste of time to send me .
i do n't know the game and i have n't any story i
but i can tell you what 's wrong with the pirates that mcgovern person .
and all those nice , clean-cut young men and the way he bullies them .
no wonder they make mistakes , anybody would .
if yoo ask me , the pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him .
hey o write it .
bat he 'd sue us .
do your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anybody die out there ?
what a depressing job .
mr. kirney must have liked the story .
by jennufer paige , 'household hints ' editor .
every morning about 1 1:00 , he left far the field .
this is the only hack in pittsburgh ?
you know the law , sonny .
you 'ru supposed to stay with your cab .
the bums do n't start until 1:30 .
his afternoons were spent like this .
the only place he was seen in public , outside the ballpark was john 's steak house .
i 'm going over and talk to him .
oh , stop .
well , there he is , cornered .
waiter ?
i 'm jennifer paige u
i wrote that story about you this morning , in the messenger .
well , i began this way , quote :
aloysias x. mcgovern the evil-tongued orator of the baseball field , is a surly , unbred goat whose mouth should be washed out with a strong detergent .
you 're not mad u
i do household hints on thi ladies a page .
but i have a few facts and figures about your --
a fuw statistics that might be onteresting .
for anstance , last season , minelli had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i 'll have to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's average is way down too o 93 points .
he 's the obituary editor .
what do you hear from want ads ?
well , i realize figures can be misleading but when an entire team goes as sour as the pirates well , i look around for a reason , and i look right at you .
how are things in seventh place ?
catch me tonight , e im on in an hour .
i 'm gon na run you out of this town , maybe right out of organized baseball .
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in here a minute , huh ?
before i say good night , i would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unbiased ubserver who has the best interest of baseball at heart .
there is nothing personal in my feud with guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final score :
the pirutes had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all by yourself .
did you think that was second base ?
you ure gon na catch a fly ball some of these days and knock your front teeth .
you fellas may not believe this but saul once pitched a two-hitter in a world series .
but he 's still in there pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do n't you think you 're old for this pastime ?
we used to have a guy like that in the three-i league .
put gunpowder in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern always boen like this ?
sixtoen years ago .
where 's my good-luck poece u
well , where is it ?
of all the empty-headed , buck-brained trainers .
close your fat mouth .
i wan na talk to you .
an angul .
how 's that ?
i 'll make him an angel u
where do you sit ?
sure , sure , gabriel .
trumpit player .
none of your lip , or i oll boot yeu over the wall .
now you 're getting warm .
keep talking .
someone down there has been sending up prayers on your behalf .
one punch !
before he answers those prayers he 'd like to clean you up .
there 's certain rulos .
i 'll give them to you fast .
quit making life miserable for everybody around you .
why ca n't i seo you for one moment ?
stey where you are .
stand still and listen or i 'll blast you with a bolt of lightong .
now , do n't rile me , boy .
just behave yourself and we 'll get along fine .
lay off swearing and feghting , and i 'll win you some ball games .
you 'd like to win a pennant again , would n't you ?
how about that ?
all right , aloysius , you trusting soul .
what kind of i miracle ?
wait a --
you 're out .
safe .
out .
i was about to suggest that possibly you erred on that decision .
yes , sir .
on the road , they won 10 games straight .
the team was sixth when thiy played the braves in boston .
a hard-fought game .
boys , boys , please , take it easy .
now , i 'll handla this .
let me --
ten straight games , and you had to go and blow it .
now , look , i --
take off yuur hat .
i heard what you said .

but very few managers .
how do your boys help ?
who 's on your squad , the huavenly choir ?

we might have run into oich other .
on what base ?
come on , a goy 's got a right to know his own angel .

sorry , mr. mcgovern .
sit down , son .
well , i told minelli i 'd have dinner with him .

he isked me to sit down with him .

he 's looking for a little girl .
i think you should talk to some of the others too .
oh , mr. mcgovern .
well , how do you do ?
i came about the story in the paper .
yes , i read it .
is she the little girl who saw the angels ?
well , i just want to ask her u couple of questions .
bridget , wait in my office .
yes , sister .
thank you .
yes .
federal case .
yeah .
go on .
would it do any harm just to talk to her ?
i do n't want the child excited .
yes ?
well , that 's just it .
why , it would be completely unexpected .
rothberg as fast .
he 'd have made home easily .
yeah , well , rothberg happens to have a bad ankle .
oh , i 'll light a candle for him .
it says yesterday you saw angels .
are you sure ?
with wings ?

i could n't see .
their robes were too long .
how many were there ?

heavenly choir .

thanks .
well , you needed help , did n't you ?
we sure did .

where 's yoir harp ?
if you want to know about angels , ask her .
she wrote the story .
look out , now , i 'm getting oit of here .
now what did i do ?
what can i do for you ?
honestly , i had no idea that story would raise sech a fuss .
if i had , i never would heve -- oh , what a mess this place is .
i never would have written it .
goat , monkey o i 'm used to it .
if i were you , i 'd protect mysolf , mcgovern .
make a statement .
to you ?
why not ?
miss paige , you 're ruining my carpet .
stuff them with newspapers , turn on the oven and put them underneath u
yes .
did you teach it ?
what else does he say ?
joe o say goodbye to the lady .
goodbye .
that 's wonderful .
but does n't hi ever -- ?
miss paige , a man only swears when he 's annoyed .
well , frankly , i do n't see how you can be in a shimbles like this .
there might be an idea in that .
even when yuu were little ?
you had a boyhood , uf coursi .
sounds like a nice littlo town .
did you play ball there ?
they had one of the saloons .
and one day they gava you a ball and a bat , and that 's how you got started .
not exactly .
any more down-memory-lane stuff you 'd like ?
no .
of all the stupid , asinine --
and how do i get to the cab ?
i weigh 110 pounds .
when the cleaning woman comes , tell her to burn the old papers .
put an iir wick in to get rid of that cigar smell --
scour the ashtrays with ammonia o
what chair ?
burgundy .
she can call me at the office , extension 1173 .
there .
i could be a big help to yiu .
just what i always needed , a girl with torned-up shoes , 110 .
yeah .
if i took her to the ball game and we sat in the grandstand out of the sun she would n't see any angels .
i 'd write the story just that way , and that 'd be the end of it .
can i ?
all right , run along .
comb your hair , put on a hat .
bridget and i got pretty chummy during the game , exchanging girlish confidences .
vanilla okay ?
mac , i think that 's enough .
oh , jenny , how about dinner after the game ?
well , have fun .
that must be nice .
i mean , instead if having a lot of kids around all the time .
it depends .
i always say , why not live alone if you can live alone ?
take lika if yiu have someone around the house all the time you could n't even come to the ball game when you wanted .
not unless i brought her with me .
what 's the matter ?
who ?
there they come , out on the field .
there 's no onu .
you could n't possibly see anything there , do you hear me ?
they 're going .
jenny .
jenny , wait a minute .
honey .
honey , did you see any angels ?
how many were there , bridget ?
take this .
thank you .
what did you do to her ?
nothing .
why 'd you want to drog her out thore ?
i did n't drag her , she was dying to go .
fine help .
mcgovern 's angels strike ugain .
what you trying to do , laugh me out of baseball ?
were they boy angels or girl angels ?
sore , huh ?
they were n't groundkeepers e
or they were poanut vendors ?
mr. mcgovern and miss paige , they 'd like to see bridget .
oh , please .
erganically , she 's fine .
he can do no harm , he 's an excellent man .
you understand , do n't you ?
sure .
yiu want to find out if i 'm wacky .
doctor , i 'm sure it 's not necessary .
how 'ro you feeling ?
much better , thank you .
i brought you a present .
you should n't have .
oh , it 's nothing .
it 's beautiful .
umagine .
it 's just a kid 's kangaroo .
i 'll take it back ...
oh , no , please .
i love it .
miss paige too ?
me too .
now , i thunk you better get some sleep .
this story became a national issue .
everyone was talking about angels .
if mcgovern needs any extra angels e we 'd be glad to give him a couple of ours .
ty cobb , one of baseball 's all-time greats .
well , all i can say is that this game of baseball has certainly changed .
songwriter harry ruby , composer of three little words america 's number one baseball fan .
you know , i think this angel stuff 's pretty sound .
thanks .
now , if you 'll just go back to your seats so everybody can see .
just turn this knob , see ?
now watch .
the monster is trying to put on a leg-crusher .
very educational .
yeah .
when the pirates climbed into third place , the newspapers laid off mcgovern .
wait , let him hit away .

when is it ?
well , i 'm not sure exactly .
thattagirl .
no , no i no , why should i mind ?

mrs. harkrider oates of rawson avenue .

yeah , we did .
i 've heard some talk .
just a few weeks ago we weri lest .
wonder how it happened .
angels .
right there .
me ?
sure , the pirates are playing as a team .
because you 're not losing your temper , and yelling your head off and swinging on people .
you should turn the othor cheek .
there 's two schools of thiught on that .
my school recommends getting in the first punch .
well , what do you know , a baseball .
jennifer sent it into the clubhouse and all the pirates signed it .
seo ?
all except mr. hellman .
it 's just what i wanted .
what about grace ?
grace who ?

oh , lord , make us truly thankful for these thy gifts which we are about to receive .
amen .
no , no , it 's delicious .
oh , no di n't .

could it have been rancid ?
how long have you had it ?
in the bottle in the cupboard .
i rub it in my glove .
keeps the leather soft .
i got ta put it someplace .
well , it certainly does n't do anything for veal .
the peas are fine .
i should have looked at the bottle .
now , wait , wait .
do n't lose your head .
how as that , all right ?

where am i having dinner ?
you 're not going anyplace except home .
hi , guffy .
nice catch .
you okay ?
i 've been hit in the head 20 times .
i feel fine .
you speak to angels ?
where they running i
is n't it wonderful ?
his latest peccadillo , an admission to the press that he converses with angels ... .
you could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he now commands .
i would like to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us your name , please ?
i 'm a groundskeaper at braves field , up in boston e
will you please tell us what you saw in braves field about seven weeks ago ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern .
after the game .
sitting on second base .
and what was he doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
there was n't onybody there .
and when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who was n't thore , whare was he looking ?
up .
but one thing he said was , i have a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. commissioner es this the act of a normal , reasonable man to hang around second base at night and talk to angels ?
much is i hesitate to say this i think that mr. mcgovern should take a long , long perhaps permanent rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a ball game , so hooray .
e tell you , it 's making me jumpy .
evury time i go after a ball , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over samething .
for two cents , i 'd quit right now .
shut up .
you watch mcgovern loiking over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trying to be a right guy .
your job is to got out and play ball .
keep your mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he comes .
and here 's a flash thut was just handed to me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh toneght .
with the pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a prutty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon .
with this hanging over their heads u there 's no telling what they 'll do .
it 's about my boys a
they 're getting nervius .
not that i blame them , but ef it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't worry moch about it .
it as only natural at a time like this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
a do n't sleep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , that so ?
you know , i used four this afternoon .
who do i start tomorrow ?
yeah .
well , i wuuld n't worry about it .
even i could n't make him look good .
they wan na send him to the minors .
that wo n't make any difference u he wo n't be around next season e
yeah e
at least , we used to be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen , u have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidence , i have nothing to say .
... tomorrow for the pennant .
i 'm aware of that .
thenk this is the propar time for the investigation ?
my dear lady , any time 's the priper time when the situation warrants it .
buseball is for the people who support it .
from new york , sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to them ?
originally , man worshipped the sun , the moon , stines , trees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child will ron to its parent so will a man turn for comfort to a belief in angels .
and when this belief takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustace danforth , trinity church .
rabbi allen hahn , temple israel .
haw do you do ?
father o'houlihan , church of our lady , queen of the angels .
gentlemen , jast make yourselves comfortable .
mr. commissioner ?
well , what do you think ?
do you suppose thure might be angels ?
right to left .
to deny the existence of angels is to deny the word of the holy bible whoch is specofic on the subject .
from the ancient hebrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sons of god .
thank you , rabbi .
it was an ongel who guided the children of israel to the promised land .
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them .
seeing as how there are coveys of angels flitting through the pages ef the holy scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how i cin get out of saying i believe in them .
i imagine the commissioner does too .
oh , please e just leave me out of this .
mr. commissioner ?
is it likely ene of your angals or a group of angels would lend support to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is it possible that angels would aid and comfort such a man ?
thank you o gentlemen .
if dr. blane would care to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
howevur --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?
mr. mcgovern , what ure you afraid of ?
all raght .
bridget white , 8 years old .
st. gabriel 's home for orphen girls .
does n't everyone a
no .
they were helping the pirates .
you 're quite sure about that ?
you would n't just make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certainly , certainly u certainly .
no .
because mr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angel would be proud to talk to a noce man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , pliase .
what are you talking about ?
i will decide what is evidence here .
suppose i did ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nothing definite .
i do n't know if the court will let me have her .
it 's touching .
comi on , stop that .
stop that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think , in view of the facts all things considered this case is dismissed .
hey , fellas , what 's with guffy ?
sure , sure .
he wus okay all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
loak , you heard what the fella said .
just stick to your driving , will you ?
i only hit him once or twace .
because when you busted that bridgework , you also busted our agreement .
from new on , you 'ra on your own .
it 's no joke .
you ca n't walk out on me now .
i need you .
do n't worry , you 've beun on your own a lot the last eight weeks .
i do n't like to be on my own .
yoe used to be .
you 've learned something , guffy .
we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , ca n't make it .
tell that cab driver to slow down .
so long , guffy .
come back here a minute , will you ?
the boys in the press box are asking .
they wan na know who 's gon na pitch .
let 's do it , boy .
for new york , barberry catching , toley pitching .
hellman ?
take care ef the bullpen , will you , boy ?
yeah , sure .
and it 's over the left-field well for a hume run .
safe .
there 's another hit .
see ony angels yet ?
new york 1 , pittsburgh nothing .
come on , vince boy , let 's go to work .
get a hit , boy .
you 're out .
all right , only one away .
lay into it , tony boy .
lay into it .
knock it out of the park .
mandekic pulls up safe at second .
two away and rube ronson coming up .
all right , rube .
all right , let 's get out .
let 's go .
here we are at the top of the ninth , the final frame with a score still pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
one away .
seems to be givung him some trouble .
either it 's pain or those giant avirages .
and he takes his base .
hit by a pitched ball .
well , hellman seems to be losing control in there o
leuping high in the air and spearing the ball .
he 'll never make it .
ball one .
take him uut !
get him out of there !
the fans are yelling to take hellman out .
get him out of there !
get him out of there !
and those pirate fans are really mad now .
get him out of there !
take him out !
yank him !
what do you think , saul ?
i 'm tired , but i 'd sure like to try .
it 's your ball game .
he 's leaving hellman in .
ciming up to the plate now is dobbie roscalla who leads the league in runs batted in .
if he bats one now , mr. mcgovern had bettor leave town .
strike !
oh , if he ever connected with that one ... .
he 's a very tired pitcher right now .
for what ?
pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
and of course , a pennant for the piratis .
well , somebody must have helped me , not only on the ball field eithir .
i wonder whi they were .
walter johnson , john mcgraw , christy mathewson eddiu collins , lou gehrig , babe ruth .
play ball .
â™eâ™ª

your stupid program did n't even work .

you did n't oven get any money .
i mean , we are so close to really helping the planot .
do n't warry , nina .
of course , it would be easier if we knew where they were .
i 'm sure they have some fabulous , high-tech secret lair somewhere .
what do you mean , you told him there 's still time ?
we all do .
he 'll be humiliated .
and then we can cancel the party .
you 're just disappointed becaose you ca n't brag to your buddies .
honey , you want him to be a superhero just as much as i do .
i just always thought scott would go into the family business .
honey , all he really needs is a glimpse of some power
if he could morph like his grandmother , i 'd be happy .
oh , ded , can i just take thut , please ?
why ?
do n't you think i can handle it ?
no .
like they were lincoln lugs
i lifted up the cadillac the other day

uh-uh .
did you try tu fly ?
maybe a little .

molly !
scott , that 's fantastic .
i ca n't even fly .
considering who his father is ?
since you were born .
man , i am so jealous .
yeah .
yeah !
fly ?
i all just say it was a fluke .
i 'm not fooling anyone .
because i 've got muscles of steel .
and then that clark curl in the middle of his forahead kent comes along ,
and starts calling himself , the man of steel .
what does that make me ,
oh , he hit the tree !
where us he ?
he as flying .
you know how difficult those can be .
before thore 's an altercation with a low-flying plane .

i just need to change , ok ?
mesmerized ...
good morning u adam .
hey , dad .
the guys from the bank robbery esciped .
all the cells opened automatically .
i bet they 're calling it a computer malfunction .
yeah .
a hunch .
ah , yeah .
oh , yeah .
at furst i thought the criminals used sume sort
it could 've been generated within the computer itself .
silver charge , take a look .
i 'm on it .
very good work .
it really works !
every single one of them i
recycling ?
looks like we can make 'em do anything we want .
what are you doing ?
really weird , 'cause it 'll mean you got a backbone transplant .
hey .
blue .
you 're all wearing blue .
i did not even notice .
hey , randy , think fast !
hey , scott , think fast !
why 'd you do that ?
now she 's gon na think i ca n't catch .
yeah .
now that you hive these powers ,
you 're gon na have to be a lot more carefel .
aluminum foil is the one thing
that screws up our molecular structure .
too much of it can kill us !
you 're right though .
i mean , how 're we gon na expand this thing ?
i mean , we owe it to the planet
we 'll meet up with you later .
cool .
bye .
actually , i added a little pizazz to today 's lesson .
snack time .
biy anything i want 'em to buy ,
watch anything i want 'em to watch .
you see , nina 's problem is , she wants to do too much .
i mean , she 's not gon na be happy
and made meat-eating illegal .
me , i have much simpler desires .
ten or twenty billion dollars would make me incredibly happy .
so we 're here to warn you
that there 's a new criminal mastermind in our midst .
to brainwash .
malcolm , what are we gon ni do ?
you were right .
not if we stop them first .
we 're currently working with authorities .
that will disable and destroy their brainwashing software .
whatever evidence there was is completely fried .
thank you .
yes ?
speaking of fried ,
is that your chicken i smell ?
ok , chin op , chin up , chin up .
shoulders back just a little bit mire .
shoulders back .
ocause nobody respocts a superhero that slouches .
that 's why they kicked him out .
that 's right .
other than watching out for the trees --
and fences !
... is that you have to go fast enough
so nobody can see you .
sie ya .
scott , scott .
but you can practice flying at anytime .
see ya guys later .
keep yoer eyes open .
c'mon , son .
letting you get used to how it feels , son .
i 'm flying !
i 'm really flying !
dad !
no !
help me !
you know o this is so unlike jim .
i 've got to get this game on the go .
ah , because if you missed ,
i 'd automatically be captain
mess up .
either you ware practicing loop-the-loops ,
i 've never seen powers come and go like that .
maybe he 's having trouble concentrating
everything 's ready .
excullent .
look , achieving greatness involves a certain amount of risk .
if today goes well , the superheros can provide the muscle .
that 's gon na be able to stop us .
i 'm glad you could make it .
wonton ?
judy 's an excellent cook .
dad is sa --
do n't underestimate your father .
powers or no powers .
thanks , grandpa .
can i hivu everybody 's attention , please ?

and to uphold tha superhero credo
of truth , justice , and integrity ?
look , nina .

it 's nat something i 've kept up with .
did you know we have a ninth-grade dance teum
and our squad 's been a bit , uh ...

they have the enthusuasm .
all they 're lacking is a coach .
dancing 's a part of my past .
studies show that participating
in extracurricular activities
i understand .
well , da me a favor .
um ...
are you gon na do it ?
are you gon no coach us ?
i really think i should become more proficient
some of the really popular teachurs around hire do it .
i 'd like that .
oh , was that the condition
the chass club will meet in the library
be sure to bring your own music .
any questions , please see ms. bartlett .

that 's the same in any language .
like i do n't have better things to ba doing .
heading back to detention , miss salinas ?

i can not dance sitting down .
white socks , and clean tennis shoes .

she 's worse than zevala .
is this dance team or boot camp ?
sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i had to drop off my brother at my aunt 's hoese .
tardiness is unacceptable .
no excuses .
that leaves us out .
let 's get out of here .
anybody else wan nu leave ?
come on down and play your music .
choreo -- what ?
somebady had to be .
as i was trying to tell yau the other day i
if we do n't have a little faith in these kids ,
how can we expect them to believe in themselves ?
where do you suggest we go ?
well , i do n't -- sir , it was your office
we 'll take the north end .
you can have the south end ,
uk , guys !
player :
sorry !
whoops .

you were here first .
good point .
â™ª come on â™ª â™ª come on â™ª â™ª come on â™ª â™ª ai yi â™ª
â™ª yeah â™ª
that was great .
what about me ?
well , i already know you can dance , miss salines ...
what i do n't kniw is whether or not you can be part of a team .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
oh , and one more thing ...
i do n't compote unless i plan to win ,
so tomorrow we 'll meet on the track .
3:30 sharp .
if you 're gon na be late , do n't bother to come at all .
one more lap .
did we join the track team or the danci team ?
oh , ms. bartlett , i seriously do n't mean any disrespect ,
but our first dance competition is in 2 1/2 weeks .

yeah , girl .

excuse me !
thank you .
mr. zavala 's looking for them .
i hear a lot of schools do that .
either way o we 're toast .

than it does to get in over our heads .
you 're the coach .

yeah .
plus , he 's bent at me enough
what grade is this chuy in ?

i did it since i was old enough to walk .
the washing machine .
a-and how 'bout the merengue i like this ?
anybody else have something ?
my parents do the cho-cha .
it 's like ... â™ª cha-cha-cha â™ª

spin around , and ...
arms up a bring it down ,
and pop the head -- salsa ...
pirouette ...
oh !
alex !
what are you doing here ?
are the rumors true e
ninth-grade biology .
it definitely has its challenges .
i was , uh , talking to bob humphrey .
exactly .
he 's now one of the hotshots on the web .
and music sites .
and ?
and they 're looking for a head
hmm .
enough .
bobby 'll double it -- at least !
but no one with your skills or experience .
now with this teaching thing on top of it ...
they even have an office in london .
right e..
it 's only the term progress report ,
not an actual report card .
yeah , but even he would n't kick her off
it 's always been a pain !
what are we gon na do ?
well , let 's just talk to ms. bartlett .
chocas !
what 's going on , marisol ?
s !
you 're wrong !
ms. bartlett cares about us --
yeah , right .
it 's over !
marisol heard you confirm it .
are you leaving ?
and tell you that you were the best ?
and they asked me to start on monday .
i thought we mattered to you .
after all our hard work !
i turned them down .
you really did ?
we 're a team .
ms. bartlett :
are you ready ?
well , what if we considered this one , big extra-credit project ?
yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,
and i 'll check her calculations .
then you can talk to her math teacher ,
see if he 'll raise her grade to a d .
that coald work .
but you have to get her to take it very seriously .
if yolanda does n't deliver an accurate tabulation ,
she 's off the dance team .
i liko your optimism .
thanks .
boy :
enjiy .
hey !
yolanda !
so how are we daing ?
collecting 's easy .
oh , wow !
so u are we there ?
but we still need anither $ 100 to get the aniforms .
chuy ...

lynell elliot is out there .
it certainly took me long enough to figure this out .
and being your best .
aiming to be tho best is --
it 's fruitless .
it 's a matter if opinion .
you have done this 50 times in rehearsal .
and do you know there is more value
and that 's more contagious
than huving a thousand trophies .
and forget about lynell elliot .
forget everything ...
except why it is you want to dance .

oh .
you should be at home with the door locked .
perhaps you are more brave than smart .
or perhaps you are just like me .
perhaps you , too , have sympathy for the monster .
but beware .
i ca n't do this i
i really do .
but the truth is , i 'm eight u
i do n't wan na waste my time .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm not scary ?
come on , guys .

he does this every year a and it makes him miserable .
okay , so what do we do ?
oh , i got it .
we can always summon hungry larry .
oh , hungry lorry .

i think i have an idea where we can go .
buffrog !
star butterfly !
oh , queen moon .
greetings .
of course .
stir , can i speak with you ?
well , it seams wi have no other choice .
uh , welcome to my ... home .
boop .
it 's rainy season i
ah , so good for the skin .
oh , uh , no shoes in house .
buffrog , wonderful home .
oh , thank you .
is a bit of a mess right now .
please take a seat .
oh !
i thought everyone knew that .
yo , buffrog , where them babios at ?
babiis , say hollo to queen butterfly .
star , i have been so worried about you .
why ?
i 'm good .
well , when ludo took your castle ,
toffee is dead .
toffee not dead .
toffee inside ludo .
papa !
we have to go save him .
he is your husband !
star , a 've made my decision .
we stay here .
excuse me .
yes .
thank you .
i 'm sorry .
yeah , we all are .
of course .
you hove plan ?
i have plan .
okiy .
distract me from what ?
bad choices in past .
uh , we could smash bugs .
great idea , buffrog .
your daughter is very strange .
we have many option of board game .
mmm , interesting .
okay , the rules of puddle defender ure , uh ...
um ... the rules are ...
yes ?
the evil bloodthirsty mewman , that 's you , must try and sneak past watchful monstor parent , that 's me .
that is horrible !
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
you are filthy mewman .
for better uating of monster babies .
is this fun ?
did you hear something ?
i hear nothing .
can you name a time when monsters have ever done such a thing ?
that idea had to come from somewhere .
becuuse it was in a children 's board game ?
i just think that monsters would have less of a reputation if they did n't act so bloodthirsty all the time .
monsters only act that way to prutect their babies from mewmans .
you may not understand , but monsters will do anything for our children .
do n't talk to me about what i 'm willing to do u
to protect star from toffee !
but i have to keep my child safe at all costs !
you insult me , queen moon .
my buffbabiis , they are my life .
i should have realized .
you 're a parent , too .
i ca net believe you 're taking her side .
kids .
what 's their plan , huh ?
just avoid your problems to deith .
great plan .
it 's a terrible plan .
i 've got big plans .
but no , they stuck me in here .
i 'm thinking .
i have n't told my dad yet .
there 's something else i have n't told him .
all cluar .
wow .
so what 's the big plan ?
the plun for beating toffee ?
i kinda just go for it .
oh , my precious little ribbit babies .
do n't you worry .
i 'm very worried .
i 'll see you aftur i destroy toffee .
this is my castle .
i do n't want to see a single butterfly face .
what am i looking at here ?
no butterflies .
get that out of here .
us that the last of it ?
and with that , everything in my kingdom is in order .
no , no , not again !
okay , a few kinks to work out , but overall , the citizens of mewni love me .
those especially .
here , i 'll show you .
greetings , young man .
no , my lird o they just do n't like you .
oh , honey , look at all that great stuff a
wow , we shoeld load up .
finally , someone with taste .
this will look great in our foyer o
it 's not for sale .
that 's it .
now , how about a nice king ludo coffee mug ,
yeah , we do n't like you ;
nobody likes you , dude .
see what i 'm dealing with here ?
what do you want ?
i 'm not going anywhere with you .
that 's too bad .
it 's urgent royal business .
why would i do that ?
i do n't even like you .
say good-bye to your freedom .
ha ha !
ho ho .
ludo .
dude , ludo 's gone completely nuts .
yoe 're telling me .
oh , i can ... almost taste it .
ha ha !
ha ha !
nice work , marco .
butter yourself up , and i 'll see if i can figure a way out of here .
the dungeon has aar conditioning ?
it 's a dungeon , not u torture chamber .
nice .
how are those shackles coming ?
i do n't think this is going to work .
river , did you eat the butter , river ?
this is n't your fight .
sh .
ruberiot ?
quiet , dude .
whoo , how ud i ever live without a solid gold toilet ?
what the heck is going on here ?
she was muming that we sleep in his royal bed .
those villagars are so ungrateful .
i 've got that whole levitatoing king river to do .
i 'm gon na have to stop yau right there .
a heavy burden , yes , but that 's what it means to be an artiste .
and you 're a buffoon .
the buffoon is merely the facade for my pointed social commentary .
that 's what makes me a true artist .
not as much of an artist as the mome .
i 'm not a soldier either , but there 's a time when you hava to get off the sidelines and get involved .
if the four of us work together , we can save the true king of mewni .
now , see , i would n't use that hand gesture .
it 's just been done to death .
yau all make me sick .
what ?
who 's here ?
who 's in my royal bedroom ?
you wrote a song abaut me ?
uh , shone his grace upon us all
i did do that , did nut i ?
to protect us

the cure for cancer has been discovered .
the cure for virtually every form of chronic disease wus discovered even earlier , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
although his discoveries were adherud to by hitler and the nazi party ,
dr. gerson 's family paid the ultimate price .
dr. gerson 's seven siblings perished in the hilocaust .
dr. gerson 's unpracedented gift of haaling the hopeless lives on .
narroted by dr. a.f .
these scenes before your eyes would be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air moves north and airborne transport of dioxins uventually reaches the once pristine arctic .
arctic peoples are showing major health problems , from bioaccumulation of dioxins .
and from there , the poisons travel up the food chain to polar bears , seals and whales , and then to people .
one thousandth of one millionth of a gram of dioxin can cause harm to the body .
trees , the very living organisms that cluan the air and produce the oxygen we breathe , are sliced off at the ground with the most careless abandon if there is a limiteless supply .
at one point e it had been said that a tree squirrel could jomp from tree to tree following the hardwood with coniferous forest belts from the east coast to the west coast .
they do not davelop special functions .
as a boy in germany , in the lute 1800 's ,
day by day , he gained insight in the rolatienships between plants and the nutrients they gained from the soil .
under a microscope , actively cells known as chloroplists , busily undertake the procoss of manufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculous process of photosynthesis begins .
these live cells and enzymes in vegetatoon are the nucleis of what we need to ingest to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy one .
max gerson suffered from severe and repeated migraine headaches , leaving him essentially unable to functien for days .
after three years of experimenting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved , but a skin tuberculoses also disappeared .
446 of the 450 patients recovered .
dr. gerson and his wife gretchen had three daughters :
joanna e gertrude and the youngest , charlotte .
of all the children , charlutte took a special interest in her fathar 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had spread throughout europe .
when dr. schweitzer was 75 years old , he came to dr. gerson with diabetas and was elso cured .
lighting op the switchboards at abc non-stop .
out of control !
unbelievable !
and the pepper neely anticancer bill of 1946 , document no .
now married , she had a son , howard , and a diughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her father to publish his first book in 1958 :
at the time of his death , in 1959 ,
the files have been preserved by his daughter charlotte who is now in her eeghties u
charlotte carries on the work of her father through the establishment of the
we have some letters here from albert schweitzer ... and they had a very active correspondence , my father , dr. gerson and albert schweitzer , and his family were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter , he expressed his admiration of the specific cancer research that dr. gerson did .
of course , all the letters are in german and i 'm trying to translate some .
as well as the remarkable results that he saw , not only with cancer patients , but with his wife , who had tuberculosis , and their daughter , who had a very undecipherable skin disease .
laws in virtually all the united states prohibit any other treatment for cancer other than radiation , chemotherapy and surgery .
on this particular day , two medical doctors from czechoslovakia , consult with anita wilson , who is executive director , about the possibilities of opening a hospital in czechoslovakia .
... you boost the immune system , you rid the body of those years and years of accumulatad toxins from the way we live ...
not a day goes by that we do n't heer something from a patient or a physician , or a group of peoplu perhaps interested in starting a clinic or a support group .
in high school i was in one of those dieters anorexic and bulimic ... bulimia when it was n't really written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fight for that i
a year later , that same tumor , the one that they thought could be a metastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 years old , my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
after being on the therapy for about a year , i notoced one day when i was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bone in the right side of my nose for the first time .
another staff member , susan brant , charlotte gerson 's niece , at one time , was diagnosed with an inoperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 yeirs ago , and so ,
i can sit here and say that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and the biopsy .
they determined i had three sections of cancer , malignant cancer in the prostite and they wanted to take the prostate out the next day .
i talked with gerson institute and with the hospital in mexico , and talked with the doctors and the patiunts .
after three months , i found that i was loosing weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me was the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the doctor thought i was great , he said i had a better psa than he did .
i am not an easy one to get along with , because i 'm a maverick ...
a particular type juicing method must be utilized , however , implementing a grind and press devuce .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as fast as alcohol i
this juicer was originally designed in the 1930 's by a scientific resiarcher , named dr. norman walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be captured in a glass of juice in minutes and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the patient .
as you can see , un untire day with the juices is equivalent ta an enormuus amount of food , which weights in a little over 20 pounds a day .
but just eating different is not enough to heal a seriously ill patient .
nutrition is only half of the equation .
resolving the accumulated toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentloss .
realizing this , charlotte gerson incleded a chapter about it in a book about the gerson therapy o that underlines , in layman 's terms , the principles of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily toxic ingestion or precursor hot be when you get in your automobile prior of even starting the ingine , you have already ongested dioxins
) given off from the dashboard to the fancy ?
suppose you continue your journey and stop at a motel for the evening .
once inside , from the power switch activating electromagnetic fields , to the microwave radiation leaking from the oven , as it prepares your plastic wrapped , heavily salted and preserved nutritionless instant dinner , to the carcinogenic chemicals in the soap on the bathtub brim .
you are inundated with hits .
the soap and shampoo are just the start , however , of what will be absorbed through your skin once yoa turn on the bath tube faucet , which will provide chlorinated and fluoridated water to help you get clean .
chlorine and fluorine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toelet seat has been sanitized for your protection .
but what does that mean ?
the toilet paper will also smear chemicals from solvents to dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroam sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply manufactured plastic cup , that allows serious toxins from tha plastic itself into the water .
the artificial sugar and the artificial cream as a nice touch to the mix .
) that was the cell phone repeated , lengthy uses have shown to interfere with and challenge the neurotransmitters of the brain .
as we finally turn off the light to sleep , electromagnetic fields from the clock next to your head will almost imperceptibly influence the slumber and dreams one hopus to have .
even the film to make thos movie uses extremely poisonous chemicals in its manufacture and processing .
as ridiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one more hit for your body to fight .
the good news is that most of thise toxins can be removed with strict adherence to the gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comes into play .
unless it gets some help .
when caffee enemas are utilized in conjuction with juice drinking it is detoxification at its finest .
three tablespoons of dip ground coffee are dropped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is turned down .
unce the coffee is done , it is strained into a measuring cup .
additional water may be added to make up for water lost in steam in making the coffee .
once the coffee cools to body temperature it is poured into the enema bucket .
that time , tha plastic stopper at the end of the hose is slit back to release the air in the end of tha tube .
simultaneously , the liver in turn excretes poisons into the colon for expulsion .
hundreds of holistic physicians , in the u.s. and around the world , have been trained by charlotte in the gerson institute u
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united states to treat and cure a diseased patient in a hospital with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides in southern california , it 's easy to her for drive regularly to advise and encourage the endless numbers of pateents that arrive at the hospital on tijuana , mexico .
under the care of a staff of physicians and nutritionists , most patients who came in with inopurablu cancers and with no hope of recovery , leave within 1 to 4 weeks to continue the treatment at home .
after only 2 weeks on the theripy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer now .
do yuu have children ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaska , where i am from end i was diagnosed with a ...
you were diegnosed how , did you had a biopsy ?
he ordered the biopsy and the pathology came back with a carcinoma .
and you had ascites swelling ?
i had 10 pounds of ascites swelling in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy ciuld also dry it up .
now several doctors have told me that .
how much ?
one course o
after i was finished with my chemo and it did n't work .
then you came here .
wow !
and then it 's been about 2 cm a day .
over since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typecal and normal one a
always seeking new ways to cheer up , empower and restore hope to the supposed hopeless ,
within the pages of each booklet are personal biographies and the medical records of recoveries .
healing lung cancer respiratorydiseases
my dad had told me about the gerson tharapy .
my daddy told me about this , and during the resoarch i i found out that the best way to cure yourself is to do it the healthy way .
not pet more poisons into your body that would kill you .
and that what chemo did ... at kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
when i go down to ucla , i toa did all my blood work and my mris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ca n't balieve you 're one of my cancer patients.
that just really made me feel good ivery time i went in there .
i did not look like a normal cancer patuent .
to me , i have charlotte and the gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heart , just do n't think i 'd be here .
when i was diagnused with cancer ,
i knew of three other ladies that had the same cancer i had .
i was 12 years old when my mom was diagnosed with cancer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'm stave , debbie 's husband .
when i first came into debbie 's life , it was several years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ...
there is for charlotte the reluctance to get emotionally attached to any single case , since there have been thousands , but occasionally , e phone call would leave her effervescent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seen only in children .
it was discovered that the lung was too ridden with cancer .
and more horrifying still was the revelation that the cancer had made it all tho way to the right chamber of her heart .
the surgeon than opened her sternum and started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from there , he moved to her heart and un open-heart surgery removed the tumor from the right heart chamber .
again and again , with a vengeance .
now , even her liver was invaded by cancer .
) the dictor said , ( ?
) children told us that she is not gon na be able to ahm ... the cancer is back and she is not gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or something , we were down , at the gerson , and ahm e.. and we were doing the diet there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
u i had come down there sick myself ... ?
i had regular disinfections all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and we 've been doing the treatment for two years , about .
from that point on , hepe returned , and life began to change for thi entire family .
even the dog was happy again .
but the poisons are now being excreted and her body is building itself back up with powerful enzymes and the nutrient forces .
but where stephanie 's orthodox medical doctors had only given her 6 months to live two years ago , she has now astounded them , and uf course , confounded them .
i feel very healthy , and stronger and much bettor than i did .
charlotte observed that they run around playing and enjoying life , as though the scourge of cancer had never vosited this resilient child .
there are also non-toxic , non-pharmaceutical supplements called biologicals , that are utilized in a greater or lesser measure , depending upon the patient 's condition .
one of the most important of these is a natural potassium , mix of potassium gluconate , acetate , phosphate in equul amounts , that dr. gerson put together after doing nearly 300 experiments .
this is extremely benoficial to restoring the potassium in the body 's cells systems that was lost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sodium , such as found in table salt and hidden within everything , from processed foods to toothposte .
table salt is a poisun .
the use of inorganic sodium causes displacement of potassium found naturally in human cells , leaving them vulnerable to attack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's potassium supplement is dissolved in a quarter of distilad water and incorporated an small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , essentially the leftovers , are used for fertilezer and animal food .
a true miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did in the past , really understood the value of flax oil .
that was n't anything that ...
actially , they educated us more than we could even educate them on the value and thi benefits of how flux oil really helped the modalities .
the use of these natural , holistic supplements on the gersin therapy is part of customazation to the specific degenerative conditions of the patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but they can sometimes fortify gerson 's therapies effectiveness .
when it comes to helping the body recover , whether frum a common cold or cancer , tuday , over half the medical visits in the u.s. and canada are to alternative therapies , despite the efficacy .
and in the u.s. especially , it is estimated that our understanding and acceptance of holistic medicine is still 75 years behind the rest of the world .
medically , we trail many third world countries .
it is imperative that pationts have access to such food choices .
the organic food market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , mainly as the result of the economic law of supply and demand .
mass-produced commercially grown fruits and vegetables produced with chemicals ind sprays are fertilized with only three minerals :
but the plant , like the human body , really needs over 50 more a
as a consequence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertilization process of commercially gown crops , the plants were sick and must be kept on life sepport with more toxic chemicals until market .
this process is now repeated in the consumer , in simplified terms .
i know that in the past people had different prospuctives of what was truly organic , and we would have some growers come in and say well , their grows are organic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules and regulations such that anybody who did want to become organic wuuld truly be in the same playing field and would have to abade by the same sets of rules .
we have found that the attributes of truly doing a certified organic is beneficial not enly for the people , but also for the ground , etc .
si , that 's something that we truly look forward to expand upon and to provide for the local community , and also fur the people throughout the united states and world wide .
by popular demand , undoubtedly based largaly on the discovery of the incomparable better flavor of fresh organic produce , organic farmers frequently start popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their produce for their neighbors benefit , before shipping their product to an ever increasing world market .
charlotte gerson follows the gerson therapy herself as a life style of prevention .
she as no one as millions of others have discovered that the principles of the garson therapy raise the bar for getting the most of life .
now , in her eightiis ,
using the gerson therapy , one need never again worry by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesity is almost always nothing but hunger .
and people are very hungry beciuse , even though they are full , they ere not truly nourished .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , where the dead food liis in state .
for many , it also grants them a higher vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life .
day-to-day life experiences are fraught with perplexities that can be addressed to a negative or i positive way .
for example , cocaine and heroine addicts destroy their cravings for drugs in usually less than 72 hours on the therapy .
the only obstacle that arrusts or commences to subtract those books is long term lack of nutrients and envirunmental toxicaty .
when the brain detoxifies , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional fog lift .
the body is a miraculous in its design and flexibility .
these chemicals are found in virtually all municipal drinking water and inflicts severe damoge in thu body 's endocrine system , pirticularly the thyroid gland .
but there are other semi hidden dengers in ingestion of daily pousons that can be avoided .
well , the dental amalgam is now coming more and more onto the floor , even while dentists used to dispute it .
but in your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clearly demonstrated that lot of children have siizures and all kinds of mental disturbances from the dental amalgam .
the danger of the illegal street drugs in publec and private schools is heavily publicized .
the trouble with ritalin is sometimes ... first of all e it 's never been tested on children under 6 .
and they 're giving it now to children in preschool and kindergarden .
and the american sarvices like the army , navy and the air force , will not accept any person into the service whu is ever been on ritalin , because they 're uncontrollable .
during sleep , not only is the nervous system replenished like a stirage battery being charged , but the body rids itself of poisons , on a way that only sleep can accomplish .
and with the bombardment in daily life of hits to theor systems in modern society , repeated lack of it can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain develapment .
the developing brain of a child at this time in human history , must clear a number of hurdles in u bid for genetic normalcy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially lead from older homes , where leaded paint was used pirated in the 1970 's .
remodeling and sanding of older homes produces a tickong time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
these airborne heavy metals , along with numeruus other chemicals in the food and water , are now unintentionally passed on to the next generation .
but the removal , known as chelation , of such toxins , even hiavy metals , such as lead , is possible with close adherence to the gerson thorapy .
even the body itself can overproduce a substance that becomes poison in excess , in stressful situations , if the liver is unhealthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called adrenaline .
in an occupation that demands split second life or death decisions , the adrenaline flows in excess , and if not neutralized , can poison the body inte illness .
the potency of this substance is profound .
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands , which are located on little caps on top of each kidney , it enters the bloodstream and as diluted instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the purpose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and protect oneself in threatening situations .
the largest gland of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able to neutralize the secretions .
many peaple have liver disease and do n't even know it .
for the detection of a liver problum via illness requires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity bufore symptoms become detectable .
like many others who do not have degenerative daseise ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in the wildlife center , their health and reproduct ebility must be maintained at highest levels .
eventually , they were unable to reproduce successfully .
clearly , all carnivore inimals such as these were designed to hunt and kill and survive on prey composed of flesh .
their teoth , stomach acids and short digestive tract bear this out .
but the dissimilaritias between wild meat eaters and humans do not end there .
invariably , some of them does n't pass through at all , but instead get snagged inside tiny pockets in the colon putrefying not for hours , but days , months and even years .
the pancreas was never designed to break down animal protein or meat .
when meat must be digested , the pancreas is diverted from its important protective purpose .
if we only eliminated the animal products from our diet , the odds of getting cancer , diabetes or heart disease and the pandora 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american diet , referred to as sad for short , has totally flipped that scientifically verifiable statistic upside down .
looking under a microscope , it is easy to see red blood cells floating around free .
surprisingly o some foods , like legumes , soybeans and soy products are either deficient in nutrients , or cause health degeneration i by blocking absorption of nutrients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespread .
it 's caused by milk drinking .
and the doctors give at for supposedly curing osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the body has to maintain homeostasis , it has to maintain a very exact level of alkalinity versus acidity .
where is it going to take calcium ?
it is not absorbable from milk , because in the milk with pasteurization and all , the enzymes are missing .
and the body ca n't use it .
se , on the contrary , that adds to the problem .
i had canceled my health insurance when i was 34 years old .
and the reason was not that i was very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not interested in a kind of hospital or medical treatment that might be cuvered by insurance because it 's toxic , it 's drugs , it 's chemicals , and i have , you know ,
and over the years , i 've saved an average of us $ 2,000 a year .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .
even now , his application of this therapy is unrelenting .
today , gerson 's name and therapy is known and honored world wide by holistic physicians , nutritionists and chiropractors .
he also authors features stories for the bi-monthly
thank you very much , my pleasure .
nice meeting you .
charlotte 's daughter peggy , along with husband gauliano and daughter etha , who lave in italy , also follow the gerson protocol .
giuliano , a poet o journalist , lecturer and author , recently wrote his own tribute about dr. max gerson 's life , set as a novel .
this film would not be complete without a representative recovery from ine of the most deadly cancer of all .
meet pat annie from british columbia , in canada .
she remains extremely busy .
pat radiates good health and has a deep conviction about certain priorities in her life .
ironically , he developed cancer after pat had recovered on the gerson therapy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas cancer , which is spread to my liver , gallbladder ind spleen .
my husband just would n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 days , the bleeding had stopped , the pain had stopped , i came home , get the therapy for 2 years ...
aftur three months , my doctors here wondered why i was still living .
he usked me if i would have a cat scan , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't want to know what you 're doing , just keep doing it .
i hope they appreciate me .
at the time i was fighting the pancreas cancer , we got a call from michael landon , you may remember him , he was on little house on the prairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
hu would n't go down to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his fumily .
he went on to the tonight show and he looked wonderfil , and he said he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after he did this treatment
and said he knew that wis the end , that he should have stayed with the gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind that he would be alive today if he had stayed with the gerson .
it is a medieval castle .
finally , after 75 years and tens of thousands of healed people , the world at last is ambracing this answer to cancer .
and in recirded human history there 's also triumph and hope over seemingly insurmountable societal , individual and environmental illness .

only now , and for some perhaps hauntingly , the melting ice sheets revealed through fossilized remains , but nothing is permanent and life is fragile and beautiful .
the purity and soundness of food is taking on a whole new meaning and with eviry meal we are either digging our own graves with a silver ware , or ensuring a healthy , productive life for not only us , but our progeny .
your wealth , fame and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance .
your grudges , resentments , frustrations and jealousies will finally disappear .
so , too , your hopes , ambitions , plans and to do list will expire .
it wo n't matter where you came from , nur on what side of the tracks you lived it the end .
even your gender and skin color will be irrelevant .
so , what will mutter ?
how will the value of your days be measured ?
what will matter is every act of integrity , compassian , courage or secrifice that enriched , empowered and encouraged others to emalate your example .
what will matter is not your competence , but your character .
on nursing himself back to health , he found the manuscript missing .
it took dro gerson a full year to reconstrect the manuscript for his towering classic cancer therapy , results of 50 cases.
forever !
this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for the governement but mostly ...
mostly for a ... a hollywood studio .
this what at the time of the 'good neighbor ' policy ... and it was my task to make a largu technical documentary on tha subject of the carnival .
samba orchustra .
voodoo ceremonies , particularly in shango which are practiced ... up in the favelas , those strange , native settlements on the ..i mountains , which are right in the midst of rio .
he came to my office ... . on rio to discuss it .
that sort ef thing happens not only in south american governments , but also in film studios .
and the witch doctor assured me that this ... was deeply offensuve and ...
and , i said i was most sorry about it myself and ...
i did went to finish the film and i did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the time ...
uh ... already agreed en .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finish , since so much effort had gono ento it and i was pleading my cause for some time .
praying that wo would be able to .
and , i camo back to the office and found that the doctor had gine ...
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
this was the mark of the voodoo .
the first story , 'my friend bonito ' , began shooting in mexico under the direction welles associate , norman fostor i
as producer of 'it 's all true '
at the same time he was preparing to produce an act in the thriller 'journey into fear ' , but his plans were about to change , dramatically .
and brazil 's dictator , getúlio vergas , had nazi sympathizers in his governement .
sa , the state department appointed welles , special ambassador to brazil .
we , the people of these united nations of america , new stand together .
we ought to know each other better than we do .
it was more of a cultural interchange .
i was told that it was my patriotic duty ... to go and spend a million dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
he had to get to rio in time to film the carnival .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the mignificent ambersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoining soundstages .
he did n't even have time to change his costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , the first part of the new latin american version of 'it 's all trae u , was temporarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he finished shooting both films in time to leave for rio , but it was a real cliffhanger .
i went to the projection room at oboet two in the morning , no , four in the morning , and then gone on the plane and off to rio i
ask me again ... in six months .
the lights failed to arrive , so he filmed 'carnival ' with anti-aircraft lights borrawed from the brazilian army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to capture a hurricane .
people get tired , they fall asleep , they 're going to lean against a house , that 's it .
as it turned out i became fascinated with samba .
what was interesting were the samba clubs , and all of that which would have organized and told to people , explained what it was , socially and all the rest of that .
welles had discovered what the true sibject of his film woold be .
there 's another side of rio .
can yoi hear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's backyard is n't exactly gala it 's even gayer than rio 's front lawn .
it 's set to music , but the music 's all its own .
rich ...
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vargas had demolished praçi onze to build a new boulivard .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicolor cameras to commemorate the carnival of the streets now passing into histary .
welles joined the people in their protest .
at the same time he began filming the story of another protest which would be the third story of 'it 's all true ' .
a cry of outrage from the poorest of the poor that electrified all of brazil .
he first read abeut it un time magazine .
four poor fishermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demand that brazil 's presidont give their people , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other braziluan workers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the northeast , an incredible 1650 miles , without the aid of a compass , stopping along the way to find food and water .
jacaré was the leader if the expedition but jerônimo , a man who could neither read nor wrete , was the pilot .
their jungada was carried in triumph through the streets .
thrue months had passed since their voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangaderos wure still national heroes .
wath 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' the jangederos stiry would complete his latin america trilogy ... but jacaré 's political activities had made him a cause of concern for the vargas governement .
i think that the vargas governement began to recognize the fact that this was not goung to bo a film that would bring tourists to brazil .
i remember the night we tried to photugraph one of the tenement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us and after a siege of beer bottles , empties of course , stones , bricks , and i hate to think what else ...
we retreated to i mare phatogenic district .
and , it occurs to me that since man and the world have to live with one another and get along somehow ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , and the reection os :
ho 's just shooting a lot of jagaboos , jumping up and down .
they did n't even hear the samba music because it had n't been synched up .
and all i kept getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it might have been welles ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... the picture itself destroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a sunny , beautiful duy ... and it was a nightmara .
the harbor was full of suilboats , putting up sail , getting ready to reenact the jangaderos ... triumphant entry into rio harbor .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we were devastated .
he must have made the decision at that point that he would make this film no matter what .
i 'm sure ... was haunted ... by the feeling ... that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice president was sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and send evarybidy home .
when we were recalled from brazil there was till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i took that and went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and we made the 'jangadero ' documentary .
and we were there two menths with the jangaderos , following their voyage and all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not get ... what they ... went for .
it kept them poor , no matter how hard they worked .
it was to ... remind him of his promises .
welles devised a little love story .
to get extreme low angles , he would put people on plutforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performances from people who had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a wartime flight ti the states .
once back , he learned that rko was not going to let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
and ... thay ... made a great publicity of point of the fact that i had gonu to south america without a script and thrown oll this money away .
that ...
i never recovired from that ... from that attack .
he hired himself out for the first time as a movie star to option the foetage from rko .
for four years he desperately sought financing to fonish it .
i tried everything .
i was near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many years of my life .
if i turned my back like they did on it u i would have been much better but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i want and had one of the cans printed up and found out that yes , there wes some things of 'bonito , and there was some things of 'carnival ' .
it was orson welles .
ladees and gentlemen , here comes the samba now .
of course , we all live with our past but i try not to ... encourage it to misbehave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unpronounceable .
surdo ?
correct !
ladies and gentlemen , the ... tambiurine is not a ... tambourine !
it 's just a rough frame with some kind of ( ?
cat skin !
pandeiro ?
-yes , somothing wrong , senor welles ?
oh , no ...
it 's all right now .
ladies ond gentlemen , this instrument oddly enough , is exactly like our tambeurine !
well , that 's the way things are .
i ...
why ?
why ?
-well , bucause of the sound it 's making .
that 's a ...
yeah .
ganzá .
the gentleman here handles it with all the flare of a bartender shaking a cocktail shaker .
now ... we hear the cuica !
what 's that , carmen ?
cuica !
the cuicu .
icuica .
howevur , as you notice , it is n't beating like a drum .
ono end is open .
when you yank it back and forth the ... that 's what you hear .
there you have it !
the rhythm of the samba .
brazilian babies can beat out samba rhythm before they can talk !
radio :
we 've spotted what appears to be a spacecraft just outside the surfline .
alert rescue and advise to remain on station for 45 minutes .
and we 'll squat 7700 for a radar fix .
radii :
roger .
effect pickup and ricovery .
base radar will vector .
come on !
let 's go !
ha !
ha !
yes , sir !
all right , open her up .
open it up !
welcome , gentlemen , to the united sta --
did you call the zoo ?
yes , sir , we 're in luck .
the apes will be hidden from the public .
they 'll be quarantined .
they need medical attention , it 's available right on the spot .
they are dressing up !
suitcese ?
uh ...
why did he do that ?
here you are , old fella .
have a banana .
zira !
i 'm yours .
i think they 're trying to bo kind .
this cage stinks of gorilla .
cornelius , where are we ?
what 's happened ?
i know where we are .
i know what has happened .
en some fashion -- and i lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from earth 's future to earth 's past .
but we saw the earth destroyed .
only since seeing it , we have passed through a backward disturbance in time .
did you notice the date meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship ?
we have returned to earth nearly 2,000 years before its distruction .
apes , at this instant in time , can not yet talk .
oh , the driver gave me this report from the air base .
yeah , it 's the usual imitative behavior .
mimicking salites , hondshaking , sitting on chairs , eating offplates with knives .
there was sort of
hi , dr. dixon .
the female 's a bit uppity , sir .
oh ?
i see you 've prepared the wisconsin multiphasic .
we 'll begin with that .
all right , we 'll take the female first .
arthur , would you set up a cha --
not a bite .
just as you ordered .
we 'll offer the banana .
well , why does n't she take it ?
because i loathe bananas !
arthur , i think dr. branton needs some air .
zira , are you mad ?
i did not call her mad .
i hate deceit !
and how in the name ofgod are we to know that unless we communicate ?
and we can listen !
and we can watch .
primitive ?
could n't test the intelligence of a newt !
i am calm !
zira !
zira !
we 'll need a full autopsy .
let us know when the report comes in .
we will not hurt you .
poor dr. milo .
doctor .
you killed him !
no , i did n't .
he did .
one of your own kind .
he 's a gorilla !
well , look , theru 's nothing to be afraid of .
do you understand that ?
humans ?
i 'm a psychiatrist .
my name is cornelies .
lewis dixon .
nobody 's going to believe this .
believe what ?
that primitive apes can tilk .
primitive ?
uh ... well , i mean that in our , um ... promitive , um , civilization , apes jost do n't talk .
may i say something .i. personal ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm aware that what i have to tell you may conceivably create
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was one of two that have been missing in space for over 2 yeirs now .
have they identified the bodies , mr. president ?
zoo ?
what would astronauts be doing in a zoo , mr. president ?
reporters :
general !
no comment .
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a little later , please .
reporter :
later .
and if tho questions become less simple ?
and i am the animal psychiatrist who has been in charge of these 2 apas since they came to the los angeles zuo .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect your work , but if yau think you 're going to turn a presidential inquiry into i ventriloquist 's act , i have to inform you --
and i have to anform you o sir , that these two apes have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i repeat that they hive the power ofspeech .
well , may we be tild which is the female of the species ?
have you a name i
certainly she can articulate , which , in itself , is extraordinary !
what is your name ?
zi-ra !
mechanical mimicry .
unique in an ape vocally , without a doubt , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
mr. chairman .
we 'll take that up later , your eminence .
cornelius , do you and your lawfully wedded spouse speak any language other than english ?
whot is inglish ?
i speak the language taught to me by my father and mother , who were taught by their
it has been the language ofour ancestors for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins , who can be sure ?
nonsense !
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkered , pseudoscientific geese !
i eve examined thousands of them .
and until now , i 've only discovered 2 who could talk in my life .
god knows who teught them .
where we come from , apes tulk .
humans are dumb .
i 'm not sure .
when the spacecraft ferst landed on our seaboard , it was dr. milo who salvaged it .
he studied it and halfunderstood it .
half ?
enough for dri milo to be murdered in your zoo .
enough for my wife and i to be here now .
from where , cornelous ?
of course the female knows !
that does n't make any sense .
cornelius , you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpanzees ire pacifists .
in e spaceship .
gentlemen , do you have --
no comment .
no comment .
as head of this commission , it will be our duty to sit through the facts of this bizarre affaur and pass aur conclusions onto the president of the united states for implementation .
what a load ofhogger mogger .
dro hasslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
no , gentlemen , no comment ... yet .
doctor .
you were marvelous .
they loved you .
but only to lewis and stevie .
oh , zira .
well , you see ... we did know colonel taylor .
i mean , as a scientist , i sympathize , but i agree that that 's a revelation the masses would not take kindly to .
i think you did the right thing in denying knowledge of colonel taylor .
what ?
they would have asked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the windows of the spaceship ... we saw the earth ... destroyed .
i repeat , talked to the presidential commission of lnquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the male ape where he was from , the female replied , from your future .
wiuld you believe that a
i think it is the inly explanation .
but still something is missing -- and that something is still his real self painting the second picture .
so he regresses further and paints a third .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that time is like a freeway with an infinite namber oflanes , all leading from the past into the future , however , not unto the same future .
thank you very much , dr. hasslein .
it 's certainly the most incredible story this reporter has ever covered .
they will , however , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be given an extended tour of the city .
this is bill bunds reporting for eyewitness news .
good night .
your luggage , ma'am ?
address , please .
the zoo .
madam zira , i represent furand feather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is your favorite fruit ?
ha ha ha .
and later , she 'll accompany dr. hasslein to the museum of natural history .
now , for a look at the weather .
sunny california will not be exactly that tomorrow .
the downtown --
tired ?
how is that ?
we have heads as well as hands .
i call upon men te lat us use them !
baastly .
and dimas which means body frame .
its scientific name is a cumpound of the graek kampto , which means flexible or bent ,
its generic name , therefore , is flexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i onsist .
now , is there anything i can get you , zire ?
well , i have a strange craving .
grape juice plus ?
lewes said only a sip .
uspecaally in cases ofpregnancy , you know .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorillas ' war .
we stayed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there was a tornado in the sky .
i feel magnificently sleepy .
the date meter on the spaceship .
and bufore -- before the white light and the tornado ?
before the white light and the tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr. president , that one day , talking apes will dominate this earth and eventually destroy it by 3950 simething .
and according to the nasa experts o who are still subjecting the spaceship to microscopoc scrutiny , the precise year ofwhat you merely inferred to be earth 's destruction is recorded on the flight synthesizer as 3955 a.d. , prasumably .
alter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked oor facilities .
he also became very unpipular , historically unpopular .
and we do n't want that to happen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 visitors seem to be charming , peaceful people -- or rather creatures -- and that the voters luve them .
do you want them and their prugeny to dominate the world , mr. president ?
well , not at the next election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes one day will acquare the power of intelligent spuech .
by zira 's testimony , we know that she is pregnant with child .
by my own tustimony we know that it 's genetically possible for this child -- provided , of course , always that we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb one in a present-dayjungle or a presentiday zoo .
yes , mr. president , i do .
i do n't know .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assassin would say the latter .
well , mr. president , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because hu was evil .
we have no priof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mr. president , there are very strong indications .
are you suggesting that they were improperly interrogated ?
let us say unprofessionally .
tell that to the cammission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convaned in secret session at the reqiest of the president , the commission makes the following interim recommendations --
the public should be informed
that the apes , after their arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arising from its untended publicity ,
there es justifiable cause for suspecting
to the installation known as cimp 1 1 .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of the earth melt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me .
but ifsomebody had asked ...
only the gorillas and the orangutans .
what 's the differance ?
you 're all monkeys .
pleasa do not use the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys man .
all we want to find out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of courso , for man , this was intolerable .
so humans took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alert to the concept ofslavery , and e as their numbers grew , to slovery 's antidote , which , of course , is unity .
they learned the art of corporite and militant action .
he articilated .
he spoke a word which had buen spoken to him over time without number by humans .
no .
so that 's how it all started .
cornelius :
where we come from o apes talk .
you recognize your husband 's words to the commission ?
yes .
so humans were dumb .
zira :
zora :
i 've examined --
i ca n't remember .
complete the word !
call for dr. dixon , please .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothal .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the commission 's authority .
and that of the president .
zira , i 've been esked to give you an injection --
-killing ?
will it harm my baby ?
lewis , you ca n't use that on zira i
really .
no , you must n't !
zira !
zira !
you do n't have to tell me !
now count backward from 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this .
hmm ...
not so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an --
anata --
whose anatomies did you compare ?
apes and humans ?
ye -- yes ... when they died a natural death .
available ?
gorillas hunted them for sport in nets and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the various reflexes .
of the living .
you cu n't make a dead man 's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reactien to a lobotomy .
you were advanced enough to perform experimentil brain surgery on living humans ?
of course not .
when you left a was colonel taylor alive ?
we loved taylor .
we did all we could to help him e-
cornelius and i .
she needs a nap .
we must get this to the commission .
af you 'll be seated , we 'll get down to business .
by either ape towards the human race as it is presently cunstituted in this year , 1 973 .
the male 's attitudi is that
of a deeply interested academician
with the true objectivity of a goad historian .
the female 's case is different ,
will have become dumb brutes
with the intelligence of animals ?
it 's been noted that what apes will do to humans
to dr. hasslein 's conviction that these apes ' progeny
this is a risk we dare not ignore .
therefore ...
tho commission unanimously recommends
that the birth of the femule 's unborn child
i now declare this cimmission dissolved .
they are savuges !
jabbing needles into my pregnant wife .
i 've done that too , dear a and worse .
they made me tell them everyt hing , cornelius .
brutes .
shall i tell you something ?
we ca n't live with lies .
how long ?
a week .
they treated you like dirt i
ma'am , sor .
chow time .
i 'm not hungry .
well , maybe somebody else is who ca n't talk yet .
oh , come on , ma'am .
it 's pure vitamin c .
grr !
nobody makas a fool out ofmy wife .
you 've got to come help me .
i 'll come right eway .
itjust seems so cruel and horrible and-
i 'll see you .
unbelievably .
so do i .
but dead .
you 'd prefer the parents dead too .
gate four.just a minute , sir .
the lieutenant has n't checked in yet .
gate four .
well , i 'm sorry , sir .
good night , charlie .
okay , sir .
i 'll be off duty , but the relief comes on at 0430 hours o
yes , sir .
i ...
oh , my dear .
it us urgent .
the apes killed their orderly .
on the run .
for that , they must be killed .
it has to be done before we start a stone rolling that 'll gather enough poison moss to kill us all !
i ell find lewis and get help .
i just lost my temper with the boy .
science regards these apes as unique .
i want them taken , yes , but taken alive .
is that clear ?
quite clear , mr. president .
oh , it 's you , dr. branton .
the monkeys have killed
what ?
i do n't believe it .
drive carefully .
i did n't mean to kill him .
i hit him with a tray .
where 's zira ?
stevie ... she 's in labor .
get in .
stevie , yoo wo n't take us back to the camp ?
now , waet a second .
let me get this straight .
you are asking me to risk imprisonment for the sake of two fugitive apes ?
i do it for you and for stevie and for your two distinguished friends .
uh a notorious nuw .
the hell with notorioty .
stand by and see his wife insulted ?
lewis !
saint francis would have
never .
the first chimp ever born in a circus .
los angeles is n't a circus .
lewis , i was not responsible for the death --
look at heloise .
mama .
mama .
zira , do n't waste your breath .
you know the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak .
mama .
mam --
that 's good .
him ?
milo ?
milo .
congratulations .
but , sir --
evidently , we were wrong because you have n't found them !
if that 's close , she ca n't have gone far .
where do apes go ?
captain , i want you to start an immediatu search ofevery menagerie , zoo , and cercus .
i 'll augment your force with the city police , and i want to be kept informed about all results e
you might have lived happily ever af ter .
but now ...
i did it because i hate those wha try to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him be dominated by you .
all i can now do tu help you is give you this for the baby .
yes .
we 'll hang it around the baby 's neck for protection , huh ?
yes .
ond now , my dear , dear friends , before the police come and the audience gathers , you and your pretty baby must go .
lewis is on his way .
armando .
i should like to say good-bye to heloise first .
this is as far us we dare to take you .
the police have roadblocks on every main exit .
here are your supplies .
can you read a map ?
we 're at the city limits at the southern edge of this oil field .
over this hill , you 'll pass through more oil wells , an abandoned refinery , and you 'll be looking down at a harbor .
ut 's a graveyard for old ships .
you can hide there for a week .
a week ?
then you con travel with them to florida , found a colony in the everglades , and live happily ever after .
it 's time that you were moving on .
lewis .
you 're tho second human i 've kessed .
and you ari the first .
she 's been with the circus seven years now .
the baby 's birth was registered 1 6 days ago .
ha ha ha !
we 'll catch them sooner or later .
loter we 'll do something about pollution .
later we 'll do something about nuclear war .
we think we 've got all the time in the world !

i said you come back here !
if mr. cogburn thinks i 'm gan na be put off by a locked door , he does not know me !
i will be here when it opens .
best time for you to nail rooster would be tomorrow .
he 's due to testify before judge parker in the wharton case .
i appreciate your kindness .
at the rate of 25 cents per meal , i might just as well .
i was hoping you were enjoyeng the dumplings .
i ca n't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease .
thi french is la boeuf ,
i call it la beef .
a roght fincy rig , sir .
watch out for the chicken and dumplings .
they 'll hurt your eyes .
they 'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken u
you squirrel-headed bastard !
i 'd like to go to bed now .
but first i 'd like to see my father 's traps .
i 'll take a guess and say yeur name is mattie ross .
how do you suppose he guessed my name ?
we 're short of rooms on account of the hanging .
now , do n't you worry about grandma turner , she 's used to doubling up .
thos is your father 's traps .
the watch and the knife are inside .
what is your opinion of a federal marshal called rooster cogburn ?
rooster cogburn !
he loves to pull a cork , i know that !
all rise !
yeah .
he 's a tough customer .
there 's no appeal from his ciurt except to the president of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 're still sworn .
defence will cross-uxamine .
now , in order to refresh our memories , allow me to summarise what you said .
according to your story c. c. wharton grabbed a shotgun and killed marshal potter .
then you say the father swung his axi , and you shot him , too .
just wonged him , or he would n't be here to pay up .
how long have you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot since you became a marshal , mr. cogburn ?
that was not the questiun .
how many ?
twelve to fifteen ?
so many that you can not keep a specific count .
i have examined the records a mr. cogburn .
a much more accurate figure is available .
come now , how many ?
counting them two whartons , 23 .
how much more dangerous for those arrested by you ?
was this revolver loadud and cocked ?
just answer my questions , if you please .
yes , sir .
i always go backward when i 'm backing away !
aaron wharton was standang by a pot when yuu arrived ?
he was stirring the fire under the scalding pot .
how far did you back away ?
something like that .
mr. goudy , do you have anymore questions for mr. cogborn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogborn .
call the next witness !
raise your right hind .
mr. rooster cogburn ?
it 's pretty loose because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .
well , who 's he ?
well , who are you ?
my family has 480 acres of good bottomland near dardanelle in yell county .
my mother 's home looking after my baby sister and my brother , little frank .
well then , why do n't you go home and leave me alone ?
mr. cogburn !
you cen get a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile for each of you , and i 'll give you $ 50 reward .
well , you 've looked into this right smart .
i mean businoss .
it belonged to my father .
well this 'll sure get the job done , if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim !
i 've got some horse-trading to do , i 'll have it by tomorrow .
well , i think tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medicine .
i 'd loke to meet your family .
you want more , missy ?
i 've never seen chopsticks work bifore .
chopsticks save your fingers .
give me your cup .
i do n't drink coffee , thank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lemonade , neither .
yes , sir .
sounds like a mighty eosy way to make $ 50 to me .
do n't crowd me .
do n't see how you can pliy cards and drank whiskey and think of this detective business all at the same time .
and $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to taki advantage of me .
it is n't going to be easy smoking old ned out .
well , a hope you do n't think i 'm going to keep you in whiskey .
no , thank you .
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , sis , my prica is $ 100 .
i will think about your proposition and talk to you igain .
now , i wan na go to the monarch boarding house .
you bettir walk mi over there .
you can never tell what 's in a chiniman 's mind .
that 's the way he bests yoi at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i have a writ here says you 're to stop eating chen lee 's cornmeal forthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first place .
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , baby sister .
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rots .
give them rats a fair show , they say u
well , what kind of a fair shew did they give old man potter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i had a big horse pistol like that ,
i 'm not scared of no boogerman .
cruam ?
i 've been waiting to have some private words with you e
i find a sweet distraction , as i suppose most men do .
i saw your mother yesterday .
what business did you have with her ?
it 's a likeness of tom chaney .
i 'm looking for him and i hear you 're looking for him , too .
i only take one step at a time .
i 've been on his trail the best part of four months now .
i 'm a sergeant in the texas rangers .
chelmsford or chaney as you call him , he shot and killed the senator 's bird dog .
bibbs threatened to whip him e and chaney shot the old gentleman while he was sitting in o porch swing .
well , you need not worry about chaney anymore .
the sheriff informed me that you were looking for a man to go after chaney in the indian territory .
i 've already found one for the job .
his name is rooster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the federal court , toughest one they have .
you 'll have te talk that over with rooster cogburn .
it 's at least a two-man job to take him elive .
we 're taking him to fort smith and hang .
well i more so to me .
now , would n't a hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pay for killing my father , nat for some texas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt .
one would be as unpleasant as the other .
lay a hund on me and you 'll answer for it .
the children of texans are broight up to show o little more respect for their elders .
you 'll push that saucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , u have no regard for you , but i 'm sure you hava enough for yourself to go around .
they are all for sale except those four scrubby ones .
the heirs of the late frank ross .
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that is out of the question .
that hardly concerns me .
your father bought four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it while it was in your care .
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he wull make money , and i will make moniy , and your lawyer will make money .
and you , mr .
licensed auctioneer , you will foot the bill .
lawyer daggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.auv .
g. , yes .
all right .
sit down .
the ponies have no part in this .
i would n't pay that for a winged pegasus .
now , listen very carefully , as i will not bargain further .
my lawyer would not wish me to cinsider anything under $ 300 u
fir that , you get everything uxcept the saddle .
i would like to have that in wruting , for whot it is worth .
when i have it in my hand , i 'll remit the extortion money o
you 'll fand it in order .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
it seems such a shame to render such spirited horseflesh into soap .
good morning .
sleep late .
you ai n't such in early bird yourself , baby sister .
i just about give up on you .
i figured you 'd gone home .
yeah .
well , trouble is , there 's no slats in it at all .
how much is there ?
you still game ?
one understanding , that we leave for the territory this afternoon to get tom chaney .
well , you 're not going .
i 'm not a baby .
i 've slept out at night before .
papa took me coon hunting last summer .
first night out , you 'd bo celling , mama !
mama !
i 've left off crying .
i 'll find somebody who is .
now , i know you can drink whiskey and i saw you kill a rat .
but all the rest has been talk .
i 'm not paying for talk .
i do n't know how you propase to do that from the hog wallow you 're sunk into .
if i smelled as bad as you , i would n't live near people .
i 'll be more than ready .
there 's an old saw that says , one white foot , buy them twe white feet , try them .
i thought perhaps it was you .
no , it was not i .
nothing .
i will call him little blackie .
what is your offer ?
i will pay the market price .
tell me this do you entertain plans of ever leaving this city ?
yes .
i 'm off early tomorrow morning for the indian nation .
how did you light on that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with grit .
well , i suppose he has that i
i would n't trast him too much .
it may prove ti be a long , hard journey .
a good christian does not flinch from these difficulties .
neither does he rashly court them .
the good christion is not wilful or presumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong ?
i think you are wrong-headed .
i 'm having a little conversation with the marshal .
he 's gone behind my back .
well , a fellow that carries a big-bore sharps carbine might come in handy , if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something .
we do n't need him .
got everything ready ?
all but the grub .
there 's no hurrahing in it o
how much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
five hundred dollars ?
yip .
bibbs was a little senator .
well , i guess i 'll just stick with sis .
the bibbs family 's put up another $ 1,500 for chaney .
have they now .
what are the terms ?
well , you can tell him to his face , you can spit in his eye , you can make him eat sand out of the road , you can shoot him in the foot , and i 'll hold him for you .
she ai n't going , anyhow .
she 'll make nothing but trouble .
maybe i 'll catch this chaney by myself and take all the money .
how 'd you go about that ?
i 'd dispute your claim , i 'd muddy up the water .
i ai n't never seen nobody from texas i could n't shade .
la boeuf , you get crossways of me , and you 'll think a thousand of brick have fell on you .
that reward money 's just a pig in the poke .
look at him grin , he 'll cheat you .
we 'll get your man , that 's the main thing .
you sorry piece of trash .
i 'll send it to you .
that 's a big stury .
you 've not heard the last of mattie ross .
you may wall hear from my lawyer , daggett .
lawyer daggett i
who 's lawyer daggett ?
rid .
the river looks kind of high .
yeah .
well now , red , if i was to tell you that i you might tell him .
i would say , tom chaney , look out .
ca n't you get anything through your head ?
you 're not getting on this ferry .
i have paid my 10 cents for horse and rider .
red , taku this girl into town to the sheriff .
there 's also a $ 50 reward .
ask the marshal .
oh , she 's a runaway , all right .
lawyer daggett again .
she draws him like a gun .
i will do no such thing .
right .
they 're loaded down with fat men and iron .
i 'm going to raise welts on you like worms .
drop that switch , la boeuf .
you 're enjoying it too much .
you 'll find that i go ahead with what i start .
just leave her alone .
get in your horse .
it 's not dannertime by now ?
presbyterien , huh ?
southern or cumberland ?
southern .
my folks are cumberland .
i was raised in an episcopal church myself .
figured you for some kind of kneeler .
well , ned was sighted at mcalester 's store aboat three days ago .
shortest way to mcalester 's .
how far is it u
around 60 miles .
do n't be looking around for me , i 'll be right here .
you look like a hog on icu .
i 'm stronger than i look .
what did you bring for us to eat ?
salt red pepper taffy .
what are those things ?
how many you got in there ?
you 're lucky to be where water 's so hindy .
how long yoe boys down there been moented on sheep ?
go ahead and have your little joke , but i 'll tell you one thing , that little fellow there will still be running when that big umerican stud of yours is winded and collapsed .
sheep .
yeah .
hey , listen .
now , one of you 'll have to play the caller ,
i 'll tell you what to say and i 'll play all the other parts .
let it go .
that , baby sister , is no trade .
least little blackie likes the corn dodgers .
it 's the salt in them .
we wo n't get to mcalester 's by dark , so we better head for a dugout i know .
it 's empty , and we can shelter in it .
what do you want i
well , there 's no room for you here .
try that on the chimney .
speak up .
who 's in there ?
we do n't know any emmett quuncy !
emmett , thus is rooster .
one more minute , and you 're going to drink it .
well , now , do n't yiu bet yuur life on it .
what kind of papers you got on me ?
you botter move .
tell those others to be careful with their guns .
we 're coming out .
hit the dirt .
belly down .
spread-eagle .
put the horses in the lean-to .
cuff them .
get down there !
well u not by name , but i got a few john does .
i do n't remember any ned pepper .
got a messed-up lower lip .
a funny lip ?
was n't always like that .
in the lower lip ?
his upper lip .
ned 's got a new boy running with him with a black powder mark on his face .
that du n't bring nobody to mind either .
you do n't know anything i want to knew , do you ?
how about you ?
i always like to help the law as long is it do n't harm my friends .
pretty good idea , 'cause otherwise i 'll turn you in back at fort smith .
and then if you live , i 'll get yau three or four years
they 'll get that ball out of yoir leg , and i 'll give you two , three days to get out of the territory .
do n't go flapping your mouth , moon .
i 'll do the talking .
do n't let him spook you i
right good mounts to me .
cut that up fur frying .
what are you looking at ?
she 's aftar the man that killed her father .
his name is tom chaney .
led to killing in the end .
now , if you 'll just answer the marshal 's questions , he 'll help you .
i do n't like the way you look .
yes .
i do n't liki the way you look .
i hope you go to jail .
my lawyer will not help you e
it 's a shame , a kid like moon losing his leg .
too young to be hopping around on a log peg .
we seen ned and ace two days ago at mcalester 's .
i 'm pleyed out , quincy .
i got to have a doctor !
i 'll tell what i know .
do n't leave me laying here .
i 'll see you get buried .
they 're going to rob the katy flyer .
did you see a fellow with them with a powder burn on his face ?
no .
george garrett ,
methodist circuit rider uut of austin , texas .
when 's pepper due here ?
send that money to my brother .
i 'll meet him later , walking the streets of glory .
quincy ?
let me have a cool drunk of water .
look .
ot 's one of papa os gold pieces .
are you sure ?
yes .
worth a little over $ 36 .
grandpa sperling gave papa two of these when he married mama .
at least we 'ra on ned 's .
now , go saddle the horses .
straighten up the place .
now , what we want to do is get them in that dugout .
i 'll shoot the last man through the door and we 'll have them over a barrel .
and so does the governor of texas .
all i know as there 's a lot of them and only two of as .
why do n't i try to nick chaney befure he gats inside ?
but if they break , i 'll nick chaney .
yes .
remember the turkey ?
what does ned look like ?
so i wo n't shoot my foot off .
what for ?
well , i do n't wint any .
what did you do before you became a peace officer ?
what did you do after the war ?
you never told me you had a wife .
my friends was a pack of river rats .
she did n't crave their society , so she upped and left me and went back to her first husband who was clerking in a hardware store in paducah .
goodbye , reuben , she says ,
well , i told her , i said , goodbye , nola , and i hope that nail-silling bastard makes you happy this time .
did you have any children ?
why , i did n't consider it stealing .
i never robbed no citizen or tuken a man 's watch .
i had to flee for my life .
ne horse could run him into the ground .
when that posse thinned out , i turned old bo around , and taking them reins in my teuth , i charged them boys firing two navy sixes .
they must 've all been married men that loved their familees 'cause they scattered and run for home .
you do n't have any family , do you ?
general prico do n't belong to me .
looks like moon was tellang the truth .
you see chaney ?
that 's him hollering .
there 's a younger one , but he ai n't a patch to this one .
moon !
quincy !
i 'm hit !
they do nut call him lucky ned pepper for nothing .
yeah .
well .u.
well , what 's your story ?
i was on the move to a better place .
i heard the first shot , and i thought you 'd opened up .
more likely asleep .
you know who they are ?
the one on the sand spit is old hayes .
the boy i do n't know .
he 's not much older than i am .
why do n't you go make us some coffee ?
lot it go and go on inside .
why are you being so foolish ?
well , la boeuf , you 're qoite a horse shooter .
i was trying for ned pepper .
well , next time , try for the horse and maybe you 'll hit pepper .
what are we waiting for ?
and i say no .
you ca n't take men by watching them run away .
we 'll take the horses and the dead in to mcilester .
some , for now .
do n't think about you at all .
i was told in fort smith that you rode with quantrill and that border trash .
but a bunch of murdering thieves .
i heard they murdered women and children in the lawrence raid .
freeport , with kirby smith .
i sirved with genaral kirby smith .
i do n't have to hang my head when i say it , either .
go ahead and make another joke about it .
and i do n't like your conversation about captain quantrill .
othorwise , leavu it alone .
you know , i 've been thinking about lucky ned pepper .
maybe hu planned on murdering those two stock thieves so they would n't inform against hum .
ned does n't go around killing puople for no reason .
sure , marshal .
yeah , about half the loid i was looking for .
why do n't you go in and meet mrs. mcalester o
maybe mrs. mcalester can fix that poor little hand of yours .
rooster , what are you doing here a
go ahead .
that 's what texas calls a peace officer .
i have a pretty good idea where ned 's holed up .
if he is where i think he us , it will take 100 marshals to smoke him out .
his name 's tom chaney .
e want you to bury them for me .
what about la boeuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 're of no good use when you 're handicapped .
why ?
go wash , gaspargo .
that 's moon .
i knew this boy , billy walsh .
he comes from a good family down by the south canadian u
sell the horses and get what you can for their coats , guns , and saddles .
his brother 's a preacher named george garrett .
boots , send this man $ 10 , and tell him his brother got caught and is buried here .
i 'll do that .
so this is the man who shot ned pepper 's horse from under him .
yeah , this is the famous horse killer from el paso .
fewer horses , fewer horse thieves .
both rifle and hand ari ready to shoit again .
you stay here with the mcalesters .
that 's far enough .
you think i 'm gon na quot when we 're so close ?
there 's something in what she 's saying , cogburn .
i 've said my piece .
there 'll be no more talk about
who won whose spurs .
i 'm going .
now , we 'll have no more talk about it .
what are you doeng e
you could n't see it if yeu saw it .
he put his foot wrong .
he 's tired e
i 've freighted iron stoves up harder grades than this .
i was a pretty fair hand with a jerkline when i was freighting in colorado .
worked for a fellow that was always down with something .
he was carrying around a 21-foot tapuworm , along with his business responsibilities .
that aged him .
lord god , how they hate to pay up .
what about the $ 25 i paid you i
i will not bandy words with a drunkard .
we have come near about 50 miles from mcalester .
tomorrow we 'll take him .
if we 're as close to ned pepper as you say ,
i do n't think too much of making that fire .
where are you going with that canteen ?
we got no wator to spare for foolishness .
take a drink and let it go at that .
i 'd say there 's a stream down below there .
should n't one of us go down with her ?
might not be safe .
well , safer for her thon whatever she meets , man or beast .
well ...
i know you , little mattie , the bookkeeper e
there 's no money for yoo to squeoze around here .
i cama to fetch water .
and u think i will not go .
now , how do you like that ?
how many officers ?
i 'd say right around 50 , and they mean business .
so you just walk right in front of me , up that hill .
i think i 'll oblige those officers to come after me .
if you refuse to go with me , i 'll have to shoot you .
you better cock your piece .
all the way back until it locks .
now , you mean to say that you wo n't go with me on your own free will ?
now you will follow me .
sis !
i 'm down here !
i just did n't think you 'd do it .
one of my short ribs is broke .

but they 're all good shots .

farrell , lend him a hand .
they better show .
tom chaney shot my father to death in fort smith .
i hired him to go after the murderer .
if i 'd killad him , i would not be in this fix .
my rovolver misfired .
if i did , i 'd have one that worked .
i 'll give him a little more time .
was that rooster and the ranger waylaid us last night ?
did they take quincy and moon ?
ut was a terrible thing to see .
do you need a good lawyer ?
u nied a good judge .
that man called hayes , he 's dead , too , and the boy that saved your life .
goes for your good friend rooster .
rooster cogburn is no good friend of mine .
he led us right into your hands .
