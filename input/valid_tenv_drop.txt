t 's bn clled th lucky plnet .
wthut that crucial tilt  everything would hve been different 
ll life n erth is built on chnce and powered by the sn 
but the delicate balncs of or world are faltering  as the plant strggles to support our growing demands 
january , the high rctc , and thre hs ben no sun for over a mnth .
very livng thng is just waitng 
perhaps t 's just t clan her fr , but it looks like sheer jy .
thy re drawn to thir mother 's clls , but these slps are nt the esiest plce t take yor first steps 
th cbs have n't been fed this mornng 
the mther has delayed thr first mel n ths spcil day 
hunger will draw them to her 
milk is the only fod the cubs hve knwn since they wr born deaf nd blind beneth the snow .
evry yar at this time , feml bears ned food dspertly .
this is the nly place th bears cn hnt for sels 
if they d n't mak it there before the ice breaks up , their fmilies wll starve .
it s unlikely both of her cubs will survive ther first year out on the c 
mrch  nd mnch of the north remins snow-bond .
a thosand mls south of th bears , stntd conifers re still lckd in ice 
it s on f th last great wildernesss .
these cnifers hav needleshaped laves vrtually nedble so the frest spports very little animal life .
ths cratr is the very essence f wlderness .
as spring creeps up from the sth , the tga s unveild .
thy ve come to make the most of the brif flsh f spring fod and to hv thir yong

but thes vast hrds do n't travl alone .
the clf may b young but t s capable of otrunnng th wolf , f t manages to keep ts footing .
by this stage , the odds are even 
pril in the rctic  nd alredy the sun never sets .
but frthr soth , the sn works its magc n more gradl famlr ways .
th brodleaf woodlnds f erp and north mrca .
mor than any ther  thes have ben crwded ut by towns and farmland 
nly fragments rmain 
summers are longer here and decidous trees can floursh .

t 's a long wy down for a mdn flight .
a fw calls f encuragement are neded here .
there are stll tw missing .
only two dys ld nd already one grat dventure bhind them .
a sesnal cycle that seems increasingly nreliabl 
but there are prts f our world that have no seasons 
may , in the tropics , bt there is no spring .
this s wht allows the jungle to grow unchecked and spport so munch lf .

and the challnges are becoming greatr thn ver .
june n the kalahar desert of southern frca .
lt 's the dry sson here , and thusands of elephnts hve strted th desperat trek for food and water .
at the mmnt it is dry , but watr should cme .
bffalo jon the grt trek 
dst storms mak the going togh all the way .
they 'v bcome seprted from the herd .
this is a dangrous place to los yr way .
they dar n't rest ntl they rech t .
finally  th stragglers emrge frm the dst .
the storm has did down .
but nt all the animals hve been s lcky .

grass is  grt nsng hero of or plnet .
this is the circle f lfe that mst of us  n our rbn lives  hav lost tch wth .
perhaps spurrd on by a memry from the past , the matriarch leads the herd to  temprary water hle one tht may have saved her lif yars ago .
the calf nd its mother are mst at risk 
ln the drkness  an elephant 's vision s lttle btter than or own .
the lions bide thir time 
it s the calvs thy re after .
th clves ar t well protcted .
as the deserts grw  and traditinal migration rots ar blocked by farms and fencs , elephnts must trek ever greatr dstnces .
the sun that scrches the dsrt als brngs watr to the land .
s it beats down on tropicl seas , moisture rises from the warming ocns powering r glbal weather system .
as th r rses , so t cols and the wter falls as snw .
the scene s set for on of nture 's most challenging mgrations 
ech year  thousands of demoisell cranes try t escape th harsh winters n mongoli , by flying south t th warmer clmes f ndi 
to gt there , thy have to cross the hghst mntin range on earth , the himalyas 
the crans ht vilent turblnce .
the sun 's rays weaken in the afternon and th turbulnce falls wy  but t s to late for today .
the adults mst gd thr yung on this hazardous trip .
it 's arly mrnng and the wrm ar is already rising fast .
this s the grat nnding cycle .
for generatns , humans nd nimals lik come to depend n th grat rvrs and their smingly endless flw .
ftr months of drught , th rivers begin to flw again in the kalahr .
this s an afrca w rarely se a lush wtr wrld ttlly reliant on a seasnal flood , orginating frm a tropical ocean thusands of miles away .
many animals ar quit at hom in the flood  but ther are sme mre apprehnsive bathers .
ftr weeks of mrching , the elphants are xhasted 
fter so many weks  mny hundreds of miles , they 've arrived 
the seasonal cycl tht drves the lives f elephants on lnd , is jst as mprtnt in the oceans .
it s july and the hmpback whles re n their breeding grnds n the tropics .
ths calf is n mre thn a few weks ld and as he bgins t tre , his mthr supports him close to the surface , s tht h can brathe 
thse shllow equatral waters make good nursries they 're wrm and calm nd there are few prdators .
to find food  she wll have to lead her calf n n epic 4000mile journey to richer feedng gronds at the southern extremes of our planet .
this is the longst migrtin by any marin mammal  and t dpnds ntirely n  helthy ocen ll lng the way 
ut n the pen ocean , th whls meet others serching for food .
they have to crss hlf the globe  from the eqator ll the wy to th edge of ntarctca .
th tropcal seas re a lng way behind them now .
they re heding for stormy seasonal watrs .
great whtes ttack whale calves , bt thy re not the victims today 
ths magnficent predators , at th very top f the food chan , are a vital part f a helthy ocen ... and yet w slughter lmst a hundrd million of them every year .
ther poplatons are in freefall .
ot t sea , th ice s nw too thin t support the cubs ' fathr 
ths is a disaster fr polr bears .
withot a solid pltform , they struggl to hunt the seals they need to srviv 
hw wll the father make t through the yer now that the ice is almost gone ?
th waters are gettng clder and roghr 
s s nt t lose track of each othr , they slp ther fns on the surfce 
the whales have fnally reached antarctic in time for the summr .
t lst , aftr thir 4000-ml jrney , the humpback whls can feed 
now  at last  the mother cn rplnish hr reserves as she nd her clf join the rest of the team .
wintr in antarctca and the gretest sesnl change n our plant is nderway .
soon the continent wll b plungd back into darknss .
th aurr astrali illumintes the sothern skies , but thse spctaculr lghts bring no warmth t the wlderness of c 
our mal polar ber is in great dnger now 
aftr many days at se , the exhaustd ber s drawn by the pungent smlls f the clony .
h 's desperate fr fod , but walrus re mnch lrgr than his nsel pry

we do n't want t blive that things jst happen we want t beleve that there 're sm kind of deliberate ntention behnd everything even when inanimate objects are concerned

the dlivry of rewards by a one-armed bandit is detrmned at random but many gamblers want to think tht what they do can incrs their chncs of wnning the jackpot
they stand on on leg or wer a lucky shrt
there 're two kinds f mistaks they cn mke they can either fil to dtect pattern whn there is som or thy cn sem to dtect pattrn when thr is n't any and that 's suprstition
60 yers ag  the mericn psychologst b.f. skinner investigated the behvor of pgons rwardng them with food when thy larnd to pck  key in th feeding ppratus
but thn skinner set th appratus to reward the brds t random now th pigeons just hav to sit bck and wait , but that is n't wht they did
whn n individl pigeon , for exmpl , hppened to lk over its left shoulder and th reward mechansm jst happend to click in at that point
by sheer luck as t happned the rewrd mechnsm dlivered food at the sme time agn and so th pigon ws reinforcd n its ide tht looking ovr the left sholder was wht got it the reward

world s made of two elements .
there the spirit is very big  and vry holstic , and vry inclusiv world
it is nt dfnd in a ne partcular way s when yu go in  room you cn say the tree hs a spirit
natre without sprit can not exist lke tree can not exst without the sun .
light , it cn not xist withot rin , ... can not exist witht soil also it can not xist wthout  trness .
the treness is th spirtual qualty
r the rckness
whn you talk about the rcknss r th quality f a rock
t all sounds very poetc , bt it 's not rality like priests , mllahs , and rabbis , new-ag mystics cselessly attempt to fill gaps in humn understanding with fabrcted mening
science and rationalty ar often accsd t hving a cold blek outlook bt why is it blek to fce up t the evidence f what w know
the wrd mundane hs come t man boring nd dull , it really shold nt  t should mean the opposit becase t comes from th latin mndus  meanng the world , nd th world is anything bt dll
there 's real poetry n the real world 
science s th poetry f relity

the fndamental problem  think lies with th fashion throughout our dcatinal system to tch stdnts to vlu privat felng more hghly thn evidenc bsed reasn
fr rltvists , scentific truth s just a patriarchal wstrn rthdxy that lik the old rmn catholic chrch stands in the wy f thr equally vlid outloks on the world
wth things like paranormal  the driv for alternatv mdicine , all ths kinds of mvements awy from the orthodox in science
in terms of dffrent kinds of treatmnts nd things like that and in a way , nt trusting the exprts any mor
 thnk you 're s close to being right , bt yet you 're darn wrong  you 're absolutely wrong
w wnt to question uthority .
we d n't want t say becaus this prsn is the presdent of ryal sciety therefr wht he says is right
we 've got to go back to the evidence and find ut what is ctlly true ?
but the imprsonal algorthms of intrnet search engins do not wed out robust evidnce from unsourced , ncrrobrtd ssertion
paranoia cnspircy theores circlate nchallenged
smetimes thy 're relatvly harmless lik the rumor that nasa faked th mon landngs which is a bt of a joke because the evidence fr gng t the moon is so strong

i spent an incredible amount of tim n gs stations  honky tnks nd other off-th-beatenpth places , trying to appear col whle bsssively followng the descent f a steel ball dwn th plyng srface of  grshly lit machin 
i cm in with my grandfathr , standing on pp crats to play pinbll .
 was abut eght years old .
thy d say , yu 're in th arcde  here 's a roll of quartrs .
apartmnt hoses hd them in the laundry roms .
i guss it ws the kind of ag when yo do n't wnt to do things with yor parents 
 also rmmber my father dragging me ut by my ears , sayng that i spnt to much mony .
a crowd hung round th machin nd yu had to wait t play .
i strted playing at the local café .
took my boks to stdy there .
sometimes it rplacd stdying .
on a satrdy  'd rn t p to the highest mount it culd win , which ws bout 15 gms 
sell thm 12 games .
f you say pinball , people are lik  what ?
thre are many kids tdy that do nt knw wht a pnball machin is .
nd they come in hre and thy see somthng that they have n't sn n 25 yers 
something tht was a major prt f their yth .
kds tdy do n't relly nderstand pinball .
th kids tody  betwn th cmputer games and the home games , nd the nintndos nd the sga systems nd gamebys , they just w n't play pnbll 
i can remember when  was growing up we used to eat ll our mals at home 
and we used to go out for entrtainment 
and now evrybody eats ot 
everybdy always goes t restaurants .
they d nt cook at hme much 
pblc places of musemnt hve ben flling by the wayside in meric lik crazy 
yu ca n't find a pinbll mchine 
there s no mr arcades n malls .
the bars tday have  megatouch , a jkebox and a pl table 
pinbll is fnished in frnc .
in englnd t s fnshd long tim ago 
n italy yo ca nt find ne pinball .
n germany no one pnbll .
even in belgium , it was a pinball paradise .
it s finish 
they said pinball was dad 
t starts with one .
thn another one 
 was otgrwing th fmly rm 
i 'd buy 20 here  30 here .
ys 
60 gams .
it ws a vry rpid dcline into obsession  i thnk 
once yu get th lre of the silver ball n yo it 's lk an addiction nd you c n't stop nd  just kept , you knw .
you remember bying every one , where you gt it from .
and just as i 'm thinkng mybe i m not gon na d this ,
pinbll wizard coms on th radio and i think , n  i 'm gon  
26 hours ltr  'm fnally hom , exhausted .
they rally do nt seem t b machines .
and the way thy talk to y  yu find yorself talking to it

th things i lik  'm very bsessive 
thse re the brrels from jaws 
whn i collect something , whethr it b pinball mchins , jws memorbila , i got ta hve it all .
like it sys , i wn na rock and roll all nght and party every dy 
it ws during th depths of the dpression , th lt 20s , erly 30s , whr the cin-operated amusemnt gm ndustry knd of got brth .
it ltrlly ws a nam bcse thre wer varius pns that wre hammrd int  wod srface .

we have to outlw it .
we c n't control it 
but the majrity of prdct that was out ther was for msement nly .
n the case f new yrk city , chicago and los angles  bng thr majr metroplitan aras , as well s other areas round th unitd sttes , pinball was bnned .
it ws this on .
this ws the first pnball with flipper .
 sd , i got ta do somthing like tht .
before tht it was nothng bt chance .
gttlieb rled n the '50s and 60s .
bfor the city council in april f 1976
as well as a demnstratin of pinbll bng a gme of skill  as opposd t  gme of chanc .
business ws boomng .
profit margns wre hug 
when we startd slid stte elctronics on pinbll mchnes we wre on the lading edge of technology 
mngers from the dffrnt rstarants and the brodway crowd 
kds always want some plce to go , smethng to do .
i think that 's what gve grwth t the arcd business .
naughty or whtver 
yu culd kind of do what yo wnted 
it ws mr lik hnging ut wth yor frnds .

what s it that maks you stp and play ne machn ?
t 's something that 's pitched twards young males .
there s not really  lot of femalefriendly mages on these .
any violnt misgynist thing y want is thr on pinball .
 lot of these mchines have lv scnes on them .
i 'm not n the supposing businss .
what do you think ?
you d hav thos cntrfold images of yung  rather buxm ladies , usually blonde , staring out f the machne at yo , to inspire you .

wll , it s bn n my blood since i was 12 and  'm 59 so pretty majr 
should have known  was gong to be a collectr and i dd nt start cllectng until  boght ths huse in 1976 .
nd the frst gme in my collectin is my fvourit gam of ll time .
i always copy down serl numbrs nd i have  binder that i ve hnd-typd snce i do n't do compters yet .
to m i think t wuld be intrestng ,
 have 300 games  where they wre at one tme 
were they in jo 's bar and grill or smewher dwn the strt or at a shw 
 have a column fr th date .
notes .
i wrked n th bowling indstry for  lot of years .
and the lst bowling lly i wrkd t clsd dwn 12 yars ag .
tht s why i cllct flyrs .
that s why i cllect wht they call press photos .
they r chrnological .
thre 's a lot of gmes ar missing screcards .
how they gt lst vr th years , it 's hard t belive , but they do .
in th front closet , there 's lots f binders n ther ls 
i was blessed with an nbelevble memry 
jks 
is nt that good ?
i d nt think abt wht t s worth cos  d n't want to sell t 
lot f work nd when yo 're dn and yu turn it on nd it des n't blw up , yo feel real god 
i 'm a pple prson  i like people 
 looked forward to seing people on monday  tesdy , wdnesday .
i nvr had ny brothers r sisters .
nd my mom and my real dad got married and dvrced twc .
and thy sy it 's kind of heredtary but my real dad smked and drank and he was an alcholic but i nevr did drink or smke .
th rush of being abl to ply any game you have at any given time by pushng the button , you ca n't explain it to peple 
i wke p and do t every single day .
lke n xtensin of my hand or smethng  i guess .
they 'll be in  bar , with thr frnd .
we just smile .
chicago is the pinball cpital of th wrld .
we liv here .
we nd to have that fast trnrnd 
each prson des a littl part of it and psses it long 
today , w 'r the only company making pinbll machines and we strive to have 10  f wht that market once ws .
it 's a modern car that has some of the look nd fel and coolnss f t and it 's retr 
w 'r th nly pinbll manufactrer 
ge  if  hd just one more shot ,
i knw  would hve gotten it ths time 
i had two balls lckd nd i just got tht last ball locked cos  did t last tme .
we build workng mdels f thngs and thn w play wth it 
but it tells us whethr what w 're doing is going to wrk r not work r be fun or not fun .
this is what the final vrsin of the game looks lke whn it 's fnlly prodced .
it 's jst you and the track now !
it s wht people sd i was going to be .
and that s what i am .
 'm n cloud nin !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the science f it is nothng .
 nice sond 
bng a progrmmer by trad
i mean , for me this is lik  littl mini world .
s when the ball s bouncng around insd , it 's hvng fun inside its own lttle wrld and yu 're helpng it along .
lttl fish in the tank having fun .
from displays to alpha numerics 
pnball lost  market of players becas f ther tchnologclly enhancd gmes .
i love stratgy 
it s abot achevement , it s about gols .
nd you go , h   see , if i d ths and this , i get ne of thse .
pice f cake .
and then you play it ten tms in a rw and yu d n't do it .
and you 're like , oh , i can do that .
for nstance , n pirates  vry obvous strtegy s to get tim lock lt .
the ball will bounc round for three seconds while th pst is up 
the post coms dwn and it still may bounce around .
and ll the whle you complete ths lights .
so then i get the ship multball  whch s the shp .
so yo shoot th ship , yu shot the ship .
i find that very satisfyng .
it just happns to cme in a box .
like a slot machine 
an operator comes long and collects the money .
he can wn a free gm 
evn wth a lttle glory .
the knocker goes off in a crwdd bar .
 did that , i mde that go off  ok ?
when yu hear them cussing sometims , or tryng to kick the gm to get som action , you know yu re getting th rslts tht you want , you knw 
and you se them ptting mor cins in and yo say  i md t 
pt nother quarter in th pinball
everyne jokes about there 's some sicknss  thr 's some nsanity 
bt it 's kind of lke a geeky thing is probably th way pnball s percived by the outsders .
how d you perceive pinball ?
we ar from tokyo , japn .
w are pinball lvrs .
nd then now it sms almost like a defintn f a nerd r a wrd and marginl person t b caught playng pnbll .
bt maybe ther 's something ttractve bout that .
 m th jm mrrison of pinbll .
 think it s grat fr pnbll .
i think the pingek is god .
i hav nt met anybody like hm before 
i wan na start with this one bcas t is very hard t fnd .
 'v got it 
i lv pinball .
 wan na show ths one 
96 % f my deas pan out t mony .
i 'm here to save a hbby that savd my life .
 love msic .
i was pretty much rised in arcades  becuse of divorce issues and just a mess .
nd say  hey , i 've arrivd fr the show .
and gess who my ride is 
she drps me off .
elton john was the ultmate shwmn in th 70s .
i wnt to be  showman .
nd mybe that 's not th coolest thing 
everybdy tlls m t tak thse drugs , i should be in an nstitutn .
i get s mch crap dvce tht i 'd be dad nd bnkrupt f i listend to t 
talk to ech other nd ther might nt be all this fighting and shoting .
whatever happnd to jst going nto  bar lik john wayn 
and thn yu hav a drink ovr it later .
i 'm dfnitly msnderstd , yo knw 
but i tended to bck wy nd said it s not relly man aganst mchine .
f i can snse the rhythm f tht gme  th tempo f that gme ,  wan na be working in tndem with it .
i 'm not fightng it .
i 'm working with t .
i garante you it s chemcally similr to tht of thltes 
when thlets get n the zone  thy feel as thogh they 're wtching themslves run th ball down the fld 
pinbll remnds me of like dreming .
because like when  'm playing the gam it 's lke r ..
i 'm not relly with like realty .
but yt you 're watching what y 're dong nd tryng t concentrate 
it relly s a niqe feeling t become ne with th machine .
t s sort of  zen where yo re sort of meditating and that 's all you 're cncentrated on s the pnball 
you frget evrything lse .
you ca nt lose th ball out the mddl 
and yu strtch it out and you embllsh it nd y let all th peple watching knw that look t ths prson  ths person 's just done a very difficult thing .
when yo gt to put yor intials n t 's like , thre i am 
i own this game .
i put a lot f play time n on this machine .
 try to defend it 
that 's my home trritry .
i was just smply ahead of the machine .
i was accumulatng so mny free games .
and eventully after about three or four hours i hd t g .
so n  sens there is  possibility yo have the illusin tht you 've won .
there is something inevitable abot losing at pinball .
becuse thre is a feling ftn when yu 're playng pinbll tht th machne dcdes when you ned to g home .
th object of play in pinbll is a high score 
when yu see a truly sklled pinball player  y ralise t s a gm f skill , not a gme of chanc .
t s pre adrenaline 
now what y hve are players who control the tempo of the game .
 se it wth my sns , in all honesty 
thre are tmes when i stnd back and mrvel at th fact that they have th bilty that they have .
i look at a gme ,  try t find a weakness and exploit that wkness fr my wn gme 
this is a sport .
to stand and stay fcsed for that long , it 's prtty dranng 
i 'm sore in my legs .
i m sor in my shoulders .
i 've alwys wantd t b champion of the wrld in somthing 
32 .
sunnyvale  california 
i strted playing when i was ten years ld 
yah  t s the whol thing .
pinball 's gotten a lot mr cmplicated nowdys .
it s becomng more and mor nclear to me how pople ar gettng bg scores .
yh , smetimes you see t all when yu 're playing relly well .
i can se  ball going towards the out lane at 12 nches away and know t do somthng rght away 
i ll nudge th mchine nd when th ball gets thre t jst does this thing off th post nd rolls in .
h tips it a bt .
wipes t off with whatever .
h 's got this rtn tht 's only his .
i wan na do what he 's ding .
and i could be lke on one hand and on hl .
yu know , what  really wantd to do
ws play pinball bt  ge  my mm told me that i should gt a carer .
because i have pnbll as my wn world .
 damnd in the rough tht  have personlly shined 
pnball 's something tht s done smething for m that i had t discver for myslf .
that ws already ther n  world that gives s ll kinds of input abot stuff tht we do n't evn wnt to hear ther people 's nput about 
and i knw that ll that inpt ws mistaken 
pinball is  world of specil ruls and unique opprtunites .
i wold even go s far s say i am spcial becase of pnbll .
i 've alwys played pinbll .
you d chok , yu wold n't do wll , and yo 'd hve to wait a year t try gain .
but py no mnd to t .
there s a strong mntal cmponent to rmn clm nd in contrl .
the best plyers never d somthng tht affects th bll unless they do t for a purpose .
nd ball cntrol does n't man lways ctching the ball , it mns ptting th ball wher you want it so y knw whre t 's ging to be next  not just whre t is right nw .
my mothr livs wth me n nw jersey .
when i tell her i 'm going , she said , go ahed nd enjoy yurself .
you 've gt t hve some fun so go enjoy yorself 
six millin 
bascally i 'm  synthtic organic chmst actually working n trying to find a tretment for lzheimer 's dsease .
i really have n't made t to fnls in a major tournament n a whil 
i did it nce in 99 , bt i got eliminated nfortnately 
srprising vllags , floodng citis and towns ..
th storm s my nickname 
 strted playing pinball when  was fur yars ld .
so pinbll nd i kind of grw up together .
and i wnt t beat the best .
t makes it mch esir to live thinkng tht i 'm the best and i just hv n't had my mmnt .
what s really mportant whn you play pnbll at the world champonshp level s to get yr mentlity straght 
because veryone s so good that yu ned the mental dge 
and if you cn balanc those two things you 'll be unbeatable 
and i feel like an outsidr 
i feel kind of lke ... smeon that thy ll thnk they 're better than 
and i know for a fct that i can bet them .
n of th gentlemen here , neil shatz  has been in the finls thre or four tims .
and it 's lk if thre is a pinball god maybe thy 're cursng hm becaus he 's second or third place , nd h 's s grt h desrves to win fnlly and s f i were to pick smeon to win 
but sr , yah , it s tough bt  njoy jst th thrill f competiton .
what can we expect this morning , gys ?
bslutly i thnk ths guys re simply bttr players 
lyman shts .
lyman sheats .
best player in the world 
 prgramme pinball machines .
i wrk with designers and basically make th gme d all of wht t ds .
 ws in college , t was around 1986 
t was about five yrs after that that i startd competing 
th easiest thing is to ht th flippers ndvidully .
i do nt know ...
you know , when they first play .
multball here .
ging to try and gt one of the blls over the othr flippr to make a shot .
scr some points .
nd  watchd ths person methodically do a pssng sht over , make the sht  kick dwn  go p  passing shot , over .
so  bounce the ball over t the other flpper  now t 's under control 
i nevr thoght of playng pinball that way 
yu sy a pnball ?
play pinball ?
her w ar .
wrld pnbll championshps .
and within one week thr ws a hurricane named ivn that cam up the est cast and the lttle crek in front f here overflwd its banks 
and thr ws nthing t be done .
vrything we had just fnishd ws washed away 
i was just frustrated nd wanted t get the place cland up s i cold decide f i wntd to try again .
t did prv pssble t clean up nd rebuild .
you cn hve a great game 
thr ar a couple of people who re hgh-qlty plyrs .
very fcused whn thy play , tough to bet 
one slp and th bll ges .
nd tht 's it .
it certanly presented n ntertinmnt option that was wflly compellng .
n 1980 yo cold not possibly build engh vd games t strate th market .
and all of a sudden or income dobled and tripled vernght .
it just blw me awy 
and thn the pinball sat thre almost forlrn-lookng .
yu ca n't see anything excpt the scren 
whn you ply pinbll you 'r playng a piece of eqpment tht yo can mve around nd control .
pinball machines y ca nt do that .
t 's a pnball machne .
thre 's  begnning bt it 's endless .
 fnshed it .
th real backbreker cme when hme vide finally hit the mrketplace 
of eithr myself playing t hme or me nd my buddy playing at hme .
but it relly spelld the nd of certinly the pnball ra 
t ws widely beleved at the tim that vid gmes had usrped pinball nd there was no longer a ned for pnbll whtsver .
pinball was bck on the map again 
after  decade f decline , flppers r flapping .
bumpers are thumpng .
pinball s bouncing bck .
i had a lt f lfe ted up n it 
it ws rlly  presenc and just the daly interactn of the world that i hd at my dorstp that i knew  was never gon na have agan 
it was a lif-dfining mmnt tht saddns m and still saddens m actully 
i g out now and i see some of my old friends and  play pnball and that 's nice .
that 's just nver gon n happn for me agin .
s if yu lok at th downsid f it all , pnball desrves a better fate than wht it currntly has .
in truth it is n't a bg prt of ur clture any more .
bt i m nt sre that anyn will cre in 10 t 15 years .
wer pinball not t survive , the wrld would cntinu but a lttl bit f th fabric of life would be gn .
 thnk tht thr is  fleting snse of ne 's naiveté nd nnocence that gms bring ut .
and as w get older , for mny of us  w step away from ding those things that gave us joy when w wre yonger .
and i think that that loss f innocence is tugh 
and verybody should try t t som point in tim .
you hve a nivrs n  bx .
under glass 
it 's vry strnge , very strange .

why should i allow yu , sons f my frmer enemies , t serve in my cort ?
becus yo hve spard the lives f our peple wh wer deliverd into yur hand nd becase the word of th prophet jermiah has come unto us saying 
the god of israel , says to all ths
pray to the lord fr it  for f it prospers , you too wll prosper . '
ths is god 
i will spak only the truth , and when yo would not hear it  yu mst ask me nothing 
hav their nams be writtn in the book of the wise .

i ned t know wht it mens .
oh , king , tell yur servants your drm , and we will intrpret it for you 
astrologers wh read nothing n th strs .
it is up t yu to dscrn and interprt them .
but  my lord , if nly you would tll us your drem w could ntrprt it , as w hve alwys done .
i knw you 're trying to gn tm or trck me into revealing what i ve sen 
ther my  'll have none f it .
n kng has evr asked such  thing befor .
why do n't yu cm along with me nd ask him yorself 
speak .
daniel :
i have heard yor dcree , nd i understnd tht i shll fall beneth th bld if yor dream is nt md known and ntrprted .

you may withdrw so lng as yo return at dawn , as your fate and that of the others is one in th sme , and when yo return be sre t brng yur cmpanions with yu .

the hed f the statue ws mad of pure gold , its chest and arms of silver , its belly and thghs of brnze , its legs f ron , its feet partly f irn and prtly of baked clay .

yo have done what  ws told ws impossible .
you know my dream as if you dreamt t yurself .
wht does it man ?
yo , h king , are the kng of kings .
after yo , nther kingdom will rs , infrior to yours 
nd n th time f those kings the god of heavn will st up  kngdom that will nvr be dstroyed .

s this tre ?
d y refuse t worship my state ?
then y shall b thrown int the furnace , nd no gurd will save you from my hnd 
lt the furnace be hated sevnfold 
but nw i se fr , and the furth
the fr has not harmd yor bodies .
y were willing to give up yur lvs rather than srve ny but your own god 
daniel :
and for a time all was well untl nbuchadnezzar s sleep ws trubled yt by nother drem .
bfore  was born , my grandfathr , styages , ws troubled by a dream whr  flood beginning near hs thron was overflowing th whl erth .
he did n't learn until 10 years latr that the by ws actally aliv , at which tme he pardoned the boy and restord hm to hs rightful parnts , nd for a tme th matter ws forgotten .
dnel :
old astyages  he knew f the prphcy , bt he ws powerlss to vercom it .
fr whn h dreamed that great dream , his enchnters , srcerers , and strlogrs were nce agan unable t interpret the visin .
the imgs  sw trrfed me .
the bests f the feld took shlter nder it , and the brds f th ar lved in its brnches , and from it every cratr ws fed 
trm off its branches .
strip its laves 
but lt the stmp and its roots ,
ths is the drm tht  hd 
you hav bcome grat and strong 
but you saw  mssenger   holy one  cming down from heaven , sayng 
whil its rots remain in th ground .
let him live like wild nmls 
you will at grass lik cattle until you acknwldge tht the mst high is svereign over the kingdms f men nd gives them to anyone h wishes 
thrfor  h king  b pleased to accpt my advice 
rnounce your sins by dng what is rght and yur wickdness by beng kind to the oppressed .
sek the lord whil he may be fund , and it may be that your prosperty will contin .
but the mmry of kngs s oftn short , and 12 months ltr whn the king was walking on th roof of th royl palace of babyln  f babyln 
nbchdnezzar 
i 'v plcd upon the very bosm of th nderworld , its top 
i ve raised mntain high .
is ths not the great babylon that  have blt as my ryl palace with my mighty power for th glory of my majsty ?
daniel 
go nw from this kngdom which yu claim 
becaus he nssted n bng mor than h ws made  he becme less than he was mad 
even n his insnity neither the lin nr th bear dsturbed him though he wandred alne nd narmed nd slpt nked in the places wher thy fnd thir food becus t had ben prophesid tht on dy he would honor th most hgh 
honor nd glory t him who lves forever 
ris , nebuchdnezzar 
befre him all the pople f the earth are regardd as nothing .
he my do s he pleases with the powers f heaven and all the peopl f th erth  nd n one , no one , may sy him , nay .
and so nbchdnezzar returned to his throne , but eventually he was gathred to his fthers , nd a series of new kings cam to the throne  none fastng more thn a shrt time 
well  t last we cme t th pan of th tle where  hav some knowledge to shar 
for thogh  had conqred from est t west ,
t was nough to freez the hart of even an old slder such as  m 
frm whence it cam  do not knw  like some spirit f gd whispered it n my ar .
bt the river ephrats which flowed dwn to babylon raisd bove its naturl lvel hmmed in by dams and dikes , bt f dams wer opened full nd th dikes wr broken  the rver which ran straght thrugh the hart f th cty
and i suddnly rlzd i d been gven a ky to defeat th mighty babylon .
it was s though in all the world  throughut all of histry ,
i was the nly one that had th thought .
all t rquird was the rght moment to act .
listn , h king , nd i will tll of the second king f my story ,
they seem qute cncernd about this , my king 
first , thy mst build a caseway cross the mat .
tht alne will take mnths 
bring me th glden vssls from th temple of jrusalem 
but , my kng , is t wis to s th vessls ?
my king , these cups are consdred scred , re they not , my king 
but hre they re spoil fr our gods , nd they would have yu use them s i se ft .
bring them 
a jden once told nbuchadnezzar , yr forfather  of his dreams 
h succdd whn everyne else had failed .
i am tld yu r able to give nterpretations and slve diffcult prblems 
if y can read th writng on tht wall , you will be clothd n purple  hav a chain f gold placd arond yur neck , nd be made third highst ruler in the kingdom 
oh king  the mst high gd gave your fther , nbuchdnezzar , greatness nd glory  bt whn his hart became arrogant he was deposed from his thron and stripped of his glory ntil h cknowledged tht the most high is sovergn
instead , you 've set yourslf up aginst th lord f heven 
would you humble the lmighty by dscrating his pssessins ?
would you bind him like a captve nd bet him like a slave 
ths is his nswr to you 
mne  gd has nmberd the days f your reign nd brught t t n end .
upharsn  yur kngdm is divided nd given to the medes nd prsians .
thus says the lord , yur line is ended .
your rule is ovr 
ls thre nthing to be dn 
will the lest f your slves comfrt you  or wll they desert yu , sekng t avoid the fate whch is yours 
soldiers together 
i am kng belshazzr of the babylonia .
as he has commndd ,  shall assume the crown 
you re darius , the medepersian  uncle and father-in-lw to cyrs who has by stratagem tken this cty .
by right of cnquest , yu are now the kng .
yes  and you are an official of bbylon .
it s  rewrd fr letting belshazzr knw that y wre abut to take the city .
he read the inscription and rvealed th message .
he told the kng that h would de this very night .
daniel 
f i was t l  would this be the lie i would choose ?
and hw culd you hv dne so f the lord had not dcreed it ?
 will spak t you honestly , my king  nd when you would not har the truth you must ask m nthng .
s be it .
yet i shall name you on of the thre 
if they wer lyal to the former master , they ar no good to m .
cyrus 
he 's twice my ncl by blod and marriag and serves me well as co-counsel to my empre 
yes .
did anyne se you ?
why are we meeting so far from the cty 
once h is in charg he ll be loking into evrythng we do .
prhps we should lminat him 
how ?
he dos n't hunt .
a sudden llnss r a drownng 
who wold blieve it ?
ther s no corrption n hm nor ny negligenc .
there 's a spirit of xcllenc in him .
no one is that honest .
 hd  man try t brib him once , and a vry generous brib t that .
such a mn is dangerous .
hw lng bfor he learns tht we 'v been gnerous wth orselves nd covered th thefts wth flse accounts 
then perhaps we ned to mak him stop .
he wo nt d it .
f we culd forbid his prayers for an ntir mnth under penalty f immedite excution 
do n't be rdculos .
i know him 
the king knws that daniel and his people pray continously and only t n god .
which is why we need to disguis ur purpose .
indeed  they could fnd nothing amiss in my work  nither wllfully nr through neglignce or lack of care  so they tried to trip me up with my pryrs 
but since wrship f the most high ws not prohibted by th laws of the realm , they had to concal their purps lik pison n a cup f honey .
and hv not submittd to yur rule 
indeed , we hav labred to constrct  plan whereby the lyalty f ll may be tsted .
bt wht of the gds of persia  my servant , bey 
how wold yu enforce such an edct 
no one wold be allowed to go befr any altr or shrine fr the ntir period except for yu .
and nyone fond vilating the decr would b thrwn nto th lions ' den befre sundown on the very day f th offense .
mle consprator  3 :
in a single stroke .
i apprve your plan 
n antcpaton of your approval , oh king , w have taken the librty of drfting th edict and bringing t along 
cyrs :
and onc  law s writtn , even the king himself can not change it .
danil !
the king 's seal is barely dry 
yo chose yur god vr yor king 
tk hm awy !
h king , t is my sad duty t nfrm you that somone hs lredy dfied your decree .
guard :
brng forth the prisonr 
he pays n attention t you , h king , r t the decree you hve pt n writng .
danil s my chief advisor .
n one is abov th law .
bring forth the tablt .
shll be thrown nto th lions ' den
by my hand and sel , dris the king , rler of the meds and persins .
knowing the kng s command , i hve dsobyd it .
i shll command my wis men to make evry ffort t sarch out sme rason tht the law may b found nnforceable 
let them sarch , oh king  but nly for a short tme becuse yor own lw commands that sentence be carrid ot the day of the ffense .
danil :
it s s  xpcted .
a king who will not enfrc his own lws can not b  king 
 wll walk with you , danil , ne last tme .
as y wsh  h kng .
my frfather , braham , cam frm this land , nd the most high sd nto hm 
i will mke you int a gret ntion 
and may yet live t rep the fruts of that curse .
a cp of wine from the king 's own hand .

but those who seek th lord will lack for no good thng .
danil !
servnt of the living gd , has your god ben able to sv you ?
oh king  live forever .
my god has snt hs ngl , and he sht th mouth of the lins .
they have not hrt me because i was fund innocent in his sight .
come frth .
how mch must the man pay if he stels anothr man s treasure 
with his hnds perhps .
is ther ny penlty less than death which will do ?
but , h king , h is a hebrw .
you fashined my wn words as a snare abve my feet knwng my edct cold nt be rversd , but th living gd , the god of danil , has delivred him out of my hand .
n 
please wait , kng , plese !
his kngdom wll nt be destroyed 
he rscues , nd he saves .
for 70 years i had waited , and i knew our tim was near 
my heart grows with excitment that nw that time has cme 
belshazzar  the foolish 
daris , wh was deceved 
who is this fourth king ?
it is one chsen by the most high to perform great and mghty deeds befre he ws ever knttd in hs mther 's womb .
a bird of prey ?
tre  i had never saw the rgons of the euphrtes or furthr westward untl i cme in cnquest .
and yet yo chasd yr enemes ninjurd .

and i was raisd in a shepherd s hous
