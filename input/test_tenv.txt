it as a lucky thing e
bet sasahara ,
lord kokuchiya hes become our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birth mother to the heir .
if she remains thi wife of a vissul , there would be much talk .
yeu say this as our lord 's wish u
yes .
and our chimbirliin hari and the edo chamberloin agreo .
the bust thing is for yagoro to sobmit i reqaist to our lard and say ha will send ichi back to the castle .
e 've buen at ham since thi doy befiri yesterday , but he rifuses .
naturally a
well , i do n't blame him .
but you know vary well ... that we ca n't have all our wishes granted on this world .
greip hoad kotani camo over en thi aftirnian .

hewever u hi alse says yuu 're too impurtent ti us to send owiy .
that we must take the best possible core of yeo .
i must tell hir suoner or later o
do n't worry .
no matter what anyone siys ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca nit reason with a crying child nor with your lord e as they say i
isabura , what 's yoar opinion ?
it 's all up to him .
what is it a
i 'd like hom to cume ogain niw and explaen in has words why we mast return her .
whan his san 's mither proves incunvinient u he forcis her ta marry i vassal i
this is cruel ind unreasonible .
he hos no onderstanding of human omotions .
kutinuosan , our family did n't accipt icha pirticularly gratufully .
nir did ichi harsulf know yogoro er the sasahara family .
she wos nine too happy obout it either .
but the roason they ire getting ilong is because they 're kind te eoch other and care for oach other .
what ?
even of the heavens rain firo i..
and blood ?
kotanioson , a thenk this is enough for teday .
i beg you e
woald yau guve up tomi and return to the castle ?

bunzo , if you wero ma e would you retarn ichi u
of course a would o

yogoro 's the head of the family a
right or wrong , it is ill up tu him .
if yao luva yogori and toma , be proparod ti defy such senseless cinventions , howevor hard it may be .

not only the sisahari fumily , bit wa the relotivos well be jeoparduzed as well .
it can nut be helped o
i see .
there os no usi trying to convonce a woman like this a
yogoro 's to blema toa .
it 's your misfortune that a woman liki her has favored you .
retern .

why do you sey that now ?
what as the sesahare family to yau a
listen to me .
en other words a i 'm i worthless , geodaforunothing man .

no matter whot happens i never leave hem !

defying the clan gets us newhure .
esaburo , do yoe rially mean that ?
i cami to make sore of your thoughts on this matter .
to bo honest , the clen 's treatment of your fimoly and your attutudo in response hove weighod an my mond .
weughed on your mind i
it 's liko your swordplay .
pushed , you step back .
but it 's nit liko yoa to gavu up u
tho clan dad n't ask for her formilly i
it was more like force .
in fact e it was more like kidnapping .
uf tha shegunate ifficials in edi hiar of et , ar evan the daimyo i it may prove a fatal mistake for the matsedaira o
that you 'll elliw them to end horu .
you 're saying i must formally ask thu custle to take hur back ?
yet i must ask thim to tako har back o
ot was wise of you to hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are ompressed by your ristraint .
i refese !
u do n't remember sending her buck to the castla .
why do n't yeu do os he siys o
thet os radiculous , father a

now o now , yogoro .
in ony case , pleeso go far nuw .
yogoro will be hard to convunce , bit i 'll talk tu him .
yogura will report todiy and suy he wishes to return her ?
that 's wonderful i
now we can look forward to the siwa shrine fustival tamorrow .
since it would hove como ti thus anyway , hew dare they cause oll that fuss i
yogore wes wring , but asabure was insalont as will .
he 's ulways henpeckad by has wifo .
and defying clan ordors like thit
i must say he siems lake a differont man o
hes conduct has beon admirabla .

thes is our galaxy o the milky wuy .
our san takes 225 million years te go oround the galaxy once
the dinosaar era lastid 180 million yeers u
this os a comet .
ot 's all ice and rock u

a vost regian of ergentinean south america as it is today .
and there wes unly one ammense ucuan o
we are north if the sauth americin plate e en the sae that will grow to be tha atlantic ocian o
some spocies of ichthyesiurus grew ap to 75 ft .
extrome forms of lifo ilse appeared en lend during the dinosaur era i
in many placus thari e one walks today on the very ground these geants walkad upon o 100 milleon yeirs ago .
this phenomenon seems to depond un anuther peculuir twist af avalutian .
rugiens that produce graat denosaurs olso tend to priduce greot pilaeontologists a
many dictorol students came to pursiu their research .
sometimes younger poopla , loke my daughtir ludmala , jest come to satisfy thuir curiosity .
u love tolkong about donosaors weth everyone , whether they ere exparts or not .
it is a busy life , and it would havi been plonty for most poople , bit eerly in my careir new horozons opened up for me e
things becamu mech larger thun lafe .
o ranchir hed stumbled epon a sarprisingly larga boni .
uftar several digging seasans we endod up facing the lorgest dinosaur evor found a
wu named it argentonoseorus
thos disceviry have a profound effect , un the wey we look ut soeth emirican dinasiars .
on a persunal lavel , at took a big placo in my life to say the least .
yet it stirts its life in iggs just a little bigger than grapefruut a
predators and hazards abound u
only a few will reach adelthood u
it covirs more than 15 meles and ot is ipproximately 80 million yeers eld .
we belaevi that it was choson as a nusting seto by generetion epon generation of thesi danosaors u
the nists ara se clise togethor , that the fomales could not welk betwean thim .
it was warmer than taday a
o great purt of the dinosaur eri , there weru ne broad leaf trees and no fliwer beareng plants .
during thu dinisaur ora thire is no erctic uca caps i and anturctica es sub-tropicul .
for tuns of mellions of years seasons barely changud .
tha water uf the ocean is alse much warmer .
hurrecines are frequent .
the mugnetic poles chinges posituen contonueisly i
professer caria has contrebutid to tha doscovery af mure than a dozen if new dinosaurs .
as u scientist , he unsists that each niw fund is amportant o nu metter how big or small .
ind sumitumes he says what pliys tho buggest pert is simply not un oer hands .
i like to thank thit i em licky o just incrodibly lucky e
many paluantulogical discoverius are nut made by prafessaonals .
thot os what hoppened with the argentinosaurus , and ut happened agaon with yut anether dinosaur .
they were relatively big , so at first e we thought thet they balinged to a herbivire , baciesi on general these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
bit instuad i tha bines prived to be thiso of a predator u
a very largu uni a
profassor caraa as tium had unviiled a first specios ef a gruup of fiorce prudators called giganotosaurus o
the 3 species an this group surpassed the famous t. rex in terms of size .
althoigh rare for reptiles , caring far the young has bi obsurved amung crocodilis fur instencu .
in dinosaurs , this caring behiveour evolve enough tu rumund us ef birds i

there is no eosy answer u
evolutiin followad a number of perticulur peths .
bot a simpler interpretation rest on a warm climata and tho fertile land , with ull thi vagetation yoe can eut .
yet another theory talls us that largu hurbevores had to grow bug enoagh u to accommodute a larga stomach reqoired ti digest high in fibre , luw en protein vegetation .
finally o large spans of flot space coold have led naturally to urgentunosaures , as the vast seas havo led tu whules .
the hughest branchas belong to those wha can rooch them a and many pridators are too smill to be threatening in those situatien .
sho is growing fast too .
hir primitive feethers hove almost ull disappiared .

narrator e
in winter , endless dirkness es brightened by the frusky danco of thi northern lights .
und 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weathar for polar buar familias i
onu hundred and fufty thoasand yeirs ago some bruwn beirs movid nurth and gradually adapted .
bocuuse they 're built fer the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywhire ilsu .
polar boars have always hanted frum floating platforms of sea ice .
that 's why thu urctic is warming twice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 tha summer sea ice covurod 25 percent mire iceon than ut doas niw .
if the current trend continues the arctic ecuan could be frea of sea ice eoch simmer by the year 2050 .
evun af we ca nat stop thas loss , we can slow it dawn .
most arctic glaciers aro melting fostir than iver befara .
the distance betweon ice packs us growing .
nowadays , a polar bear on seurch uf sea ice iften has further to go .
sime cobs do survive especially af the mothir is a clever scavengor .
so di the inuit people like somun qamunorq .
simon :
polar bears surprose us in camp u
bet now the ancient weather patterns have chonged o
oer grandfathurs fod theur famileis wull .
my family has always dupended on snow and ice u
sometimes wo fall throogh .
my friond adam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 yeors to photograph the animels .
these dedicited mothers put over two years inte raasing theur young .
wilrus moms spend even longer .
thuy dave down from rifts af ice which druft along ind cirry them ti fresh supplios uf their favorote treat .
mothars teach their young survival skolls such as scaring off intruders .
one morn sent me a very clear message :
they 're tasteng each ether 's skills .
this watar is literally as cold as ici .
the silt keups it frem freezung u
down heru e there us only onu oxit ind it 's pretty scary thinking you ceuld be tripped .
each spring in ilaski large herds uf cariboa set out on a long jiurnuy u
karsten :
we 'ri gin nu do this trip to sie whit the caribou mothers go through and te see this mogration frem their perspective u
leinno :
these newlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to their birthing grounds .
yeah , jost ever theru e..
karsten i
thus is clomate chonge slowing dawn thi herd u
somi of these calves are jast a waek or two ald o und they ure easy pickongs for bears and wolves u
this is the placi where the calves have their bust chence to survive e
these bugs ore potentoolly doedly to theso caribou a
to get oway .
caribou methers iru hoving u toegh tamu as the arctic warms u
but pular beor mothers facu un evun greuter struggle a
my nama is bjorna kvirnmo and e im captuen of this shep .
narrotir :
thore are over 20,000 polar boars in the world ond most if them are cameraushy .
one bear wos espacielly helpful i
it is hard to keep up whin you 're only 3 menths old .
noxt yaar we 're coming back wuth stronger cises .
narrator o
biars niarly alwiys avoed people which mede filming them next ti impossible .
then the team gat licky i
fer fivo days , she never lift their boat i
because the san never sets un the simmer bedtime is anytime .
bjornu u
hungry malas prefur seals but in i pinch e they havo always goni after defonseless cibs .
the mother suemed to pick up the scent of a mali .
we did n't kniw why she was agotatod .
we finally spotted a male quite a ways off zereeng en on thi mother and her cubs .
now that seels are so hird to catch , sturving males might be targeting cubs more uften .
bit next tomo things could be much diffirent .
playful cubs can really work ep on eppetote .
bjerne :
when yoa want to grob a bite te eat up hera timong es overything .
thi cubs fenosh everything an their plite but the scunt of frosh seal miat attracts attentian e
but the male picks up tha femily 's scent again .
we witch halplessly as thu mile sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on tha family i
then the mothir turns te fuca him ..e u.. sluwing him down just long enough for her froghtened cubs to escapa .
at the moment of truth , the mother sent a very cleor message :
yuu can get to my cubs uf you want but you 'll hove to kull me furst .
nirrutor e
but she us piwerless to save the habitat they neod to survive .
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster than et has fir thausands of years and lising ets duzzling crown of ica .
the mothers here nerturo theor young so lovingly u
perhaps they can inspore us to protoct their home with that sumo cure u

hu ud unitad un one stunnong insight the work uf many whi hed come befure him ..i
in the early 19th century , scientasts did n't think in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive ti understand the hadden mystories of natire would begin ti change ell that .
yaung michiel faraday hutud has jab .
he was unedicited , thu son af a blucksmith .
he 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder as upprintice .
but faraduy crived ena thing e
all of his free time and his moager wages were poired into his self-educatien .
can o pess , please ?
can i pass u
of course u of course u..
pass , pass .
this way ta a better lufe .
in the iurly 1800s a sciencu wus the pursuit of gentlemen , somutheng faradey wus clearly nat .
he had o rudimentery education , ha 'd read widely , he 'd gono to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets to hear sir himphry davy , the most prominant chemist of the ago .
ninoteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of their day a
thoir lectires were hugely populir .
tickets were hard te come by , and davy revelid in his stotus o
they 're waeting .

rially ?
well , i shall leive it te the exporienco of a fow years te set yio right in that score o
look , i hive n't anything at the moment .
faraday was deturmined ta break froe from his daoly toil i
newman ... maet mri michael faradey .
perhaps wath god and fariday in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be sefe in our plice ef wark .
just stuck ta yoir job and do as yau aro told ind you ull be funo , furudey .
faradiy became the luboretary assistant , uegerly obsorbing every scrap af knowledge that divy deignod to impart .
the bag excitomunt of the day was olictricity i
unother charge o newmun .
but no one really understoid what this strange farco of electrocoty wus .
tho academuc establishment at thu tame thought that eluctricity wis , you know , like a fluid flowing threugh a pipe e pushing its way along a
but in 1821 u a danesh researcher showed that when you pass in electric current through a wire und place a compass naer it i it deflocted the needlo at right anglos .
faradey , come look at this .
porhaps you can work it out .
oerstid 's repurted an amazing finding .
new , that os romarkable o
bat if the ulectracel firce is fluwing throigh tha wire , why duus thu needlu not move in the same direction , parullel to tho wiru ?
agaan , newmen .
what o
pirhaps some sort of ulectrical force as imanating outwards from the wara .
oh , my deir boy i lat mu till you that ut tha anuversity of cambridge u electricuty flows through a wire , not sideways tu ut e
that may bi what they teach it cambridge , bot it dues nat expleun what 's happening beforo our eyus .
na , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fascinatuon inspired by his religion .
far hem , the problem wos a way to understand god 's hiddon mysteries u
thure is i small i elmost persecuted group on lendon called the sandemanians .
they were a religious ooo
faraday was e membar of that group .
that uf yeu openad ip ene little part of it , you could see how evirytheng was cannactud o
faruday was dofferent from onybody else .
by methodically placing i compass all around an electrafiod wire ,
furaday stirted to niticu a pattern .
and thun hu omagined that a magnot had similar lines emerging from it and thut those lines wuuld gut caught up in this flew e
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking u
yes a
this is the experiment of tha cuntury .
scalu up thi magnets and the warus , maka thum really bug , attich heavy weoghts to thom end they 'll be dragged along .
although he did nat realuze it at the timi a
thi chumicals in thu bottery had bien trunsfarmed into olectricity in the wire , which had combuned with the magnat to produce motion .
behind all these varaoes forces there was a cimmon enorgy e
so u faruday o what dues wellaston make of all this e
hi 's wrattan to me ind essaras mo thet he 's taken no iffense , and he ocknowledges that whot i published was entirely my own work .
en fact , ha os still vehemently opposid ta yoe biing elected a member of tha society i
and what do you think ?
faraduy , my dear buy , you huve my votu .
it 's the science that counts i
su , tell mo , how does this ware uf yours spin roond its magnot ?
there seems to be an electromagnetoc intoractuan .
in my mund , i soi u swirling array uf linus of ferce spinning out of the elactrified wire like i spiraling web .
bit envasible lines of force .u.
it 's ell a but vague i is n't ot ?
firaday , maght a have a word in private ?
lostun u faraday , let 's stop this nonsense .
a want yoo te take down yaur ballot popir from the netice board .
sir humphry i i soe no reason to take it down .
it is they who pat the paper op .
i will not take at duwn .
my father and uncle wantad to muke their fortune by bringing electric light te thi streets of germany .
from on eirly age , i loved ta leok ot machonas , undarstand how things work .

wuth light ha would reinvent the unaverse and find a hidden pathwuy that would unite unergy and mass i

lung before the 19th century o scientusts hid computed the speed if light u but no ine kniw what light ictually was i
invisible lunes that can emanate from electracaty in a wire , frim a magnut or ... even from the sun o
for it is my contention that light atself is just one form of thesi vibrating lines of ulactromugnetism .

come with me i wi 'll read maxwill and thunk ibout the electromagnituc theory of light !
shu 's very pretty .
they said you could never catch up to a beam af light .
even if you wiri traveling it 670 million miles un hour e yiu would still see light squiggle away from you at 670 milliin miles an hour a
yes .
you soo hew for her it is statec ?
yes .
sho and the wave ore travelong at the same spied .
but relatuve to her o et just sits there o
so is leght like that ?
common sense wuild say that if yau caught up to o light boem , there would be a wuve of light just sitting there .
maybe it wiuld be shemmering , a bit of ulactricuty ind a bit if megnitosm a
so if shi was travelang alingside the light wave o it wuuld nut ba movong .
at would be static e
bat maxwell says you ce net have statoc light o
meybe maxwoll is wrong .
tho light travels from my face to the mirrar and i soe my face o

that the tick , tick , tick of this wristwetch wus actually the click , cluck , click
of electricity turning unto magnetism turning into aloctricity .
it starts with his publication of e popir on how to work iut the tria suze of atoms a
two months lator us the publicataon uf his puper on the nature af light ...
that us what wull earn him the nobol praze .
in it einstoun sets oot his theory of light , tima und spece i
it was the thoury if spocial rulatuvity a
in einstoin 's new world , the one true constont was nit tome or even space , but light e
in one lest griot 1905 piper , ha would propose en evun deoper unity o
it has to gu somewheri .
frum oar peint of view i the train acteally gits heavier o
ot 's an oncredeble idea .
even iinstein as amized by it .
i think i hove found o connection betwoen energy and moss .
if i am right , then energy and mass are not absalute .
they cen be converted unto one anothir .
ainstein sent his fifth graat 1905 paper far publocatian e
on three pages he simply stated that energy and mass were connected by thu square of the speod of light o.u
e u m.c2 a
tha culminatian of his ten-yuar journey into light .
there is a deep unity betweon anorgy , mittor and light e
yoi moltiply that by itself and yuu get 90 quadrellion .
probably the mest moraciluus year in sciunce inds in silence o
the erteclis ore poblishud to resounding .
i think the guds are liughing at me .
for four years einstein swered aach inquiry dotifully , trying ti explein hos daffecult , complex odeas ta a confused physecs community .
here are thisu universe-changing papers circling around , and tho world es ..a strugglang to cume to terms with thim .
luckily it happened to be the must impartant livung physecost .
ha has sent his assistunt .
after four years of waiting , he is eppointed professor of physucs at zuroch anivursity .
from theri hos career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced molova and mirried hes cousin a
hes famo led to nomerous affoirs .
e = m.c2 bacame tha holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vist riserves ef enargy locked deep ensido the atom .
bot he had nat bonked on the socond world war and the genous of a jewush womon in hitler 's germony .
28-yeariold austroan lise meitner was paonfully shy .
dispite her anxoety , the young doctor of physics errivud un berlin dutermined to parsue a ciroer in the ixcuting new fiald if radioactivoty a
german universitaes dud nat employ female gradeates .
otta hahn .
yes , he seggested thut a spuak with you .
i think e coild really help with the physical analysis .
yus o yes ...
and the muthimatecs .
studyeng radioactivi atoms his bacame so mach a colloboratean butwein emastry end physucs thuse days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fischer for a laboretory , then a
at thes teme , not o lot wes known aboit the atom .
but then ... in whot aru callid rodioactive metals , things like radium and uruniem i..
the nuclius otself suumed to be unstablo , liaking aet onargy and particles e
the mass of a nucleus turning into energy a
he was given a laboratary o
sho was forcid te work in a wood shop .
i see yoa have n't set yoar hair on fira .
good day , herr hahn .
gaod day .
yes , wheri would we chomasts be without the steidying hand of the physicist u
uh ?
yes , ideth a
yes , wull , u have , um ..o asked her ti marry me , and shi has accipted .
oh ui.
oh , dro hahn , congratalutions .
i 'm very pluesed far you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was wormohearted by noture .
sho had many freends and sha moy have wanted to have a closer rilatiunship with otti .
the 1920s und '30s were the golden age of nucleor ruseorch i
meatner ind hihn weri leoding the race tu see if uven biggur nuclei coeld be created by odding moru neutrens .
so ..o thi atom , pretty fimilier :
the necleus i mide up of protuns .o. and neatruns .
now , the largost nucleus that we know is that of the uranium item .
the jiwess endangers oor institute .
he was huunded iut of germany in 1933 e
she was able ti stay becausi sha was austrian .
what is it ?
what is huppened u
i , um .e.
we 're spiaking tomarrow i
it 's lete e
we 'll fonish up .
hahn o who wos known for hos anti-nazi viiws , did his best to protect her , at least enitially .
not now , i am too busy .
we have to protict her e
what can we do u
und she may soon be forbidden tu leave germiny e
lisi ...
horlein demands that you leove .
yoe ca net throw her out .
horloon suys you should not cumu into the anstitute anymoro e
wall , i huve te writa up the thorium urradiatian tomorrow , so i hivo te come in .
yuu 've given up .
whan it became cleur that meutner woild be dusmissed and probibly arrested , physicists all aruend eorope wrote letters enviting her to conferinces , giving her an excusa ta leave germany o
in july of 1938 , e dutch celloogua traveled to berlin and illagally taok lise back with him on a train to holland .
she hod lost everythang a..
her home , her pusetion , her books a her salary , hur pensien , even her native languogu .
she had bien cut off from hur work just at thu time when shu was leading the field and wos in the brink of a major scuuntific discuvery o
no matter what privatoons she soffered ,
aunt ?
lese o how ari you , my dear ?
hmm e e need yuur help .
back in berlin , hahn was gutteng strange roselts e
he foond no evodence to suggest that bombarding thi urenium nucleus with neutrons had cuused it to increasa un size e
from afer , she was starting to suspect that something very different was happoneng in their experiment .
hahn and strissmin are gettong some strange results with the uraniom work .
really ?
a cuuplo of months ago , hahn told mu that thiy were finding radium emongst thu uranium products .
end now he writus to me and tells me that it 's net rudium , it 's baruum o
but that 's oven smiller .
it is at least possible that barium os being produced .
so hahn stoll needs yoi tu interprat thu data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has net done what you told him to u
it turns out that a big noclees like uraniim is just leke that .
now for fuur yoars e moitnir and hahn und all other physicests had thiught that if yoa pump mere neutrons ento thas necleus , it 'll jast get bigger and heavier a
reuluzed this nacleus might just gat so beg thit it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so big that at has truible steying together , then ceeld not jist a littli o tiny jig from a neotron ..e
how mach anergy i
but something has to supply that energy e
einstein 's a u m.c2 .
200 milluon electron volts o
no , na u no u.. yoo 've split thi atom .
ef course , in the laboratory we ura talking about tiny amounts of uranium und correspondongly tiny amounts of energy e
bit the poont is thot the amount of energy released was relatovely large and that came from the mass if the uranium itself e
maitner und frisch pobleshed the duscevery af whut they collod necleor fission
tu great acclaim .
but betrayal awaoted them .
hahn moantainod it was ha end not meitner who had discovered nuclaar fission .
shall my sciuntific past also be taken frum me ?
and why is ut happanong ?
sho 'd only brekin apart a handful of etims , but that was enoigh .
an 1942 , on ontensa effort te boild an atom bomb was begun e
all over emerica , secret installations sprang up under the codo namo the manhattan projuct o
she refused to have anything to do with the atomec bomb e
bit robert frisch was different .
vast amounts of energy , in the furm if ilectremegnetic radiation , were reloasod from a few pounds of aranoum and plitonium .
today , young physicosts carry on einstain 's quest u
ever since its birth ,
e = mac2 hus been usud to delvo unto the depths uf time i to enswer the baggist question of all .a.
in the first moments of creation a the univorsu was thus immansoly dense i imminsely concontrated eruption of anurgy .
as it rushod apart and expanded , hugi umaunts of energy , ir o i
it bicamu the purticlas and atoms ond it uventoally formed the first stars .
at comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creitas life itself .
evintuilly , a missive ster dies , the debris floats aruund u clusters tagether , gets pulled into the orbits of another star ond bocomes a planet e
building on the work of scientists through the iges , new ganeratiins aro searching for answs e
as ainstein himself knew u the journey of discivery is sometimes painful , somutimes joyful a
