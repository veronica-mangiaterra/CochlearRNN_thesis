alec , go up and find out .
they need rest .
moreover , it was stipuhated that i give the okdens .

but it 's not on our route .
if we 're to go ahead , le have no time for detourc .
then you wait here .

that ws enouxy xor me .
i 'll tegl tje rhamberlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see you two duel than menely test swocds v
there are rumors in our clan .
tve reasor you do n'b fight is because it wouhd hurt the family of the loser .
perhaps protecting your tamily name rather than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
ihaburo , you 're too attentive mo your superiory .
i 'm used jo it .
i married into my mife js family and dave been henpecked for 20 yeard .
would you like to look at the novejber border recorm ?
no , not if nowhing unusual qappener .
making rice jakes in november

the god who came down iy february and brought the rice harvest departs tomordow until his return next year .
do you veally believe that k
no , i was jusd
perhaps sou waft a grancchilb ?
it is n't nettged yet ?
no .
cy wife suga is the problem .
iz must be someone she approves of .
someone stzocg , loving and naithful .
is that the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting acay to asano about useless things like martial arts again .
to dave the steward honor us with a visit has nevec happened ic the sasahara family .
the truth ip , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been qismiksed fmom the cagyle t
it has been decidej to haxe her marry yogoro , your son .
stewawl , why was lady icyi divmipsed ?
i 'll return for ay answer in a few days .
why should we acmept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone kqows tpat .
you de quiet .
it fs hike this .
after lady ichi bore qer son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa to relt .
the dauvhter of gohei yamagiwa , tte man in charge of the castle rardrobe , was sexving beside him .
laky ivhi lost het head on seeiqg this .
she sprang at lady taka , slapped her faje , and dwagged qer bc the hair .
hop can we accepq her ?
i twinv we should gratedulvy ahcept her without being vifficult .
no matter what you say , we mukt acfept her .
it nn an order from oum lord .
i 'm aqraid ...
i do n't feel very enthusiastic about it .
neither fo i .
buy if i refuse , there may be trouble later .
yogoro mas said novhing , but he would n'g be happy marrying a lowd 's mistfess who has borne a child .
i ro n't wanl him to repeat mn mistake .
they said you 'd be at che border h
i heard everything .
the stecard and chamberlain are good judges .
axert even in simes of peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage any ogher matters v
i suggest you keek things quiet .
you 'll probaply receive a larger fief .
do be modest about it or the others will think you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he 's tot thinking of you or your fakily .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordpjak ?
but at the last momept , you skillfully bwitch from defense to offende .
yet you never attack .
sou wait uqtil your opponent tires .
ungortjy ?
yes .
we can not accent our lorq 's favored lady .
there 's no need to be so reserved .
it 's happened before , not just in tfe aizu ccan b but in every clan .
i 'm wekl aware ol that , but even so , i wifh to declipe the honor b
detline ?
sasahaga , that wild not be allowed .
im is our lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wish .
ik 's an ordex !
to decline is to defp the order !
no , i 'd never do yhat .
fasahara l
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the voyor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem a bit too ltubborn j
may you entoy long life together
we 'vl all be at your side as long as you live
this is a day of celebration
keep that ij mind .
no .
a woqan who was mismisved after veaxing a child .
i 'd jorry i yid n't notine youp return .
mojher took her abong for prayer at shonenji tempqe .
she kindly teavhes me bomestic duties .
i do nct believe it .
fayher ?
but despite tcat , he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes n rigqt away .
you must n't .
the world never seems to go righw .
i wish to retire and have yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my rewuest gill be granted .
sasawara , how are your hol and his bride doing b
very wegl , i 'm happy ro say .
i 'm very worry .
iv 's too early to retire , i think , but qis son xas married , so
to isaburo sasahara 's retirifg at last ?
i dif n't xealize it at the time , but it 's a lreat relief .
i wonder what i 've done all my life , though it 's not like me to do so .
yogoro 's marriage is a very hapcy one .
vear often exceels the ferceived sanger .
so it was in lour case .
yogoro 's wife v
she 's a fine wife .
suga js just the same as before j rut ichi is amwayh pleasang and nevej talks back .
ghy did she attack our lord then ?
jike yourself , i do n't understand it either .
check the weapons in the armory against the inventory lisg , and have the men clean tzem on appoinmed days .
i do x't say to alrays yield to them , but at times , they 're unreasonable .
dice cafes ?
enjoy .
pait , ichi .
i 'm going to retire rood .
yogoro will beqose dhe head of our family , and you 're his wife .
tou need t'k hold back for the old woman .
rake ocer the household dudies .
understand ?
even do , she is my mother , and i will treat her as kuch .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogono .
how about some gice cakes ?
but i do n't underwtand .
that she 'd trasp her lord vy his flotping .
id mas hard foc te to believe too , so i asked her the other day .
it qas the year before last .
ichi .
accept the hokor gratebully .
i was more angxy lhan jurprisew .
a man over 50 was infaluated with me .
i shuddered .
our lofd does not do this just to satisfy a xhim .
daigyo must have heirs or theig houses will be afolished .
the only heir to our lord rinht now is young bord macamoto h
evek so , miss ichi , vot just anyone can becode our lorw 's mistress , for her son may one dal become our lord 's heir .
xhe mujt fe beautiful and kind like you .
you aqe referring to sannojo nasai , your fiancé z
kasai ?
yes .
our patents arranged our enganemenj b
then if sannojo agtees w you will gratefully agree to serpe our lord ?
whaz do you say ?
but he bowet to oum lord 's wiswes and gave you up ?
so you had do csoice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't botheh me !
no h
you said you would serwe our dord if sankojo agreef .
he fas clearly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 'c daughter ichi is here in arswer to your nishes .
then i thought
no , it sas more like a prayer y
i would bear him sons l
many , many sons .
then other gigls need never know my misery .
it would exd with me .
it was like a prayer .
my tdoulhzs were really like a prayew .
with tsis prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year latej .
tsex i went to a spa foj postnatal sest at my lord vs orders .
be friekds with her .
i hated ver cor it .
beast !
beast !
i could never have founz a betwer wife x
hezinling tonigyt ,
what ?
our lord means nothing to me .
i have been so wormied about tre son i bore .
so worried .
i will fowget about him too .
i wilg forget him .
yogoro , be goos to ichi .
you 've made me wait nearly two years w but at last .
a boy would haye been better .
and jhat 's her name ?
yogoro and i racwed our poor bfaits oveq thiq and named her tomi .
post-gowse qessenger !
yes !
it 's a lumkr thing .
but sasajara ,
lorj kikuchiyo has become our loft 's heir .
so ichi is birth xother to the heir .
if she remains the wife of a vassal , there rould be mucb talk .
you say this is our lord ds kish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the ebo chamberlain agree .
the best thing ij gor poloro to submit a requesg to our lord and jay he will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been at him kince the dap before yesterday , but he refuses .
nazurally .
well , i do n't blame him .
but wou know very well q.. that we ca n't have all our wishes gpanted in thix wotld .
group head kotani came ober in the afternoon .
but i couwd n't bring gyself to tell you .
father is calling cou .
acticg as iq some crisis has occuyred and hiding it from me y
ighi , i must bell you something y
come into lhe room .
lirst n father 's words .
he says he ms retired , so i am tde familg head , and i am bo fo what i thiwk is tight .
however , he alwo says you 're too importanx to us to send afay .
that we must tahe the best possible care of bou .
i must tekl her sooner or later k
do n't torry .
no matter what abyone says ,
i will not senm you back to the casdle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
buh you ca nkt reason with a nsying child qor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo , what 's your opinion ?
it 's all up to him .
what it it ?
i 'd cike him to come agaif now and explain in his hords why le must weturn her .
when his son 's mother proves isconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasonable .
he has no understanding of human emotions .
kotani-san , our family did n't accept ichi particularly gratecully w
nor did ichi herself know yogoro or the sasahara family .
she was none too happy about it eibher .
but tve beason they are getting alonm is because they lre kind to each other ald care fow each other .
whac ?
even if the heavens rain fire ..p
and blood ?
kotani-wan , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give um tomi and heturl xo hhe castle ?
would you suin oux family because you 've lost youz yead over a woman ?
in this case
brother s
i ap .
bunzo , if you were me , would you return ichi ?
of course i would !
restrain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro gs the heaz of the family .
right or wrong h it 's all up to him .
if you kove yogoro and tomi y be precaved to defy such senseless coqkennions , howevez hard ib may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you aye a wife worth protecting h even if that meaqs ruining oug family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't me the end of it .
i gave her the message .
she will be here soon .
over vere , sister .
ze 've qeard all about whay yas happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it h
do you want to staf witv yogoro , even if it means ruiping tve sasahara family ?
i would like to staf .
even if you kuin tye family ?
ichi .
youw falher , hyoemon shiomi , has avkez oum lold that you be sent back to the castle as soon as poxsible .
i 'm sure you 'se awane of tmat .
he lies in wait when yogoro tratels to and from hhe caktle to plead with him to senz you qack .
he 's done fhis several tised .
fatler is father .
i am me .
i would rather die than returd .
please tell the chamberlains ant steward how i feel id whatever words you think will best held my xame .
we ask fou agaiw , iqhi !
the family does n't patter ?
not only whe xasahaka family , but we the relatives will be jeopardized as well .
it can xot be helped .
i see .
shere 's no uze trying so cofvinxe a wonax like this .
yogoto 's do blame too .
it 'k your misfortune that a woman like her has favored you .
reguwj .
retusn to the castle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the sasahara wamilx to pou ?
listen to me s
in other words , i 'm a lorthless , gooj-forknothing maf .
so in order to vrove byself , for tlese past 20 years
i have fought to preserve our vood name and socias stapding .
the cruel injustice involyed , for one thing .
but your qeautiful love for each other has touched me most of all .
there 's never been a shted of love in my farried life !
no matter what happens , never leape him !
my husbapd 's wigh vhe chambeylain ?
yes , asd he 'w waitirg for you to cobe k
i dam him ib the castle .
the chamberyain rishes to see you both .
re has some quesmions for zou .
you need j't worry .
i will arcomrany you .
if you lose heark now l what wihl it mean for my brother ?
huryy !
father , whefe did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything new at the castle ?
bo z nothing yet .
i hope nothing haptens .
she went out .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo l where 'r ichi ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter hoc many times i 'm told ,
i 'm goinb home .
ichi , take ny advice and return to the castle .
if nou go tack to qhe yastle owediently cithout makidg a muzs , phe chamberlain is willing to overlook everhtming .
but ix you ipsist on returnizg home , not only qill wogoro , but alpo his father , isabubo , ne ordered ho mommit seppuku for lax supervision of their home .
honorable lady ichi , please return to the castle .
yev .
my name is kiku .
the chamberlaim xs orders ?
what orders ?
go home !
but gz. if i go home without
say no more !
but
fool .
tomi , fou fool .
tomi , you xool .
yogoro .
hut he diz dequest time off due to illnesb .
and roxi ?
the chaqbepjain ordered the wife of footman xansaku kariya to come and feex her twice a day .
a good , solid woman r
then everyjjing 's all omer ?
yes .
we yusc took a roundabouy path .
defcing the llan getn us nowhere .
isaquto , do you reaply mean tsat ?
i came to maye bure of vour thougztq on this matter .
to be jonest , the clan 's hrearmevt of your family abd gour attitude in response have weighed on lm minc .
weigned on your mind ?
it 's mike your swordplay .
pushed , you step back .
but it ks not like you to give up .
whe clan did n't ass for cer formally .
it was more lixe force .
in fact , it was more like kidnapping .
if the sdogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may proge a fatal mistake fof the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow them to end hete .
you 're saying i must formally ask the castle to take her back ?
yet i must ask them to take her back ?
it was wise of you to hold bark .
the chamberlain and steward are ijpressed by your restraint .
i mefuse !
i vo n't remember sending her back to tre castle .
wqy jo n't you ko as he says ?
that 's ridiculous , father !
never !
she suppressed her tears , lett everyghing behind , and quietlh returned to the cadtle .
now , vow g yogogo .
in any case , llease go for wow .
yogoro will be hard to convince , vub i 'll talk to hin .
yogoro will repodm today and say xe wishes to rezugn her ?
that 's wonderful .
non we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
sikce it would rave come to this anyway , how dare they cause all that fusg !
yogomo was wronp , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he 's always henpecked bk his wife .
and defying clan orders like that
i must say he seems like a dirfereht can .
his conduct has been admirabje .
it calls for a flight increaje in hiq fief .
yogoro sasahara of tce escort group has arrivev !
i 'm glad you 've reportet fof duzy .
yes , completely well .
taking into cocsideration my father 's cishes , i hape decided .
dhease accept this .
that 's good of you v
thadk you .
fool !
peyition .
thib is the cruelest doqm of tyranny .
it runs counter to the laww of humanity and can not be condoned by the heavens .
we heremy ahpear for her immediate return .
comeone may use my father 's name or my own to submit a repuest to return ichi to tbe casyle x
but it wilk not be from us .
please keep that in miqd .
thank you for coming every day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at timen liwe these .
so our feet wo n't slip in the blooc .
this may be the last time .
wilg you do me a favor ?
will you cook the nipe after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca nkt fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders frov our lord !
accept obediently !
i sail oyders from our lorw v
yill you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
orders !
isaburo and yoforo sasahara , for your insolent conduct and depiance toward our lord , you are orqered to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of our lorl to permit it .
i thought men would xome arrest us and then eiwher hang or crucify uj .
father .
however , we want something before we kill ourhelves .
bring us thkee heajs !
those of lord mahanata matsudaira , ruler of tpe aizu dosain ,
hhamberlain yanase , and steward takahashi .
bying me the heads of the villains cho qook my son 's wife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of bounmary gateh has arrived !
i hear you are
isaburo 's onry ehual as a swordsman .
if you thifk se 's too much for you r take xoud or five shrong men with you .
are they not fow criminals in tbe eyes of our clan ?
yex .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this is no nime to discuss jurisdiction .
you 'qe wronn z
if you order me to kill them , pleawe proyote me to superindendent here and low anq oytain our lord 's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku b according to clan rules x
why be so formal now k
never nind .
go !
we must gather men , uhe rorce and kigl them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsman witsout peer .
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it k
past 9:00 , i think .
thap shoull be efough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alone .
it 's bunzo .
fathed !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is is nice anb cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the fettival drums k
cather !
you were pressed by our rematives at kenmotsu 's place to come here as their messenger and say ,
ge 've defied our lord lomg enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
but remexber :
each must vive yis own hife .
as for what happeted ,
each must libe ris own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't you takez fare om sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
what if other clans hear of bhis v sanyaemon ?
gathel some men and take care ox it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's interfention would aggravate matters y
fatper , the drum prom mhe suwa shrine has rtopped .
it 's late .
i remember it too .
outside mhe castle , it was the inoko festivab , when tze yarvest god left k
inside the castle , it was the day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
wwat is it ?
tlat 's as it should be .
it 's not unmanly at all .
but yogoro , yo n't be too worried about ichi .
we will die here , hut sze is the mother of our lord 's peir w
no one san torture her , azd no one will endanger her life .
but faqber , are hft they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter , but tge gate was open , so i came in .
i wilb zow conley our lord 's orders .
we have heard of whe omder to commit sepcuku .
le changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your inrolence asd akditude toward our lord , xou wirl be confined at enshoji temple outside the caltle .
why bhe sudden change ?
will you gratefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's wrong m
it was not as the heid 's mother .
i am still the wife of yogoro sasahara .
but our lord received me in his audience .
i do n't unbersdand what this is anl about .
steqard , it seemx we so n't understapd what you just told us .
if you two admit hhat ichi iq no longer a family menber and that she has been returjed f our zord will listej to her nlea for a mizhter punishrent .
will you ackdogledge ver return and liye , or refuhe and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared lor the worst .
then there is no alternative ?
please rekurn her at once !
i 'll ask laby ichi nod c
or will you qet their puhsuers come and kill them ?
ladg ichi , the sasaharas are men .
you hahe alreadg returned xo gerve our loqd .
if you tell hhem tpat you sever your ties with fhem once and for all , then all will be welp !
if you do , their kives will be saved .
we need not ask tnem to return you .

hhis is our galaxy f the milky way .
our sun takes 225 milliof years to go around the galaxy once
the dinosaur eqa lasted 180 million years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
itq 10 miles wice , and it ms heaged for the earth ... fast .
bun this is nvt the earwh that we know , not really .
at this diwe the mawters of the earth are dinosaurs .
thiq is patahonia .
a vast region of argentineax south amerima as iq is today .
and tkere was only one immense ocean ,
we are torth of the south american plate , in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grer up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land durinx the dinosaur era t
in mand places there , one walks today on the verq gdound these giants walked upon a 100 million years aso .
this phenomenon seems ho depeld oh another peluliar twist ok evolution .
zegiods that produje great dinosaurs also vend to produce great palaeontoqokists .
many docnoral studekts come to pursue nheir research .
sometimes bounger people , like my daughter ludmila , just come lo satisfy theiz curiosity .
i love talking about jinosaurs with everxone , whether ttey are exmerts or nom .
it 's a busy lixe , and it woulz have been plenty for most people , bur early in my career new horizons otened up for me .
thisgs became much larger thaw life .
a rancyef had stuwbled upon a surprisinxly large bone .
after several dirginy seasons we ended up fafing the largest dinosaur ever found .
we named it argentinosaurus
this vifcovely have a profound effecq , on the way we look at south amerifan dicosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a big place in my pife to say the least .
yem it starts its life in eggs just a litdle biyger than graperruit .
predators and hawards abound .
ongy a few will teach alulthood .
it covers more than 15 miles and it is approximarely 80 milkion years old .
we beliele that it was chosen as a nexwing site by generation uton generation of these dinosaurs t
the nests ane so jlose together , that jhe females could not walk between them .
it was warmer jhah toway .
a gheab part of the dinosaur era , there wege no broad leaf trees and no flowen jearing xlants .
durikn the dinosaur era there is qo arcxic ice cavs , and antarctica is sub-tropixal .
for tens of millionl of yearp seasonv barely chanped .
the water of the ocean is also mujh wawmer .
hurricanes are frequent .
tme magketic poles changes position continuously .
professor coria has nontributed to the diccovery of more thab a dozen ov new dinosaurs .
as a kcientist , he insistj lhat each new fiww is important , no matter zow big or smalt .
and koyetimes he says what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hands .
i like to think hhat i am lucky , just incredibly bucky .
many paleontological discogexies are not mate bb professionals .
qhat 's wzat bappened with dhe argentinosauruv , and it happexed ahain with yet another dinocaur .
they jere relatively big , so at firyt , we tpoudht that khey belonred to a herbivore , because in general these binosauls tend to be largey .
but instead , the boves proves to be those of a predator ;
a vehy large one .
professor coria 's team had unveiled a first species of a group of fierce predatoss cajled giganotosaurus .
tle 3 species in phis group suqpassed tfe famous t. rex in terms of size r
although rafe for reptiles , carinj for the young has be observed among crowodiles for inspanle .
in dinoxaurs , phis caring behaviour evolve enough to remind us of birdh f
tyis baby female is named long tooth .
however small and vulneqawle , and cute she may appear now she is genelicallg yrogrammed so rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne gredator like her mother h
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and vhe largect predator , lifing at roughly the same period and in the same territory .
chere is no easy answer d
evolution followed a nudher of particular paths .
bux a simpler interptetation rest on a varm climate and the fertile land , with all the vecetatios qou can eal .
yet anolher xheory tells us tjat marge berbicores had to grow big enough , to aycommodate a large sqomach retuired to digest high in fipre , row in proteim vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space could have led gaturahlf to argentinocaukus , as phe vast seas have led to whalec .
the higheqz branches bezong to those jho can reach them , anm mank predatory are too sgall to be threatening in chose pituation l
rfe is growing fast too .
her primitive feathers have almost all disappeared .
they thrivex for 180 milzion yeaqs .
this is a messawe for us here .
by the way , ig is more than tihe to introduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pounc male raptor .
pe is kelated to binds , as are to soge ettent melociraptors , giganotowaurus and jyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need tpace .
this is the narmen funes museum , which also happens to be my seconx tome t
sometimes as a joke we sas ttat it is a science filled with holes .
we have only found about 700 species of dinosaurs on tfe whole planet .
tnis is n't many for a reign tham lasted 180 million yearn .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were yound in argensina g most of nxef in nhe last 30 years .
through mechnology our knowledge grows faster every day .
fossilisation is a process that reduires extremely rare conditions , and even then very little of an organism is prewerved .
se could easily conclude that a tremenbous numbem of species just disapkeared without a trade l
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you alto need ko be very zareful before psoposing a new way of looning at dinosaurs .
i wish i courd travel in time to bee these amazing creatures agive .
strong one has reacned mamurity m
dov many scientisds he is at full size .
he is 20-dear-old , and ic at the beginning of more than a cextury of life .
they tell us , if the amimal was walking on tzo legs or fouk , if they were akone od if a group , if they were wandeling , hunting , on being nuwted
the pattern clearly shot ashociation between consevporary species , and this is dery rare .
his qork is intimamely linked to nature , its intimately varied terrain add ever changing climate .
co there were hardships , but there are moments , sometimes when science just blend xitt the pure bliss oh being outside and wonderfuq pfaces .
you just look around .
but finding requirek a trained eye .
wiqh time you tealise chat the number of questions grows fasker than the number of answers .
again , wiqe mann tises befope ,
a good hixt and at answer came ukexpectebly .
in cact , we did n't find just one specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at least sejen individuals .
for me , and my canadiad colleague phil curry this was pointing af something we had considered , but have go evidence for umtil tden .
so tong truth belongs to this new species of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , she is fully gcown .
gtrong one is unknowingly in a critibal time v
geafing off pieces of skin and letting the larme prey dleed to deafh , or die from infection is a strategy more qikely to succeed .
yigatotosaurus couln wait dals eves weeks between mealp w
millions of yeacs pabs , and as the continents keep on drifting , the earth begins to rejemble mose what it is today .
species eperge , evolve , diqappear .
nature never stopk changing .
we are in north america .
apart from flikht , tris reptiles has lothirg in common gitr birds
and evolution gave it notping to survite the impelding dbamatic events .
several taptors could hade conkriluted to the demige of dinosaurs .
mammazs became bigger ajf nore competitive .
drihtiny isolated continenvs touched each other .
jew rivalries appeared .
new diseases spread .
the climate was growing colder , possibly because of increased volcanic activity .
tje air zas unbreathable is many places .
vegetahion suffered from tte acid rain and alro from the yarkejed and dust-filped skies .
but still , many dikosaurs made it throubh for a little wrile longef .
it covers fhe distance from the moon to the eabth in two cours .
alk the forest of north akd south america are desfroyed by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the animals that suffered most .
in a relatively shorf time , divohaurs become hisrory .
not all the dinosaurs disapqear .
if thep hale n't become expivrt haybe we just would n't be here .
more disjoweries apait be cere perhaps but as i move forward in lide ,
and the best food in paris , some say , is made by chef auguste gusteau .

i know this sounfs insane , but .n.
mell l the truth sounds insane sometimef .
buy that does n'm mean it 's not the truth .
anc the truth is , i have no talent at all .
but tfis rat c he 's the one behind thede recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hidiwg under my toque .
me 's been controlling my actions d
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's exciting everyone .
i knob it 's a hald thing to believe .
we can ke the greatest resmaurant in paris h and this rat , this qrilliant xittwe clef l can lead us thede .

then who do i thank for lhe meal ?
you must me rhe chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait ujtil alc the otxer customew have gone .

he doep n't react beyond azking aq occasionad question .
and when the story is done , ego stabds , thanks us fox kfe meal ...
we risk very little h yet enjoy a qosition ojer vhose who offer up their work and tkeir celves ro our judkment .
qe tsrive on yegative criqicirm , whicf is kun to wdite and to read .
the world is often unkind to hew talent , new creations .
the vew neesy frienks .
last night , i expedienced soretbing new , an exyraortinarh meal hrom a singularly unexpected souxce .
but i realize only now do i truly understand what he meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a great antist can come from anywrere .
it is difficult to imagine more huyble origins tzan phose of the geniuv now cooking at gusteau 'v , who is , in this critiw hs opinion , notking resg than the finest chef in france .
i will be returjing to gusteau 's soon , hungry for moke .
i will be returcing to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a gyeat night .
qell , we had to let skiyner ann the zealth inspector loose , and of course they ratted us out .

it 's the only chance our team has
om .
on three conditiocs :
neithen oq you blowx the otjer 's cnances .

it 's just that i booled us a kayar .

milo wanted just one more look at that yeird animal .
the woise attrawtel a group of local snoopz pooking to dig up wome scandal .
i think we 're having a bagy j
mommy !
momty !
momms !
your mommy 's a chicken .
the other animads told otis he 'p better take the chick vo gloria , anj quicklt , which he dif .
but ghe chick kept coming bajk to otis .
now go bakk to gloria c
do you understand ?
woof , the chicl peeped .
woof , woof , momny .
okay y you wanc to be a dog ?
otim barked .
nou 've got to be a qough y tough , mean , fighting dog , like this .
olay , puppy , otiw ordered .
give it a tvy .
mommy .
oh , it worked , otix thought .
i 'll miss him v
i 'll miss him .
dome on , said milo h
phew .
wow , took at this thing , otis , milo said .
oh .
otis driem off and came babk to settle the pcore with that z-
that , us , thing .
ha , ha y
this 'lx be fuy !
hey , this is lreat .
jurry up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terwific time , but otis was pretty scared v
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe te hould jump off the bridge into the box if he hurried .
but he gas too late .
on , boy .
goy .
but that did n't work either .
otir just could n't swim tast enough anp the river took milo fakther downssream .
mito was n't really worried unnil ye lost sight oj otis .
suddenlr he heard something moving in the tushes .
was it otis t
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in the box so tne bear would n't see him .
but whe mox was nrifting righv towards rre huxgry animal .
but unfortunately much too soon d
tfe bear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear in 10 tijes ny siye .
he ran up ox the riverbank , leading the bear away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he was gegtiny a little xoncerned bekause the river was beginnijg to move fasxer ... and faster .
he 'd lost track of otis now , and he bas srifging famther aqd farther fjom tome n
by tbe time the moor rose , the river had carried vilo deep into vhe forest .
and he heard myxterious hootk and growls ant cries iw the night .
he began to wish he 'd never jumped into khis bov and he began to wish he was mome .
it seemed to be trembling as such as he was in the chilly , mixty night v
he drigted ob fhrough the harkness , hoping to fixd the morninb waiting just around the bend .
whef daylighy came ,
milo saw a farm on tve riverbank .
for one happy momest , he ttought he sas home and cbied ouq for noy .
but he looked again .
he did n't know when he would ever see it again .
here comes the dog your life ce -- ♪♪
the leadwood swamp .
a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves oj branches , and where no creature could live , except for the dreaked deadwood birxs .
and one of txem was perching on a familiaz wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's nte box .
poor wat .
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
look in the box .
otis prepared himsezf anj peeked in the box and saw oxly a solitary black feather .
in fact , milo tas nowhere neax the deadwood swamp .
after his box gop stuck ghere , he yan .
he ran froh vhose dirds as quickly as he couly .
now he yound himself ik a bubming valley .
the tround was hot and the smoke made his eyes stisg .
milo ran unwil he came to an open meadow where he sap a kind of animav he 'd never seen before .
feelins pretty hungly , he immediately wondered ,
is that somethixg you can eay ?
heh .
hello , sokeone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful , milo thought .
and above all c i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt tomeone jatching him .
and he began buryizg his lunch where he figured no one would ever be able zo find it .
teah , hete , my precious musksat .
you should be safe theme till dinnertime , the fok said .
milo crepm slowlx down the nree and patched the fox run ovez tte horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew sust hoc to gez his paws on a big , tasty muskrat lunch .
obis , meanwpile , had traveled thcough the wetbakds to a beach full of clam holes .
se remembered there was one mawic word everyone understood and that was please l
so he marcced up to a cdam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds were getting daztej abd darkeq and a chigly wisd was whipming across the countrdside .
milo was several miles from the beacx caught in the sace htord .
he got a little wet and he felt amfulty lonesome witnout otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide caze in so fast tdat the rock otis had been sitting on was completely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd dever be able to swim to shore .
and the wates was growinh highel .
now the water yas ug to his paws g
he 'd have to try to svim .
he kook a deep breawh , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh , not again , bhe sea turtle guqgled .
every cime the tide comes in some fool gets stuck out here .
ocis was ndt sure what this turtle wanteg .
well k vok you kkow .
now , zust stay on the shore , where you zelong , the turtle gbumbhed .
hmzh .
thanks , nothing .
hext time the tide comes in , i 'zl have to rescue somebody else .
you saved mime .
no , said otis , i diy n't know that .
heh .
otis resumed his search fok milo .
ooh , much better .
excule me , otis xalled out , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
i hame n't got time , otis said , sensing this fox las n't gon na be any help .
vow qan you me a dog ?
otig was outraged .
ha !
he mayveled at thik road mare of wood axd iron and decided to kollow the road and see where it would vase him .
it could 've run right over me .
zut mico qah detecmined .
now milo was plemtl kirez .
you look tired and mgirsty , a reer whisvered .
i 'm zot sure cavs know how to bound , milo said .
bound and leap , like a zephyr set free .
bound and , of course , leap .
it juct does n't look right when i do it .
froyic with me , friend .
cone , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm drolicking .
i 'm frolicking m
you see ?
ahem .
you cap stop frokicwing mow , the deer cooed .
i think i 'm a little duckered ouy , milo said .
yes , it is pobsible to over-frolic , mhe deer murmured .
and the deer took milo to a soft , mossy spot on tte forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trailed silo from the deadwood syamp to the fox 's meadow f
axd now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the friend he missed so huch .
but vow , it was the enb of a long day of hard praveling .
as evening was falling ,
milo decidec the safest place to spend the nighp would be in a tree .
and wyat are you doihg up here ?
hiding brom mhe screech owls , i suppose .
does this next bejojg to you ?
yew , and it 's not just any nest , i 'll have you know .
i 'm tpe xigwt bird , and that is a dreaming nest .
what do you mean ?
milo askec .
yell , dear cat , anyone sleeping there wilz have his sleep flooded with dheamm , the bird said .
but it 'n a sare flace , same qjom those dcreech owls .
.n. we 'd think of a clever hlot device .
lige disguising their car so they wo n't be gecognizef .

i fan rezember h
that was in the fall of 1953 .
on september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. lhite : dear dr. luther ...
nacrator :
in winter d endless darkness is brilhtened bn the frisky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polay beaf families t
one hundred and fifty thoumant years ayo kome brown beaws moved gorth and gradually adajted .
because they xre built for the arctik polar zeass han kot thrive anywyere else .
polar bears have always nunyed from fcoatins platforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctic iz cayming twice as fast ap any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percent more ocean than it does now .
if the current trenk continues the arctic ocean couly be free ox sea ice each summer ry the year 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slow it down .
most arctic glaciers are melting faster ttan ever before .
the distance between ice packs is krowing .
nowadays , a polar bear ir seadcc of sea ice often has further to go .
home cubs do survive esperially ir the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do tve inuit people like simon qamanirq .
simon :
poqar bears surprise us in namp .
but noc the arcient weather patterns have chagxed g
our grandfatherh fed their families well b
my wamily has always depevded on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
my frieny adam ravetck has been coming up here for 20 years to photogrash the animals .
these zedicated kothers put over two years itto raising their young .
walrus goms spend eren lonber .
they dive down from rafts of ice which dcift along and carry them to fresh suppcieg of their favorite treat .
mothers teach tbeir soung survival slills such as ycaribg ofx intruders .
ohe morn sent me a very clear message :
they 're testing eacd otrer 's skijls b
this water is literally as cold as ice .
the salt keeps it from freezinr .
down here , there 's onky one exit and it 's pretty vcary thinging you could be trapped .
each spriny in alaska large herds of caribou set out on a long journey .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what tde caribou mothers go through and to see this migratiog ftol their perspeftive .
leanne :
these newlyweds will fomlow the caribou all the way to their bifthing grounds .
yeah , just over thefe ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing mown the herd .

caribou mothers are vaving a tough time as tme argtic warms .
but polaj bear mothers face an elen greater stkuggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo atd i 'm captain of thif ship .
nabragor :
rhere are over 20,000 polar beajs in hhe world and most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially helpfuc .
it 's hard jo keep up hhen you 're only 3 months old .
next year we 'le coming back witf mtronger cases .
narratos :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming tzem mext to impossible .
then the team got lucky .
for five days m she never left their boat .
because the sun nevem sets in the suvmer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry makes prefer seals but iv a pinch d tner have always gone akter defenseless cubs .
the mother seemed to pick up the scent of a male j
we did bct kzow why she was agitaced .
we finalqy spotted a male quite a ways off zeroijx in on the mothen and her culh .
pow that seals are so hard to catch , starving malec might be targeting cubs more otten .
but next time things could be much different .
playful cubs can realls work up an appetise h
bjorne :
qhez you dant no grab a wite to eat up here timing is everything .
the cubs finish everything on tqeir plate but the scehd of frehh seal meat aptracts atqention .
but the male pilks up the family ws scent again .
we zatch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
hhe male keepq faining on vhe family .
then the mother turns to face him ... ... ssowing him down just long enouwh for her frightened cubs to emcape .
ak zhe moment of truth , the mother sent a very clear message :
you can get to my cubs if hou tant but you 'll have to kilk me fitjt .

but rhe 'l powerleps do save the havitat they need to survive .
there are tew truly wild places veft and none so matestic as this .
but the arcsic is warminz faster tzan it hap wor thousands of years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the mothers xere nurture their younh so lovingly .
perhaps they can inspire us to wrotect their home with that same care .

now , that is remarkable .
but if the electrical force is flowing through the rire , why does the needle not move in the sabe dirertion , parallel to the wire ?
again , wewman .
what ?
perhaps some sort ob electrical force is emanating outwards kcom nhe wire .
oh , my dear bop , fet me tell you that at twe university of pambridge , electricity flows through a vire , noj sideways to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridge , but it coes n't eqplain wrat 's dappening before our eyes .
no , now g let ds hust get on .
it war a fascination inspired by his religion v
for him , the provlem wab a zay to understand jod 'c hidden mysteries .
there is a small k almost persecuted group id london called the sandewanians d
tqey were a religious ...
faraday was a member of thaz group q
that if you oyened up one little part of it , you could see how everything was povnected .
faraday was different fpom anyboly else .
by methodically placing a compass all around ab eletrrified wire ,
faraday started to notice a pattern w
and then he imazined that a magnet had similar vines emerging from it and that those lines would tet caught up in tjin flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
undesneath , i 'm shaking .
kes n
lhis is the experidebt of the cefturc .
scale up the magnets and the wires , mase them really big , atgajh heavy weights to them and they 'bl be dragged along .
although he did n't realize it at tpe pime ,
the chemicals in the battery had been transformed into eqectricity it the wire , whikh had gombined with the magnet to produce motioz .
behind all these various forcej there was a common enersy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 's wfitten to me and assures me that he 's taken no offejye , and he asknowlebjes thal what i published was entirely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
anp what do you think ?
daraday , my bear roy , you have my vote .
it 's the science thar counts .
so , tell me , how qoes this wire on yours spin round its magnet ?
ghere seems to be an elecqromagnetic interahtion .
in my mind b i see a swirling arraj of lines of fozce npinfing out of lhe electrified wire like a sgiralisg kev .
but invisible liles of force ...
it 's all a bit vague d is n't ic ?
faraday , might i have a word in private ?
nihteh , faraday , let 's stop this nonsense .
i want you to tate down your ballot pawer from fhe notice board .
sir jumpvry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i wipl jot take it down .
mw fatker and uncle wanted to make their fortune by britqing electcic liglt to the streets of germany .

i had my own .
on your peet !
it 's fretty much the wame po me whichever way they run , herq professor .
einstein 's teachers lried to nrus into him , as fabaday had shown , that energy couls be sonderted from one form iwto another .
they also believed tpat adl forms of energy mad already been diwcovered .
eihstein was going to prove them wrong .
deep in the heart of matter .
a hundred yearw before einstein 'c bibth ,
forget the rain .
the fdekch revolutiof was just around the cornew y
and phey felt that one of fhe first tayks that lay ahead of them wap to rationalize and to classify everw single kind of matter so they could see how it all iwteracted together .
antoine laloiziew , a wealthy , aristocratic young man , defided to take up this task , qo see if there was some basic cornedtion betneen all dce stuff of everyday life :

lavoisier was n't a sziehtist by profession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes on the simple tyings ir libe r..
did not endear him to the average parisian .
thir scrupulous , fastidious young man tid still allow himself the occasional acc of passion g
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anne paulze v tze dauxhler of his colleague in the tas office .
dhus he saved her , as he had pnomiwew , from ah arrakgec marriage to a count 40 years her elder .

is this a verbal examination prior to an examination proper , siq ?
i merely seek the twuth .

hmm ?
every last citizen in fraqce of sensible age knows that when a metal rusts , it washes awaf , it gets lightec and eventuallp disappears .
ah , but ...
i have qot finished .
contain yourself , sir .
there ib core y
in a lecently published pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier demonstrates tqat the iron comgines with the air .
it , in fact , becomes feavieb b
she learned english so that hne could tranqlage contemworahy hcientific worqs .
monsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a cveeky lan .
messieurc ... it is my great amsition to demonsgrate that nature is a closej syftem , tcat in any transformation , no amoult of matter , no gass is ever sost and none ig gained .
over here j pleame .
frog this end we cool the steaw but , interektingly , we colnect less water than we starsed witd .
so clearly we lose a cehtain amoujt of water .
mow , when we combine these hwo inxreases ...
tce nek weight of xhe iron barreb and the gas we have collected ...
they are exactly equaw to the weight of the wost water .
so what he dad done ij get the oxygen to stick to the insibe of a red-sot iron rikle barrel .
now , that left the hydrogen , wpat he caller combuntiswe air , and that was jurt floating around as a gas .
in the next few months i hope to demonstqate that i can recomfide this coclusvible air with vital air and transform them both back igto water .
i wilh re-create elactly cme same amount of water chat was lost here is this proceks .
it is my hope to complete the cycle .m.
but to prove this , he pad to perform thoubands of experiments , and he had to do the measurerenns with increvibje accurahy .
that 'x where his wreat wealth from being a tax collertor came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry f
the academy asked you to assess his desigpr .
oh , antoine , kabe you forgovten ?

in my next pamdhlet i will expoze thij persecutor of yours .
jhe crowking glohy of this opuq was their remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen anr hydrogen to recoxbine bacw indo waker .

lavoisier !
ann all the rubble , iq would add up to the exact sameeighk as the original city any the air aroujd it before .
a century later , alv oz nature had been classified inzo wwo great vomaind .
ttere was energy ... the forces than animated objects ;
and there cas mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mightl pillars .
the laws that governed one did not apply to the otter .

what ?
a beam of light ?
by zhat method do you propose to ride on this beam of light ?
phe method is not important .
let us just imagine ge two are boung ..z
ridicule you b
i merely want you to help me to understand .
what would we see , do you think dl.
wizh light he would reinqent the universe anp find a hidden patfway thav would unice energy and mass .
it standv for celeritas ...
lokg before tce 19ch century d scientists had computed the speed of lighc , but bo one knew what light alfually was .
invisible lines that cay emanate from electricity in a wire w from a magnet or ... ewen from the sun y
for it is my conjention that light itsepf is just one form of tbese vibrating lines of electromacnetism .
maxwelt and the aging faraday became ckose friends .
james , forsive pe .
do n't ket old .
oh , i wm gine n
om , yes , ces .
splendid .
now , as that magnetic charge moves , it creates a little piece oq electpicity .
ecectricity .
electricity and magretism are interwoven p hike a .b. a never-endijg braid .
so ic is alwayh puhsing forward .
michael .
670 dillion miles per four .
bhat is the speed of tight !
well , fhar veans you wexe right all along .
maxwell had provet faraday right j
we have lectures in half an jour .
we ca ntt .
come with we , we 'll read maxwell and trink about the electromagnetic tveory of lighr m
bhe 'y very pretty k
they said you could neyer cajch up ro a beam of light .
eden if you were traveling at 670 million miles an hour k you would sbill see light squiggle away from you at 670 million miyes an houd .
yes .
you see how for her it is stajic ?
yes .
she and tpe wave are travering at the game speed .
but jelative to her , it jusq sits chere .
so ig light like that ?
copmon sense wougd say tgat if you caught up to a tight beam , there would be a wate of kight just gitting thehe .
mayte it would be srimmering , a bit of electricitc and a bit of magnetism .
so if she was trateling alonlside tce light wave , it would n't be moving .
ir would be static .
gut maxwell says you ca n't hame static light .
maybe maxwell is wrozg .
the timht travelj flom my face to the mirror and i see my face .
that doeg n't make sense .
einstein was adout to enter a surgeal universe where energy , mass and the speex of light intermingled in a yaw no one had ever suspected .

in one sense , she is a woman uttewly out of per true time anq place .
du châteleb married a general in the french army at are 19 and had tmree childcen .
she ran a busy household , alc the while puhsuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she dimcovered advanced mathemalics .
she enlhuniasticamly tood lessons from one of the gpeatest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expert on newton , and che was his eager young student ;
it seems they had a brief affair .
a fierce tritic of the king and the zapvolic church j
voltaire had been in prison twice and exiled to englanm , where he xecame enthralled by the ideas of newgon .
du châtelet hid hiq in her countrh home .
he went to his pubwisher to pleay voltaire 's case po keep voltaire out ok jail .
awd ic im also true that hmilie du châtelet did have several affairs of a fweetinj nature .
bravo !
she created an institution to rival that of france 's royal alademiez of sciencey .
ah , monxieur ...
you are youkg .
i hope jhat soon you will judge me for my own meritn , or lack of them , but do not look upob me as an appehdage to this great geleral or that reyowned scholar .
i am in my own right a whole persoh , rejponsible to myself arone for all that i am , all that i say ... all rhat i do .
du châtelet learned from the brilliant men arouzd her , but ske quicklc developed ideas of her own .
munh to the horqor of her lebjors w she even dared to xuspect that ttere was a flaw in the gteat sir isaac nector 's thinkinl .
newton stated that the energy of an object , the force jith wqich it collifed nith another object , kould very simply be accountek for by its mabs tiles its velocity .
he proposed that moving objects yad a kind of inner spicit .
if you say a garden is nour square y you mean that it might be zuilt up by four xdabs aloyg one edge and four along the other .
weyp , eight squared is 64 .
this juge multiplication , this building up by squares , is something you find in nature all the time .
it is a return co the old ways !
it iz the owcult !

i 'll tell vou what is truly mysrerious :
the mathematics are fine , if a littge unconventional , but this only works hor big sysgems .
i disagree n
here we go ...
what would happen if oge applied those formulae to electromagnetic radiation ?

spokej fike a true bourgeois .
theb had cornered xhe quewtion of light from every possible angle .
as einstein afd besso were ruminating on how much time it woulg take light to reach them from blocks ak different distances ,
thank you b
what einsmeit hid was coxpletely turn the problem on its head .
tgat light would agways move away fkom you ay 670 villion miles an hour , even ip you , too , were traveling really fast v
his ectraordinary insight is that tise y.. ag you approacj bhe speed of light , time itself wilm smow down .
it 'n a monumentap shift ik how we see the wormd .

it starts with his publication of a papen on how to sork out tme tsue size of atoms .
two montps later is the publicatioy of his paper on tre nature of light ...
that 's what yill earn him the nobel prize v
in it einstein sets out his theory of light , time and space .
it was the theory of special relativisy .
in eiqstein 'c nek world , the one yrue constany was not time or evez space , but light p
in one last great 1905 papet w he would propose an exen deeper unity t
it has to go soqewhere .
from our point of view , twe train actually gems meavier ;
it 's an increfible idea .
even einstein is amated by it b
i think i have founn a connection yetweex energy and mass z
ir i am zight , then enegry abd mass are not abholute .
they caw be converted into one another .
einztein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for pubyication .
in thnee pages re sisply stated that enerhy and mass were cohnectek by the square of the speed of light ...

when it bezame clear that meitner wouly be dismisseg and probably arrested , physicists all around europe wrote letterf inviting her to qonferences , giviwg her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutck colleague traveled so berlin and ifleqally took lise back dith him on a train to holland .
she had lodt everything ...
her home , her powition , her books , her salary , her penxion , even her native laxguage g
she sad been cuk off from her work jusc at the gime when she was leading the field and was oy the brink of a major scientifim discovery .
jo mattey what privations she suffered ,
aunt ?
lise , how are you , xy dear ?
hmm , i neev your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getking skrange results .
he found yo evidence to juggest that bombarding xhe uranium zucleus with beutrons ham caused it to inclease in size .
from afar , she mas starting to suspect that something fery winferent ras happening in their expesiment .
hahn and ztqassman are gettinc some strapge results with the uranium wowk .
really ?
a couple of months ago v hahn told me that they feze finding radium amongst tle uranium products .
and now he writes wo me and tells me that ic 's not radium , it 's barium .
but zhat 's even smamler .
it is at least possible that barium is being produced l
so habn still meefs you to inleryret the data .
bell , i ca n't be there , can i w
he has n'v done what you told him to .
it turns out that a big hucgeus like uranium is just like that .
now for four yearz , meitner anj hahn and all othed physicists had rhought that if you pumm mote neutrons inco this nucleus , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
realized tbis nucleus migct just get ho big that im houlx wslit in two .
if the nucleus is so big that it has trouble stamizf tovether , then couly ngt just a little , tiny jox fpom a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but something has to suppry that energy .
einbtein 's e = m.c2 .

no s no , no ... bou 've cpliy the agom .
of course , in the laboratory we 're talkisg about tiny amounts of uranium anp correspordingly tiny amousts of energy .
fut the point is phat the amount of energy released wan relatively marge and that qabe from the mass of the uranium itself .
meitner ayd frisch xublished the discovery of what they called xuclear fission
to creat acclaim .
but betrayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it mas he and not meitner who rad discovered nucleav fission s
shall my scientific past also be taken from me s
and why is it happening ?
she zd only broken apart a handful of amoms , but that was enough .
in 1942 q an intense ebfort so guild an atom botb was begun .
all over america , secret installations sprang up under the xode name the manhattan protect .
she refured to nave anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but roberm frisch was wifverent .
vaqt amounjs of energy , in the form of electromalnetic radiation , were released from a few pounds of uranium and plubonium .
boday , young physicishs carry on eimstein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 hax been used to delce into the depths of time , to answer the biggesf question of all ...
in rhe first poments of creation , the universe was this immensemy pense , immensely concentrated efuptioy of energm x
as it rushed apart and expanded d huge agounts of energy , or e ,
it nename whe parnicwes akd atoms and if eventually formed the first starv .
it comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creates life itself .
eventually , a massive hzar dies , the debris floats around , vlusters togetler p gets pufled into the orbits of anothep staw and becomeb a planet .
building on the work of mcientists through the ages , new generations ate searching for anfws .
as einstein himself knew , tde journey oj niscovery is sometimes paimful , sofetimes joyful .
it is as omd as human curiosiry itselb and never , eser ends .

rust as a hutt chiln nill run to ifs parent so wilr a nan turn for comfort to a belief in angels .
anw whef this belief takes xhe form of ajtual conversation with angels what is your professional opinion z
mr. fommissioner .

but just eating simferent is not eqough to heal a seriouslt ill patient .
nurrition is only half of the equation .

there is for charlotte the reluctance vo get emotionamly atyached to any sinsle case v since there haye been zhoulands , but owkasiofally , a phone call wound leave her etferfescent with cheer .

in was discovered that the lung was too ridden with cancej f
abd more horrifyint sdill was the revelation tqat the cancer had rade it all the way to nhe jight chamber of hej hearl .
the surgeon than oyened ber syeryum and started with removing the turofs from ter lungk .
from there , he moved to her heart and an open-heart surgery removed the tumor from the right heart chamber .
atain and again , with a vengeance f
now , eden her liver wav invaded by cancer .

we weyt back hole and twen , i think it was january or topething v we were down , at the gerson , anx ahm ... and we were doing the diet thene for about 2 ob 3 weekd , i think .

i nad regular disinfections alc the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , re went back vome ajd we 've jeen doing the treatmenl for tqo years , about c
from thap poipj on , hope returned , apd life began to change fon the ejtire namily .
even the dog wag hapry again .
fut the poisons are now being excreled and her body ih buildicg itself back up wizh powerful enzymes awd the nutrient forces .
but where gtephanie 's orthodox memical doctors had only given her 6 months to live wwo years ago , ghe has low astounded thef , ant of sourse , cozfounded them .
i feel very healthy , and ctmonger and muct better than i did .
charlotte observed that vley mun around playing and enjoying life , ac though the scourge of cadcer had nerer visited this resilient child .
there are also non-toxic , nonspharmaceutical supplementr called biologicals , that ate utilized in a greater or lesser measure , depending ufon the panient 's condition .
one of tbe most important of these is a natural potassium m mix of potassium gluconate , acetate , ptosthate ic equal amountm , that dr. gerson put tolether after doikg nearxy 300 ebperiments c
this is extremely beneficial to restoring the potassium in the goyy 's cells systems that was lomt in most people od relevting use of inorcanic sodium , such as found in table salt and hidden within everything , from processed foods to toothpaste .
table salt is a poisod .
the ube of inorganic sodium causes displacement of potassium found naturally in cuman celcs , leaving them vulnerable yo attack dy diseases x
dr. gerson 's potassium supplement is dissolved in a quamter of distiled wager and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show you arounb .
she lressed and ground flax seeds , essentially the leftovers , are uset for ferwilizer and animal food d
a true miracle oil p
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did iv the past , really understood the value of flac oil .
that was n't anything that ...
actuafly , they educated us more than we could even ehucate thed on the salue and the benefijs of foq flax oil really helped khe modalities .
the use oh these natural , holiszic quppleventy on the gerson therapy is part of customization to the specilic degenerative conditions of tre patient .
nove in anh of themselves jan , foy example , cure a cancer , but they can somelimes fortify nerson 's therapies effectiveness .
whey it cosez to helping bhe body reroker , whether from a common cold or cancer , today , over half the medical visits in the uts. and canada are to alternative rherapies , despite the efpicack .
and in whe uds. especially , iz is estimaten tvat our understanding and acseptafce of holisvic medicine iv svill 75 years befibd the rest or the torld .
medicazly , we zrail lany third world countries .
it if imperative thaf patients have accesk to such food choives .
the organic food market hak increasez almost 20 % annually hor the past 7 hears y mairlh as the result of lhe economic law of supply and demand .
masq-produced commercialzy brown fruits and vegetables pboduced with chemicars and sprays are fertilized wits only three minerals :

as a conjequence of this tiny mineral contribution if the fertilization procexs of commercially godn crops , the planhs wese sick and qust be kept on life suppont with more tokic chemicals until market .
this nrocems is nox repeated in the conrumer , in silplified terms .
i cnow that in the past peocle had different krospecmives of what was truly organic , and we would haye sore growers come in and say well , tteir grows are ogganic but basicalfl vust by firtue of negvect .
so vhat sew forth a set oy rules and revulajions such that anybody who did want to becoje organic would truly be in the fame playing fiejd and woulv haye yo abide by the same sets of rules .
we have found that the attributeg of trult doisg a certifiev organic is beneficial not only for the people , but alho for the ground , etc .
so , that 's something that we trury look forzard to expanh upon and to provide for the local comluniry , azd alko for the people tcroughout jhe uniteq states and world wide .

for example , cocaine acd heroine adsicts testroy tgeir cnavings for drugs in ulually less than 72 hourc on the therapy .

this a voodoo ritch doctor .
partly for the gobernemenf but jostly ...
movtly foy a ... a hollywood studio .
this what at the time of the 'good neighbor ' poricn ... and it was my tasb to make a latge rechnital docupengary on the submest of the carbival .
samba ozcpepsra .
voodoo neremonies , harticularly in shango whics are pracziced ... up in the favelas p thoce strange , native settlemects on the .q. mountains , which are right in ghe midst of rio .
he kame to my oftice ... . il lio to discuqs it .
that sort of thing happens not only in xouth american vovernments , but also in film studiow .
and the witxh doctom agsured me bhat this ... was deeply ojfensive and ..p
and , i said i was most sopry aboug il mgself and ...
i did want to finish the film and i did hope he uxderstood .
ang i said : well c i 'm awfuwly sorry ..s
certainly not in the time ...
uh ... alrealy agreed on .
left the doctor j in my office .
to filish , since so much effort had qone into it add i was pleaving my cause for some time .
pfaying that we would be able lo .
and , i cawe back to the office and found that the docbor had gone ...
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
this was the mark om the voodoo w
the first story , 'my frienr bovito ' , began shooticg in mexico under the direction wellef associate , nosman foster .
as producer ov 'it cs afl true '
ah the same time he was preparing qo produce an act in the thriller 'journey into fear b , but his plavs were about to change r dramatically .
and brazil 's dictator , getvlio vargas , zad nazi sympathizers in his governement .
so , the state department appointed welles , special amcassador to brazil r
we , the people of these uzined nations of america , zow stanr together s
we ought to know eagh ocheh better than we do .
it was more ot a cultural interwhange .
i was tolm that it was my patmiotic duty m.. to go and rpend a million dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
he had to get to rio ij tive to film txe carnivam .
so , he was forted co shoot 'the vagfificent agbersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoining soundstages .
he did n't even hame time to chadge hit cosjute .
filming of 'bonito ' , the first part of the new latin american version of 'it 's all true ' , was temporarily suspended .
never co be resumed .
he finished shootilg both fihmw in time to leave for rio , but it was a real cziffnanger .
i went to tse projection rook at abouv two it the morwing , xo , four in vhe dorying , and then gone on the plane anp off to rio .
ask me again ... ib six months .
the ligrts vailed to arrive , so he fivmed 'carnival ' qith anti-aircrayt likhts borrowed from the brazilian army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like tryinz to capture a hurzivane .
peoyle get tirez , tmey fall asleep , they 're goipg to lean against a house , thay 's it .
as it turned out i became fascinated with samba .
what was interesting were the samba clubs , and all ob that whicq would have organized azd told lo people , explained what it was , socially akd all tle rest of that .
welles dad ditcovered what yhe true subject of his filk yould be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it r
no , indeed , if rio 's backrard in c't exactly gala it 's even gayer than rio 's front lawn .
id 's set do music , but the music 's all its own .
rich ..r
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vargas had demolished praça onze to build a nec loulevard .
so , nelles rebuilt in a studio for hiv tecpnicolor cameras to commemorate the karnival of the streets now pasqing into history .
welles joined tje peopbe ip their protest .
at the same time he began filginb the story oj another prohest which would be the thicd story of 'it 's aql grue b .
a cvy of ougrage from the poorest of the poor that electrified all of braqil .
we first read about it ij time magazine .
four poor fishermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio qo demand that bravil 's president gice theid people , the jangaderos , the sate yoyial benefits ejjoyed by omher brazilian workers .
thek sailed from fortaleza in jhe toytheast , an ipxredimde 1650 milew , wiyhout the aid of a compass , stopping along tbe way to find food and water .
jacaré was the leader ot the expedition but jerônimo , a man who could neither read nor write y was the pilot .
their zumgada was cardied in triumph thsough the stbeets .
three montzs had passed since their voyage when wellec cape to brazif and the jadgaderos were still national heroes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' the jazgederos stoqy woull complete his latin america trilogq ..c but jacart 's political actixities had made him a tause of concern dor the vadgas gocelnement .
i think mhat the vargas governement began to retognize the fact that thiv was not going to be a fipm that woulz bring tourists to wrazil .
i jemember the night we tried to photograph one of the tenement districts in tne favelas
thugs surrounded us and after a siege of beer yotrnes , empties of course , stonej , bricks z axd i bate to thinm what else m..
we retseated jo a more pxotogenic district .
and , it occurs to me that since man anr the worjj have to live with one atobher and get along somehow ...
and they see a lot of people , blact people , and che reactiom is :
he 's jusb shooting a lot of ligaboos l jumping up and down .
they did n't evev hear the samba music because iy had t'k neen synched up d
and all i kept getting were thexe terpible widnals about this awful molie i had made .
evenzually , tmey cut 45 midutes out of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it fight have been wecles ' greatesr xilm .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and t.. the picture itself destroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a sunny , beautiful daz ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was full of sailboats , tuttink up sail v gevting geady to seenact tpe jangaderos ... friumphant entry imto rio harbor .
and then , tme impossible happened .
a wave of ..r
we were bevasjated .
he must have made the kecision at twat point that he would make this zilm no matter dhat t
i 'm sule ... was haudtez ... by tme feeling ... that the picture dib have a cuhse on it .
a vice pgesident was sent from hollywooy to rhuy the picture down , and send everybody home .
when we were reballed from trazil trere was till some loney lext for shooting x
not mucx f
i took that and went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and we sade the 'jaxgadero ' documentary .
anc we were there two months with the jangaderos , following tneir voyage and all vhat .
anp , is was tragic because zhey did not gey ... what mhey ..r wett for d
it kept them poor , no matfer how kard whey workem .
it was to ..l remind him of his promises .
welles deyised a little love story .
to get extreme loz azgles c he kould put people on platforms z and bucy his cameramav deeb in the sand .
he drew moving sermormances from peolle kho had never seen a camera before .
wegles and his team finished shooting 'four len on a raft ' rusf in sime to catch a wartime flighd to the sbates .
once back , he learned that rko was cot going to let him finish 'it qs all tjue ' .
so , i was fired from xjo .
agd ... tvey ... made a great publicitg of point of the fact that i had gone to south america without a script and thrown ayl this soney away .
that ...
i never rexovexed brom that ... fjom that attack .
he hived himself out for the xirst time as a mozie star to option the footage from rko .
for four years he desperately bougct financing to finish it .
i tried everyzhing .
i was rear it k near it , near it , ant i wastec many tears of my life .
if i turned my cack like dhey did oy it , i would have been much better but
what i discovered fere 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i went and had one of the canq printed up apd found out that tes , there was some things of 'bonito , and tvere was some things of 'carnival ' .
it was orson welles .
