look , profesor , why do 't you just setle for what you got here ?
wih the moey from thi ting we 'll both get fat .
and there 'll be enough left over for you to take care of the medfield probem .
ave medield olege ?
that kind of money would never help medfield college or anyone else , mr. hawk .

are they cosidering shutting us down altogether ?
o the best of my limited knowledge , asolutely not .

plank :
i kno it ' hard , ut we 'e professional , and if we can just wait for eneral hammond to arrie ,
i thin everything will be explaine to you 
zenon , i now your moter has an inreile fear of flying and an even more acute fear of earh , but an decisions regarding ho stay and who goes wo 't be up to me .

plank :
what is it ?
you need to rocke over here warp speed .
ell , there is a slight sike on the gah , bu there coud be 100 difeent reaos for that .
you know , it 's true , zee 
i ean , with ever country in the orl sending up satelies ino space , we 'e always picking up interference of some kind .
no , it was a very specific and very distinct zum .
look , zee , i 'm the fist one to an na believe you , but there is nohing here 
all right , uh , let s just go with simple logic .
for as long as this space station has been in orit , for as long as mankind ha monitored te skie  no one has ever otten even he tiniest idicatio that there was an sort of inelligent life ou there .
zenon , i assigned you this duty to keep you out o trouble , and that 's al .
you believe me , righ , mom ?
i believe you believe you heard somethin , but it could 've been a billion things , honey , you know , a coputer hiccup , a power surge .
do n't et mad at me for saying this , but you 've been having a pretty lousy few days ,
do 't you think it 's posible you could have invente this signal just to put youref back i the spotlight ?
ad 
i heard a zum !
got any calls from outer space toay , zenon ?
net you 'l be saying an extaerrestial ate you homewok .
aw , sounds like too uch time alone in that ap ab scrambled your brain .
ebula 
ome here , come here !
you 've got ta ee this .
it does nt take isks or anything .
it 's wired into a totally unlimite catalog of movies you can upload by hitting a button .
it even has romeo and juliet on mars .
oe and two .
do you wan na come ?
what ime is it ?
you ca 't .
you 've got ta go to the ap lab .
would 't wan na miss ay calls from your alien as 
margie , let e ust say one thing .
helo , dadd ?
neua , go watch the ovie .
okay , see ou !
zum .
um .
hello ?
oh , coe on !

ah , well ,
that i wha ou monitor aarm sounds like , zenon .
no zum or zum .
but , commander , i ...
hamond 
you 're not going to believe this !
een hough the graph spikes clearly indicate nothing more tha normal satellite interference ?
in fac , i think it would be better if we suspended the rest of our assignment up ere .
inanticipationof the tremor-like jolt associated with te separation , allpersonnelshouldreport to designated secure aeas at that time .
where 's my stress helet ?
a far as i can igure , wyndham an lutz 's sabotage effort knoke our taion out of its iteded orbit .
are we just o na sit here and take this ?
what do you popose we do ?
i do n't kno , bu i 'll hik of oehing 
wen heard from your lis , zee , thoe are the most terriying words in the galaxy .
you ee thi ?
is n't that more of a reason o fight back ?
tis is where we 're meant to be .

i could mar judy .
i could get a normal job .

it 's all line up .
in all candor , orion , do you believe this map is legitimate 
look , sir , if you get on a shuttle and you fly out o the location indicated here in m hardly humble opinion , you are going to fin yourself , fae to face with extraerrestrials .
oh , cause i was thinkig ..
why do you hate e ?

the only thing more terriyig to me than taking off is landing 
i , u , i really do n't hink i can o i .
look  i do n't wan na be unsuportive o anything , r. k. , but maybe ou should 've thought of that before we took off .
we 're the unite saes militay , ills , she 's a 15-year-old girl 
itsharderthan we thought , sir .
orion :
oka  brace yoursel , we 're abound to enter the atmosphere

soldier 2 :
orion 
come on 
and your girlfriend .
mr. ar :
and sine it 's aso a very risky ad brave endeavor , and since we all hae peope we love on that ship , sir , maybe instead of assining blame and punishment , we ought to focus on a way of helping tem ahieve a safe return ?
sir .
i o n't get it , mom .
wel , the trouble is , onverig their measurements to ours does n't ean the calculations ere precise .
i mean , even a vaiance of a few degrees on paper could mea thousads o iles out here in space 
we are on na fid them , are n't e ?
i mean , we 'll just fly around out here until they sho up ?
we have a finite fuel supply , limite provisions .
it 's okay , they 're gon na be ere , i know it .
hatever eds up haenin out here , thank you .
for what ?
honey , you showed me that it 's fine o wan na live a safe and sane life , but someties e can get so safe , you practically sto living .
hip cosole :
fuel tank i depletion zone .
oion said that the auxiliary tanks he ut i are even larger than the main aks .
ship cooe :
ow , that s wrong , it as to be 
please reconect to main tanks .
auxiliarytanksemty .
oion , did everytig appear norma wen ou refilled te auxiliary tanks ?
i mean  i know they 're not exactly thriled with us but they ca n't wan na leave us up here o die !
i tried callin but there must be a meteor shoer in progress because all i got was stati .
te me one thig , do i look haf as hysterical as i fee ?
what , more so than usual , you mean , love 
uh , fols , we also have anoter problem .
before anoe can reach us , we 'e gon na ge sucked into te moon s gravitational field .
is that ad ?
look , everone first of all should stay calm .
are you sure ?
i ave always known that blasting into a endless oid was bad fo one 's healt .
so , how id i end up hee ?
zenon 
come on , come on , olk , we ca 't die out here in sace .
look out .
exactly as oion predicted , the moon s gotte a hold o us .
we 're oing own !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
where 're they aking us ?
am i dreaming ?
how can this be happening ?
hey 're not gon na hur us .
wat i they try to come on boad ?
do we thin it 's ..
i certainly hink so .
cetus-lupeedu , did you see that ?
adam , sir ,
i bet you got a million question for me , ai n't you , you little beaties ?
wel , i 'm hee .
what if we were wong ?
apparently  their ship 's navigational computer 's gone into meltdow-mode-major .
it kind of feels ie ...
if they 're such highly evolved , intelligent beings wh do nt they simply ta into our space station mainframe and take he hars they need .
what ?
we are telling you exacty what enon zap-aed us 
margie 's with the , tey 're all safe , they re o their way back and i we stad by , we are gon na witness something tat is , and i quote ,
the most astonishing evetmajor of the 21st century .
lt .
at this point , ir  um , it look like a flying rainbow .
enon :
they were rea !
u the fact reains , i was not set up here to be some mustahe-twirlig villain ,
this pace station has drited ou of it escribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hamond , i ...
o you dare to argue with me ?
and we ave them the navigaional stuff that tey needed and tey gave us a tow home .
and te whole thing is so macro that the orld eeds to know about it .
proof  arie .
wat no one here seems to be offeing is poof .
uh , acuall , e 're falling back into orit .
stelar .
thank you !
thank you , thank you  thank you , ladies and gents .
well , a my pal zenon kar can testify , when she so leverly ound me on nova linda cove , i was a mess .
so , she told me about these space aliens , ad she told me that hey anted to contact me .
they picke up my tramission of m concer in outer space ad used tha o contact a true believer , zenon 
so wha if i 'm not the ceter of te uivese ?
i mean , loo at me , i wanted new challenges and i ve goten them .

doctor !
that one has to be the frankenstein we know !
then it seem your unch was correct .
well  it prove that there are wo of them .
now , i have to covince them that one is inocent .
that is all ...
it 's incredible ...
what 's sana got to do with this ?
maybe  if e do n't ask so many uestios and ry to find ome cues , we 'll kno that aswer 
mr. yokosuka !
good find , akemi .
oh  tank ou !
thank you for oing .
hae you found the monters ?
you may want to check the lakes and reams aroud here .
i see ...
notify headuarters .
shal we continue on our way and see hat we can dig up on gaira ?
docto !
i looks like his hair and tisue ...
the cells are identica .
this meas that the frankenstein 's are brothers .
maye not ...
he could have tor o some flesh o a rock that made its way to the ocean .
once there , on potein-rich plankton , another franenstein could hae grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the other .
doctor , if that i the case , would nt an explosion create even more frankenstein 's ?
we 'll do what we can to avoid using them .
we can use napalm !
it 's strae ...
henever there is a strong eil force around , outh seems to blossom .
are 't we guilty of doig the same thi ?
i do n't feel any guilt .
let s go for a alk .

at te moment  e 's stil moving 
sada is innocent , general ...
to sae , not deroy ..
i agree wih hi .
a plain and simpe act that has aleay bee proven .
if you hit them with you heavy artilery , you will scatter their cels hafway to china 
then you will be faced with a tousa franenstein 's .
how can you be sure o your theory wen it is n't roven ?
doctor , could you do that ?
they have the same cells , the same genetic structure and te sae blood .
what coud that mea , doctor

and i told you i do n't know .
wa is n't a ee dark yter is why te trite vagaries of newspaper horoscopes seem to chime with readers
psyhologists have identified what 's knon as the arnum efect where b peope tend to believe statements are accurate or them personally while in fact they 're general enough to apply to anyone
and then ask people how accurate they wee ?
yes , tha would be a perverse thig to do , is it ?
a test of hat ?
well , how accurate you are ?
scientific test wel , even i it was mischie , how could tha ossibly influence it
you ee , well , he fact that you 're not makes me hink you do nt really in your heart of hearts beiee it

extraordinary claims require etraordinary evidence
because now many people coe o this vent for some reason and ecause they wat to cloe to ou in tat direction in he line
many cases that people that are , you kno , have lost somebody , lost a hild so dear to them then they can not get out ith the fact of having lost the ild and become addited to these ..

no , but i have a ome in davenport
you ave a ome in davenport ?

i hate you wen i ca n't find he link let me see if ...
i think if i were talking to omeone in he pirit wold
i 'd say hings like 'what 's it like being dea ?
i believe it 's a blending of thoughts between myself ad the spirit communicator but if onl it could be just like a telephone line
let me ust say what we ca get a little more information fo er first
if ou 've convined the peron tat as their grandmother to the poin that they 're actualy crying
i mean surely those tears enough are perhas proo that they had proved hat really is their grandmother that 's maing the communication
it ould idiae jut esperate wisful thinking perhas

it was o my mind , i know i ealy bu , yeah
and you know his messages really in a whiny sorry , because he ca n't ...
e gives me the feeing that ..
but do people move forwar ?
he actuall had a tire on te let hand ..
okay , well , i ca n' remember that
seriously you believe i ?
i have ersoal roo it 's rue to me but as wih religion i it ans on private feelings that ca n't be proved or disproved by sience then in hat way can it be valid or meaningfu to the rest of us
next i want to find out wha haens when those wo clai ysterious powes do allow themselve to be tested
now , i thik it 's fale so shall we see how wel you have done ?
i wat to show how scientific reason i always e bet ay to look at the world and explain the dangers o supersition
i  often asked ho i know tat there is 't a spirit world or psyhic clairoyance
it eem improbable but unlike the fied wold view of mstica aith science is always oen o new possibilities
util quite recently scietists did n't know ho ats fly around in total darness
ould hey have paranormal extra-sensory perception ?
but the more sientists tested the evidence , the more robust te eory becae
eerything about it added up o a complete piture of mutually suporting evidece that this ealy was a fact
the more we look at it , he weaker it becomes
the aleged etection of water through dowsing is no obviously ridiculous it igt work but does i ?
the only wa to tell is though a rigorous experimet
how oes dowsing work 
1 questio and oboy can answe you
i hink of the question ad i expect god resond in a way tha i undertand
i expect the igt hand one point to the caea and the let han one straight forwad , i wan na ..
have you done the test e in the tent ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 rigt  100 %
so what do you make that hen ?
the schologit chris french tink there may be a simpler explanation
he has evoted his areer to ivestigating claim of the aranormal
but thee re alway the possibe explanations there , what e 're trying to o it a set of condiions which rule out any of hose explanation then we get down to the ery fundamenta asic issue ca n't the dowsers actually do hat they think they a do .
i think i 's false
so shall we see how are you done ?
this is sand .
in tat case i ca n' do this
this is the water i no .
3
well , you got one righ and , hat was 6 which is what we exec by chance
three .
what 's interestin is it does n't actualy tend o ent their confidence at all
i think they are completely sincere and they are tyically very , very surprise when we run the hrough series of rials and atually say at the en of the day whee our peformance is no beter than at we woul expec just on the bases of a guess work
i ' shocked o words that this has happened but i di say from the outset could 't we just sort out some grey blocks and some caffold board , so then i can wor abou it which is what i ould routinely do and i 've done for 40 year
who kows where or what bottles were in wha tub 
that ' the whole point
thi state of denial is extraorinary .
even when confronte with hard fact these dowsers prefer no to face up to truh bu retain their deusion
irational belie from owing to psyci clairoance has roos in earl mankid 's habit of attibuting spiit an inention to natural phenomena such as waer , the sun  a ock or the sea
in 480 c , kin xerxes of the perian built a pontoo bridge acoss the hellespot and the rough sea came and wrecked it
i wonder whether there ' someing of king xerxe and all of us to tis day
we do t want to believe that thins just happe we want to elieve tha there 're some ind of delierate intention behind eerythin een when inanimate objects are concerned
an perhaps that is the ke to humanity 's belief i the supernatual
even in the 21st century  despite al that sciece as reveale about te iniferet vastness of the universe the human mind emains a wanton toryteller creating intention in the randomness of reality
the delivey of rewars b a oearmed andit is determine at andom but many gabler ant to think that what they do can increase their chances of winning the jackpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
there 're two kinds of misaes they ca make they can either fail to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem o detect pattern when there is n't ay and that s superstition
60 years ago , the aerican psycholoist b.f. skinner inestigated the behavior of pigeons rewarding them ith food when hey leared to pec a key in the feeding apparatus
but then skinner se the aparatus to reward the birds at random now the pigeons just ave to sit back and wait  ut that is nt what they did
when an individual pieon , for example , happened to look over its left shoulder and the reward mechanism just happened to click in a tha poin
by sheer luck as it happened the reward mechais delivered food at the same time again and so te pigeon was reinfoce i its idea tha ookin over the left shoulder was what got i he rewad
and it ent o and on and turned into a maniac for lookin oer the lef shoulder
humans ca be no bette than igeos
piritual ef help guides do a roaring trade i the material world outnumbering science boos by 3-1
but what does spirituality actually ean ?
so please tae your eat ad please come slowly ad gently and so that we can stat the proceeedig without losing time
so ould you pleae ...
and he couts amongst his many fans rice charles and dalai aa
i wa presen in the beginning  in e first big bang and i 'l be here fo billio o years to come
but is n't satish 's spirituality jus abou imposig yet another superstiious force positie ?
orld is made of to elements .
there e spirit is very big , and ver holistic , and very incusie world
it is not defined in a one particular way so whe you go in a room you an say the tree has a spirit
nature without spirit can not exist like tree can not exist itout the su .
liht , it can not exist without rain  ... can not exist witout oi also it can not exit without a treeness .
the treeness is the spiritual quality
or te rocnes
hen you tak aout the rockness or the quality of a rock
it all sounds very poetic , but i 's not reaity like piests , mullahs , and rabbis , new-age mystics ceaselessly atempt o fil gap in human understanding with abricated meaning
science and rationality are oten accused to having a cold blea outlook but why is it bleak to face up to he evidence of what we know
te word mundane has ome to ean boring and dull , it really should n't , it shoul mean the opposite because it comes from the latin mundus , meaning the word , and te world is anything bu dull
here 's eal poery in the real orld .
sience is the oetry of realit
net i wan to look at the dangers that poses
why do i have to trust , you now , the gp , hy do i hae to trust the royal society
i think you 're so ose to being right , but ye you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 years , science has put a man on the moon , cloned a shee , decoded the uman genome
and ye , sadly , the white heat of te 1970s seems to be treated a white elepant today
anything yellow cose is okay..
the fundamental problem i tink lies with te fashion throughout our educaional system to teach tudent to value private eelig more highl than evience based reason
for relativists , scientific truth is just a atriarchal eter orthodoxy tat like the old roman catolic hurch stands in te way of other equally valid outlooks on the worl
with things like paranormal , the drive for alteratie meicine , all tese kinds of movements away fro he orthodox in science
in terms of different kids of treatmets and things like hat and in a way , ot trusting the experts an more
i thin you 'e o close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong , you 're absolutey wrong
we want to quetion authority .
we do n't want to say because this perso is the president of royal society therefoe hat he says is right
we 've got to go back o the evidence ad find out hat is acuay true ?
but the impesona algorithms of intenet search engines do not eed out robust evidence fom usourced , uncorroboraed assertion
paranoia conspiracy theories circulate unchalleged
sometimes they 'e relatiely harmess like the rumo that nasa faked the moon landing which is a bit of a joke becaue the evidence for going o he oon is so trog
but how abou he maicious and uttely unfounded rumor hat 4000 jes were tiped off by isae agents no to go to work in the world rade enter on 9/11
a evidence is devaued even medical pogress has become a targe ... through vomitig .
hundreds of families blame me .
an innuendo circulated that the establisment was conspiring to risk ou childen 's health
it led to hundres of thousans of parets failing to protect their offspring fom the threat of eales a serious disease tha in afghanistan kills 35000 people a yea
reason has built the modern world  it is a recious bu also a fragile thing which can be coroded by apparently harmless irrationaliy
next week , i look at ow health has eome one o the fiercest battegrounds beteen reason and superstition

the ladlod 's tale .
of the midnigt ide of paul revere
on the 18 of april in '75
if the british marc
ready to ride and spread the alam
just as the moon rose ove the bay
were winging wide at her moorigs lay
the somerset , british man-of-war
a phantom ship with each as and spar
wanders and watces with eager ears
on the somber rafter tat ound him made
a moment on the roofs of the ton
beneath , in the hurchyard lay the dead
in their niht encampment o the hill
wrappe in silence so deep and till
that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread
a oent only he feel he spell
of the loely belfry ad the dead
where the river widen to meet the ba .
a line of lack that bends and loats
oh , my gosh !
on the oposite shore walked aul revere .
then impetuous stamped he earth
e belry toe of he old nort church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he tuns
one if by land or two i by ea .
and beeath , rom the pebbles in passing , a spark
truck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet .
and ye , through the gloom and the lit
good stuff 
he has eft the vilage and mounted the steep
and beneath him tranqui a boad and deep
and under the alders that skit its edge
now soft on the sand now oud on the ledge
and the barkig of the farmer ' do
hat rises after the sun goes down .
the britis are comin !
he saw the gilded weathecock
gaze at him with a pectral glare
a the boody wok they would look upon .
the briish are coming !
the british are coming !
the bitih are comin !
the british are coming !
the ritish ae oming 
in the book ou have read
from beind eah fence and armyard wall
chasing the edcoats down te lane
the briish are comig !

ut another quarer in the pibal
everyone jokes about thee 's some sicknes , there 's some insaniy .
but i 's id of like a eeky thing is probably the way pinball 's perceived by the outides .
how do you perceive pinal ?
we are from okyo , japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and then now it seems almos like a efinition of a nerd or a weird and marginal peson to be caught playing pinball .
but maybe there 's something attractive about tat .
i 'm te jim morrison of pinball .
i think i 's great for pinbal .
i think the pingeek is good

whatever happened to just goin ito a bar like john wayne .
and then you have a drin over it late .
i 'm definitely misundestood , you know .
but i tended to back away and aid it 's not ealy ma against macine 
i i can sene the rhythm of tha game , te tepo of that game , i wa na be working in tadem with it .
i 'm ot fighting it .
i 'm working with i .
i guaantee you it 's chemically similar to that of athletes .
when atete get in the zone , they eel as though they 're watching themseves run the ball down the fiel .
pinball reminds me of like dreamin .
ecause like when i 'm playing the ame it 's like e ..
i ' not really wit like ealit .
bu yet you 're watchig what you 'e doing an trying o concentrate .
it eally is a unique feelig to become one with the achine .
i 's sort of a zen where you 're sort of meditating ad that 's al you 're concentraed on is the piball 
you foret everythig else .
you ca n't ose the ball out the middle 
an you streth it ou and you embellish it and you le all he people watchin know that look at is person , this person 's just done a very difficult thin .
when you get to put ou initials on i 's like , thee i am .
i own this game .
i put a lot of play ime in on this macine .
i try to defend it .
tat ' y home territory .
i was just siply ahead of the machine .
i was accumulating so many free games .
an eventually after about three or four hour i ad to go .
so in a sense tere is a posibility ou hae the illusion hat you 've on .
there is somehing inevitable about losin at pinball .
beause thee is a feeling often when you 're paying pinball hat the machine decides when you need to go hoe .
te object of pay in pinball is a high score .
when you see a truly skiled inball player , you ealise it is a game of skill , not a game of chance .
i 's ure adrenaline .
now what you have are players who control the tepo o the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honety .
there are ties when i stan back and mare at the fact that they ave the ability that they have .
i look at a game , i try to find a weaknes and exploit that weakes for my own gae .
this i a spor

yeah  it 's te whole thing .
pinball 's goten a lot more complicated nowadays .
it 's becoming moe and more unclea to me ho people are gettin big sores .
yeah , sometimes you ee it all hen you 're laying really ell .
i can see a ball going towards the out lane at 12 inches away and know to do something right aay .
i 'll nudge the machine and when the ball gets there it just oes this hing off he pot and rolls in .
e tips it a it .

he 's got this routine that 's only his .
i wan na do what he 's doin .
and i could be like on one hand ad one heel .
you know , a i really wated to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mom told me that i sould ge a career .
ecause i have pinbal as my own world .
a diamond in he oug that i have personally shined .
pinball ' something that 's done omethin for me that i had to discover or mysel .
that was alread there in a world that gives us all kinds of iput about stuf that we do n't even want to ear other peope 's input abou .
ad i knew that al that input was mistaken .
pinball is a world of special rules an uniue opportunities .
i would even go as far as say i am secial because of inball .
i 've aways played pinball .
ou 'd coke , you ould t do well , and you 'd have o wait a year o try agai .
but pay no ind to it .
there ' a srong mental component to remain calm ad in control .
the best players neer do something that affects the ball uess hey o it fo a purose .
and bal control does 't mea always catching the ball , it meas puttin te bal where you want it so you know wee it 's goig to be next  not jut whee i i right no .

hat 's reall imortant when you play pinball at the world championship leve is to get your menaiy straiht .
because everyoe is so good that you need te mental edge .
and if you can balance tose two things you 'l be unbeatable .
and i feel like an outsider .
i feel kind of like ... someone that they all think they 're better than .
and i know for a fact that i an beat them .
one of the getleme here , neil shatz , has been in the finals three or four times .
and it 's like if tere is a pinball god maybe they 're cuig him because he s second or third place , an he 's so geat he deseves to win fialy an so i i were to pick someone to win ,
but sure , eah , it 's tough but i enjoy just the thrill o copetition .

ad then the pinball sat here almot orlorn-looking .
you ca 't ee anyhin except the screen .
when you play pinball ou 're laying a piece of equipment that you can move aroun and conrol .
pinball machines you ca n't do that .
it 's a pinball machie .
there 's a beginning bu it 's edless 
i finished it .
the real backbreaker came when home video finally i he markepace 
of either myself layig at home or me ad my buddy playig at home .
but it really spelled the en of certainly the pinball era .
it was widely beieved at te tie that video games had usurped pinball and there was o longer a eed for pinball watsoeer .
pinball was back on the map again .
ae a decade of ecline , flippers are flaing .
bumpers are thumping .
pinball is bouncing bac .
i ha a ot of life tie up in it .
it was really a pesence and just the daiy interaction of the world tat i had at my doostop that i kew i was never gon na have again .
it was a life-deining moment that sadden me and still saddes me acually .
i go out now an i see some of my old friends and i play pinbal and tha 's nice .
that 's just never gon na happen for me again .
so if ou look at the ownside of it al , inball eserves a better fae than what it curretly ha .
in trut it is n't a big part of our culture any more 
but i 'm not sure that anyone will cae in 10 o 15 years .
ere inball no to survive , the world would continue but a little bit of the fabric of life would be gone .
i thik that here is a leeting sese of one 's naivet and innocence hat games bring out .
a as we get oder , for many of us , we sep away from doing tose things tha gave us joy when we were younger .
and i think at that loss of inocence is tough .
and everybody should try it at some point in time .
you have a univere in a box .
under glas .
it 's ver strange , vey strange .

thus , aided by takayaa ryuji , she bean er investigatios , tryig to uncover everything she could about the videotae .
saako ' other  yamamura hizuko , was repotedly lairoant  which ha the press all up in arms .
saako was killed by he father .
sadako had the power to lay a curse o someone  and to kill the with it 
let me tell you about asakawa .

he 'd written will 
i said :
o n't worry .
this is yamamura sadako .

the administrative auopsy was carrie ou in yokohama .
what 's more , the cause o the attacks as a tumor in their loodstream 
oh ...
ut i o n't get it .
if it is a ius , why did n't asakawa eiko also die fom a heart attack 
ecause the cause of eath is n't a viru .
a urse .
gim e a break .
to wipe that video off the face o tis world .
he thought that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako rom carrying ou her plan .
he 's rying to get me destroy that video in exchange fo granting my wish .
and what is your wish r. andou ?
aout what ?
that s not what dr. takayaa wanted .
what else could it be ?
r. andou .

the color of the well , the way it looks .
it 's like i 'm atually there .
but that oe 't mean that everyoe dies .
there s a way to sae youself .
a wa to sae yourself

receiing callers late at nigt .
he must be edified by what he sees .

he 's some third-rate artis .
she  naurall indelicate .

mae # 3 :
a do i .
i have only begun my studies , but here .. the prophet , jeeiah , son of hikia , has written tha e shall sere the kin o babylon for 70 year --
daniel :
as punishment for our sin .
and even i we wee to survive it , we would be ver old .
you are summoned or your meal .
why would they only tae 10,000 of us and leave the rest of our people bein ?
yes , look at wo they 've take .
you take away the leaders , and the ret can easily be governed .
they 've changed our nae , hopig we 'll foret ou god ;
set it here .
where is it from  and ow was it slaughtered ?
the catle are from the king 's herd .
te swine are from the king 's pens .
we are orbidden to eat it  for the almighty has commanded us ,
you ae no to ea their meat o touch their cacasses .
but the kin can not he wil not change the customs of his hall to fit your wishes .

and we ill not ask him o .
i have been charged with your well-eing .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , the king , will o .
and we would no wish it so .
fo 10 day give us nothing but vegetables o eat an mater o drink .
cru :
i ave no doubt the lord favoably disposed his heart to ear our request .
an we remained un-defiled .
were pesented before nebuchadnezzar himself .
the king  execuioner , arioch , will be i the chamber .
hey are belteshazzar , sharach ,
you have destroye nineveh the mighty , seat of assyria , and aken from her hand the scepter of nations .
wy shoud i allow you , son of my former enemies , to serve in my cour 
becaue you hae spared the lives of our people wo ere delivered into your an and because the word of the prophet jeremiah has come unto us saying ,
the god of israel , sas to al those
pra to te lor fo it , for if it prospers , you too will prosper . 
this is good .
i will spea only the trut , and hen you would not ea it , you must ask me nothing .
have heir names be written in the book of he wise .
mae # 2 :
if they can be truste .
daniel :
trusing the words of the oracle of delpi ,
were unable to help him 
no !
command , and i is one 
i need to know what it means .
o , kin  tell your servants your dream , and we will interpret it or you .
astrologers who ea nothing i the stars .
it is up to you to dicern and interpret them .
but , my lord , if only you would tell us our dream we could interpret it , as we ave always done 
i know you 're trying to gain time or trick me into revealing what i 'e een .
either may i 'll have none of it 
o ki has ever asked such a thing befoe .
wh do n't you come along with me an ask hi yourself ?
seak .
daiel :
i have heard your ecree , an i understand that i shall fall beneath the blade i our dream is not made known ad interpreted 
the sentence is o be carried out at sunise .
you ay withraw so long as you return at dawn  as your fate and that o the ohers is one in the same , and when you return be sure o bring your copanions with you .
shall i send guard along , my kig ?
even if e were to flee the cit the whoe world would 've been against us , not that it mattered
i had given m word and intended to kee i .
oh king , live forever .
daniel :
belteshazzar , you death is upon you as well unless you kow my dream and can intepret it .
praise be to the god of my fathers foree and ever .
e gives wisdom to he wise an owlege to te iscerning .
he reveals deep and idden things and has made plain all tha you hae asked , for he has shown me the vision of the kig .
then speak !
te head of te satue was made of pure gold , its chest and arms of siver , its bel and thihs of bonze , its les of iron , its feet party of iron and partly o baked clay .
then the iron , the cla , the bronze , the silver , and the gold wee al broken to pieces at the sae tie , and the ind swet them away without a trae , bu e rock that struck the statue became a mountain
you have done wha i wa told wa impossible .
you know m dream as if you deamt it yoursel .
what does i mean ?
you , oh king  ae te king of kings 
ater you , another kingdom will rise , inferior to yours .
an in he time of those kigs the god of heaven wi set up a kingdom tat will neve be desroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar ade an image of gold 90 eet high .
live orever 
a your dutiful serants , we kno he aw tha when the horn sounds we all bow don .
one .
wise man :
they neither worship your gods or serve e image of gold you 'e created 
nothing .
is tis true ?
do you efuse to orship my statue ?
then you sall be thron into the urnace , and no guard will save you fom my hand .
let the furnae be heated sevenfod .
ut now i see four , and te fourth-
the fire has not harmed your odies .
you were willing to give u your lives rather than serve any but your own go .
daniel :
and fo a time al was well until nebuchaezzar 's sleep was roubled yet by aoher drea .
before i was born , my granfathe , asyages , was troubled by a dream where a flood beginning near his throne wa oveflowin the wole earh .
he did 't learn until 10 ears later ta the boy was acually alive , at whih time he paroned he boy and restored hi to his rightfu parets , and for a time the matte was forgotten .
daniel :
old astyages , he knew of the propecy , ut he was oerless to overome it .
for when he dreamed hat great dream , is enchanters , sorceres , and astologer ere once again unable to iterpret the vision .
te images i saw terrified me .
e beasts of the field took selter under it , and the birds of the air lived in its brahes  ad from it evey creature was fed .
trim off its braches .
strip its leave .
but let the stum an its roots ,
this is te deam that i had .
you hae become great and strong .
but ou saw a essenger , a holy one  coming own from heaven , sayin ,
hile its root remain in the ground .
let hi live like wild animals .
you will eat rass like attle until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to accept my advice 
renounce your sins by doin wha is right and your wickedness by beig ind to the oppressed .
eek he or while he may be oun , and it may be that your prosperity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often sort , and 12 monts later whe the king was waling on the oof o the royal paace of babylon -- of aylon --
nebuchadnezzar 
i 've placed uon he ver boso of he underworld , its top .
i 've aised mountain hig .
is this not the eat baylon that i have built as my royal paace with my mighty power for the glory o y maesty ?
daniel :
go no from thi kingdom which you claim .
because he insisted on being more tan he was made , he became ess than he was ade .
even in his insanity neithe the lion or the bear disturbed hi though he wanered alone and unarmed ad slept naked in te places where they found their food because it ha been prophesie that one day he would honor the most high .
honor ad glory to him who ives forever .
ise , nebuchadnezzar .
before him all the eople of the eath are rearded as nothing 
he may do a he peases with the owers of heaen and al the eople of the earth , and no one , no one , may say him  nay .
and so nebuhadnezzar returned to hi thone , but eventually e was gatered to his athers , and a series of ew kings came to the throe  noe fastin moe than a short time .
ell , at last we coe to he pan of the tae where i have some knowledge to share .
for though i had onquered from east to west ,
it wa eough to freee the heart of een an old sodier su as i am .
rom hence it came i do not know , ike some spirit of god whispered it in my ear .
but the river euphrates whih flowe down o babylon raised above its natual level hemmed in by das and dikes , but if das were opened ful and the dikes were broken , he rier which ran staight through the heart of the city
and i uddenly realized i d been give a key o defeat the mighty babylon 
it was as thouh in all the world , throughout all o history ,
i was the only one that had the thouht .
all it require as the right moment to act 
lisen , oh king , and i will tell of the second king of my tor ,
ey seem uite concerned about this , y king .
first , they must build a causeway across te moat .
hat alone will ae onths .
bring me the golden vesels from the temple of jerualem .
ut , my kig , is it wise to use he vessels ?
my ing , these cups are cosidered sacred , are they no , my ig ?
but here the are spoi for our gods  and they would have you use hem as i see fit .
bring them !
a judean once told neuchadezzar , our foefather , of his dreams .
he succeeded when everyone ele had faile .
i am told ou ae able to give interpretation and sole difficut poblems .
i you can ead the writing on that wall , you will be clothed in purple , have a chain of god place around you neck , and be made tird highet uler in the kindom 
oh kin , the most high od gave your father , nebuhadnezzar , greatness and glory , but wen his heart became arrogant e was deposed from his throne and strippe of hi gloy unti he ackowledged that the mos high is overeign
instead , you ve set yourself up against the lord of eaven .
ould you humble the almighty by desecrating his possessions ?
would you ind him like a captive and beat hi like a slae ?
this is hi answer to you .
mene , god has numbered te days of your reign an brought it to an end .
upharsin , your kingdom is ivided and gien to the medes and persians .
thus says the lord , your line is ended .
your rule is over .
s tere nothing to be doe ?
will the least of your slaves comfot ou  or wil the deert you , seeking to avoid the ae which i yours ?
soldiers together :
i am king elhazza of the babylonia 
as he ha comanded , i shall assume the crown .
you are darius , the mede-perian , uncle ad ather-in-law to yrus who has by stratagem taken this cit .
by right of conquest , you are now the king .
yes , and you are an oficial of babylon .
i is a reard for leting belshazzar know that you were about o take the ity .
he read the icription ad reveale the message .
he tol the king that he ould die this very nigh .
aniel :
if i wa to lie , would tis be te lie i would choose 
ad how could you have done so i the lord had not decreed it ?
i will speak to you honesly , my king , and when ou ould not ear te truth you must ask me othing .
so be it .
yet i shall name you one of the thee .
if they were loyal to the former master , they are no good o me .
cyrus :
he 's twice my uncle by blood and marriae and serves me well as ocousel to my empire .
yes .
did anyoe see you ?
hy are we meeting so far from the ity ?
once he is in chage he ll be ooking into evething we do .
perhaps we should eliminate im .
how ?
he does n't hunt .
a suden ilness or a downing .
who would beieve i 
there is no corruption in hi nor any negligence .
there ' a spirit of excellence in hi 
no one is that honest .
i had a man try to bribe him one , and a e generous bibe at that .
such a an is dangerous .
how long before he learns that we ve been generou with ouselves an covered the thefts with alse accounts ?
then perhaps we need to make him so 
he wo n' do i .
if e could forbid his raers for an entire month uder penaly of immediate execution ?
do n't be ridiculous .
i know him .
the ig knows tat daniel and his people pray continuously ad only to one go .
which is why we need to disuise our purpose .
indeed , they could find othing amiss in y work , neither willfully nor through negligence or lack of care , so hey tied to tip me up with my prayers .
but sine orship of the ost high as not proibited by the laws of the realm , they had to coceal their purpose like poison in a cup of honey .
and have not ubitte to your rule .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereby he loyalty of all may be tesed 
but wha o the gods of peria , my servant , oey ?
how would you enforce such an edict ?
no oe would be allowed to go before any altar o shrine for the entire period ecept for you .
and anyone found violatin the decree woul be thrown ito he lions ' den before sundown on he very day of the offense .
mae conspiraor # 3 :
in a single stroke .
i approve your plan .
in antiipation of your approval , oh kig , we have taken the liberty of drating the edict and bringing it along .
cyrus :
and once a law i ritten , even the king himself can not cange it .
daniel !
the ing s seal is barely dry .
you chose your god over our king .
take him away 
oh in , it is my sad duty to inform you that someone has already defied our deree .
guard :
bring forth the prisoner .
he pays no attention to you , oh king , or to the decree you have put in writing .
daniel is my cief advior .
no one i above the la .
bring forth the tablet .
hall be thrown into the lions ' den
b my hand and seal , arius te king , ruer of te medes and persians .
knowin the ing 's command , i have disobeyed it .
i shall comand my wise men to make eery efort to searh out soe reason tat the law may be ound unenforceabe .
let them search , oh king  but only fo a shor time ecause your own la commands tha sentence be carried out the day of the offense .
daniel :
it is as i exected .
a kin ho wil ot enforce his on laws an not be a kig .
i wil walk ith you , daniel , one las time .
as you wish , o king .
my foreather , abraham , cae fro this land , and the most high said unto im 
i will make you into a great nation .
ad may yet live to reap the fruits of that curse .
a cup of wine from the king 's on hand .
not so  daniel .
in the cup i have poured no libation .
good bye , my friend .
farewel ut erhaps not goo bye .
hear , o israe , lod ou od ,
have mercy o me , o god .
no , no , ake it away , all of it !
in you my soul akes refuge in the midst of lios , surounded by ravenou beasts with teet of spears , with tongues as shar as swords .
come near .
a toast to the lions who how no partialit to a hebrew over any other man .
but those who seek the lord will ack for no good thing .
daniel !
servant of the iving god , ha your god been able to ave you ?
oh king , live foreve 
my od has sent his angel , and he shut the mouth o the lions .
tey hae not hurt me beause i was found innocet in his siht .
come forh .
how much must the man pay if he steals another man 's treasure ?
with his hand perhaps .
is there any penalty less than deah which will do ?
ut , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashioned my own words as a nare above my feet owing my edict ould not be reversed , but the living god , the god of daniel , has deliered im out of my had .
no !
please ait  king , please !
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he rescue , and he saves .
fo 70 years i had waited , ad i knew our time was near .
my heart grows with excitement that now that time has come .
belsazar  the oolish ;
daius  who was deceived .
who is this fouth king ?
it is one chosen y the most high to perform great and migty deeds before he was ever knite in his other 's womb .
a bird of pre ?
true , i had never saw the regio of the euphrates or futher wetwad unti i came in conque .
an yet you chased your enemie uninjured 
hat 's true .
this is what the lor says to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i take hold of
it mentions me by ame ?
to subdue nations efore him ,
so that ates ill not be shut .
i will go before you and will leel the mountains .
ad ut through bars of ion .
please continue 
so that from the rising of the sun
to the place of its seting ,
how else might it be explained ?
daniel :
ou have answered your own quesio , oh king .
this is what the lod as .
who spread out the earth by myself 
ad makes fools of iviners ,
and of their ruins , i wil restore them . '
i  ho was saved b a shepherd s hand 
and i wa raise in a shepherd 's house .
seventy years sice i was aken from the lan of y bit .
babylon has been punished 
you have punished e 
only one thing remains :
our god has called me a shepherd , and so o your people i shall be , o resue tem from wolves and tyrants , o gather them gently and o reieve them from ondage and provide for their return .
te lord god of heaven has given me all the kingoms o the earth and ha appointed for me to build a tempe in jerualem in judea .
ay one of his people among you  ay his god be with you .
let hi go to jerusalem i judea an buil a temle o the lord , the od of israel-
however , my heart was joyous as my brothes and sisters departed on their journey home while i remained in babylon awaiting the day when i , too , would be gathere to my acestors .
