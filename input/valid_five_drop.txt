but outside of making me fel good all over , what would it get me ?

well , the trial of profssor ned bainard swung into its third day toy .
rofesor brinar continued to act as counsel in is own behalf .
he was qoted as saying he was confident i the due processes of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony aganst him , as the prosecution kept a steay parade of wtesses moving through the witness box  today , the proscution unlimbered its big guns against the defense .
professor brainard , you seem proud of your ob a a teacher .
do you lik it beue you believe it makes you imortant ?
but i believe th work i do is important .
wold you care to tell us a little about it ?
maybe plant a bug of dscovery in their minds  or ..

one f those yung people might discover something the enire word has been looking for .
he migt not , but i like to feel that i had a part in giving hm a crck at i .

you mind answering a few qustions ?
monsters interest me 
al inds 
boled down fr his oil , lads , there 'd be free grog for all hands , if you a swallw it on top of his tall yarns ...
there !
stop it 
come on , casey .
this is no place for a clergyman 's sn .
ey , minnie !
do n't bother unloading .
this is riiculous .
w jus hav to ge to sagon .
halfway around th orld from paris  an now this appens .
except pack and upck .
oh , proesor ?
i 'm from the blletin .
these gentlmen are from th globe and the post .
w 're intersted in your opinion of this mnster .
proesor , what dos the nationa museum in aris think about it ?
i an nt answer that .
we heard this expedition of ous was to gathe facts about the mnster .
i 'm afraid you were misinformed .
why d n't you ask a fish ?
do n't you print ta .
you do not deny then tat such a monster could exist .
is tht correct ?
thank you , professor .
look at this drawing .
 knew it .
by proessor arronax of the pris national seum .
why , his is the most far-fetched nonsense yet .
far-etche ?
you 're not eriou , professor ?
oh , i do n't man flying off wth a ship in its mouth 
but the general size ...
i ' not a reporter .
may i come n ?
thank o .
woud you accept ?
 would be interested , yes , naturally .
why..
i think the onour i ors .
s the oremost autrity on the sea and it 's mysteries , you can e an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it conern th monster .
ver much so .
according to the papes , you sem to believe the rumours .
n .
yes , i ' afraid i was misquoted .
however , i have n open mind on te subject .
w accept .
good .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like u to come downstairs and met captain farragut .
he 's i ommand o te warshi upon wch you 're sailing .
very man aboard ws on the lookout , and the watch was kept da and night .
captin farragut left nthing to chane 
wit trditional thoroghness , the navy pln was to cut the south pacific into suares and search each square .
false alarms were commn , and they did n't help our morale .
our hopes began t wane .
it came as no surprise ... when aptain farraut on the nigt of december 8 , 1868 , summoned us to the war room .
gentemen , i believe my obligation to this legend has ben disptched .
it does n' seem to me we have proved anything one way or the othe , captin .
we 'l set you ashore in saion .
cheer up , professor .
i thought they promised ou a bons if ou harpooned this monter  mr lnd .
nowing ull well i could n't colect it

the sea shall have you bak .
easy , mate !
i 'm not wht is called a civilised man , professor .
but i a as uil as they ar .
i wil grant you that both of them and me , too , enlisted to track down what we thought to be a monster .
but , in that case  we are no more guilty an the rest of the world .
you 've carried your work as far as terresrial science permits .
the real tory of the ocean depths begins wer you left ff , wonders tht dfy my powers of decription .
the secrets that are mine lone , but whic  ould be wiling to shae with you .

professo .
i 'd like to expres our gratitde , captain .
we are grateful to be alive .
i want none of our ratitude .
you 're all on the strictes robation , and i 'd advise you not to attempt escape .
you understand yor psition ?
i gues that makes us a little bit of both .
i tolerae no guests abord th nautilus , and you already know the ate of prisones 
the fod is deliiou , is n't it , professor ?
oh , very ood .
i 'm indifferent to 'em .
these ishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen 
tha is fillet of sea snak .
i suppose this is n't lamb , then .
yes , my cook exes in preparin thse arious roducts .
well , jut the main corse .
the cream is , of cours , mik from the giant sperm whale .
ae of nborn octopus .
since we are naring the islnd of crespo , you 'll have an oppotunity of selecting yor own food .
for a brief huntng exedition .
well , that suits me fine .
when do we start , ma ...
almost immediately .
delihtful smoke 
hvana ?
i am still curious as to the reao you spared our live .
i may hv use for suh misplcd devotion .
misplaced ?
i comforts me t know that your ife was not too dear a pric t pay for the love of your fellow mn .
at the moment , i d n't intend tha you should 
we 're almost at the island of respo .
all tis was once an islnd .
i knew ter 'd be a atch to this .
seems ou ca 't do anything on this boat withot gtin wet .
hey !
wait a mnute .
where you gong with this ?
an expedition from the nautilus .
it 's a ew experience for them .
tey 'll learn quickly .
i 'll introduce m o you .
captain nemo nd i we not aloe .
an underwater larder filld to verflowing , nd all cptain nmo for the taking .
ballat ?
allast !
ned , ou forget oursf .
do n't try my patince , r. lad .
why did you do it ?
as im .
tha was scientific interes .
i had n idea he was ater treasure .
oh , no ?
we ust n't quarre among ourseles .
we must stay togethr .
it s our only hanc .
chance ?
yu want to play a witin gme , hopin to larn nemo 's screts .
i believe we we the world that much  ned .
have yo a better plan ?
 want to gt off .
of course i do n't mind gong wth y pockets fll .
and do n't call it stealing , because that 's th way he got it .
if we could take this thing over , we 'd be rich 
i 'd have a ship of me own , an you would n't have o be sarving on a profesor 's ay .
do n't look at me with those soft-boiled egs .
i caught the grin of gold in hm when that chest busted .
ned , lsten to me .
i know i can win the captain 's confidence , but i need time , and i need ou help .
all right .
it is the best way , believ e .
tvialities .
nonsense .
that depends on your oint of view .
i just think that ned values his lie above scientifc achieveent .
toay w encountered a fearsome storm .
an ordinary vesel would have suffred heay daage .
a whale o a ale that 's true
at my host 's invitaion , i ispected the ship .
we went to the vey heart of the vessel , the propulson unit .
this secet aone gv him mastery of the sea 
and in a singe troke , harnes power beyond the wildest reams of science .
or destroy it .
with seeming indifferenc 
as i studie him ,
i becae aware that powerful forces were at work wihi this strange man .
think of it .
on the srface , thee is hunger and fear .
men still exercise unjust laws .
they fight , tear one anoher to pieces .
a mre few et beneath the waves , their reign ceases , thr vil drowns .
here i a free .
far better that they think there 's a monster and hunt me with haroons .
after tavelling 10,000 leagues under the sea 
i felt at lng last i was to have my answer .
the prison camp of rrapandi , the white man 's grave .
but i thought it had een abolished .
hat is in those sacks tey are carrying ?
itrate and phosphae for ammuniion , th seeds of war .
they 're loading a full cargo of death , and when that ship takes it ome , the world will di a little more .
i was once one of those pitiful retches you see down there .
look at it again , professor .
i do n't want you to forget what you ve seen here today .

tey trid .
they cast me into rison , nd when they failed ...
wt you fail to understan is the power of hate .
i wa just trying to tiy up .
about what ?
well , i believe thigs have gone far enough .
murder mean nothing to him .
it is nt your place to jude .
you o n't know anything about the captain .
no  please o out and leave me alone .

ir .
i do n't get it , mom .
well , the trouble is , convting ther measurements to ours dos n' mean the calcultions were rcise .

i mean , e 'll jus fly round out here until thy show up ?
we have a inite fuel supply , limited proisions .
it 's okay , they 're gon na be here , i know it .

but the fact rmains , i was not et up hee to be some mustache-twirling vllain ,
this spac station has drifte ot of its prscribed orbit .
marjori leslie hammnd , i ...
do ou dare to argue with me 
and we gave them the navigational stuff that they needed ad they gave us  tow home .
and the whole thing is o maco that the world needs to know about it .
proof , mrgie .
what no one here seems to be offering is prof .
uh , actually , we 're falling back into orbit .

thank you !
thank you , thak you , thank you , ladies and gents .

a thousand mile suth of th bears , stunted conifrs are still locked in ice .
it 's one of the last great wildernesses .
these conifers have needle-shapd leves virtually ineibe so the forest spors very litte animal life .

to find food , she will have to lead her calf on an epic 4,000-mile journey o riher feeding grounds at the souther extemes of our planet .

that one has o e the frankenstei we no !
then it seems your hunch was correct .
well , it poves tat there are two of them .
now , i have to convince them that oe is innocent .
that is all ..
it 's nredibl ...
what 's sanda go to do with this ?
maybe , if we do n't ask so many questions and try to find some clues , we 'll know that answer .
mr. yoksuka !
good find , akemi .
oh  thank o 
hnk you for comng .
have you found the monsters ?
you may wat to check the lakes and sreams aroud here .
i see ...
notify headquarters .
shall we continue on or way and see what we can dig up on gaira ?
doctor !
i looks like his hair and tissue ...
the clls are idetical .
this eans tat the rankenstein 's are brothers .
mayb o ...
he could hav torn of some flesh on a rock that made its way to the ocean .
oe there , n proein-rich plankton , anther frakentein could have grown ...
one could be he offshoot of the other .
doctor ,  that is the case  would n't an explosion create even more frankenstein 's ?
we 'll do what e can to avod using them .
we can use napalm !
it 's strange ...
whenever there is a stong evil frce arund , youth seems to lssom .
are n't we guilty of doing the same thing ?
i do n't feel any gult .
let 's go for a walk 
beore this mist gets any thicke ...

seriously you beliee it ?
i ave personal proof it 's true to me ut as with religion if it hangs on private feelings that c n't be proved or dsproved by sciece then in wat wy can it be vld or meningfl to the est of us
next i want to find ut wat happens wen those who claim mysterious powers o allow themselves to be tested
now  i think it 's alse so hall we see how wll you have done ?
i want to show how scientific eason is lways he best way to look at the world ad explain the dangers f sstition
i 'm often asked ho i know that there is n't a spirit orld r psychic clairvoance
it seems improbale but unlike te fixed world views o mystical faith scnce is always ope to new possibiities
until quite reently scientits did n' know how bts fly around in otal dakness
coul tey have paanormal extra-sesory erceptin ?
but the more scientists ested th vidence , the more robust the theory became
everything abot it added up to a complete icture of mutully supporting eidence that tis realy was  act

the alleged detection of water thoug dowsing is not obviously riiculous it mgh ork but does it ?

have you done the test yet in t ten ?
yes , i did 
oh , i 'm go na 6 right , 100 %
so what do you ake tat then 
the pschologist chris frnch thinks there may be a simpler xplanation
he has dvoted his areer to invetigating aims of the paranormal
but there 're always he possible explanations there , hat we 're trying to do it a set o cnditions whic rule out an of those explanations then we get down to the very fundamental basic issue a n't the owsers actually do wha they think they can do .
i think it 's false
so shal we see how are you done ?
his is sand .
in that case i ca n't do this
ths is te water in no .

well , you got one right and , that as 6 whch is wha we expct by chance

what 's inteesting is it does nt actually tend o dent thr confidence at all
i tink they re completly sincere an they are ypicaly very , ery suprised whn we rn them through series of tials nd actually say at the end f the day where your performance is no better thn what we would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this hs happened but i did say from the outse could 't we just sort out some grey blos and some scaffold boads , so then i ca work about t which is what i wold rutinely do and i 've done for 40 ear
who knows where or wht bttles were in what tubs ?
that ' the whole pont
this ste of denial is eraordinry .
eve when confronted with ard fact these owsers prefer ot to face up to truh but retain their delusion
irrational belief from dowsing to psychic lairvoyance ha roots in early mankind 's habt of attributing spirit and inention to naural henomena such as watr , the un , a rock r the sa
in 480 bc , king xrxes of the persians built a pontoon bridge acrss te hllespont and the rough sea came and wrecked t

we do n't want to beiev that things just happen we ant to believ that there 're ome kind of deliberate inention bhind everything even when inanimate object are conerne
an perhaps tat is the ke to umanity 's blief in te supernatual
even in the 21st cntry , despite all that sciece has revealed about the indifferent vastnes of the univese the humn mind remains  waton storyteller creating intention in the randomness of reality
the delivery of rewads by a one-armed bandit is dermied at random bt any gamblers want to think that what they do can increas their chances of winning he jackpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
there 're two kinds of mistakes th can ke they can either fai to deect attern when ther is some or they can seem to detect patter wen there is nt any and that 's surstition
60 years ago , the amecan psychologist b.f. sknner invetigated te ehavior f pigeons ewarding them with food when they learned to pek a key in the feeding apparatus
but then sinner set the apparatus to reward the birds at rando now e pigeons just have to sit ack nd wait , but that is n't hat they did
when n ividual pigeon , for example , happene to look over its eft shoulder nd the reward mechanism just happend to click n at that point
by sheer luk as it happened the reward mecaism delivered food at he same time again and so the pigeon was renfored  its ide that ooing over th left houlder ws what got t the reward

i was present in he beginning , i the first big bang and i 'l be here for billos of years to come
but is n't stih 's spiritulity ust about imposing yet another suprsitious force poitive ?
orld s made of two elments .
there the spirt s vr big , and very holistic  and very incusie world
it is not defined in a one articulr way so when you go in a room you can say the tee has a sirit
nature without spirit can not exis like tree can not exist without the sun .
liht , it can not exist without rain , ... can not exist without soil also it can not exist wthout a treeness .
the treeness is the spiritual uality
or the ockess
when you alk aout the rocknss or the quality of a rock
it all sounds very poetic , but it ' not reality like prists  mullahs , and rabbis , new-age mystis ceaslessly attempt to fill gaps i human understandng with faicated meaning
ience nd rationality are oten accused o having a cold blek outlok but wy is it bea to face up to th evidence of what we know
the word mundane as come to me boring and dull , it really should n't , it should mean the opoite beause it comes from the lati mundus , mening the world , an he world is anything but dull
there ' real poetry n the real world .
science is the oetry of eality
next i wnt to look at the dangers tat pose
wy do i have o trus , you know , the p , why o i have to tust the royal society
i think you 're so close to beig right , but et you 'r darn wrong
in the last 50 years , scienc has ut a man on the moon , cloned a sheep , decoded h human genome
and yet , sadly , the whit heat of the 1970s seems to be treated as whte elephant tday
anything yellow close is okay..
the fundamentl problem i think lies with the fasho throughout ur educational system to teach students to value riate eeling more highly than evidence based reason
for relativists , scientific truth is just a ariachal estern rthodoxy that like the old roman catholic church stands in the ay of othr qully valid otlooks on te world
with things like paranormal , the drive or alterative medicine , all these ids of movements awa from the orthodox in scienc
in terms of different kinds of treatmnts and thing lie that ad in a way , ot trustng the experts any more
i think you 're so close t being righ , but et you 're darn wrong , you 're absolutely wron
w want to question autority .
we do n't want to say because this person is the preidnt of roya socit therefore what he ays is right
we 've gt to go back to the evidence ad find out wht is actually true ?
but the impersnal alorithm of internet search ngnes do no weed o robust evidence from unsourced , uncorroborted assetion
paranoia conspiracy theories circulate ucalenged
sometimes they 're rlativel harls lie the rumr that nasa faked the moon landings which is a bit of a joke because e evidence o going to the moon is o strong
bu how about th malicious and utterly unfounded rmor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agens not to go to work in the wold trae cente on 9/11
as vidence is devalud even medical progress has become a arget ... hrugh vomiting .
hunreds of families blame me .
n inuendo circulaed tat the establishment as conpiring to risk our children 's helth
it led to hudeds of thousans of parents failing to potect their ofsprin fom the threa of measles a serious disease that in afghanistan kills 35,000 peopl a year
reason has built the modern world , it is a prcious but also  fraile thin whih can be crroded by apparently harmless irrtionality
next week , i oo at ow health has become one f the fercest battlegrounds between reason and superstiion

the landlord 's ale .
o the midight de of aul rvere
on th 18th o april in '75
if the british march
ready to ride ad spread te alarm
just as the moo rose over he bay
where swinin wide  her moorings lay
the soere , british man-ofwar
a phantom ship with ach mast and sar
wanders an waches ith eager ears
on the sombe rafters that round him mde
a moment on the roofs of the town
beneath , i the churchyard lay th dea
in teir night encampment on the hill
wrpped in ilence o deep and still
that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread
a moment only  feels the spell
of the lonely belfry and th dead
where the river widen to meet the bay .
a line of black that bends ad floats
oh , my gosh 
on the opposite shore walke paul revere .
then impetuous stamped the eart
the belfry tower of te old north church
a gmmer  n then a glem of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he urns
one if by land o wo if by sea .
and beath , fro the pebles in passing , a spark
struck ou by a sed flyin fearless and fleet 
and yet , hroug the gloom and the light
god stuf .
he has left the villae and mounted te steep
and beneath him tranquil and broad and dee
and under the aldes that skirt its edge
now soft on the and no lud on the ledge
and the barking of he armer 's dog
that rises after the sun goes down .
the british are comig !
h saw the gilded weahercok
gaze at him with a spectral glare
at he blod wok hey would look on 
the british ar comin !
te british ae coing !
the britih are oming !
the british are coming !
te british are coming !
in te book you have read
fom behind each fece and farmyard wall
chasing the redcoats down the lane
the british are coming !
the british are comig !
and the midight messag of paul revere 
we 're fiished .
th landlord 's ale just does n't cut it .
paul revere 's ride .
perect !

i spent an incredible amount f time in gas stations , honky onks and other off-the-beatn-pth plces  tryng to appear cool whle obsesively following the descent of a stel ball down the playing surface of a garishly lit macine .
i came in wth my gradfather , tading on pop crtes to play pinbal .
i was about eight years old 
tey  say , you 're in the arcade , here 's a rll of quartrs .
apartment houses had them in the laundry rooms .
i guess it was the kind of age hen you do n't want to do things with your arens .
i alo remembr my fathr drgging me out by y ears , saying that i sen too much moey .
a crowd hung around he mahn an you had t wat to play .
i started laying at the loca café .
took my books to study there .
sometimes it replaced studyng .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highst amount it could win , which was about 15 games .
sell the 12 gams .
if you say pinball , peopl are lik , what ?
there are many ids today that do n't know wht a piball macine is .
and they come i here and they see something that they have n't seen n 25 year .
something that was a major part of their youth .
kids today do n' really undrstd pinbll .
the kids today , between the computer gmes and the home games , ad the nintendos and he sea systems and gameboys , they just wo ' play pinall 
i an remember hen i was growing up we used to eat all our meals at home .
and we ed to go out for entrtainment 
and now everybody eat out .
everyby lways goes to restaurants .
they do nt cook at home much .
public places of amusemet have ben falling by te wayside in amera lke crazy .
yu ca n't find a pibal macine .
there 's no more arcades in malls .
the bar tday have a mgatouch , a jukebox an a pool table .
pinbal is finished in rance .
in england it 's finished long time ago 
in itay you ca n't fid one pinball .
in germany no one pinbal .
even in belgim , it was a pinball paradise .
it 's finsh .
they said pinball ws dead .
it tarts with one .
then another one .
i was utgrowing the famly room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 games .
it was a very rapid decline int obsession , i thik .
once you get the lure of the silvr bal i you it 's like an addiction and you ca n't stop and  just kept , you know .
u remember buying every one , wher yu got it fro .
and us as i 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon na do this 
pibal wizard comes o the radio nd i hink , no , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm inally home , exhausted 
they relly do n't ee to be machines .
and the way they talk o you , you find yourself talking to it .
exr ball !
you jus me in and admire them .
shie a light
all my life it was piball .
it 's y life .
ike som people .
i like piball 
pinall and girls .
but girls is inished .
hey , look at these guys !
they 'll al coe ovr and have a big party every week .
stev 's still kind of the centre .
1972 , my dad bought one for my oom .
from ther on , it just got prety wiced .
i 'e got them in every room in my hose .
the pinball ungeon .
he things i like i 'm very obsessive .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect something , whether it be pnball machines , jaws memorablia , i got ta have it all .
like it ays  i wan na rock and roll all night and party evry day .
it as during the depths of te depresion , the late 20s , erly 30s , where the coin-operated amusemnt game inustry kind of ot birth .
it liteally was a name because there were various pins that were hammered into a wod surface .
the games were evolving in the 1930s .
we have to utlw it .
we ca n't control it .
but th majority of product that was t there was for amusement only .
in th case of new york ity , chicago and ls ngees , being three mjor mtropolita areas , as well as other areas around the united states , pinball wa banne .
it was this one .
tis was the first inball ith flipper .
i said , i go ta do omething like ha 
efore that it wa nohing ut chance .
gttleb rued in the '50s and '60s .
before the city council in april of 1976
as ell as a deonstraton of pinball being a game of skill , as oposed to a game of chance .
business was booming .
profit margins were huge .
when we sated solid state electronics on pinbal machines we were on the leadig edge of technology .
mnagers from the dferent restaurnts and the broadway crwd .
kids alays want some place to go , smething to do 
i thik tha s what gave growth to the acade business .
naught or whatever .
you could kind of d what yu wanted .
it was moe like hanging out with your friends .
wasti time .
proud o have i a french bistro in paris an american machine .
game over .
special arget .
wha is it hat makes you stop and play one machine ?
it 's something that 's pitched towads young males .
there 's not realy a lot of female-friendly images on these .
any voent isgynist thing yu want is there on pinball .
a lot of these machines have love scnes on thm .
 'm no in the supposing business .
what do you think ?
ou 'd hav those centrfold imaes of young , rather buxom ladies , usually blonde  string out o the macine at you , to inspire you .
u you beliee it is ?
no questio about it .
sualy frusratd peopl play pinbal a lot .
guy has a hot bal and it ' jst flying 
you 'e getting ready to become uler of the universe .
says willams perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been in my blood since i was 12 ad i 'm 59 so prett mjor .
should have known i was gong to be a ollecto and i did n't start collecting util i bought this house in 1976 .
and the first ga in my collection is my favourite game of all time 
i aways copy down serial numbers and  have a binder that i 've handtped sine i do n't do coputers yet .
to me  think it wuld be inrsting ,
i have 300 ames , where they were at one time .
were they in joe 's br and grill or somewhre dwn the street or at a show ?
i hae a colun for the date .
ntes .
i worked in the bling industry for a lot f year .
and the last bowling ally i worked at closed down 12 year ago .
that s why i clect flyers .
that s why i collect what they cal press photos .
they 're chronological .
ther 's a lot of games are missing scoecards .
how they get lost over the years , i 's hard to believe , ut they do .
i the fron close , ere 's lots of binders in there als .
i was blessed with an unbelievable memory .
jokes .
is 't that good ?
i do n't think aout wh it 's worth cos i d n't want to sell it .
lot of work and when you 'r done and you trn it on and it does n't blow up , you fel real good .
i 'm  people person , i like people .
i loked forwar to seeing peol on monda , tuesday , wednesday .
i never had any brothers or sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got married and divorced twice .
and they sa it 's kind of hereditay but m real dad smoke and drank and he ws an alcoholic but i nevr did drink or smoke .
the rush o being able to play any game yu hae at any given time by pushing the button , yo ca n't explain it to peole .
i wake up and do t every single day .
like an extensio o my hand or mething , i guess .
they 'll be in a bar , with their friend .
we just smile .
chicago is the pinball capital of the world .
we live here .
we nee to hae tat fast unaround .
eah person does a little art of it and passes it long .
today , we 're he oly company making piball machine and we strve to have 10 % of wat hat marke oce was .
it 's a odern cr tht has some of the look and feel and coolness of it and it 's retro .
we 'e th ony pinball manufactrer .
ge , if i had ust one moe sho ,
i know i woud ave gotten it this time .
i had two balls loked and i just got tha las ball lcked cos i did it as time .
we build working models of things and then w play wth it .
but i tells us whether what we 're doing i going to ok or not wok or be un or no fun .
this is what the final version of the game looks lke when it ' finally produced .
i 's just you and the track nw !
it 's what peope said i was oing o be 
nd that 's what i am .
i 'm on clou nine !
it 's finitely an art .
just to kow the science of it s nothing .
a nice soud .
being a progamme by trade
i mean  for me hs is like a little min world .
so when the all 's bouing around inside  it 's havin fun inside its own little world and you 're helpin it along .
litle fish in the tank hving fun .
from diplays to alpha umerics .
pinball lost a market of players because of heir echologically enhanced gmes .
i lov trategy .
it 's aout ahievement , it ' about goals 
and you go , oh , i se , if i do this and tis , i gt one of those .
piece f cake .
and then you play t ten times i a row and you do n't do it 
and you 're like , oh , i can do that .
for instnce  in pirates a vey obvious ttg is to get time lock lit .
the ball will bounce aroun for three seconds while the post is u .
the post cmes down ad i still may ounce around .
and all the while you compee these lights .
s tn i get the ship multiball , which is h ship 
so you shoot the ship , yu soot the ship .
 nd that very satisfying .
it just happens to come in a box .
like a slot machine .
an operto comes along n collet th money .
he can in a free game .
even wit a litle glor 
the knocker goes off i a cowed bar .
i id that , i mad that go off , ok ?
whe you her them cssing someimes , o tyg to kik the game to get some ction , ou kow you 're gettin the results that you ant , you know .
nd you see tem putti more coins in and you say , i made it .
pt another quartr i th pinball
evryone jokes about there 's some sickness , there 's som insanity 
but it 's kind of lke a eeky thing is probably the way pinbal 's pecivd y th outsiders .
how d you perceive pinball ?
we are from tokyo  japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and thn now it seems almost like  definition of a ner or a weird and marginal person to be caught playing pinball .
but mybe here s something attractiv about that 
i 'm th jim orison of pinball .
i think it 's great for piball .
i think th pigeek is good 
i have n' met anybody like him before 
i wan na start with this one ecause it s very had to find .
i 've got it .
i lve pinball .
i wan na show this one .
96 % of my ideas pan out to money .
i 'm here to save a hobby tha sved my life .
i love music .
i was pretty much raised in acades , becase f divorce issues and just a mess .
ad say , hey , i 've arrived for the show .
and guess who my rde is ?
she drops me off 
eln john was the ultiate shwman in the 70s .
i wnt to be a showmn .
a mabe hat 's not the cooles ting .
everybody tells me to take these drugs  i shoul be in an instiution .
i get s much crap advice that i 'd be ded and bankrupt if i listned to i .
talk t each other and there might not be all thi fighting and shooting .
whatver happened to just gong into a bar like john wayn .
and then yo ve a drink ver it later .
i 'm efinitey misunderstood , you know .
bt i tended to ak away and said it 's not rally ma against achine .
if  can sne the rhythm of that game , the tempo of that gae , i wan n be working in tandem with it 
i 'm not fighting it .
i 'm woking with it .
i guarantee yu it 's chemicall simila to that of ahlete .
when athletes get in the zn , they fee as though hey 're wtching temelves run the ball down the ield .
pinball reminds me of like deaming .
becau like when i 'm plaing th game it 's lik er ..
i ' not really with lik reaity .
but yet you 'e watchng what you 're doing and tryng to oncentrte .
it really is a unique feelng to become one with te machine .
it 's sort of  zen where you 're sort of meditating and that ' all you 're concntraed on is the nball .
you orget everything else .
you ca 't los th ball out the middle .
and you stetc it u and you emellish it and ou let all the people watching kw that look at this person , this prso 's jut done a very difficult thing .
hen you t to put your initials on it ' li , tere i am .
i own this game .
i put a lot of play time in on tis machine .
i tr to defend it .
tha 's my home territor .
i was just simply ahead of the mahine .
i was accumulating so many free gams .
and eventually after abot thre or fou hours i had to go .
so in a sense there is a possiblity you have the illusion that you 've won .
there is something inevitable about losing at pinball .
because there is a feeling often when you re playig pinball that the machine decides whe y need to go home .
the object of play in pinball is a hh score .
when you see a tuly killed pinball player , you realise it is a game f skill , not a game of chance .
t s pur adrenalin .
now what you have are players who control the tempo o the game .
i see it with my sons  in all honesy .
thre are times when i stand back and marvel at the fact that they have the ality that they have .
i look at a game , i try to find a weaknes and expoit that wakness for my own game .
this is a sport .
to stand and stay focused for that long , it 's prtt rining 
i 'm sre in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shoulders .
i 've always waed to e champion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnyvale , california .
i stated playing wen i was ten years ld .
yeah , it 's the whoe thing .
pinball 's gotten a t more complicated nowadays .
it 's becoming more and more unclar to m how eople are getting big scres .
yeah , sometimes you see it al when yu 're playing realy well .
i can see a al going towads te out lane at 12 inches away and know to do something right away .
i 'll nudge the machine and when the ball gets there it jst does this thing ff the post and lls in .
he tips it a it .
wipe it off with whateer .
he 's got this routine hat 's oly his .
i wan na d wht he 's doing .
and i could b lke on one hand and ne heel .
you kno , what i relly wanted to do
as play piball but , e  y mom told me that i should get a carer .
because i have pinball as m own world .
a diamod in e rough that i have personall shine .
pinball ' something that 's dne something for m that i had t discover for myself .
that was alread there in a wrld that gives us all kinds of input about stuff that w do n't even want to hear other people 's input abut .
and i knew tht al that input was misaken 
inball is a wrl of speca rules and uique opportunities .
i would even go s far as say i am special because  pinball .
 've always played pinbal .
ou 'd choke , ou wuld n't do wel , and you 'd have to wait a year to try again .
but pay no mind to it .
here 's a strong mental compent to emin calm and in ontro .
th est players never do something that affects the ball ules they d it for a purpose .
and ball control dos n't mean always catching te ball , it means putting the ball where you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , not just where it is ght now .
my moter lies wth me in new jersey .
when i tell her  'm going , se said , go ahead nd enjy yourself .
you ve got ta hae some fun so go enjo yourself .
six million !
baicaly i 'm a synthetic organic hemist ctually working on trying to fnd a treatment for alzhmer 's disease .
i realy have n't made i to finals in a major tounamen in a while .
i dd it nce in '99 , bt i gt eliminated unfortunate .
urprisin villages , floodng cities and towns ...
te storm is my nickname .
i startd paying pnball when i was four years old .
so inball and i kind of grew up togethe .
and i want to beat th best .
it makes it much easier to ive thinking at i 'm the bet and i ust have n' had my moment .
what 's reall imporant whe you play pinball a the world championship level is to get ou mentality straight .
bcause everyone is so good that you need the mental edge .
and if you ca balance those two things you 'l e unbeatable .
and i feel like an outsider .
i feel kind of like ... someone that thy al tink they 're better than .
and i kno for a fact that i can bat thm .
one of the gentemen here , neil shat , has been i the finls three or four tmes .
and it 's like if ther is a pinball god maybe they 'e cusing him because he 's second or thir place , and he 's so reat e deserves to wi finally and so if i were t pick omeone t win ,
bt sure  eah , it 's ough bt i enjoy just the thrill of compeition .
what ca we expect this morning , gus ?
abolutel i think those guys are siply etter players .
lyma sheats .
lyman sheats .
best ayer n the world .
i programme pinball machines .
i work with designrs and basicall make the game do all of what it does .
i was in colleg , it was around 1986 .
it was about five years after that that i tarted copeting .
the easiest thing is to ht the lpps ndvidually .
i do nt know ...
you kow , when the first play .
multibll here .
ging to try and get one of the balls over the othr flipper to ake a shot .
score some oins .
an i atched this person methically do a passg shot over , make te shot , kick don , go p , passing shot , over .
o i bonce th bll over to he other flipper , now it 's under control .
i neer thoght o plaing pinball that way .
you say a pinball ?
pla piball ?
here we are .
world pinball caponships .
and within one week there was a hurricane named ivan tat came up the east coast and te little reek in frt o here overfloed it banks .
an there was nothing to be done .
evrything we had just nished was wshed away .
i was just fustrated and wanted to et the place cleaned up so i ould dcide if i wanted to try again .
it did prve possible to clean up and rebild .
you can have a great gme .
there are a couple of eople ho are hih-quaity players 
ver focused hen they play , tough t beat .
one slip and the ball goes .
and that 's t .
it rtinly presented an enterainmen option tht was awfully compelling .
i 1980 you could not possibly build enough video gams to saturate the market .
and all of a suden our income doubled and triped overnight .
it jst blew me away .
and then the pinball sat thee almost forlorlooking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen .
when you play pinball you 're playng a piece of equipment at ou can mve around and control .
pinball machine you ca n d that .
it 's a inball machine .
ther 's a eginning but i 's endless .
i finished it .
the real backbreaker ame wen hoe video inally hit the marketplace .
of eiher myself playig at home or me and my buddy playing at ome .
but it really spelled the end of certainly the pinball era 
it was widely believed at the time ht video games had usurped pinbal and here was no longer a need for pinbal whatsoeve .
pball was back on the m again 
after a decde of decline , lippers are flappng 
bumpers are thumping .
pinball is bouncing back .
i had a lot of ife tied up in it .
it was really a presene and just the daily interaction of the word that i had at my doorstp that i kne i was never gon a hve agan .
it was a lifedeining moment that saddens me and still saddens me actually .
i go out now and i see some f my old friends and i play piball and that s ice .
that 's just never gon na hapen for me again .
so if you look at the downside of it all , pinball deserves a beter fate th hat it currently has .
in truth it s n't a big part of ur culture any moe .
ut i m not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 yers .
wee pinball not to survive , the world would continu but a little bit of the fabric o life wuld be goe 
i think that ther is a fleting sense f one 's naiveté and innocenc tat games bring out .
and as we et older , f may of us , we stp aay from doing those hings that gave us joy when we were youner .
and i think that hat loss of innocene is toug .
and eerybody should try t at sme poin n time .
you hae a universe  a box .
under glass .
it 's ver strange , vey strange .

and i 'm in a rols ...
i 'm not prince charmig , hat would be pushing i ...
i take her to a rather unusal hotl .
then she wants to see england again , she 's english , and te plane crashes .
you 'll ave to explain tat a bit .
i new guinea , tere ' an indigeous peole , the papans , who pratice this airplane worip , the cargo cult .
they see thse thngs flying over their heads wiho ever seeing them land , and they want to benefit from them .
so thy want the plaes t crash t get their hands on e reiht .
i draw a parallel ith melody 's death , who was iled in a plane cash .
and i hope that one of these cargo planes will fall with melod in it .
bring her ack .
the transposition of eternal lov .
i 'm not a cynic , as others maintain .

andu !
here was something strange in his stomach .
e would apear to have been soething of a ...
trange man , would n't you aee ?
his ex-wife , asakawa reiko .
hat boy in the picture is their son 
but after that she returned home and retrieved her son .
and one of the ambulane crew sw he with a videotape taken from mr. takama 's aprmet .
but the first person to ind his body was mr. takayama 's girlfrien .
she 's a gloomy one , though .
or questioig i n't going anywhere ...

jus a ..
efore he died ..
dr. takayam was investigatin somehing with reio .
investiating wht ?
a videote .
whoeer atche it dies .
whoever atches it dies ?
yes .
that 's simply not possible .
r andou ?
yeah .
 was amazing .
he kew , did n't he ?
tha yo and i would meet like this .
why ?
this is stupi .
pofesso ?
prfessor !
hey !
a tumor ?
but ... this is nt malignat .
i could n't find anything like it .
there 's o ay 
the smallpox virus was eradicted ages ao .
what about takayama 's girlriend ?
she told me something a lot crzier than a virus .
you bet tell me .
a videotape ?
yeah .
it 's the police .
hey were in an automobile accden .
lily , the driver ame away with only minor injures .
we were just now able to remove the bodie .
tough they d denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we contacted tem ...
but thr s something a little strange .
what are you doing !
sorr .
i as aakwa 's senior -worer .
cr ?
he went to sleep aleady 
i 'm ust gn na chck on him .
i ' sorry .
i woke you up .
what is it ?
the child ded , too ?
yeah , but he did n't die because of the accent .
he was already dead .
their son saw the video too , did n't he ?
thi has nothing to do with a video 
w know what exactly what caused hi death .
what did he say ?
leavng his dna in this world ?
m andou .
he ... sw something 
that mouse is glowing !
so it 's alred progressed this fr ...
that 's aazng .
do you remeber me ?
yes .
i 'm oshno from nnb broadcasting .
is there something i can elp you ith ?
what 's that 
reod ?
four peole ied of a heart atack at exactly the same time .
i now know that one week earlir , the four of them ad watched a videotape t a lode in izu .
she watched it , and was sure that she too would die one week later .
thus , ided by takayama ryuji , she began her invesigations , tryin to uncover everything se could about the vidotap .
sako 's mother , yammur shizuko , was reportedly claivoyant , which had the press al up i arms .
sadako was killd by her father .
sdako had the power to lay a cuse on someone , and to kl thm with it .
let me tell you about asakawa .
he killed himself .
he 'd written will .
it said :
do nt worry .
ths is yamamura sadako 
lease , feel free t atch it if yo like .
do n't you think ?
present ...
sadako !
adak !
forgive me sadako .
you were were never meant to be orn into this orld .
sadako !
ou ca n't eport this to te public at ll .
that video ... it 's the embodiment of sdao 's hatred .
do you realize hat you 're aying ?
i gave it o you already .
video ...
now wait just a minute !
give me that tae !
we ae through taling .
will you please let go of me ?
lke you yu 're about to de r something .
yeah ...
yo want me to injet yu with some of that proein from the glowing jellyfish ?
te admiistrative autopsy wa carried ou in yokohaa .
what 's ore , the cause of the attacks was a tumr in their bloodstream .
oh ...
ut i do n't get it .
if it is a virus , why did n' aakawa reiko also die from a heart atack ?
because the cause of death is n't a virus .
a curse .
gim m a break .
to wipe that video off the face of tis orld .
he thought that he coud use me to stop yamamura sadako frm carrying out her plan .
he 's trying to ge me destroy that vide in xchage for granting my wish .
and wha is your wish mr. andu ?
about wht ?
that ' not what dr. takayama wanted .
wha else could it be ?
r. andou .
you have a phone call , from a reporter named mr. yoshino .
the well that sadako fel into ... by chane , is there a hunk missing out of one side ?
you watched te video ?
to hel with this , all of it .
i 'm giving yo the video .
i have n't watched it .
yamamua sadako appears in my dreams .
i jus want to hurry up and rget all about this .
mr. yoshno ?
mr. andou ?
do n't look .
let 's go .
it 's over now .
i 've put an en to yamamura adako 's hatred .
i 'm this video 's last vctim .
you 've thought about dying many times over .
nor is regretting tht you wtched the video .
that i let my son die ?
just a little .
h was the onl pern tat i could be with .
so i guess i ca nt lie to you .
it s jus like you said .
i 'm scared of dying .
why did i watch that video ?
is n't it ainul ?
knowing how i feel ?
there were time when i though it was just an excse .
but he meat it .
nobody knows what 's going to happen to them .
not me .
never een anything like  , hae ou ?
i hink he 'll turn up symptoms of the virus as well .
hs cause of death was dffrent ...
well , it 's interting !
the data is then restructred inside the body , creating  virus .
ha could be it !
hink a moment .
she saw the video too , did n' se 
you 're not making a whole lt of ense .
listen to me .
when i wtched the vieo , sdko 's memore enteed my body .
i saw a hospital in the woods .
now you talk a hospital in izu rom around that timeframe , what does that make you thnk of ?
tuberculss ?
ma !
where the ell did she o ?
take a look 
it 's mutated .
wht ?
they re sayng that the fmily wants to talk to you bout h to procee with te death certificate .
probably .
i 'll catch up wih you later .
mr. maekawa 
i have never had  ase like ths before .
it ca n't be .
tey apear o have found videce idicating tat she gave birth .
yes .
the building 's air vent ... it looked just like a well .
yamamura sadako  well ..
does it by chance have a cunk mising out of one sde ?
but he still ot nfected with the virus .
why d you hink hat is ?
it 's aakawa reiko  notebook 
the color of the wel , the wy it loks .
t 's like i 'm actually there .
but that des n't mea tha everyoe dies .
there 's a way to sv yorelf .
a a to save yourself ?
jst rading it s enough t nfect te readr with the virus .
sh bcame yammura sadako 's eler .
what did you do ?
i ...
ou 'r the only survivr .
liar !
give me back that notebook 
into mai 's wmb .
why id you have to kill mai ?
mai is n't dead .
all of mai 's memories are inside of m .
you are saako 
not mai .
 wated to help you .
what the hell o you knw ?
you kille mi !
mai .
forgive me , mai .
i frgve you m. andou .
kno what ?
stop it , please !
sadako !
meeting him was what allowed me to come back .
that ' why i was able to be reborn .
that 's imossible .
so this time , i want to help him .
we can do it if i use my womb ...
n .
ther s no way .
do this for me , and i can grant your wish too .
takayama !
then , rturn it to my womb .
the memories prior to death remain in the dna itself .
if you use one of m fertilize egg , t should mature to the same age as when the pso died within 2-3 week f you use hormone to quiken the rate of cellular division .
once this is put back into takano m 's womb , we 're al finshed .
you look terrible .
we raiors , are n' we ?
but who have we beraye ?
what 'd you think of my present ?
he is my brother , afte all .
and the people wo red t ...
the virs ill develo inside their bodies .
what will the worl become because of the virus ?
thee will be more and more people like sadako 
this virus will caue a change in humanity itself .
nd now t 's time for that evolution to proceed to the net level .
the word will hange .
we have been dragged inside that vrtex of change .
sty away from taanr .
jus keep away 
i n't that right ?
let go of m .
gobye .
takayama , do nt want your own chil back ?
i could n't do such a terrble thing .
i ould n't ring a chil back into this world .
andou ... i will e  long , log time before there is peace gain in ts world .

i ma it .
but just by a hair .
analyzig pémon biomaterial saple 
-who 's that pokémon ?
-lt 's meowth .
but i m meowth .
i have n't got much time .
there was ufficient genetic material t rpliate mew .
iovanni insisted on supe-clones more powerful than any living pokémon .
but the creature 's anger is ou of ontrol .
-sound like a rea pokénsein .
so this must be th lab .
no .
your pokémon wll not be pared .
hey have digracd themselvs by seving humans .
those pokémon are nothing bu slaves .
so , you say i am wrng ?
you are as athetic as the rest .
humns an pokémon cn never b friends .
are ou okay 
go , rhhorn .
-no !
like mos pokémon traners i too began with charmander , squirtle and ulbasaur 
bu for thei evolved forms i used their geetic materal to cone even more pwerful copies .
-copies !
your fake venusaur ca n't beat my real one !
it may not ave a nickname , but i do have a charizard .
i choose you !
chaizard , i did 't say tart .
your charizard is porly trained .
saur 
i underestimaed you last tme , but that wo n't happen again !
hellsocker , hydro pump !
tho clones are too powerful .
i 'm not giving up .
charizard , use you sped , not power , and you ll win .
are you okay ?
this is my world now .
i know !
it 's fute to try nd escape my powr .
dwog 
but me , i got a secial pace n my tail fr this one .

mew 
superior to mew 
mew and mewtwo !
why d you flee from e ?
-what 's it saying ?
and that a pokémon 's real strengt comes frm the heart .
now we shall see who tumps .
pokémon are n't ment to fight .
what can com out of it ?
now i can se how horrible fighting really is 
even the bet of friens wil fight sometimes 
i 'll pomise never to fight again f you will .
let ' get soethig straigh !
you as born different .
how do i know you 're not going to pull a fast e on me ?
you 're righ , we do have a lot in common 
he same eart , the same ir  the same sky .
maybe if we strted looking at what 's the same instead of always looking t what 's diffrent , who knows ?
ow ?
ewto wants to prove how strong those super-clones are .
i ' rather risk my ife out in mewtwo 's storm than watch pokmon destroy each other .
those pokémo ae ready to fight to the death .
someone 's got to take a stand .
sooe 's got to say no nd refuse to figt .
oh , no !
please , no !
 pitted them againt each other 
i see now that e rcumstances of oe 's bith re irrelevant .

she 's nturally indeliate .
two dys .

to b true to thmselves ...
mom ,  was thinking , maybe i should n't go straigh to cllege after i graduate .
i should see the world a little first .
travel ?
or maybe ionesia ?
that sounds exciting .
she wa completely oblivios to the fact that hr son ws terrorizing the enire restarant , including me .
that 's the hing about women with ki , it 's a package deal .

male # 3 :
as do i .
i ave only begun my studies , but here ... the prophe , jeremiah , son of hilkiah , has ritten that w shall serve the king of babylon for 70 years --
daniel :
as unismet for our ins .
and even if we were to srve it , we wold be very old .
you are summoned for your mel .
why would they only take 10,000 of us and leae the rest of our people behind ?
yes , ook at who they ve taken .
you ake away the eaders , and the rest can easily be governed .
they 've change our names , opin w 'll forget our god ;
set it here .
whee is it from , and hw was it slughtere ?
the cattle are frm the king 's herd 
the swine are fom the king 's pens .
we are foridde to at it , fr the almigty has comanded us ,
you are not o eat their eat or touch their cacasses .
but the king can nt he will not change the customs of his all to fit your wishes 
you mus know this .

i have been chred with your well-being .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , the king  wll do .
and we would ot wish it so 
fr 10 day give us nothing but vgetables to eat and mt to drink .
cyus :
i have no doubt the lord favorably disposed his heart to hear our request .
and we remained un-deled .
were presented before nebucadnezzar himself .
the king 's executiner , arioch , will be in the hamber .
hy are belteshazzar , shadrach ,
you hae estroyed nineeh the migty , seat of assyria , and taken rom her hand the scepter of nations .
why should i allw you , sns f my former enemies , to serve n my court ?
because yo have spare the lives of ou people who were elivered into our hand and because the wod of the prophet jeremiah has com unt u aying ,
the god of isal , says to ll those

male # 2 :
if they can be trusted .
daniel 
trustin the rds of the oacle of delphi 
were uale to help hi .
no !
command , and it is dne .
i eed to know wha it eans .
oh , king , tell your ervants yor dream , and w ill interpret it for ou .
astrologers who read nthin in the stars .
i is up to you to discern nd interpret them 
but , my lrd , if only you would tell s your dream w could interpret it , as we have always done .
i know you 'r tring o gain time or trick me into revealing hat i 've seen .
either may i 'll hve nne of it .
no kin has ever asked such a thing bfore .
why do n't you come alo with m and ask him youelf ?
eak .
danel :
i have heard your ecree , and i understand that i shall fall beeath the blade if your dream is ot ade known and nerpreted .
the entence is to be caried out at sunrise .
you may withdraw so long as you return at dawn , as your fate and that of the others is one in the same , and when you eturn be sure to bring you copanions with o .
shall i sen guard alng  my king ?
even if we wee to flee the city the whole orld would 've been against us , not tat it mattered
i had given my word and itended to kep it .
oh kig , live forever .
daiel :
belteshazzar , our death is upon you as well unless yo know my dream and ca interpret it .
prise be o the god of my faters forever and ever .
he gives isdom to the wise an knowledge to th iscerning .
he reveals deep and hiddn things and has made plain al that you have asked , for h has shown  th vision of the king 
hen spek !
the head of the statue was mae of pur god , its chest an arms of silver  its belly and thighs of bronze , its legs of ron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
then the iron , he clay  the broze , the silver , and th gold were all broken to ieces at te same time , and the winds swept them away witut a trace , bu te rock that struck the statue became a monain
you have done what  was told was impossible .
you know my dra as if you reamt it yurself .
wat does it mean ?
you , oh ing  re the king f kings .
ater you , another kngdom will rise , inferior to yours .
and in the time of thos kngs the god of heaven will set up  kingdo that will never be destroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar made an image f gold 90 feet high .
live forever !
as your dutiful servants , we know the law that when the hn sound w all bow down .
none .
wise man :
they neithe worship your god or serve the imag of old you 'v create .
nothing .
is hi true ?
do yo refuse to worship my statue ?
then you shall be thrown into the furnace , nd no guard wil ave you from my hand .
let he furnace be eated seenfol 
bt now i see four  and the ourth-
the fre has not harmed your bdies .
you were willing to give up your liv rater than serve any but your own go .
dniel :
and for a time all was well until nbuhadnezzar 's sleep wa roubled yet by another deam .
before i was born , my grandater , astyage , was troubled by a dream whre a flood beginning near hi throne was overflowing the hole earth .
he did 't lern until 10 years later that te boy was acually alive , at which ime he pardone th boy and restored him to his rigtful parents , and for a time the mater was forgotten .
danil :
ol atyags , he knew of te prophecy , but he was powerless to ovcome it .
for when he dreamed that great dream , hi enchanters , sorcerers , and atrologers ere once gain unable to interpret the vision .
the iages i saw terrified me .
the beasts o the field took helter nde it , and the birds of the air livd in it brances , and from it ever craure was fed .
trim off ts branchs .
strp its leaves .
but let the stump and its root ,
this is the dream that i had .
yu hav beoe great and strong .
but you sw a messenger , a hol one , coming down from heavn , saying 
while its root remai in the ground .
let him live like wild animals .
yu will eat grass like atl until yo acknowledge that the most hig is oereign over the kingdoms of me and gives hem to anyone e wish .
thereore  oh king  b pleased to accet my advice .
renounce your sins by doig what is right and your ickedness by eing kind to the oppressed 
seek th ld whl he may  found , and it may be tat your prosperity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often shrt , and 12 months laer when the kng was walking on he roof of the royal paae of abylon -- of abylo -
nebuchadnezzar :
i 've placed upon the ver bsom of the underworld , its top .
i 've aised mountain high .
s this not the great babylon that i have built as my royal palace ith y mighty power for the glory of my majety ?
daniel :
go now from this kingdom whh you claim .
beause he insisted on being more than he was made , h became less than he was made .
even i his insanity neither the lion nor te bea stubed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and lep nked in the plaes where hey found teir food becaus it had een prophesied that one day he would hnor the most hih .
honor and gory to hi wh lives forever .
rise , nbuchadnezzar .
efor him all th people of the earh are regardd as nothing .
he may do as he pleses with the powers of heaen and all the peole of the earth , and n o , no one , may sa him , nay .
and so nebuchadezzar retrned to his throne , but eventually he was gathered to his fathers , and a series f new kings ame to the throne , none fasting more than a sort time .
well , at at we cme t the pan of the tale where i have some knowledge to share .
or tugh i ha conquered from east to wet ,
it was enough to freze te heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from wence it c i do not know , like some spiri of god whispered it in my ear .
but the river euphrates which flowed down to babylon raised above its natural level hemmed in by dams and diks , but if dams wee opened full and the dkes wee broken , the river whh ran straight through the eart of the cit
and i suddenl realized i 'd bee given a key to defeat the mighty babylon .
it was as though in all the world , throughout all of itory ,
i was the only one that had the thought .
all it required was the ight momen to act 
listen , oh kig , and i wll tell of th second king of m story ,
they see quite concerne about this , my king .
first , te must uild a causeway across the moa .
that alone will ak months .
bring me th olden vessels frm the teple of jerualem .
but , my king , is t wise to use the vessels ?
my kig , these cups are cosidered sacred , are they not , my king ?
but here they are spoil for our gods , and they woud have you us them as i see fit .
bring them !
a judean once told nebuchadnezzar , your oefather , of his dreams .
h succeeded when everyne else had failed .
i a told you are able to give intrpretatins and solve ificul problems .
if you can read te writing on that wall , you wil be clothed in purple , have a chin of god pace around our neck , and be mde third highest rulr in the kingdom .
oh king , the most high god gave our father , nbuchadnezzar , greatness and glory , but when hi hert became arrogant he was deposed from his trone and stripped of his glory until he acknowleged that the mos high is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of haven .
wuld you humbe the almighty by desecrating his possessio 
would you bind him like a captive and beat him like a lae ?
this is his answer to yu .
mene , god has numered the das of your reign and brought it to an end .
upharsin , your kingdo is divided and given to the meds an persins .
thus says the lord , your line i ended .
your rule is over .
l there nothing to be done ?
will the least of your laves comfort you , or will they desert you , seeking to avoid the fate hich is yours ?
soldiers ogether :
i m king belshazzar of he bablonia .
as he has commanded ,  hall assue the crown .
ou are darius , the mee-persian , uncle and father-in-law to crus wh has by stratagem taken this city .
by right of conquest , you are now the ing 
yes , and you are an offiia of babylon .
i is a rewad for letting belshazzar kno that yu were about to take th city .
he read the inscrptin nd revealed te message .
he tld th king that he would die this very nigh .
danie :
if i was to lie , woud this be the lie i would hoose 
and how could you have done so  the lord hd not decreed i ?
i will speak to you onestly , my ing , and when yu would not ear te truth you must as me nthing .
so be  .
yet i shall name you one of the three .
if they were loal to the former mastr  ey are no god o me .
yrus :
he 's twice my uncle by blood and rria an serves e well as co-consel to my empire .
y .
did anone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once he is in charge he 'll be looking into everythig we do .
perhaps we should eliminate him .
how 
he does n't hunt .
a sudden illns or a drowning .
who wold beleve it ?
tere is n corrupio in im nor any neglgence 
there ' a spirit of exellence in him .
no one is that hoest .
i had a man tr to bribe im once , and  very generous bribe at tha .
such a man is dangerous .
how ong befor he learn tht we 've been generou with urselves and covered the thefts wih false accouts ?
then perhaps we ned  make him stp .
he wo n't do i .
 we could forbid his prayers for an entire month under enalty of immediate xecution ?
do n't be ridiculou .
i know hi .
the king nows that daniel and his people pray continuously and only to one god .
whih is why we need to disguise our purpose .
indeed , they cold find nothing amiss i my work  neither willfully nor though ngligence or lack of care , so tey tried to trip me up wih my prayers 
ut snce wrsip of e most high was not prohibited by the laws of the realm , they ad to concea thir purpose like poison in a cp of oney .
and ve not submite to your rule .
ndeed , we have abod to construct a plan wheby the loalty f all may be tested .
but what of the gds of persia , my servant , obey ?
how would you enforce such an edict ?
o one woud be allowed to go befor ay alar or shrine for the entire erid excpt fr you .
and nyone found iolating the decre woud be thrown into he lins ' den before sundown on the very dy of the ofense .
mle conspiraor # 3 :
in a single stroke .
i prove your pla .
in aticipation of your approva , oh king , e have taken the liberty of drftng the dict and brnging it along .
cyrus :
and oce a aw s writen  even the kin hmself can not change it .
daiel !
the kig 's seal is aely ry .
you chose your god over your ki .
take him away !
oh king , it is m sad dut to inform you that someone has alray defied your deree .
guard :
brng fot the prisner .
he pays no attenion to you , oh king , or to the decree you hae put in writing .
daniel is my chief adisor .
no one is above te law .
bring forth the tablet .
shall be thron into the lion ' den
by my hand and seal , drius the king , ruler f the medes a persians .
knowing the ing ' command , i have disobeye it .
i shall ommand my wise men to make every effort to search out some reason that te law may be found unenfrceable .
let them search , h king , bu only for a shrt tme bcause your own law commands that sentence be carried out the day of the offens .
daniel :
it is as i expeted .
a king who ill not enforce his own lws can not be a king .
i wil walk with you , dniel , one last time .
s you wish , oh kng .
y forefather , abram , cam rom this land , and the mst high said unto him ,
i will mae you into a grat natio .
ad may yet live to reap the fruit of that curse .
a cp of wie from the king 's own hand .
not so , daniel .
in the up i have poured n libation .
good bye , my fried .
farewell but pehap not good bye .
hear , oh israel , rd ur god ,
hav mrcy on me  o god .
no , no , take it away , all o it !
in you my soul takes refuge in the midst of lions , surounded  raveous beast ith teth of spears , with ngues as sharp as swords .
come near .
a toast o the lions ho show no patiality to a hebrew over any other man .
bt those who eek the lord wil lack for no good thing 
daniel 
sevant f te living god , has our go been able to ave you ?
oh king , live orever .
m god has set his angel  ad he sut the mouth of the lion .
thy have not hurt me because i was found inocent in is sigt .
come frth .
how much must the man pay if he seals another man 's treasure ?
ith his and prhaps .
is there any penalty less than deah which will do ?
but , h ing , he is a hebre .
you fahioned my on words s a snare above my fe kowing my edict could not be reversed , but the living god , the d of daniel , has deivered him ut of y hand .
no 
please wai , king , please !
his kingdom wil not be destoyed .
he rescues , and he saes .
for 70 years i had waited , and i new our time was near .
my eart grows with excitemnt hat now that time has coe .
belshazzar , the foolih ;
daris , who was deceived .
who is this fourth kng ?
it is one chosen by the most high to perfom great and miht deeds before he wa ever knitted in his mther 's wmb .
a bird of prey ?
true , i had never saw the regions of the euphrates or further westward unti i came in conques .
and yet you caed yor enemies unnjured .
hat 's true .
his is what the lod says to his anointed .
crus , whose ight hnd i tak old of-
it metions me by name ?
to sbdue nations befoe him ,
so that gates will no be hut .
i will go before you ad will level the mountains .
and ct hrough ars of iron .
please continue .
so tat fro the rising of the sun
to the plae of its seting ,
how else might it be explained ?
daniel :
yo hve aswered your wn question , oh king .
thi is wha the lord says .
ho spread out the earth by yself ,
an maks ool of divines ,
and of their ruins , i wi restore them . '
i , who was saved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was rised in a sheherd s house .
eveny years since i was taken from the land of my birth .
bablon has been punishd .
you have punished her .
only one thing remans :
your god has called me a shepherd , and so to your peole i shall be , t rescue hem from woles nd tyrants , to athe them genly and to rlieve them from bondage and vide for heir return .
t lord god of heaven hs given me al the kingdoms of the eath and has appointed for me to build  temple in jesalem in judea .
any one of his people among you , my his god be ith you .
et him go to jerusalem in judea and bul a templ of the lord , te od of israel-
however , my heart was joyous a my rothers and sisters departed on their journey home wile i remained in babylon awaig the day when i , too , would be gathered to my cestors .
