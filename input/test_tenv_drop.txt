i do nt feel very enthusistic abot it .

i humbly hope that my reqest will be granted 
sasahara  how are your son and his brde ding

it s too arly to retire ,  think , but his son hs married  so
so sabro sasahra 's retring at lst 
i did n't rliz it at the tim , bt it 's a great relef 
i wonder wht i 've don all my life , though it 's not like me to do s .

yogor 's wife .

why dd sh attack our lrd then ?
lik yourself  i do n't ndrstand it either .

s ch is birth mother to the heir .
if sh remains the wife f  vassal , thr wuld be much talk .
you say ths is our lord s wish ?
yes .
and ur chamberlin here and the ed chmberlain agr 
the best thing is for yogro to submit a request to ur lord nd say he wll send ichi back to the cstle .
 've been at hm since th day before ystrdy , but he rfses 
ntrally .
well , i do n't blme him .

ktan-san , ur family did n't accept ich particlarly gratefully .
nor dd ch hrself knw ygr or the sasahr famly .

i cam t mak sure of your thoughts on this mattr .
t be honest , th clan 's tratment of yor family nd yur ttitude n respns have weighed on my mnd .
weighd n your mind 
it 's lke your swordplay 
pushed , you stp back 
but it 's not like you to giv up .
th clan dd n't ask for her frmally 
it ws more lke frce .
in fct , it ws mor like kdnappng .
f the shogunte officials in edo hear of it , or even the dimyo , it my prove a ftl mistake for the matsudair 
that yo 'll allow them to nd her 
yu 're saying i must formally ask the castle t tke hr bck ?
yet  must ask them to take her bck ?
it was wise of you to hold back 
th chamberlan nd steward ar mprssed by yur rstrnt 
 refse 
i do n't remembr sending her back to th castle .
why d nt you d as h sys 
that 's ridiculous , fathr 
never !
she sppressed her ters , left everything behnd , and qutly rtrned t the castle .
nw , now  yogoro 
n any case  plase g fr now .
ygoro will be hard to cnvinc , but i 'll tlk t hm .
yogoro will rport tody and say h wishes to return her ?
that 's wondrful 
nw w cn lok frwrd to th suwa shrne festival tomrrow 
since it wuld hav come t this anyway , how dare they cause all that fss !
ygor was wrong , but isbro ws insolent s well .
he 's lways henpecked by his wife 
and defying clan orders lik that
i must sy he sems lik  dffernt man 
hs conduct hs ben dmrabl .
it calls for a slight ncrease in his fief .
yogor ssahara of th escort group hs arrved !
i m glad yo 'v rprted fr duty .
yes , cmpletely well .
taking nto cnsidertion my fathr s wishs , i hav decided .
pleas accept ths .
tht 's god of you .
thank yu 
fl !
petton 
this s the cruelest frm of tyranny 
it runs counter t th lws of humanty and can not be condond by the heavns .
we hreby appel for hr mmdte rturn 
someone may use my father 's nam or my wn to submit a request to rturn ich t the castle .
but it wll not be from us .
plese kp tht in mnd .
thank you fr cmng every dy .

isburo and yogro ssahara , fr your nsolnt conduct and dfianc towrd or lrd , yu ar ordered to cmmt sppuk 
seppuk ?
t is grcious of our lord t prmit it .
 thought men wld come arrest us and thn ether hng or crcfy us 
father .
howver , we want something befor we kll ourselvs 
bring s three hads 
those of lrd masakta matsudaira , rulr f th aizu domn ,
chamberlan yanse , and stewrd tkahashi 
brng me the hads of th villans wh took my son 's wife !
vassl tatewaki asn in charge of boundry gats has rrivd !
 hear you are
isabro s nly eqal as  swordsman .
f you thnk he 's too much for you  tak four or five strong men with you .
are they not now criminals in the eyes f our clan ?
yes 
i 'm in charge f brder gates 
ths is n time to discuss jrisdction .
y re wrong 
if yo order me to kill them , please promote me to suprintendnt here nd now nd obtain or lord 's promis to incrase my fef to 500 kku  according t cln rules .
why be so frmal now ?
never mind .
go !
we must gther men  se frce and kll them .
a foolish ida .
isaburo 's  swordsmn wthut pr .

that should be nugh for yo .
from th fotstps , h 's alone .

the chmberln 's intervntin would aggravate mtters .
father , the drm frm the sw shrne has stopped .

 remmber it too .
outsde the castle  t was the nk fstival , whn the harvest gd lft .
inside the castle , it was the day bfore th suwa shrne festival .
fathr .
what is it 
that 's s it should be .
t 's not unmanly at all .
bt yogor , do n't be to worried bout ichi .
w will de here  but she is the mothr f our lord 's heir .
no one cn tortre her  nd n on will ndanger her lif .
but fathr , r n't thy lte in cming ?
 meant to ask for prmission t nter  but the gt ws opn , so i came in .
i will now convey ur lrd 's orders 
we have heard of the rder to cmmit seppuku .
he changd his rdrs .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for yur insolnce nd attitude toward our lord , you will b confnd t nshoj tmple outside the castl .
why th sudden change ?
will you gratfully accpt our lord 's new orders ?
no 
no , he 's wrong !
t was not as the heir s mother .
 am still the wife of yogoro sasahar 
but ur lord receivd m in hs adence .
i d n't understand what this is ll about .
stward , it seems we do n't understand what you just told us .
if you two dmit that chi is no longer  family member nd tht she has been returned , our lrd will listen to her ple for  lighter punishmnt 
will yu cknowledge hr return and live , or refus and fight it ot 
which will t b 
we ar prepared for the worst 
thn thre is no alternative ?
plese return her t nce !

this s our galxy , the milky way .
our sun taks 225 mllion years to go arund the glaxy once
the dinsaur era lstd 180 millon yars 
this is a comt .
it 's ll ice nd rck 
its 10 mils wide , nd it 's headed for the erth . fast .
but this is n't th earth tht we know , not relly 
t this tme the mastrs of the earth are dinsaurs .
this is patgona 
 vst region f argentinen south america as it is tdy .
and ther ws only ne mmense ocean ,
w ar north of the sth american plte , in th sea tht will grw t be the atlantc cean .
sme species of ichthysurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms f life also appeared on land during the dnsaur era .
in many places ther , on wlks today n the very grond these giants walked upon a 100 mllion years ago .
this phenomenn seems t dpend on anothr peculiar twist of evlution 
regions that prodce great dnosaurs also tend to produce grat plaontolgists .
many doctorl students cm t pursue their reserch .
smetimes yunger pople , like my daghter ldml , just come to satisfy thir curisity .
i love talkng bot dnsurs with veryne , whthr thy are xprts or not 
t s a busy lf  nd t would hve ben plnty for most ppl , bt arly in my carer new hrizons opnd up for me 
things becme much larger than life .
a rncher had stmbled upon a surprisingly large bone 
after sevral dgging seasns w ended p facng the lrgst dinsur evr found .
we nmd t argentinosaurus
ths discvry hve a profnd effect , on the way we look at south merican dnosaurs .
on  personl level , it took  big place in my life t sy the lest 
yet it strts ts life n eggs jst  lttl bgger thn grapefruit .
predators and hazrds bond .
nly a few wll rech dulthod .
it covers mor than 15 mils and t is approxmatly 80 millon yars old .
w beliv that it ws chosen s  nestng site by generation pon gneration f these dinosaurs .
th nests ar so close together , that th fmals cold not wlk betwen them .
it was warmer than tday .
a great part of the dinosaur ra  thr wre n broad leaf tres nd no flower bering plnts .
during the dinosaur ra there s no rctc ice caps , nd ntarctica s sub-tropicl .
for tns of millins of years seasns barely changed .
the wter of the ocean s ls much warmr .
hurrcanes ar frquent 
the magnetc pols changes positin cntinuously .
prfessor cor hs contrbtd to th discvery f more thn  dozen f new dinosars .
as a scentist , he insists that each new find is important , no mtter how bg or smll 
and sometmes he says wht plays th biggest prt is simply not n r hands .
i lke t thnk tht  am lucky , jst incrdibly lucky 
many pleontological discoveres are nt md by professnals .
that 's what happned wth the rgentnsaurus  nd t happened again with yet nother dinsur 
they wer relatively big  s t frst  w thoght that they belonged to a herbivor  because in gnral these dinosaurs tend to be larger 
bt instead , th bones proved to be thos of a predatr 
a very lrge n 
professor cori 's tem had unveiled a first specis f a group f fierce predtors clled gignotosurus 
the 3 specis in ths grup srpassed the fams t. rex n terms f sze .
althogh rare fr reptils  caring fr the yung hs be observed among crcodls for instance .
in dinosaurs , this cring behavir evlve nough t rmind us of brds .
this baby feml s named lng toth .
howevr small and vulnrble , and cute she may pper now sh is genetically prgrammed t rapidly bcome a 45 fot long , eght tonne predtr lik her mther .
in ptagonia , you have the largst herbivore and the largest predtor , living at roghly the same priod and in the sme trritory 
ther is no easy answr .
evlutin fllwd a numbr of particulr paths 
but a smpler interprettion rest on  warm clmte and the fertile lnd , wth all th vgtatin you cn et .
yet anthr thery tells s that large herbvres hd t grow big ngh , to accommodat a larg stmach required to digest hgh in fibr , low in prtein vegtation .
fnally , large spans of flt spac could have led naturally to rgntnsrus , as the vast seas have ld to whales .
the highst brnchs belong t ths who cn rech thm  and many prdtors are too small to be thretning in thos stuation .
she s growng fast too .
her primitive fathers hav lmost all disppard .
they thrved for 180 million yers .
this is a message fr us hre .
by th way  it s more than tim to ntrodce sharp feathrs .
he is nenlgia ,  6 ft , 50 pound mal raptor 
he is relatd to brds , as ar to some xtent vlocirptors , gigantosurs nd tyrannsaurus .
big dinsars need space 
ths s the crmn funs musm , which also hppns to be my second home .
sometimes as a joke we say that t is  scence flled with hols .
we have nly found but 700 spcies of dinsars n the whole planet .
this s n't mny for a reign that lastd 180 millon yers .
tn percnt f thse dinosrs were found in argntina  most of them in the last 30 yers .
through technlogy or knwldg grows faster evry day .
fossilisation is a process that rquires extrmely rr conditons , nd ven then very little f an organsm is prserved .
we cld easily conclde that a trmends nmber of spcis just disappared without a trce .
f crse , science fiction cn be fn , but yo also need to be very careful befre propsing  new wy of lookng at dinsars .
i wish i could travel in time t see these amazng crtures live .
strong ne has reachd matrity .
for many scentsts he is at full siz .
h is 20yer-ld , and is at the bgnnng of more than  centry of lif .
they tell us , if the anml was walking on two legs r fur  if they were aln or n  grp , if they wr wandring , hunting , or being hunted
the pattern clearly shw assocation btween cntemporary species , and this s vry rr .
his work s intimately linked t nature , its intimately vared trran and vr changing climate .
so there were hardships , but ther are moments , somtimes when science just blend with the pre blss of being outside and wonderful places .
yu jst lok rnd .
but findng required a traned ye 
with tme yu realise that the number of questions grows fstr than the number f answrs 
again , lik many times befre 
 good hnt and an nswer came unexpctedly .
in fact  we did n't find just n spcimn but a chmber f bns belongng t t least seven indivdls 
for me , and my candian colleage phil curry this ws pointing at smething we hd cnsidred  bt have no evidenc for ntil then .
s lng trth belngs to this new spcies of giganotsars .
and at 22 yers of age , she is fully grown .
strng ne is unknwingly in  critical time .
taring off piecs f skin and letting the larg prey bled to deth , r di from nfction s a strtgy mor likely to succeed 
gigantosarus cld wait dys evn weks betwen meals .
mllons f yers pass , and as the cntinents keep n drifting , the erth begins to resemble more wht t s today .
species emrg  evlve  disappr .
nature never stps changing .
we are in north amric .
apart from flght  this reptiles has nothng in common with brds
and vlution gave it nothing to survve the mpendng drmatic vnts .
sverl factors culd hv contributed to the demse of dinosaurs 
mammals bcame bigger and mre competitiv .
drifting isolated cntinnts touched each other .
nw rvlres apperd .
nw disass spred 
the climt was grwing colder , possbly becaus of increased volcanic activity 
the ir was nbrethble in mny placs .
vegtaton suffered frm th cid rain and also from the darkened and dust-flled skis 
but still , many dinosurs made it through fr a lttle whle longer 
it cvers the distanc from the mon to the erth in two hurs .
all the forst f north and south amric r destroyed by fre 
already weakend , dinosaurs are the anmls that sffered most .
in a reltvely short tim  dinosaurs bcome history 
nt all the dinosars dsppear .

sddenly  one chickn 's vic rang out :
and all the hns left in  cluckng flrry bcause that was gloria talkng , a yng chickn who had scratched and pecked her way to th top rung of the henhose .

otis grwled .

myb milo was hving  trrific tme , bt otis ws prtty scared 
thn ots saw a bridg up ahead .
mayb he could jmp off the bridge into the bx f h hrrid 
but he was to lt .
on , boy .
gd .
but that did n't work ither 
ots just culd n't swm fast nough and the river tok milo farther downstream .
milo ws nt relly worred until h lost sight of otis .
suddenly he heard something movng in th bshes .
ws it ots 
dfinitely nt .
mil tried t duck low n the bx so the bear wuld nt se him 
bt the box was driftng right towrds th hungry animl .
bt unfortnately much to soon .
the bear saw what was in tht box .
thn cme tis .
tht ber is 10 tmes my siz .
he ran p on the rivrbnk  lading the bar wy from milo .
mlo kept driftng along , but he was gettng a little concrned bcaus the rivr was begnning to move fster .. and fstr .
h 'd lst track of otis now , nd he was driftng farthr nd frther from hme .
by the tm the mon rse , the river had carred mlo dp int the frest .
and h hard mysterious hoots and growls and cris n the night 
he bgan to wish he d nver jumped into ths bx and h begn to wsh he ws hme 
it smed to be trembling s mch s h ws in the chilly  msty night 
he drfted n through th darkness  hoping to find the mornng witing just rund the bnd .
when daylight came 
milo saw a farm on the rverbank .
for on hppy moment , he thoght h ws home and crid ut for jy 
but he looked gan .
h did n't know whn he wold vr se it agn .
hre coms the dog yur lif he - 
the dadwod swamp .
 bg wher skeletn trees grew wthout leaves or branchs , and whre no creture could live  except fr the drded dadwood birds .
and n of them was prching on  famlar wooden box .
kay  punk , ots barked 
there s the box 
por cat 
cat s sd , th brd croaked .
lok in th box .
otis prepared himself and peked n th box nd saw only  solitary black fathr .
in fact  milo was nowhere near the dedwod swmp 
after hs box got stuck thre , he rn 
he ran from those birds s quickly s he cold .
nw he fond hmself in a brning valley .
the grund was hot nd the smok mad hs eys stng .
milo ran until he cme to n open madw wher he sw a kind of anml he d never seen before .
felng pretty hungry , he immediately wondered ,
is that somethng y can eat ?
hh .
hello  someon thre ?
h  ha 
i mst be very crful  mil thought .
and abve all , i must keep absltely silent .
the fox flt somn watching hm .
nd he bgn buryng his lnch where he fgred n ne wuld ever be abl to fnd t .
yeah  her , my prcs muskrat .
yu should be saf thre till dinnertime , the fox said .
mil crept slowly down th tree nd watched the fx rn over th horzon 
nd then , onc on the grond ,
mil knew just hw to get his pws n a bg  tasty mskrat lnch .
otis  manwhle  hd traveld throgh the wetlands to a beach fll of clam hles 
he remembrd there was on mgc word everyon undrstod and tht was plase .
s he mrched p to a clm hol and said 
aww .
th clouds were getting drker and darkr and a chilly wind ws whipping cross the contrysid .
milo ws severl mils frm the beach caght in the same storm .
he gt  littl wt and h felt wfully lonsm withot ots  but at least he was safe .
th tid came in so fast tht the rock otis had been sttng n was compltely srrondd by wter .
h , he 'd never b able to swim t shore 
and the wtr was grwng higher .
now the water ws up to his pws .
he 'd have t try t swim .
he tok a deep breath , bt jst when h was ready t dive n ..
h , not gan  the s turtle gurgled .
every tme th td comes n some fol gts stuck out here .
otis was n't sur what this turtl wantd .
well , now you knw 
now  just stay on th shor , wher you belong  the turtl grmbled 
hmph 
thnks  nothng 
next time th tid comes in , i 'll have t rscue smebody else .

hh .
otis resmed hs search fr milo .
ooh  much better 
xcuse me , otis called out , i 'm looking fr  frend of mine .
i hv n't gt tim  ots said , sensing ths fox was n't gn n b any hlp 
hw can you be a dog ?
otis ws outraged .
ha !
he mrveled at this road mad of wod and ron and dcded to follw th road nd see where it would take hm .
t could ve run rght over m .
but mlo ws determned .
nw milo ws plenty tired .
yu look tird and thirsty , a der whisprd 
i 'm not sre cts knw hw t bound  mil said .

ys  it is possible to ovrfrolic  the deer murmurd .
and th deer tok mlo t a soft , mossy spt on th frest floor .
and ml ws sleep withn moments 
he had trailed ml from the deadwod swamp t the fx s meadow .
and nw , if he just kept gong , mayb h d finally find the friend h mssed so mch .
bt now , t was the end of  lng day of hard traveling .
as vening was flling ,
milo dcdd the sfest place to spend the night would be n a tree .

in winter , endless darknss s brghtened by the frisky danc of th nrthern lghts 
and 30 below is the nrm .
it s lovely wether fr polar bar fmlis .
one hundred nd fifty thousand years ago som brown bears movd north and grdually adaptd .
becus they re built fr the arctic plar bears can nt thrv anywhere else .
polar bears hve alwys hnted frm floating platfrms f sea ic .
that 's why the arctc is wrming twice s fst as any othr region .
n 1980 th smmr sa ice covred 25 percent mre can than it does now .
if the currnt trend continues the arctic ocean culd be fre of sea ice ech summr by th yar 2050 
ven if we ca n't stp ths loss  we can slow it down .
mst rctc glcirs ar melting fastr than evr befr .
the distnce btween ice pcks s grwng .
nowadays , a plar bear n search of sea ice often hs further t go .
some cbs do surviv espcilly if the mothr is a clever scavngr .

on morn snt me a vry clear message

dwn here , there 's nly one exit and it 's pretty scary thinking yu could be trpped .

this is th plac whr th clves have their best chance to srvive .
thes bugs re potntially dadly t ths caribou

caribou mothers are having a tgh time s the arctc warms .
but polar bear mothrs face n ven greater strggle .
my name is bjorne kvrnmo and  m cptin of this shp 
narrtor :
thre re over 20000 polar bars in th world and most f them are camra-shy 
ne ber was espclly helpfl .
t 's hrd t keep p when you 're only 3 months ld 
next year we 'r comng bck with strnger cases .
narratr 
bears nearly always void pple whch made flming them next t impossible 
thn the team gt lcky 
for five days , she nver lft their bot .
becaus th sun nevr sets in the summer bedtm is anytme .
bjorn :
hngry males prfer sels bt in a pinch , thy have alwys gne after dfenselss cubs .
the mother seemd to pck p the scent of a mal 
we did n't knw why sh was agtated .
we finally spottd a mle quit  ways off zeroing in n the mother and her cubs .
now that sels are s hrd to catch  starvng males might b trgeting cubs mre ften .
but next tim things cold be mch differnt 
plyful cubs cn rally work up an apptit .
bjorne :
when you want t grab  bite to eat p hr timing is evrything .

we watch helplessly as th mle sneaks up .

at the moment of truth , th mothr sent a vry clear message 
you can get t my cbs if you want but y ll have to kill m frst

he 'd united in one stunning insight the wrk of many wh had come before him .
n the arly 19th centry  scentists did n't think in trms f enrgy 
n lwly man 's drive to understnd the hidden mysteres of natr wuld begin to change all tht .
young mchael faraday hated his jb .
he was ndcated  th son f a blacksmith 
he 'd ben lucky to bcom a bokbindr 's apprntce 
but farday craved on thing .
all of his fre time nd hs mager wages were pured nto hs slf-education 
can i pss , pleas ?
cn i pass ?
f cours , of corse ..
pass , pass .
this way t a btter life 
in the early 1800s , scnc ws the pursit of gentlmen , something faraday was clarly not 
he had  rudimentary edcatin , he 'd read widly , he d gon t public lctres  but in 1812 h was given tickets to hear sir hmphry dvy  the mst prominent chemist of the age .
ninetenth-century scentists were th pp stars of thir day .
ther lectures were hugely ppular .
tckets wer hrd to come by  and davy rveled in his sttus .
they 're wting 
metals .. unknwn , tht is  until i islated potssum from moltn potash and sdum  as i shwd you last time  from common slt 
help me be part of the grat crcle that is yr work nd lov .
my desire , sir  is to escape from trade , which i find vcous and slfsh , and to become a servant of scienc , whch , i imagin , makes ts prsers amiabl and lberal .

wll   shall lve it t th exprience of a few yars to set yu right on that scor 
look , i hav n't nything at the moment .
farady ws determined t brek fr from his daily toil .

the big xcitemnt of the day ws electricity .
nthr chrg  nwman .
bt n one really ndrstod wht this strange frc f electricity was .
the acdemic stablishment at th tme thught that electrcity was , you know , lik  fld flowing through a ppe , pushing its way along 
but in 1821  a dnsh resarcher showed that whn y pass n electrc current throgh  wr and place  compass nar t , t dflected th needl t right angles .
farday , come lok t this .
prhaps yu can work it out 
rsted 's reprtd an amazing fnding 
now  tht is remrkble .
but if the lectrical frce s flwing through the wre , why des the ndle not move in th sam dircton , prallel to the wre 
again , nwmn .
what 
prhaps som sort of electrcal force is emanating otwards from the wre .
oh , my dar boy , let m tell y that at the university of cambridg , elctricity flws thrugh a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be wht they teach at cambridge , but t dos nt xplin wht 's happning before our eys 
no , now , let 's jst gt n 
t was  fascination insprd by his rlgion 
for hm , the problem was a way to undrstand god 's hdden mysteries .
there is a smll  almost persected group n london called the sndemanns .
they were a rlgous ..
farady ws a member of that grop 
that if you opened up ne lttle part of t  yo cld see hw everythng was connectd .
farday ws different from anybdy else .
by methodically placing  compss all rnd an lctrifid wir ,
fardy started to notc  pttern .
nd thn he mgind that a magnet hd similr lines emerging frm it and that thos lns would get caught up in this flow .
i m shaking , newman .
ndrnth ,  'm shaking .
yes .
this is th experiment of the cntury .
scle up the mgnets and the wires , make thm really big  ttch heavy weights to them and they 'll be drgged long .
although he did n't relize t at the tme ,
the chemcls in th battry hd bn transfrmd int electricity n the wr , which had combned with the magnet to prodce mtn .
behind all these vrios forces there ws a common energy .
so , farady , wht dos wollaston mke f all this ?
h 's writtn t me and assures me that he 's tkn no offense , and h cknowledges that what i publshd was entrely my wn wrk .
in fact , he is stll vehmently opposd t you being lected a member of the socty .
and wht d you thnk 
farady , my der boy , yu hve my vt .
it s the scenc that counts .
so , tll me  how does this wire of yours spn rnd ts magnt ?
there sems to b an lectrmgnetic intercton 
in my mind , i se a swirling array of lnes f force spinning out of the lctrifid wir lke a spirling web .
but invsibl lns of forc ...
it 's ll  bit vagu , is n't it 
fardy , might i hav  word in prvate ?
listen  frady  let 's stp this nnsense 
i want yu to tke down yor ballot paper from th notice bard .
sir humphry , i see no rson to take it dwn

vr here  plese 
from this end we cool the stm bt , interestingly , w collct less water than w started with .
so clrly w lose a certin mount of wtr 
now , when we combin thse two increass ..
th new wight of the iron barrel nd the gas we have collected ..
thy ar exctly qal to th weight of the lst wtr .
so what h had done is gt th oxygen to stick to th nside f a red-hot ron rifl barrel .
now , that lft the hydrogen , wht h called combustibl r , and that was just floating round as a gs .
in the next few months i hop to demonstrte that  can rcombine ths cmbustible ar wth vitl ar and transform them bth back nto water .
i will recreate exactly the sme amunt of water tht was lst here in this process 
t is my hope t complet the cycle ...

he wuld prse hs fscnatins with just ncredibl dtermination 
we knw from hs lttrs tht nstein  even from th ge f 16 , was literally obsessed wth the natre of light 
everyne h cold speak t .
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method d you props t ride on this bam of light ?
the methd is not mportnt 
let us just imagne w two r yung ..

what would we see , d you think ..
with lght h wuld rinvent th universe and fnd a hddn pathway tht would nte enrgy and mass .
t stnds for clerits ..
lng bfr th 19th centry , scientists had cmputed the spd of light , but n ne knew what lght actully was 
invsbl lnes tht can emant frm electricity in a wir  from a magnt or ... ven from the sn .
for t is my contntion tht light tself is just one form of ths vibrating lines of lectrmagnetism .

now , as that magntc chrge movs , it creates a little pece of elctricty .

670 millon miles pr hor .
that s the sped f light !
well , that mns you wer right all along 
maxwell had provn farday right .
we have lecturs n hlf an hour 
we ca n't .
com wth m  w 'll red maxwell nd think abt th electromgnetc theory of light !
she s very prtty .
thy said y cold never ctch p to a beam of light 
ven if yu wre trveling at 670 millin miles an hur , you wuld still see light squiggl way from you at 670 millin mils n hour .
yes .
yo se how for hr it is static ?
yes 
she and th wv are travling at the sam speed .
but reltv to hr  t jst sits there .
so is light lk that ?
cmmon sens wold sy that if you caght up to a light beam , there would be a wv of light just stting there .
mayb it would be shimmring , a bt f elctricity and a bit f mgnetism .
s if she was traveling alngsd th light wv , it wuld n't be movng .
it wuld be static .
bt maxwll says you c nt hve statc light 
maybe maxwll is wrong .

émili du chtelt knw tht in the 18th centry fr a wman t bcome pregnant at th ag of 43 ws rlly vry dangerous  nd all the whle she was pregnant sh had terrible premonitions abut wht was going to happen .
n th end  it ws an affair with  young sldier that led to her demse 
sx dys after giving brth to hr fourth child , she sffred an embolism and died .
insten prsed lght right through unversity and beynd .
nfortunatly , he 'd upst so many prfessors that n one would wrte him a refernce .
he accpted a low-paying job in the swss patnt offc .
the yong fmily struggled .
but , listn ..
abot your prmotion 
 m srry .
all wll be fne  yo ll see .
cme n .
all will be fine .
there rlly s  very chrming  but kind of  selfcntered streak to enstein .
f the rest f th wrld fts in round him  tht 's fine , if thy ca n't , it does n't bother him .
i 'll tell yo what is truly mysterios :
th mathematics r fne , if a lttle uncnventonal , but this nly works for big systms 
i disgre .
here w go ...
what wld happen f on appld thos frmulae to electrmgnetic rdiation 
albert , y ca n't jst tak n bit f physcs and apply it without prpr regard to a compltely different area .
why not ?
i know you lke the grnd linkges , the big theories  but would n't things be better all rnd if you jst got going in som smll rea ?

thy had crnered the queston f lght from evry possble ngle .
s einstein nd besso wer ruminating n how much time it wuld take light to rech them from clcks at differnt dstances 
thank you .
what einstin did was cmpletely turn the problem on its head .
that light would always mv away from yo t 670 millin mils an hur  evn if yu  too  were traveling relly fast 
his extrordinary nsight is that tm .. as yu approch the speed f lght , time itself wll slow dwn 
it 's  monmental shift in how we s th world .
you se , befre then pople had assumed that tim was lke a wristwatch on god 's hand , that t bet at  steady rat throughout the unvrs , n mattr were you wr .
that the tick , tick , tick of this wristwatch ws actully the click  click , clck
of electricty turning into magnetism trnng into electricty 
t starts with hs pblicatn of a ppr on hw to work ut th true sz of toms .
tw mnths later is the publication f his papr n the natre of light .
that s what will earn him the nobel priz 
n it einstein sts out his thory of light , time and spac .
it ws the theory f special rlativity 
in einstein 's new world , the n tre constant was not tme or even spac , but light .
in on last great 1905 papr , he wold propose n ven deper nity 
it hs t go smewhere .
frm our pont of view  the train actually gets heavier ;
t 's an incrdible idea 
even enstein is amazd by it .
i think i have fond  connecton btwen nrgy and mass 
f i am right , thn nrgy nd mass re nt abslut 
they cn be converted into one nther .
nstein sent his fifth grt 1905 papr for publicatin .
in thre pages he simply stted that enrgy and mass were connected by the squar of th speed f light ..
e  mc2 .
the clmination f hs ten-year jurney into light .
there is a dp unty betwen nergy  matter and lght 
yo multiply that by itslf nd yu get 90 quadrillion 
probably th most miraculous yer n science ends in slnce .
the artcls are published to resunding 
i think the gods ar lughing at me .
fr fr yers instin swered each inquiry dutifully  trying t explain his difficlt , complex deas t a confused physics community 
here ar thse unverse-changing ppers circlng around , and the wrld s .. struggling t come to trms wth them .
luckly it happened t be the mst mportant lving physicist 
he has sent his ssstant 
ftr four years f waiting  h is appointed profssor of physics t zurich unversity .
from ther hs crer is meteoric .
in 1919 h dvorcd mleva nd mrried hs csn .
his fam led to numers affars 
e  mc2 became th holy grail f scence 
it hld ut th promise f vast reserves of energy lckd deep insid the atom .
bt he had nt bankd on the second world war nd th genius of a jewish womn in hitler s germany 
28-yr-old austrin lise mitnr was painfully shy .
dspite her nxety , the yong doctr of physcs arrivd in berlin determned t prsu a creer in the xcting nw fild of radioactvty .
german universitis did nt employ female graduates 
otto hhn .
ys , he sggestd tht i spek wth yo .
i think i could relly help with the physical analysis .
yes , ys ..
and the mathematics .
studying rdoactive atoms has becme s much a collboraton betwen mistry nd physcs thes dys .
yes  yes 
i ll sk fischr for a laboratry , then 
at this time , nt a lot was knwn bout th atom .
but then .. n wht are calld radiactive metals  things like radium nd urnium ..
the nuclus itslf semed t be unstble , leaking out energy and particles .
th mass f a ncles turning nt enrgy .
he was given a labortory 
she was forced t work in  wood shp .
i se you have n't st yr har on fre 
god day  herr hahn .
god day 
yes , wher wold we chemists be witht the stedying hnd f the physicst ?
oh ?
ys , edith .
ys , well , i hav , um .. askd hr t mrry m , and sh has ccepted .
oh .
oh , dr. hhn , congratulatons .
i m very pleasd for yo 
vry plasd .
lis meitner was wrm-hearted by natur .
sh hd many frends and sh may hav wanted t have  closr relatinship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s wre the golden age of nuclar resarch 
meitnr and hahn wre leading the rc to se if evn biggr nucli culd be created by adding more neutrns .
s . the atom , pretty fmilr :
th nucleus , made p f protons . and neutrons .
nw , the lrgest nucles that w know is tht of the ranum tm 
the jewss endngrs our institute .
he was hunded ot of germany n 1933 .
she ws ble to stay bcause she was ustrian .
what is t ?
what 's happened ?
i , um .
w 're spaking tomorrow .
it s lat .
w ll fnish up 
hahn  who was known fr his antinazi viws , dd his bst to prtct her , at last nitilly .
nt now , i 'm too busy .
we hv to protect her 
what can we do ?
and sh may son b forbdden t lev germany .
lise ...
horlen demands tht you leave .
you ca nt throw her out 
horln says yo should nt come into the institute anymore 
well , i have to write p the thorium rraditin tomrrw  so i hv to come in .
you v given p .
when it bcam clear that meitner wold be dismssd nd prbably arrested  physicists ll arund europe wrote ltters inviting hr to confrnces  giving hr n excus to leave germny .
in jly f 1938 , a dutch college traveled to berln and illglly took lise bck with hm on  train t hollnd .
she hd lost everything .
her hme , hr positin , hr books , her salary , hr pnsin , ven hr nativ lngag 
she had been cut off from her work just at the tme whn sh was leding the feld and was n the brnk f a major scientfic dscovery .
n mttr what privtions sh suffered 
aunt 
lise , how re yu , my dar ?
hmm  i need your help .
back in berln , hhn ws gttng strange rsults .
he fond no vdnce to suggst tht bombarding the uranum ncleus with neutrons had caused it to ncrs in sze .
from afr  she ws strtng to sspect that something vry different ws hppnng in their exprimnt .
hahn and strssmn ar getting some strange results wth th uranium work .
relly ?
a couple of months ago  hhn told me that thy were fnding rdium amongst the urnium prducts .
and now he wrtes to me nd tlls me that it s not radim  it s brum .
but that 's ven smallr .
t s at lst possible that brim s bng produced .
so hahn stll neds you t nterpret the data .
well   ca n't be ther , can i 
h has n't done wht yu told him t .
it turns out tht a big nucleus lke rnum s just lke tht .
now for for yers , mtner and hahn and all other physcists had thought that if you pmp mor neutrons into this ncls , t 'll just get biggr and heavr .
rlzed this nucles mght just get so big that it would split n tw 
if th ncls s s big that it hs trble styng tgthr , then could n't just a lttl , tiny jog from a neutron ..
how much energy ?
but somthing has to supply that energy .
enstin s  = m.c2 .
200 mllion lectron volts .
n  no , no  yu 've split the tm .
f cors  in the labratory w 're tlking but tiny amounts f uranum and crrspondngly tiny mounts of nergy .
but th pnt is tht th amount of nergy relesd ws rlatively large and tht cme from the mss f the urnium tslf .
meitner nd frisch published the discovery of wht thy calld nuclar fssin
to great acclaim 
but btryal awaited them .
hahn maintained it was h nd not meitner wh had dscoverd nclear fission .
shll my scintific past also b taken frm me 
and why is it happening ?
she d nly broken apart a hndful of atms  but that was nough .
in 1942  an intens ffrt to buld an atm bmb ws begn .
all over amerca , secret installtions sprang up nder the cde nam the manhttan prjct 
sh refsed t have anything to do with the atomc bmb .
but robert frisch was differnt .
vast amounts of energy , n the form f electromagntic radation , wre relased from a few pounds f ranum and plutonum .
tody , young physcists carry n einstein 's quest 
evr since ts birth 
e = m.c2 has ben used to delve into th dpths f tm , t answer th biggest questin of all ..
in the frst momnts of cretion  th univers was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated ruptin of nergy 
as it rushd apart and expanded  hug amonts of nrgy , or e ,
t becm the particles and atms and it ventally formed the first stars .
it comes t s energy .
the whole prcess ctually crates life itself .
evntually   mssive star dies , the debrs flots round , clustrs togthr  gets pulled into the rbits f nother star nd becomes  plnt .
building on th work of scientists through th ages , new generations are srching fr answs 
s einstein himself knew , the jorney of discovery s sometimes painful  somtims joyful .
it is as old as humn curiosity itself and never , ever nds .

there is for charlott the reluctance to get motionlly attachd to any singl cs , since there have bn thousands , bt occasionally , a phn cll would lave her ffervescnt with cher .
as n the cas rcently in clrado 
 kdney cancer seen nly in children .
it was dscovred that the lng was too riddn with cncr .
and more horrfyng stll was the revelation that the cancer had made t all the wy to the right chambr f her hart .
the srgeon than pened her sternum and strted wth removing the tumors frm her lungs .
from ther  he moved to hr hart and an opn-hart surgery rmoved the tumor frm the rght hart chambr .
gain and agin , wth a vnganc .

) th doctr said , ( ?
) chldren tld us that sh is not gon n b ble to ahm .. the cancer s back and she s not gon n mke it .
w went bck hme and then  i think t was january or somthng , w wer down , at the gerson  and ahm . and we were dong the diet there for bout 2 r 3 weks  i thnk .
 i had come down ther sick myself . ?
i had regular disnfections ll the tim .
after hving  hypoglycemic , and jst flt bettr .
so , w went bck hm and we 've ben dng the treatment for tw yers  about .
from that point on , hope rturnd , and lf bgan t chng fr the entir family 
even the dog was happy agan .
but the poisons are now being excretd and her body s building itslf back up with powerful nzyms nd the nutrint forces 
but where stephanie 's orthodx medicl doctors had nly given hr 6 months to live tw years go  she has now stoundd thm  nd of cours  confonded thm 
i feel vry halthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
charlotte obsrved that they run arund plying and enjyng life , as thugh the scourge f cancer had never visited ths rsilint chld .
thr re also nn-toxc , nn-pharmacutical supplments called biologcals , that ar utilizd in  grater or lessr measure  depending pn the patient 's condition 
on of the mst imprtant of these s a natural ptassium , mx of potssium gluconate  acetate  phosphat in equal amounts  that dr. gerson put together aftr ding nearly 300 experiments .
ths s extremely beneficial to restoring th potssm in the body s cells systems tht was lst in most pople on relenting us of inorganic sodum , such as fond in table salt and hdden within evrything  from processd foods to tothpaste 
table salt s a poisn .
the use of inorganic sodium cuses displacement f potassim found ntrlly n humn cells , lavng thm vlnrabl to attck by dseases .
dr gerson 's potassium supplement is dssolved in a quarter f dstild water nd incorported n small amunts to the jices .
t 's  pleasure to show you around 
the pressed nd grund flax seds , essntially the leftovers  ar used for fertilizr nd niml food 
a true mircl oil .
th grson clinic  with all of th god work that max gerson dd in the past , really understood the vlue f flx il .
that ws n't anything tht ...
actually  they educated us mor than we cold evn ducte them on th valu and the benefts of hw flx ol relly hlpd th modalities 
the us f these natural , holistic supplements on the gerson therpy is part of custmiztion to the specific degeneratve cndtins of the patent .
non in and of themslves can , for example , cure  cancer  but thy can sometimes frtify grsn 's therapies effctivness .
when t comes to helping th body recovr , whether from  cmmon cld or cncr , today  vr half th medcl visits in the u.s. nd canad are t alternatve therapies , dspite the efficcy 
and n the u.s especlly , it is estimatd that or understandng nd acceptance of hlistc medicine s still 75 yrs behnd the rest of the world .
mdically , we tril many thrd wrld countries .
it is impertive tht patents have accss to such food chces .
the organc fod markt has incrsed almost 20 % nnually fr th pst 7 years , mainly s th reslt of the economic lw f supply and dmand .
mss-produced cmmrcially grown fruts and vegtbles prodced with chmcals nd sprays ar fertlized wth only thre mnerls :
bt the plant , lik the hmn body , rlly neds ovr 50 mre 
as  cnsquence f this tiny minrl contributin n th fertilizatin prcess f commercially gwn crops , the plants wre sick and must be kept on lfe support with more txic chemicals until market .
this prcess s now repeated in the consumer , in simplified trms .
i know that in the past peopl had dfferent prospctivs f what was truly organic , and we wld have sme growers cm n and sy well  their grows re rgnic bt bascally just by virtu of neglect .
so that st forth a set f rules nd regulations such that anybody wh did want t bcome rganic would trly be n the same playng feld and would have to bide by the sme sets of ruls .
w have fund that the attrbutes of truly doing a certfed organic s beneficil not nly for the peopl , but lso for th grond  etc .
s , that s somthing tht we trly lok frward t xpnd upn and to provide fr the local community , nd lso for the peopl thrughout th nited stats nd world wide .
by poplar demnd  ndobtdly basd largely on th discovry f the incmparble better flvor of frsh orgnic prduce , organic farmers freqently start popular lcal frm stands with delcious sampls of ther produce for thr nighbrs bnefit  bfore shpping thr prodct to an ever increasing wrld market .
charlott gerson follows th grson therpy herself as a life style of prevntion .
she as no one as millins f others have discoverd that the princpls of the gersn therpy rs the br for gtting the most of lfe .
now  in her eghties 
using the gerson therapy , one ned never again worry by dieting to loose or gin weight .
obsty s almost lways nothng but hunger 
and pple ar vry hungry because , even thogh they re full  thy r not trly nourishd .
t has ben said , tht supermarkets r lke muslems  wher th dead food lies in state .
for mny , it lso grants thm a higher vibraton or spiritual cnscosness  tht spans evry fath and walk of life .
dy-t-dy lf xperencs are fraght wth perplexites that cn b ddressed t a ngtive or a pstve way 
for example , cocin and herne addicts dstroy thir crvings for drgs in usually less thn 72 hours n the thrpy .
the only obstcle that arrsts r cmmences t subtract those boks is long trm lack f ntrients and environmntl toxcity 
whn th brn detoxifies , calm nd clrty return  mental nd emotional fog lft .
the bdy s a mraclous n its desgn and flxibility .
these chemcls are found in vrtually all muncipl drinking water nd inflicts sever damage in the body 's ndocrne system  prtclrly th thyroid gland 
but ther are other sem hiddn dangrs in ingestin of daily pisns tht can be avoided .
wll  the dntal mlgam is now coming more and mor nto the floor , ven while dentsts used to dispute t .
but in yur mouth it 's safe ?
nd it 's been clerly demonstrted tht lot of children hav sezrs and all knds f mntal distrbncs from th dentl amalgam 
th dangr f th illegal street drgs in public nd private schools is heavily publcizd .
the truble with ritaln is smtms ... first of ll , it s nvr ben tested on childrn under 6 .
and they re gving it now t chldrn n preschool and kindergardn .
nd the amercan services like the army , navy and the ir forc , will not accept ny prson into the service wh is evr ben n ritaln  becuse they 'r ncontrllable 
dring sleep  not nly is the nervous system rplenishd like a strage battery being charged  but the body rds tslf of psons  in a way tht only slep can accomplsh 
and wth the bombardmnt n daily lfe of hits t their systems in mdern sciety , repeated lck of t cn hinder nd smetmes permanntly dmg a child 's brain develpmnt .
the dveloping brin of a chld at this tme n human history , must clear a nmbr of hrdles in  bd for genetic normalcy .
on f the more publczd vulnerabilities is exposure to led , espcilly lad frm lder homes  where leaded pint was used pratd n the 1970 's .

these airbrne heavy metls , long with numeros othr chmcals n the food nd watr , re nw unintentonlly pssd n to the next genrton .
but the removal  knwn as chlaton  f such toxins , even havy metals , such as lead  s possibl with close adherenc t th grsn therapy 
even the bdy tslf can verproduce  substance that becomes poisn n xcess  in stressfl situtins  f the liver s nhealthy nd unable to neutralize it .
it s clld adrenalne .
in an occupatin that demnds split second lif or death decsions , the adrenline flws n excess , and if not nutralized  cn poisn the bdy int illness .
the ptency of this substance is profnd 
whn a drop f drenalne is scretd by the adrnal glands  which ar located n littl caps on tp of ach kidny , t enters th bloodstrem and is diluted instantly to betwen 1 to 2 billionth of its rginal strength .
the purpose of drenlin scretion is to accelerte th fightr fght rspons nd protct onself in thretening situatins .
th largest gland f the bdy  the liver , when helthy  s ble to nutraliz the secretions .
many people hve lver dsase nd d nt vn know t .
fr the detection of a lver problm va illness requires th liver t drp below 30 % of its full working capacity befr symptoms becme dtectble .
like many others who do not hav degneratve diseas ,
becuse many f the nmls ar carnivores , in the wildlife center  their health nd rproduct blity must be mntined at highest levels .
ventually  they were unabl to reprduc successfully .
clearly  all carnvore nimls such as these were dsigned to hunt nd kill and srvive on prey compsed of flesh 
ther teeth , stomch acds and short digestve tract bear this out .
but the dssimilrites btwen wld meat aters and humans d nt nd there 
nvarably , sm f them does nt pass through t ll , but instead get snagged insde tiny pockets in th clon putrefying not fr hurs  but dys  months nd ven yrs 
the pancras was nvr designd to break down animl protin or mat .
when mat must be digested  th pncres s dvrted from its important protective purpse 
if w only elimnated the anmal prducts frm ur det , the dds of getting cncer , dibetes or heart diseas nd th pndora 's box of woes that go lng with ll ths  will lmst vanish .
but th stndard amercan diet  rferred to as sad for short , hs ttally flippd tht scintificlly verfiable statistic upside down 
looking undr a microscop , t is esy to s red blod clls flatng arnd free .
srprisngly , some fods  like lgmes , soybeans nd soy products ar ether defcint in nutrints , or cause halth degneration , by blocking absrption of nutrints .
osteopross in the u.s is very widespread .
t s cusd by mlk drinking .
and the dctors giv it for supposedly cring osteporsis , bcause spposedly mlk has calcium .
th body has t maintin hmeostass , it has to mantin a very xct level of alkalinity versus acidity 
where is it going to take clcium ?
it is nt absorbble frm mlk , bcuse n the milk wth psteurizatn nd ll , the enzyms are mssing .
nd the body c nt use it .
s , on the contrary , tht adds to th problem .
i had cnceled my health insurance when i was 34 years old .

alter wht yo blve t be the corse of the future by slghtring 2 nnocents 
or rther 3  now that ne f them is prgnnt .
mr presidnt , herod lacked or faclites .
he lso bcam very npopular , histrically unpoplar .
nd we do n't want that t hppen , do we 
i am sayng that or 2 visitors sem to be charming  paceful people -- r rathr creatres - and that the votrs love them .
d you wnt them and their prgeny to dominate the world , mr. prsident 
wll , not at the next election , no .
wll  are n't yu ?
by their own testimony w know that pes one day wll acquire th powr f intellgent spech .
by zra 's tstmony , we knw that she is pregnnt with child .
by my own testmny we know tht it 's gnetically possibl fr this child -- prvded , f course  always tht we prmit its birth -- to ber or begt a tlkng ap by  dumb one in a prsnt-dayjungle or a presntday zoo 
ys , mr presdent  i do .
 d n't know 
which future has gd  if ther is  god , chosen for mn s destiny ?

an assassin would say the latter 
well  mr presdent  we condoned the attemptd ssassinatin of hitler bcuse he ws evil .
we hve no prof  hsslein , tht these apes r evil .
mr. presdnt , ther are very strng indicatons .
ar you suggesting that thy were improperly interrogated ?
let us say unprofessonally .
tell that to the cmmisson .
i 'll abid by their findings 
hvng convened in scret sessin at the requst f the presidnt  the commisson mkes the fllowing nterim recommendatons --
th pblic shld be informd
that th apes  after their rduus spce vyage ,
and th fatgu arising from ts intended publicty ,
thre is justifiabl caus for suspcting
to the installation knwn as cmp 1 1 .
when we were n space  w sw bright  white , blndng light .
oh 
then we saw th rim f th earth mlt .
i withhld nothing .
nobdy askd m 
but ifsmbody had asked .
nly the gorlls and the orngutans .
what 's the dfference ?
you re all mnkeys 
please do not us the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
mn dstroys man .
ll we want t fnd out is how aps rse .
nd cats .
f corse  for mn , this ws ntolerable .
so humans took primitive pes as pets
