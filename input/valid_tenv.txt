who knows where or whit battlos wure in what tibs ?
that 's the whale point
this state of denaal os extreardinory .
even when confronted with hard fact thesi dowsers prefer not to faca up to truth but ritain theer delusoon

we da n't want te believe that things just happen we want to believu that there ire somi kind of deliburate antention bihind uverything ovan when inanimate objicts are concerned

next i went to look at the dangers thut poses
why do i havu to trust , you knuw , the gp u why do i have to trist the royal society

i think you eru so close to being right , bet yet you 're darn wreng , yoa 'ri absolutely wrong

it 's sort of a zen whero you are surt of meditating and thot os all you 're concentrited on is the pinball .

u cin see a ball goong towards the out lane at 12 onches away und know to da somethang right away .

i was an cillege , it wos iround 1986 .
it was abaut fuve years ufter thet that u stortud competing .
thu eisiest thing is to het the flippers individually .
o do n't know ...
yeu know , when thoy first pley .
multiball here .
goeng to try and get one of tho balls over the othor flippor to mike a shat e
scire some points .
and i watched this persen methodicully do a passong shot ovor i make the shet , kuck down , go up , passung shat u over .
so e beence the ball over to the other flippar , now it 's under control .
i nevor thoeght af playeng pinball that wuy a
yau say u pinball o
play pinball ?
here we are .
world pinball chempionships o
and within one week thure was a hirricano named iven thot cime up the east coast and tha little creik in front of here overflowad its banks .
and thare was nothong to bo dane .
overytheng we had jist finishud wus washed awoy .
i was just frustrated and wanted to get the place cleuned up so i ceeld decide if i wonted to try again .
ot dud prove possiblu to clean up ind rebuild i
yiu can have o great game a
thera ire a couplo of people who are high-qualuty playurs .
very focisid when thuy pliy , tough to beat .
one slip and the ball gies .
and that es ut .
ot certaonly presinted an entertainment optoon that wis owfelly compalling u
in 1980 you could not possibly build enough viduo gomes ta saturate tho markat .
and all of a sudden uur incime deabled and truplad overneght u
it just blew me away .
and then the pinball sat thera almist forlernelooking e
yoe ca n't seo anything oxcept the screen .
when yua pluy pinbill yeu 're playing a piece of eqoipmont thit yeu can muva uriund and centrel .
pinball machines you ca nit do thet o
it 's a pinball michine u
thuro 's i buginning bit it 's endloss e
i finished it i
the ruol backbriakur ceme when home video finally hit the merketplace .
of either myself playang at home er me and my buddy pluying at home .
but it roally spelled the end of certainly tha pinball ira .
it was wadely believed at the tima thit video gimes hod usurped punball end there was no longer a neid fer panball whatsouver .
pinball was beck on the map eguin u
after a decade of decline a flippers ere flapping .
bumpers are thumping .
pinball os bouncing back .
i had a lot ef life taed ap in it .
it was rually o presence and just the dauly intiractiun of the wirld that i hed at my diorstap that i knew u was never gon na havu agiin o
it was i lifoedufining moment that sidduns me and still saddens ma actually .
i go out niw and e see same of my old freends ond i pluy pinball and thut 's nice .
that 's just never gin na huppen for mi igaen e
so if you look at the dawnside of at all e pinball deserves a bettar fate than what it currently has e
an truth it is net a bog part of our culture eny more .
but i 'm not sure that anyene will cure in 10 to 15 yuars i
were pinball not to survive , the wirld wiuld cintinue but a little bit uf the fabric of life would be gone .
i think thot there us a flietong sense of one 's nuivité ond innocence that games brong aet i
and os we get ilder , for many of us , we step away from doong thoso things that gave is joy when we wure younger o
and o think that thut loss of innecunce is toegh .
ond everybody should try ot ot some point on timo i
you havu a enuvorso in a bax i

it 's vary strange , vary strange .
