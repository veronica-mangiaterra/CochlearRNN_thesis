lichtman :
so one could argue there is a natioal security ad ecoomic reason o conceal the

kenned :
his bc was giing h so much pain on a rgular basis tht if he did n' receive pain edicaion every day , on a regular shedule , e 'd be flat out on his back .
ad consequently during i

nobody knew about it at th tme .

narrator :
fivemen .
heprblemwth putting that kind of inforaton together in one journal is that it can be stolen , copied , compromised .
i 'd be very nervous if i were the presiden and i knew some oth people hd access to that .

but we keep ots of secrets .
we keep an amazng number of screts .
i ave m dobts tha there is such a book .
pesientsthemselves certainly keep screts .
it 's not even power , per e .
it 's inormaton .

my wife used to hear rats in the attic , usually the nigts before i had an important leture .
aec , go up and fid out .

we must retrn .
why ?
ou know tht .
but if there is a madma loose ...
he 's against al of s .
aginst the vey concept of this journey .
what 's happened ?

this is contempt of court 
no , no , professor .
i mean , si oliver .
you must n' look at me .

after all , i 'm a wman .

all right .
te truth is ,
there 's this guy a northen .
is n't that the guy yo 've been readin ' about ?
rigt .
he 's this close to discoverg the gravitn .
if we can fiure out how the graviton works ,
defy it .
where bidges o n't collase ,
where planes wo n't cras .
mother :
ha ha .
positive .
the la where i 'll be working --
to cool his particle accelerator .

if you 'e sure abot this , son ...
dad .
ow !
all igt , laddies ...
now , you new guys eed to be aware that god ol  rumson
ai n't always so good ,
especially when they execute th rumson rack .
what 's the rumson rack ?
oh  nothin ' mch , rely .
tey jus create a distraction .
nd when you ai n't looin ' ..
uhh !
more work o do this year .
player :
what the ...
mn , i thought they were gon  give l ' crick-in-th-neck the bot
and let us hae our arena bac .
they were ...
uil they rcruited some supergenius kid
t help him solve he mysterie of the unierse
or some such garbage .
charlie boyle !
been lookin ' all over for yo .
i m dean wllace .
hmm ?
everone 's so exited to have o here at nortern .
well , not everyone .
i tink hey hte me .
what , that bunch of losers ?
it 's good-ye , coach n-win- big-game .
gkkt 
ou facilties hee were built in 1954 , charlie 
beautfl , ai n' the ?

hat are you laughing at , pintstein ?
it 's a physics lab .
hat d i go t do , dra you a road map , son , huh ?
come on .
i 'm charlie , ad i 'll be teaching his class .
supposedly , the party tarted in the quad ,
n thn it went to the arena ,
and then it ended up in th omon area
ha , that sounds like fun .

well , wh do n't you try something different ?
like what ?
a a ha .
fro a guy that 's ben alone in the lab for the last 15 years .
good point .
i 'll see you after my workout .
hey , oe thing .
what  really meant wa that a good scientist
des n't keep rpeating the same experient ver and over
expecting to get different results , right ?
yeah .
you know what i mean ?
ok .
have a good worout .
i 'l see yo in the lab .
al right .
ok , uddy .
ye .
whew !
whew !
always a classic move  bob .
you kow , i could n't agree more , dik .
bt if she wants t gold  dick ...
she 's got to nail the doble te loop .
yes !
yes !
i did 't realize nyone was here .
i 'm claire .
ch ..
a good scientist doe nt keep reeating the same xperiment over and over
expecting to get different resuts .
ch-chaz .
chaz from chicago .
so , where do o o to school ?
excuse me ?
where do you g to school ?
where do you o ?
frnklin .
ell , there 's your answer .
cool .
col 
cha anthony .
amy abrahms ?
claire adison ?
here .
chaz anthony ?
haz athon ?
i 'm so gad o deidd to join us .
i said take a seat , yong man .
i see first impressions are your strong suit .
paul o'donnll .
friend call me odie .
you re hard coe , ma .
settle in , chz .
i 'll be teain this class all year .
ad i 'll be disrupting it .
and it took many , many years
befre galileo oul prove s theory to be correct .
that , inee , the lanet travel around the sun in a cicular orbit .
wel , i 'm very impressed .
uh , i was , uh ..
skating and sme geek told me tha the ice rink was eliptical .
while i wa sticking his tongu to th ice .
tacher :
all riht , all right .
as you may or may not know ...
hey , chicgo .
this is deion .
odie says you 're down .
min if we jin you ?
i mean , yo .
experiment ?
h , yeah , experiment to see how long i can sa in school
without ever actully going to school .
h 's the bomb .
hey , how 's  goig 
i finished the calculatons for today 's xperimnts 
eah , the data ' right there n your desk
underneath you eighth grade geometry book , chaz .
so , how 'd you find out ?
my computr td me .
so , wh 's chaz ?
a guy who has a life .
i 've gone thruh life so far as chalie bole
and it is n' any sleigh ride .
who thought he , i was cool .
me .
hat has ever , ever happend to e before .
ever .
and i ' going bck .
ok .
chalie , i 'm not yur da .
good .
riht .
science .
one id even gave me his lunch money
always have .
oh , look , i got this one from a treet figt .
look at tht .
i got an apendix scar .
bear , ear ...
lsten , it s not he scar , al right ?
ok , girls , if you think that was something .
personal record .
well , the skeletn lecture sounded awful interesting ,
so i thought i 'd vary my rutine a ittle .
class :
park i , mr. anthony ,
and lose the bldes .
catch yo later , claire .
teacher :
all right , everyone , settle down .
and chaz nthony ' not .
honor society grs never lke honor society uys 
trus me o this one .
souns like a risky game pln to me .
and now i ' enacting a strategy
jus like any good p --
of ourse , ale , it 's not much good .
to actually move .
thank yo .
now , how many bones do you think ae in your fet ?
big finish .
i ust wish you 'd use your powers for god , not vil 
what are you talking about ?
ther re geniuses your ae , yu know .
i was talking to a olleagu over at northern .
he was telling me about a young man -
who was it that helped you ?
like i sad , sme lser in science club .
now , wh wats to come up here
and finish charting these poins on the polar graph or me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude cariature
yo know ...
ooh !
charli :
oh , hey , ad .
and my students have become openy hostil .
no to mention th dom food .
well , the only fatherly advce i can give you about the sience stuff
is jus keep plugging away .
a tutor !
dad , you 're a genius !
enius ?
m first f .
your first f .
what am i saying ?
but why are you so hapy about geting your first f ?
i .
so , uh , i guess they 're gon na kck me out of school
if  do n't get better grades .
and i would care ecause ...
you 're pretty ok .
ca n't you find anyone else ?
i mean , wl , you were the first one on my list .
maybe we could work someting out .
then i guess i shuld start prcticing .
oh , gret .
just what i want to do fter school ,
more school .
take it .
fine .
how nothing lasts forever
well , they 're wrong
yeah
you stod strong
you 've got he ky o my heart
'cause i
it sems so long ago
when my world wa upside-down

i mean , that 's wha we 're supposd to be lisenng to , right ?
thank yo .
hey , so , wat 's wit the musum ?
he 's the hocke coach over a northern .
hey , dddy !
i want you to meet ...
jaso ...
i 'm just going to gt my thigs hre .
chaz ?
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i woul hve loved to hve seen coach ddion 's fce .
i 'm glad he did n' see mine .
i had t smooth things over with caire , oo 
that was 20 miles of rough road  he apology turnpike .
hey , doc ?
yu ver have a girlfriend ?
yeah , sue .
maybe .
nothng again .
i do n't gt it , charle .
and still , there 's no sign of a graviton .
well  maybe if we ake our minds off it ,
you know  i we sit bak , rlax ,
and , uh , have a little fu .
th eureka syndrome , yeah .
wheneer he had a problem tat he coud n't solve ,
ureka 
come on , dance with me .
oh , no  i do n't thik so .
uh , you do n't wnt to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any diferent .
only as a particle u until now .
we an ust s asiy tink of it as a wave .
you said so in your book 
microwave cnflict .
how could i iss his ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
set up a phased harmonic 
affected the nuclear matrix ,
in other words , groovy little house beat
jst unoked the mysteries f the niverse !
we dd it , carlie 
this is big !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can we do it later though ?
i m kind of late for scince class 
maybe you just had a good tutor .
ut you are ging to meet one .
i gt to thinkin it ight e god for yo to met a kid you age
who 's not asamed of being smart .
he can probably se som one-on-ne
with a kid who 's ot ashamed to kik his utt .
class :
ys , well , no just you , the entr class .
i 've arranged a field trip today to nrhern .
doc !
doc !
i got to sow you omething really cool .
oh .
oh , wht ?
what am i going to d ?
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .

hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the people up there thin i 'm a genius ,
and then te other half think i m a unk .
hey , i 'm goin to use the particle acceleraor while you e gne .
might as well get some work in ,
as lng as i 'm suck down here .
mi particle accelerator es su particle acceleraor .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hokey .
igloo cit .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerator .
and i wanted to say thanks for passng me .
hey , you hav nobody to thank bt yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's from me and te guy .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goin ' down

and how the 're connectd to a mysterious quantm force .
oh  yeah .
but you know soething ?
it was , uh , genea , 1997 .
swiss scientist were able to split a photon 
and evn though the aticles are 6 miles aart ,
whatever one does , the ther one does
ol !
and maybe unloc the secret as t how it works .
and then ...
defy gravity .
let 's gt to work .
and th output level is 999 .
now ths chip has 33 ntigraviy halves .
why he rubber coating ?
they ll act like superballs .
ad when i press thi butt ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
t means i can make amends
well , with what we just discovred ,
i figured out a way to hep northern eat rmsen .

fo the re-scheduled etral onference championip
how 's this supposed to wok again ?
how is tha possible ?
like the up bls i shwd you .
corresonding microchis with oter graviton halves
whatever our skate do , their skates will b force to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c n science .
yo sure did a numr on this lab .
nah .
besides , i 've aranged his schedue so that he 'll be gone all day .
and he 's never here during hockey game

isaburo sasahra of the escort grop has tested it .
that 's enough for m .
 'll tell the chamberlain yo both approe .
i 'd rather see you two duel than merely test sords .
there are rumors in or clan .
he rason you do n't fight is bease i wold hurt the family of the loser 
perhaps protecting your family name rather than prmoting yur pride and rank is the wist way t get along in this world .
isaburo  you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
 married into my wife 's family and hae be henpecked fo 20 years 
would you lik to look a the november borer ecord 
no , not if nothing unusual happened .
aking rce cakes in ovember
but there ar n customes
the god who came own in fbruary and brught the rice harvest departs tomorow until his return next yea .
do u really believe that ?
no , i was just
perhaps you wan a grandchild ?
it is n't setled yet ?
no .
my wife suga s the problem .
it must be someon she appoves of .
someoe strong , loving and faithfl .
is that the seward s 
he 's ben waiting for you .
you wre probably idly chatti away to asano bout useles thigs like martial ats aa 
to hve the steward hnor us wih a visit has never happened in te sasahara family .
the truth is , isabro ,
lady ichi has been disissed fom the castle .
it has be decided to have her marry yogoro , your son .
steward  why was lady ici dismissed ?
i 'll rtrn for an answr in a f ays .
why should we accept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
i s like ths .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to  spa to rest .
the daugte of gohe yamagiwa , h man in charge of the castle wardobe , was servin beside him .
lady chi lost her head on seeing this .
she sprang at lady tama , slaped her ace , and dragged her by the hair .
w can we accept her ?
i think we should gratefully accept her without bein dificult .
no matter wat you sy , e must accept her .
it 's an orer from our lord .
i  afrid ...
i do n' feel ery enthusiastic aout it .
neither do i .
bu i i refuse , there may be trouble lter .
yogoo has sai nothing , but he wold n't be hppy marryig a lord 's istress who has borne a child .
i do n't want him to repeat my mitake .
hey said o 'd be at the border .
i hard everything .
the steward and chambrlain are good udges .
alert vn in times of eace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage and other matters ,
i sugges you keep things quiet .
you 'l pobably rceive a larger fief .
so be modet about it or the others will think you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of yo  your family .
will you draw on your secret principles o swrdplay ?
but t the ast momen , you skillfully switch from dfense o ofese 
yet yu nver attack .
yu wait until your pponent tires .

we can not accept our lord 's favored lady .
there 's no need to be so reseved .
it ' hppened beore , not ust in the aizu clan  but n every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , bu even so , i wish to decline the hono .
ecline ?
sashara , that will no be allowed .
it is our lord 's personal wsh .
i mean n disrspect .
yo know our lord 's wish .
it s an order !
to dcline is to defy the order !
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree t it ?
i wish to accept the onor .
isaburo ssahara , you seem a bit too stubborn .
may you enjo long life togther
we 'll all be at your side as ong as you live

a woman who was dismissed fter bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n' notice your return .
moer took her along for prayer at shonenji tempe .
she kindly aches me dmestic duties .
i do nt elieve it .
father 
but despite that , he has borne everything fo 20 years .
yes , right away .
you must n't .
the world never sems to go right .
i wish to retie and hve yogro , my ldest son , succeed m .
i humbly hope that my reuest wil be ranted .
saaara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very wel , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sorry .
it 's too erly to rtir , i thik  but his son ha arrid , so
so isaburo sasahar 's retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the time , but it 's a grea relief .
i wonder what i 'v dne all my life , thouh it 's not like m to o so .
yogoro 's marriage is a very app one .
fea often xceeds th pceived dangr .
s it was in your case .
yogoro s wie .
she 's a fie wife .
uga 's just the same as bfr , but ichi is always pleasant and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like yourself , i do 't uerstan t either .
chec the weapons in the armory againt the inventory list , and have he men clean hem on appointed days .
i do nt say to always yield to thm , but at times , they 're uneasonable 
rice cakes ?
enjo .
ait , ichi .
i 'm going to retir soon .
yooro ill become the head f our famiy , and you 're hi wife .
y ned n't hold back for th old woma .
take over the household dutis .
understad ?
even so , she is my mothe , and i wil trea he as such .
excuse me .
tha 's enough abut your duties , yooro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understad .
tat she 'd grasp hr lord by his clothing .
it wa hard for me to beieve to , so i asked her the other day .
it was the year eore last .
ichi 
ccept the honor gratefully .
i was more angry than urprised 
a man over 50 was infauated with me .
i huddered .
our lord does not do this ust to stisfy a whim .
daimyo must have heirs or their houses will be bolised .
the only heir to our lord right now is young lord maamoto .
eve so , miss ichi , not just anyone can becme our lord 's mistress , for hr son may one day become our lord 's her .
she must be bautifl and kind like you .
you are referring to sannojo kasa , your fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagent .
then if sannoo agrees , you ill gratefuly agree to serve our lod ?
what do you say ?
but he bowd to our lord 's ishes and ave you up ?
so you had n choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you said you would serve our lord if sannojo agreed 
he has clearly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyomon shiomi ' daughter ichi is here i answer to you wishes .
then  thought
no , it was more lie a prayr .
i would bear him sons .
any , many ons .
then ther gils need never know my misery .
it woul end with me .
it was like a prayer .
my thougts were realy ike a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later .
then i went o a spa for postnata rest at m lord 's oders .
be friend wit her .
 hted her fr i .
beast !
beast 
i could never have found a beter wife .
beginning tonight 
wht ?
our lord eans nothing to me .
i have ben so worried aout the son i bore .
so worried .
 will orget about hi to .
i wil forget him .
yoro , be good to ihi .
you 've made me wait nearly two years , but at lst .
a boy wuld have been better .
an what s her name ?
yogoro and i ackd our poor brans over his and named he tomi .
post-hore messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birth mother t th heir .
if she remains the ife of a vassl , there would be much alk .
y say this is our lord 's ish ?
yes .
an our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the bs thng is for yooro to submit a reques to our lod and say he will snd ihi ack to the castle .
i 've been at him since the dy before yestdy , but he refuses .
natrally .
well , i do n't blame him .
but you know very wll ... that we ca 't have al our wishes granted in this world .
group ead kotani came over in the afternon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is calling you 
acting as if soe crsis has ocurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , i must tell you something .
ome nto the room .
first , father 's words 
he says he 's retir , so i am the famly head , and i am to do what  think is rgt .
however , he also says you 're to important to us to end away .
hat we must tae th est ossible car of you .
i must ell her sooner or later .
do n't worry .
o mattr what anyone says ,
i will not send you back to the cstle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 'e right .
but you ca n't eason with a crying child nor with your lord  as thy say .
isaburo , hat 's your opinion ?
it 's all up to im .
what is it ?
i ' lke him to ome again nw and explain in his words why we must return her .
when is son 's motr proves incovenient , he focs her to mrry a vassal .
this i cruel and unreasonable .
he has no understanding of human emotions .
kotani-san , or family did n't acpt ichi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself know yogoro o the sasahara family .
she was none too happy abut it ether .
but th raso they are getting along is because thy 're kind to each other and care for each other .
what ?
even if the hevens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think his is nough for today .
i beg yo .
would you give up tmi and return t the castle ?
woud you ruin our family bcaue you 've lost your head ovr a womn ?
in this cae
brother !
i m .
bunzo , if yu were me , wold you return ichi ?
of corse i would !
restrain yurself , bnzo .
yogoro 's the head of the family .
right o wrong , it 's all up t im .
if you love yogoro and omi , be prpared to defy such senseles conventions , however ard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , ou are a wie worth protectig , even if that means ining our fmily .
i am not orthy of t .
but thi wo nt be th end of it .
 gave her the essage .
se will be here soon .
over here , sister .
we ve heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about i .
do you wnt o say with yogoro , een if it mens ruining the sasahara famiy ?
i would ike to say .
even if you rin the family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoon shomi , has aske or lord that you be sent back to the castle as son a posibe .
i m sure you 're aware of ht .
he lies in wait whe yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him to send you back .
he s done thi several ime .
fther s father .
i a m 
i would rather die an return .
please tell the chmberlains and steward how i feel in whatever rds you thnk will best help my case .
we ak you again , ichi !
the family does n't matter ?
not only the sasahara family , but we the relativs will be jeopardized as well .
it can not be lped .
 see .
tere 's n use trying t convince a oman like thi .
yogoo 's to blame too .
it 's your isfortune tht  woman lik her has favord you .
return .
rturn to the castle .
wy do ou say tht now ?
wat 's the sasahara faily to you ?
lisen to me .
in ote words , i 'm a worthless , good-for-nothing man .
so in order t pove myself , for thee ast 20 years
 have foght t preserve our good name and social standing .
the cruel injustce ivolvd , for one thing .
but your beatul love for eac other has ouched me most f al .
ther 's never been a shred of love in my mrrie life !
n matte what happens , never leave him !
my husband 's with the chamberlain ?
yes , and he s waiting fo you to come .
i saw him in the cate .
the chamberain wishes to see you both .
he has som qustions for you .
you nee n't worr .
i will accmpany you 
 you lse heart now , what wll it mean for my rother ?
hury !
father , where did you go today ?
to se tatewak .
anything new at th castle 
o , nothig yet 
i hope nothing happens .
she wet ou .
what happened to ichi ?
buzo , whee 's ichi ?
bunzo , you trcked her .
no mter how many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going home .
ichi , take my adce nd return t the castle 
if you go bac to the castle obedintly without mai a fuss , the chaberlain is willing t overlook verythng 
t if you inist on retuning home , not ony will yogoro , but als his fater , saburo , be ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervision of their home .
honorable lay ichi , pleae retun to te castle .
yes .
my me is kiku .
the chamberlai 's orders ?
what orders ?
go home !
u ... if i go home without
say no more !
bt
fool .
tomi , you ol .
tomi , you fool .
yogor .
but he did request time off de to illness .
ad tomi ?
the chambrlain orered the wife of ootman bansaku kariy to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid woman .
ten everything 's l ver ?
yes .
we jus tok a rouabout pth .
defying the clan get us nowhere .
isabur , do you really man that ?
 cme to make sure of your thoughts o ths matter .
to e honest , the lan 's tatmnt f your fmily and our attitude in repons have weighed on my mind .
weighed on you mind ?
it 's like your swordp .
pused , you step back .
ut it 's not ik you to give up .
the clan did n't as for her formally 
it wa more like frce .
i fa , it wa moe like kidnapping .
if the shogunate offical in do hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may pove a fatal mistake for the atsudaira .
that yo 'll allow the to end here .
you 're saying i mut formally ask the castle t tae her back ?
yet i must ask thm o take hr back ?
it was wise of you to hold bac .
the chamerlain and steward are imressed by yur restraint .
i refuse 
i do n't rmember sending he back to he cstle 
why do n't you do as e sas ?
tht 's idicous , father !
neer !
she supresse her tears , left everythig behind , and quietly returned to the castle .
now , now , yogoro .
in any case , please go for now .
yogoro il be hard to conince , bu i 'll talk to him .
yogor will report today nd say he wishes to return her ?
tha 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festval tomrrow .
ince it would have coe to this anywy , hw dae the cause ll hat fss !
yogoro was wrong , but isaburo as inolen as well .
he 's always hepecked by his wife .
and deying clan orders like hat
i must ay he seem lie a different man .
his conduct has been adirable 
i calls for a slight increas in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the escort group has arived !
i 'm glad yu 've reported or duty .
ys , completely well .
tking into consideration my father 's wihs , i have decided .
please accept this .
tht 's good of you .
thank you .
fool !
petition .
this s the crulest orm of tyranny .
it runs counter to the aws of humanity and can not be condoned by the havens .
we herey appeal for her immedte retrn .
someone may ue my father 's name or my own to submit  request t retrn ichi to the castle .
but t will not be from us .
please keep that in mn .
thank yu for comin eery day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at times like these .
so our fet wo n't s in he blood .
this may be the ast time .
will you do me a favor ?
ill you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
jst cook the rice .
ca n' figt on a empty tomach .
excuse e !
orers from our lor !
accep obediently !
i said orders fom ur lord !
will yu not bey ?
let 's hear what the order are .
orders !
isaburo and yogoro ashara , fr your inolent conduc and defianc towrd our lord , you are ordered to commt seppuku .
sppuku ?
it is gracious of ur lord to permit it .
i tought men would come rrest us and then either hang or crucify us .
father .
howee , we want somethig before we kill ourselves .
bring us three heads !
those of lord masakata matsuaira , ruler of he aiu domain ,
chaberain yanas , and stewad takahashi .
bring m he heads of the villins ho tk my sn 's ife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of bondary gats has arrived !
i hear yu e
saburo 's only qual s a swordsman .
if you think he 's too much for you , tae for or fve strong men with you .
are they ot now criminals in th eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in chage of border gates .
this is no time to discuss juisdiction .
you 're rng .
if you rder me to kill them , please promoe me o superintendent here and now nd obtai our lord 's promise to increase m fief to 500 koku , according to clan ruls .
why be o forml now ?
never mind .
go !
we ust gather men  use foce and kil them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo ' a swordsman without peer .
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
hat time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that shoud b enough for u .
fr t footsteps  he 's aone .
it 's bunzo .
ather !
i know what yo want to say .
father !
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu s place ?
listen to the festval drums .
father !
you were pressed by or reatives at kenmotsu s place to come hre a their messnge ad say ,
we 've defied ur ord long enogh .
buzo , do n't hat u .
but remember :
each must live his own life .
as for what happene 
each must live hs own life .
and tell everyne this for me :
hve n't you tken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
wa if other clas hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather some me nd tke cre of it yourslf .
yes , but
the chmberlain 's intevention would agravate mattes .
fathe , he drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i remember it too .
outside the castle , it was th inoko estval , when the harvest god left .
inside the catle , it was the da befre the suwa shine festial .
father .
wat is it ?
tha 's as it should be .
it 's not unmanl at all .
but yogoro , do n't be too worred about ichi .
we will die here , ut she is the other of ur lord 's her .
no one cn orure hr , ad no one will endanger her life .
but father , ae n't they late n coming ?
i mean to ask f permision to enter , but the gate was open , o i came n .
i will now convey our lord s orders 
we have heard of the ordr o commi seppuku .
he changed his orders .
isabur and yogoro ssahaa , for your insolence and atttude toward our lord , you will be cofine at ensoji tmple outside the castle .
why the sudden change 
will you graefully acept ou lrd 's new orders ?
no .
no  h 's wrong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
 am sill the wife of yoor sasahara .
but ou lod received me in his audience .
i do n't understand what this is all bout .
steward , i seems we do n't understand what you jut told us 
if you tw admi that ichi is no longer a family member and that sh has ben rtuned , our lod will listen to he pea for a lghter punshment .
will you acknowledge her return nd live , or rfuse and ight it out ?
which wil it be ?
we are prepred for he worst .
then there i no alternative ?
please return her at once !
i 'll ask lay ichi now .
or will you let thir pursuers come and kl hem ?
ldy ich , th sasaharas are men 
you have already returned to serve our lord .
if ou tell hem that yu sever your tes with them once an fr all , thn all will be wel !
if you do , thei lives wil be save .
we need not ak them t return you .
wait 
do n't move !
do n't move 
lady ichi , wll yu sever your tis with them and sav their lives ?
or will you le them die as traitors ?

psdh
this s our galaxy  the milky wa .
our sn take 225 milion years to g round the galaxy onc
the dinsaur era lasted 180 illion years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ie and rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for the earth .. fast .
but his is n't the earth tat we knw , not reall .
at tis time the masters of the earth are dinosaus .
this is patagonia .
a vast region of argentinean ouh america s it is today .
and there was only one immense ocean ,
we are north of the souh american late , in the sea that wll grow to be the tlantic oce .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme foms of life also apeared o land during the inosaur ea .
in many placs there , one walks today on the ver ground these giants walked upon a 100 million years ao .
this penomenon seems t depend n another peculiar twist o volution .
regions tat produce geat dinosaurs lso tend to poduce great palaeontologists .
many docoral stdents come o pursue their rsearch .
sometimes younger people , like my daughter ludmila  just com to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talkig about dinsaurs with everyone , wheter hey are experts or ot .
it 's a bsy lfe , and it would have be plny for most people , but early in my career new horizons opened up for me 
thing became much larger than life .
a rancher had stumbled upo a surprisingy large bone .
after evral digging seson w ended up facing the argest dinosaur eve found 
w named it argentinosaurus
tis discovery have a profound effect , n the way we look at south american dinosaurs .
on a personal leve , it tok a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than rapefrit .
predators and azards abound .
oly a few ill reach adulthood .
it cover more han 15 mies and it is approximately 80 mllion years old .
w beieve tht it was chosen a a nsting site by generation pon generaton of these dinosaus .
the ests are so clos togethe , that the females could not walk betwe them .
it as warmer than toay .
a great part of the dinosaur era , there were n broad leaf tree nd no flowe bearing plants .
during the dinosar era there is no arctic ice aps , ad anarctica is subtropical .
for tens of millions of yers seasons barely changed .
the wter of the ocean is also mch wamer .
hurricanes are requent .
the magnetic pols chanes position continuously .
professr ori has contibuted o the discovery f or than a dozen of new dinosaurs .
as  cienst , he isists tha each new find is imprtant , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes he says what plays the biggest part i simply not in our hands 
 like to think that i am lucky , just incrdibly lcky .
many paleontological discoveries are not made by proessionals .
that 's what happened with the argeniosaurus , and it happened again with yet anothe dinoaur .
they were rlatively big , s at first , we thought that they belonged to a herbivoe , because i general these dinoaur tend to be larger .
but insea , the bones rovd o be those of  predator ;
a very large on .
professor cria 's team hd nvild a firt secies of a group of fierce predators called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in this group surpssed the faus t rex in terms of size .
lthough rare for reptiles , caring for the youn has be obseve aong croodiles for instance .
in dinosaurs , this caring behaviour evolv nough to remind us o birds .
this baby fmle is named long tooth .
howeer small and vuneale , and cut she may appea now she is genetialy programmed to rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like her mother .
in ptagona , ou have the argest herbivore and te largest predator  living at roughly the same period and in he same territory .
there is no easy answer .
evolution followd  number of particula paths .
but a simpler interetation rest on a warm lima and the fertile land , with all the vegetation ou can eat .
ye another theory tells us hat large herbivore had to grow big enough , to accommodate  large stomah required to iest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , are spans of flat space could have led naturally t argetinosaurus , s the vast seas have ed to whales .
the highest branche belong to those who can reach them , and many predators are too small to be threatening in thoe situation .
he is gowing fast too .
r primitive feahers have almost ll dsappeared .
they thrived or 180 million years .
this is a message for us here .
by the way , it is more than time to inroduc sharp feathers .
he is unenagia , a 6 fot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is elated to birds , as are to so extent velociraptos , giganotosaurus d tyrannosauus 
big dinosaurs need space 
this is the carmen funes museu , which also hppens to be my second home .
sometimes as  jke we sa that it s a science filled with holes .
we have only fund about 700 species of dinosaurs on the whole planet .
this is 't may for a reign that lasted 180 illion years .
ten percnt o these dinosaurs were foud in arentina , most of them n the lst 30 years .
throug technology our knowledge rws faster every day .
fossiisatin is a process that requies extremely rare conditions  and even ten very little of n organis is preservd .
we could easil conclude that a tremendous umber of species ust disappeared witout a trace .
of course , scince fiction can be fun , bu you also need to b very careful before proposing a new way of looking at dinsaurs .
i wish i could trave i time to see these amazing creatures aliv .
trong one has reached maurity .
for many scientists he is a full size .
he is 20-yea-old , and is a the beginning of more than a century of life .
ey tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , if they wer alone or i a roup , if they were wandering , hunting , or bein huned
the pattern clealy show association between contemporary species , and this is vey rare .
his work is nimately linked to nature , its intimately aried terran and ever changing climte .
so there were hardships , but there are moments  sometimes when cince just blend with the pure bliss of beng outsie and wonderful place .
you just look around .
but fiding required a trained eye .
with time you ralise hat the number f questions grows faster tan the number of answers .
again , like many tims before ,
a good int n an answer came unexpectedly .
n fact , we did n't find just ne spcimen but a chamber of bones beloging to a least seven individuals .
for e , and my canadian coleague phil curry this as pointing at sothing we had considered , bt have no evidence for until ten .
so long truth belong to thi new species of giganoosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , she is fully grown .
strong one is unknwigly in a critical ime .
taring off ieces of si nd letting the arge prey bleed to deah , r de from infction is a strategy more liely t sceed .
giganotosarus cold wait days even weks between meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep n drifting , the earth begins to resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature ner stop changing .
we are in nrth america .
part from flight , ths reptiles has nothing in common with bird
ad evolution gave t nothing to survve the impending ramatic evens .
several factors could have contributed to the demise of dinosars .
mammals became bigger and more mptitive .
rifting isolted continents touched each other .
ne rivalries appeared .
new diseases spread .
th limate was growing coldr , possibly because o increaed volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable in many plaes .
vgetation suffered from the acid rain nd alo fom the darkned and dust-filled skes .
but till , many dinosaurs made it through for a itte whie longe 
it covers the disance from the moon to the earh in two hours .
all the forest of north and south america ae destroyd by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the animals that suffered most .
i a relatively short time , dinosaurs becme hitory .
not al the dinosaus diappear .
if they have n't becom extinct maybe we ju woud n't be here .
more discveries await me here pehaps but as i move forward in life ,
and the best food in pars , sme say , is made by chef auguste gusteau .
gusteau 's retaurant is the toast of paris  ooked five mons i advane .
h is the youngest chef ever t achieve a fivestar rating .
chef gusteau 's cookook  anyone can cook !
but not everyon celebrates ts success .
what 's even more amusing is that gusteau ctually seems to blieve it .
i , o the oher hand , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
i thin it s apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
firt of al , i 'm a rat .
flor , eggs , sgar , vanill bean ...
oh !
small tist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that 
tis is emile , my brther .
he 's eaily impressed .
so what ?
this is y dad .
he s never impressed .
e also happens to e the leader f our can .
s  what 's wrong with having highly developed senses ?
what 's going on here ?
sudenly , da did n't think my talnt was useless .
clean .
cleanerific .
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it ade my dad proud .
now , d 't you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble cause 
w 're thieves , dad .
and what we 'r stealin is , let 's ace it , garbage 
it is n't staling if  one wants it .
if no ne ants it , why are we stealng it 
but to my dad ...
you get picky about what you put in the tak , your enine is gon na die .
now sht up and eat your garbge .
scndly , stay ut of the kitchen and away fom the humans .
it 's dangerus 
they discover , they create .
how ca i describe it ?
good food is like music yo can tate , clor you can smell 
yu need only be aware to stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was right .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally uique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only oe who knew about it was emile .
hey , emile .
emile .
come o , you 're good a hiding food .
he does n't understand me , ut i can b myself around him .
why re you walking like tat ?
i d n't want to constantly have to wash my paws .
did ou ever think about how we walk on the same paws that e handle food wth ?
you eer think about what we put ito our mouths 
all the time .
but if dad sees you walking like tht , he 's not oing to like it .
what have ou got here ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found cheese 
and not just any chee 
that would go beautifully wih my mushroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we 're supposed to return o the clony beore sundown or , you know , dad 's gon  ...
emile !
ther are possibilities unexplored ere 
we t to coo this .
now  exactly how we cook thi is the real question ...
the key is to keep tning it .
tha storm 's geting closer .
he , remy  you thik that maybe we shoul n't be o ...
you got to ast this !
it 's got , lik , this ba-boom , zp kind of taste .

we got to do that again 
okay , when the ext storm come , we 'll o up on the roof ...

yo 'v been here a millo times 
gutau swears by it 
okay .

just he greatest chef in the wrld .

all right .
tell them if thy look up tese plaes , they 're on na fnd out wht aplejac is up to 
and the reason why we know apljack is arno is 'cause it cae from the cmpter into dexter 's head .

except for the acvity up in the hyloft , th arm was rtty quiet that oring .
they coud sleep throug anything .
bu a lot of the other animals wre awakened by all that surrying overhead .
some of them ust accepted it .
some were prett annoyed .
bu the mood was ver diffeen up n the haylof .
she a determied to be a good mother an never yell t her kittes .
but that approach woul not last very long , because milo , one of her kittens , was truble from the very beinning .
milo , dear , his mothr said , tat 's not a good idea !
com back here , milo !
you re a strange-looking cat , mil said .
h , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to fiure this out ad said ,
oh , all rght , a dog .
but , um , really , dep down nside , we 're al cats , right ?
uh , o , otis barked .
the kittens ere now big enough to leae he hayloft and see he world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was the first to start caling out fo food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to mil she yelled a ot .
milo , did you hear me ?
thi is the dock and down tere is th rivr .
everyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
lo asked .
is this ?
oh !
ah !
milo , get back here , his mother demande 
bu milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by the river .
right nw .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , ilo !

eh , yes , milo meowed .
i thi so , milo said .
all right , be careul , is mother ordered , and begn swimming .
all rigt .
i 'm not going to yel , his mother said .
now dry yourself off , like this 
and follow me back home .
that was fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
gt over here !
the months passed , and he farm was mming with the sounds  summer .
milo had some new hiding places he could n't wait to try out .
otis sniffed around the ard for a whil .
you 'r in the pipe , milo .
try again .
ct 's in the can !
and milo slippd off o another hiding plce .
it was n' easy fooling a dg 's nose .
ilo tried a harder sot .
ut otis found him there too .
now milo needed a brllit ida .
aha 
he thought of a place where otis could neer snff him out .
it worked .
but milo wondered if it was eally worh the trouble .
milo and otis went to see wat all the commotion was about .
uddenly , one cicken 's voice rang out :
and all the hens left in a cucking flurry because that was goria tlkig , a young chicken who had scratched and peckd her way o the op rug of the henhouse .
gloria had a go reason for wanting to be alone .
tere it is , fellas , gloria cackld .
m frst egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it final hpened .
is she saying t ome with it or is she goin back to work ?
ha-ha-h .
you wan me to kick it back to ou , ois ?
milo ased .
tis said .
i kicked it y accident .
goria ave us a job to do .
how long do e have to tick aoud thi henhouse ?
until gloria coms ack .
mabe you do 't realize i , mil , but this is a mjr day for me because ...
well  me you do 't realize ha this is the day i 've become a watchdog .
some strange noises brought mlo out of the henhouse .
what was all his about ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
come here , ots , a frog croaked .
otis sid .
otis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , cme on .
at that momet , milo was teasin a crab tat was waddling through the famyard .
e deserved it , th frog caked .
and outsde , ml and otis suddely remembeed :
h !
te egg !
otis growled .
just tr something 
probably rotten anyway .
ilo wanted jt one more look at that weird anmal .
the nise attracted  group of local snoops lookng to dig up some scandal 
i think we 're havig a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your mommy 's a chcken .
the ther anmals told otis he 'd better tke the chick t gloria , and quckly , which he d .
but the chick kept coming back to otis .
now go back to glori .
do you undertand ?
woof  the chick eeped .
woof , woof , momy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you ve got to be a rough , touh , mean , fighting dg , like this .
oky , puppy , otis ordeed 
giv it a try 
momy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll mis him .
come on , said milo .
phw .
wow , look at this thin , otis , mio said 
oh .
otis drie off nd came back to settle the core with that --
tht , uh  thing .
ha , ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is reat 
hurr up , otis !
maybe ilo was aving a trrifc tie , ut otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe e could jump off the bridge into the ox if he hurried .
but he was too lte .
on  boy 
od .
but tht did n' work either .
otis jut could n't swim fast enough and th river tok mlo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost sight of otis .
sddly he heard smethig mving in the bushe .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
mio ried to duck low  the box o the bear would n't see him .
but the bx was drifting ight towrs the hugry animal .
but unfortunatly much too soon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my sie .
he ra p n the riverbak , leading the bear awa from milo 
milo kept drifing along , ut he was getting a little concerned because the rivr was beginning to move faster ... and faster .
he 'd lot track of otis no , and e was driftig farther ad farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep ino the forest .
and he heard mysterios hoots and growls and cries n the nig .
he began to wish he 'd nevr jumed into this bx and he bga to wish he was home .
it seemed to be trebling as mch s he was in the chilly , misty ight .
he drfted on through the darkness , hoping to in the morning waiting jus aron the bend .
when daylight came ,
milo saw  farm on te riverbank .
for one happ moment , e thought he was home and cried out for joy .
but he looked again .
e did 't knw when he woul ever see it aain .
here comes the dog your life h -- ♪♪
the deadwod swmp .
a bog where skeleton tres grew without leaves or branches , an whre no ceature could lie , except for the dreaed deadwood bids .
an one of them was perching on a familir wooden box .
okay  punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat .
cat s sad , he bird croaked .
look in the box 
tis prpared imself and peed in the box and saw only a slitary black feathr .
in fact , mil ws nowhere near te deadwood swamp .
after his box got stuck there , e ran .
he ran from those bird as uicky as he could .
now he found himsef in a burng valley .
the ground was hot and the moke made his yes sting .
milo ran untl he came to an open medow where he saw a kind of animal he 'd never sen befor .
feling pretty hungry , he immediately wondered 
is that something you can eat ?
heh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be vry caful , mio though .
and above all ,  must keep abolutely silent .
the o felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch wre he figured no one would ever be abl  find it .
yeah , here , my preciou uskrat .
you sould be safe tere till dinrtime  the fox said .
ilo crept slowly down te tree and watched the fx rn over the horizon .
and then , nce on the ground ,
mio knew just how to get his paws o a ig  tasty muskat luch .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through te wetlands to a beah full of clam oles .
he rememberd ther was one magic word everyone understood and that was plase .
so he marched up to  clam hole nd said ,
aww .
the clouds were gettng darker ad darker an a chlly wind was whipping css the countryside .
milo was several miles from he beach caught in the sme storm .
he go a lttle wet nd he flt awully lonesme without otis , bt at least h was safe .
te ide came in so fast that the rock otis hd ben sitting on was completely srronded by water .
a , he 'd never be able to swim t shore .
and the water wa grwing hiher .
now the water as up to is pws .
he 'd hve to ty to swim .
he took a deep breath , but just when he was ready to dive n ...
oh  not again , the ea urtle gugled .
every time te ide come in some fool gets stuck out here .
ot s n't sure what this turtl wanted .
well , now you kw .
now  just stay on the sore , where you belng , e turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
next time the tide omes in , i ll have to rescue somebody else .
yu saved mie .
n , said otis , i dd n't know that .
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otis calld u , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
 hve n't got tie , otis sid , sensig this fox was n't go a be any hlp .
how can you e a dg ?
otis wa outraged .
ha !
he marveled at this road made of wod and iron nd decidd to follow the road and see where it would tak him .
t could 've run right over me .
but milo was determined .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm not sure cats know how to bound , milo sid .
bound and leap , lke a zephyr set fre .
boun and , of course , leap .
it just does n't ook right when i do it .
frolic with m , friend

i 'm frolicking .
i ' frolicking .
you se ?
ahem .
u can sto frolicking now  the deer cooed .
i think i 'm a little tuckee out , mio said .
yes , it is possible to over-frolic , the deer murmured .
and the deer took lo to a soft , mossy spot n the frest floor .
and milo was asleep withn moments .
he ha trailed ilo from the deadwood swamp to the ox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept goin , maybe he 'd finally find the riend he missed so much .
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveig .
as evening was fallig ,
milo decided the safest place to sped the night would be in a tree .
and what are you doing up hee ?
hidin from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this est beong to ou ?
yes , and it 's not jut any nest , i 'll ave yu know .
i 'm the night bird , and that is a drming nest .
what do yu mean ?
mlo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone sleeping ther will hve his sleep flooded with dream , the bid said .
bt it 's a safe place , safe from thse screch owls .

mrs. white : dear dr. luther ...
narrator :
in winter , endless darkness s brighened by the frisky danc of the nothern lihts .
and 30 belw is the norm .
it 's ovely weaher or polar bear fmilies .
on hundred and fify thousand yars ago some brown bears moved noth and raually adapted .
beause tey 're built for the arctic poar bears can not thrive anywhere else .
polar bears have always hunted from floating platforms of sea ice .
hat 's why the arctic is warming twi as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ce covered 25 percent more ocean ta it does now .
if the currnt trend continues the arctic ocean could be fre of sea ice each summe by the year 2050 .
eve if we  n't sop ths oss , we can slow it down .
mos arctic glaciers are melting faster than ever before .
the distance etween ice packs is growing .
nowaday , a polar ber n search o sea ce often has further to go .
some cbs do survive especially if th moter is a lever scavener .
so do the inuit people like simon qaanirq .
simon :
polar bears surrise us in camp .
ut now the ancent weather patterns have hanged .
our grandfathrs fed their families well .
my family as always depnded on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
my riend adam raetch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animals .
hese dedicated mohers pt over two year ito aising their young .
walrus moms spend even longer .
they dive down from rafts of ice whch drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of their favorite treat .
mothers teach their youg survival skills such as sarin off intruders .
oe morn set me a ver clear messae :
they 're tesing each other 's skills .
this ater is literally a cold as ice .
the salt kep t from freezig .
down here , there s only one exit and it 's pretty scary thiking you could be trapped .
each spring in aaka large herds of caribou s out on a long jurney .
kasen :
w re gon n do tis trip to se what the caribou mothers go through and to se this mgration from their perspective .
leanne :
tes newlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to thei birthin grounds .
yeah , just over thee ...
karsten :
this is climate change sloing down the herd .
sme of these calves are just a week or wo old , and hey 're easy pickings fo bears an wolve .
this is the place where the calves have their est chance to srvive .
these bug are potentially deadl to these caribou .
to ge away .
caribou others are havig a tough time as the arctic arms .
but pola bar mothers fce an even greater strugge .
my name is bjorne kvenmo ad i 'm captain of this ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 pola ars in he wold and most of them are camera-sy .
one bear was especially hlpful .
it 's hd to keep up when you 're only 3 months old .
next year we 'e coming back with stronger cases .
narrator :
bers nearly aways aoid people ich made filmng them next to impossible .
then the team got lucky .
or five days , she never left their boat .
beause te sun never sets in the umer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry mles prefer seal bu in a pinch , hey have always gone after defenseless cubs .
he mothe seemed to pick up th scent of a male .
we did n't know why she was aitated .
we finaly spotted  male quite a ways off zeroing n on the mothe and her cbs .
now that seals ar so hard to catch , staring males might be targeting cubs more oten .
but nxt time things could be muc different .
plafl ubs an really work up an appetite .
bjorne :
when yo wnt to grab  bite to eat up hre timing is everything .
the cubs finish everything on their plate but te scen of resh seal meat attracts ttention 
but the male picks up the family 's scent again .
we watch heplessly as th male sneaks up .
the male keeps gainng on the amiy .
then the mother trns to face him ... ... slowing him down just long enough or e fightened cubs o ecape .
at the mome of truth , the mother sent a very cer messae 
you can get to my cubs if you want but you 'll have to kill me first .
narrator :
but she 's powerless to sve t habitat they need t survve .
thre are few truly wid places eft and noe so mjestic as this .
bt the arctic is warmig fastr than it has for thousands of years and loing its dazzlng crw of ie .
the mothers here nurtue thir youg so lvingly .
perhps hey can inspre us to protect their ome with that same care .

he 's the king 's own brother , bt he 's as bad as the king is good .

thank you .
its author was a youtfu albert einstein .
it 's the mos faous equation in the world :
all aboard !
but while we 'e l heard of einstein 's bi idea , very few of us knw what it men .
w 've only got sausage and ches tonight .
orry , no .
but first ...
dnner !
mm ?
fod , then talk .
the god were not aughing at instein 
he 'd united in on suing insigt the work of many who had come befoe him ...
i the early 19th century , cietists did nt thin in trms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature wold begin to change all that .
yong michael faaday hated his job .
he was uneducated , the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to ecome a bokbinder 's apprentice .
but fraday craved one thing .
all of hs free time and his meager wages were poured ito his self-education .
can i pass , pas ?
can i pass ?
of curse , of course ..
pass , pass .
ths ay to a btter lif .
in e early 1800s , science was the pursuit of gntlem , somethng faraday was clearly not .
he had a rudimntary education , he ' read widel , he d gone to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tckets to hear sir humphry davy , the most promient chemist of te age .
nineteenth-century scientists ere the pop stars of their day .
their lectures were hugely popuar .
ickts ere hard to come b , and davy rveled in his statu 
they 're waiting 
mtals ... unknown , that is , until i isolated otassium from molte potash and sodium , as i showed you ast time , frm common sat .
hl e be part of the great cicle tha is your work and love .
my desire , sir  is to escape from trade , hich i find vicious and selfish , and t ecome a servat of science , whch , i imagie , makes its pursuers amiable nd lberal .
reall ?
well , i shall leav it to the exprience of a few years to set you right on that score .
look , i have n' anything at the momen .
faraday was dtemined o break free from his daily toil .
nwman ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhaps ith gd and faraday in charge o the cheicals , you and i will be safe in our place of work .
jst stck to our j and do as you 're told and you 'll be fie , farada .
faraday became the laboratory assistant , eagerly absorbing every crap f knwledge that dav deigned t impart .
the big exciement of the day was electricity .
anothe chare , newman .
but no one eally understod what ths strang force of electrcity wa .
the academic estblishment at the time thought tht electricity was , you know , like  fluid flowing through a pipe , pushing its way along .
but in 1821 , a danish researcr showed that hen you pass an electric current through a wire and place a compass near it , it deflected the neele at right angles .
faraday , come loo at this 
perhaps you can work it out .
oersted 's reporte an amazing fining .
now , that is rmarkble .
but if the electrica force s fowing through the wire , why doe the needle not move in the same direcio , parallel to the re ?
again , newman 
what ?
perhaps soe sot o electrical force is emanatig outwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you that at the university of cambridge , electricity flows through a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be what they tch at cambridg , but it does 't explain what 's happening before our eyes 
no , now  lt 's just get on .
it was a fascination inspired by is religion .
for him , h roblem was a wy to unerstand god 's hidden ysteries .
tere is a small , amost persecuted goup in ondon clled the sademanians .
thy were a religious ..
faraday was a member of that group .
that if you opeed p on little part of it , you could see how everything as cnneted .
faraday ws ifferent from anyod else .
b ethodically plaing a compass all around n electrified wire ,
faraday strted to otice  pattern .
and then he imagined that a mgnet had similar lines emerging fr it and that those lies would get caught up in tis flow 
i 'm saking , newman .
underneath , i m shaking .
yes .
this is the experiment of te century .
scale up the magnets and the wies , make tem rely big , attach heavy weighs to them and hey 'll be dragged along .
althugh he id n't reaize it at the time ,
the chemicals in the batter ad been trnsformed into electricity in the wre , wich had combine wth the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these variou forces there was a common energy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston make of all this 
h s written to me ad assures me that he 's taken no ffense , and he acknowledges that what i published was ntrely my own work .
in fact , he is still veemently opposed to you being lcted a member of the society .
and what do you think ?
fraday , my dear boy , you have my vote .
t 's the sience that counts .
so , tell m , how does this wire of yurs spin rund its magnet ?
there seems to e a electromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i see a wirling array of lines of force spinning out of the eletrified wir like  spiraling web .
but inisible lies of forc ...
 's all a bit vague , is n't it ?
fraday , ight i have a word n private ?
listen , faraday , let 's stop this nonense .
i want yo to take down your ballot paper from the notice board .
sir humhry , i ee no reason t tke it down .
it i they ho put the paper up .
i will not take it down .
my father and uncle waned to make their fortune by bringig electric light to the reets of germany .
from an early age , i loved t look at machines , undertand how things wok .
he 's going to kil himself .
i experienced a mirale when my father showe me a compss 
there had to be omething behind objects that lay deeply hiden .
i had my own .
on yur feet !
it 's pretty much the same t me whichever way they run , herr professor .
instein s teachers tried to dum ino him , as faraday hd shown , that energy could be converted from one form into anothr .
they also believed that al foms of energy had alredy been discovred .
einstein as goig to pro them wrng .
deep in th heart of matter .
a hundred years before einstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
te french reolution as just around the corner .
and they felt at one of the first tass that lay ahad of hem was o rationalize and to clssfy every single kind of atter so they could see how it all interacted togeher .
antoine lavoisier , a wealthy , arstocratic youn man , decided to tak up this task , to see if there was some basic connection between al te stuff of everyday lie :
all th different substances in the world .
his meticlou , eve obsessive attetion to detil ...
was lso to be his downfall .
your pecse observatins commend you as a ld of scientific criosty 
most unusual .
for the lst five weeks , i have taken nothing bu mik .
i would rather die than fast on mil or five weeks !
mosieur , with te greatest f espect to a memer of te roal aademy of cience , your gut must think you throat has been slit 
how dre you insult the count ?
do n't frget what th cont offers .. not jst marriage , but think of how you will be ntroduced to all the salons .
you will be the toast of pris .
do you relly plan t mary d'amerval ?
then i must ontrive to save you .
lavoisier was n't a sientit by profession .
he was he hd of ax enforemnt in paris .
but his taxes on th simpe things in lfe ...
did ot endear him to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidious young man id still allow himslf the ccasional act of pasion .
in 1771 , lavoisier mrried marie anne paulze , the daughter o his clleague in the tax office .
thus he saved her , as he had promisd , from an arranged arriage to a count 40 years her eder .
allow me to show you something .
what will happn if i take a bar of copper or iron and leave it outside in the rain for months on end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lvoisier ?
the metals ...
is this a veral examination prior to an examination prper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let me pess ou further .
hmm ?
every last ctizen in france of snsible ae knows that when a etal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lter and eventually diappears .
ah , but ..
i ave ot finishe .
contain yourself , sir .
there is more .
in a ecently published pamphlet by a brilliant young cemit ,
antoine lvoisier demonstrates that the iron cmbines with he air .
it , in fact , becomes heavier .
she learned engish so hat she could ranslat cntemporary scietfic works .
monieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheek man .
mesieurs .. it is my great ambition to demonstrate that atu is a losed system , tha in any transformation , no amount of matter , no mass i ever lost nd none is gained .
oer here , please .
from this end we cool th steam but  interestingly , we collect less watr han we started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of waer .
now , when we combine thee tw increases ..
te new ight of the iron brrel and th gas we have olleced ...
they re exactly equal to the eight of he lost water .
so what he had done is get the oxyen to stick to th inside of a red-hot ion rifle brrel .
now , tha lft te hydrogen , what he called combuible air , and that was just floating arud as a gas .
in the next few moths i hope to demontrat that  can recombine this combusible ar with vital air and trasfrm them both bck nto water .
i will re-create exacly the same amount of water that was lost here in this process .
it is my hoe to complet the cycle ...
but to poe this , he had to perform thousands of eperients , and e had to do th masurements with ncredible accuracy .
hat 's where his great wealth from bein a tax colletor came n .
antoie .
i 'm sorry .
te academy asked you to assess his desgns .
oh , antone , have you forotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to pedl .
monsieur 
i have invented a dvic which projecs an iage of the sbstance of fire onto a sreen .
my device renders the subtnce of fire viible .
have you colecte it , this substance of fire ?
i am not give to onjeture , monsiur .
no , no .
if ou wll you excuse me .
 am extremely busy today .
thank you .
so that s all ?
the kin 's cientific despot ha decreed tat your invention does not onfrm o the version of he truth as laid down by the acadmy .
lavoisir .
he taks aout facts , he worships the truth .
liten t me , my fiend .
they are all the same , the royal academies ..
they insult the liberty of the mnd .
tey hink thy are the sole arbitrs of geniu 
they re rotten to the co ...
do n't worry .
in my next pamphlet i will xpose this perecutr of yours .
the crowning glory of this ous was thir remarkale use of atic electrcity to cause oxygen and yrogen to recomin back into waer .
to th rench revoutionaris of 1790 ,
he was denounced by a faled cientist turned radical journalist ,
lavoisie !
and all the rubble , it wold add up to the exact sameeiht as the original cty and he air around it before .
a century later , ll of atue had been lassified ito tw great domains .
there was energy ... the orces that anmated objects ;
and ther was mass ...
the whole o 19thcentury science reted o these two mighty pillars .
the laws that governe one did not apply to the other .
but young , newly enrolled physis sudent albert einstein did n't lik las .
extremely well , her einstein .
all te bette for seeng you have escaped te pyics laboratory with you ife .
that 's abut all you ever do .
it 's etting a little stuffy in here , frulen maric .
woul you care to take a walk with me ?
peraps you ' like me to tell you what you have mssed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just incredible determination .
e know from hs letters that einstein , evn from the age of 16 , was literally obsessed with the nature of light .
everyone he could speak to ...
what ?
a beam f light ?
by what mhod d you propoe to rid on this beam of ligh ?
the metho is not imortant .
let us just iagine we two are young ...
ridicue you ?
 merey want you to help me to understad .
what woud w see , do yo think ...
with light he would invent the unverse and find a hidden pathway that wuld unite energy ad mass .
it tans for celrta ...
long bfore the 19th centur , cietists had computed te speed of light , but no one kew what lght actually as .
invisible lin tht can emanate from electricity in a wire , from a magne or ... even from th sun .
for it is my contentin that lih tsel is jst one form of these vibrating lies of eletromagnetim .
maxwll and the agig faraday became close friends .
james , forgive me .
do n' get old .
oh , i ' fine 
oh , yes  yes 
splenid .
now , as that magnetic charge moves , it creats a little piec of electrcity .
electricity .
electriity and magnetism are interwoven , like a .. a never-ending braid .
so it is always pulsng forward .
michael 
670 milion miles per ur .
that is the speed of light !
wll  that means you wer rigt all aong .
maxwell had prove faraday righ .
we have lectures in half an hou .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwl and think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they sid you culd nee catch up to a beam of ligh .
even if you were traveling at 670 milion miles an hour , ou would still see ligh squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an our .
yes .
you see how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave ae travling at the same speed .
but relative to er , it just sits there .
so is light like th ?
common sense wuld say that if you caug p to a lgh eam , there would be a wave o ligh jut sitting here .
maybe it wold e shimring , a it of electrict and a bit of magnetism .
so if she was traveling alongside the light ave , it wold n't be moving .
it would be sttic .
bu mawell says you ca n't have static light .
maybe maxwell is wrong .
the light trvels from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
that does n't mak sense .
einstein wa about to enter a surreal uniese where energy , mass and th speed of lih intermingle i a way no on had ever suspectd .
long before the french revoltion , scintists were not sure how to quantiy motion 
du câtelet 's translation is stll the standard text in france oday .
muse , my memory cause ...
for what offence he queen o heave began
t persecute s brave , so just a man !
only the othr night ,
i fear , however , that my wi is nly a curiosity to others .
if only my nd were permitted opportunity .
my deaest émilie .
use them bot and the world will fal at your feet .
no ...
in one sense , she is a woman utterly out of her tu time and place .
du hâtelet marrie a general i he french arm at age 19 and ad three hldrn .
she ran a busy household , all the hil pusuing her passion for scece .
she as 23 wen she discoered advanced mathematics 
he enthuiastically took lessons frm one of the gratet mathmticians of the day ,
e was an expert on newtn , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they ha a brief affair .
a fierce critic of the king an the catholic churh ,
voltaire had been in prison twice and exiled to engla , where he becae enthralled by the ideas of newton .
du hâtelet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to pled voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of ail .
and it is also rue tha émilie d châtelet did hav several affairs of a fleeting naure 
ravo !
se created an insttution to rvl that of frace 's royal adeies of sciences .
ah , monsier ..
you are oung .
i hoe that soon you will udge me for my wn merits , or lack of them , but do not look upon me as an appenge to this great genel or that renowned cholar .
i am in m own right  whole person , respnsible to myself alone for ll that i am , all that i say .. all that i do 
du châtelet learned from the brilliant mn around her , bu she quickly developed ideas of her own .
much to the horrr o her mentor , he evn dared to uspect tat there was a flaw in the great sir isaac newton 's thinking .
newton stated that the energy of a object , the fore ih whic it colided with another object , could very simply b accounted for by its mass ims ts velocity .
he propose tht moving objets had a kind of inner spirit .
if you sa a garn is four square , yo mean that it mght be built up by our slabs long ne edge and four along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 
this huge multipliation , tis buildng up by squares , is smthig you find in nature all the time .
it is a return to the old ways !
it is the occult 
so ll eibni is asking i , where does all his force come from ?

about yur promotion .
i 'm sory 
all will e fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all ill be fn .
there really is a very harming , but kind of a self-centered streak to eistein .
f the rest of the world fits in around him , tat 's fine , if they ca n't , t does n't boher him .
i 'l tell you wat is truly mystious :
the matematics are fine , if a little unonvenional , bu his oly works for big systems .
i disagree .
here we go ...
what would happen if on applied those formulae to elctromgnetic radiation ?
albert , ou ca n't just take ne bit of physics and pply it with proper reard to a comltely dfferent rea .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linages , the big theoies , but would 't things be bette all round if you just got gong in sme smll area ?
spoken like a true bourgeois .
they had cornerd the question of ligt frm every possible angle .
a einstein an besso were ruminating on hw much time it would take light to reach them from clocks t different dstances ,
thank yo .
wat einstein did was compleely turn the proble on ts head 
that light would always move away from you at 670 mili miles an hur , ven if you  too , were traveling really fast .
hs extraordinary insight is that time ... as you approach the sped of light , time itse will slow down .
it 's a monumental sift in how we see the word .
you see , befor ten people had assumed hat time wa like a wristwach on god 's hand , tat it beat a a steady rate throughout the universe , no matter were you wee .
that the tick , tick , tck o this wristwatch was atualy th click , lic , click
of electricity turnin into antism turning into electricity .
it starts with his publiation of a paper on how o work out the true size of toms .
two months laer is th publication of his aper on the nature f light ...
that 's what wil earn him he nobel pize 
in it insein sets out his theory of light , time and space .
t was the teory of special relativi .
in einstein 's ne world  the one true constant was no tme or even space , but light .
n one lst great 1905 pper  h would propose an even deeper unity .
t has to go somewhere .
from ur point of vie  the train ctully gets heavier ;
it 's an ncredible idea .
even einstein s amazed by it .
 think i have found a connecion between energy and mass .
 i am right , hen nergy and mass are not absolute .
they can be convertd into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 per for publiaion .
in three page he simly stated tat energy an mss were conneted by the square of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the ulmination of his ten-year jurney into light .
there is a deep uniy between enrgy  matter and light .
ou multily that by itelf an you et 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year i science ends in silenc .
te artiles are published to resoundng .
i tink the ods are lauhing t me .
or our years einsei swered each inqury dutifully , trying o xplain his difficult , complex ideas to a confused physics community .
here are these univere-chaging apers crcling around , ad the world is ... struggling to come to terms with them .
luckil it hapened to be the most importan living physicist .
he ha set his assitat .
after four yers of aitin , he is appointed professor of physcs at zurich university .
from there his caeer is eteoric .
n 1919 he divorced mileva and married his cousin .
his fam led o numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 bcame the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vast reseves of nergy locked deep inside the atom .
but he had n't banked n the second world ar and th geni of  jewih woma in hitler 's germany .
28-year-old austrian lise meiter was painfull shy .
desit er anxiety , the young doctor of physics arrivd in berln determine to pusue a career in the exciting new field of radioactivity .
german universties dd not employ female graduats .
otto hahn .
ys , he suggestd that i seak with you 
i think i could realy help with the physical analysis .
es , yes ..
and the mathematcs .
sudying radioacti atms has become so much a collaboration between emistry and physics these days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
at his time , not a lot was knwn about the atom .
but then ... n what are called radoactive etals , thing like radiu ad uranium ..
the nucleus itelf seemed to b unstble , leaking ut energy and paricles .
the mas of a nucleus rnin into energy .
he was given a laboraory .
she was forced to ork in a wood shop .
i see you have n't set your hair on fir .
good day , herr hahn .
oo day .
ys , wre woul we chemists be without the stadying hand of te physicist ?
oh ?
ys , eith .
yes , el , i hav , m ... sked her t marry me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr hah , congratulation .
i 'm very pleased for you .
very pleased .
lise metnr was warm-hearted by nature .
she ad many rinds and she may have wanted to have a closer relatinship with ott .
the 1920s nd '30 were the golden age of nuclear research .
meitner and hahn were leading the race to see if even igger nuclei could be created b dding mre neutrs .
so .. the aom , retty familiar :
the nucleus , made u of potons .. and neutrons .
now , the largst nucleus tat we know is th of th uranium ao .
the ewess endanges ou intitute .
h was hunded out of gerany in 1933 .
sh was able to stay becaue she was austrian .
what is it 
wat 's happened 
i , u ...
we 'e speaking tomrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish u 
hahn , who was known for is anti-nazi views  did his best to protect e , at lest initilly .
not ow , i ' too busy .
we have to prtect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbien to leave germany .
lise ..
horlein demands that you leave .
you ca n' trow her out .
holein says you should not come into the institute anymre .
well , i have to wrte up the thorium irradiaton toorrow , so i have to come in .
you 've give up .
when it became clear tht mitner would be dismssed ad probably arrested , physiciss al around europe wrote etters invting her to conferencs , giving he an excuse to leave germany .
in jly of 1938 , a utch colleague traveled to berlin and illegal took lise bck with him on a tran to holland .
he had lost everything ...
he home , her position , her bks , her salary , her pension , ven her native language .
sh had been cut off from er work ut at the time when she was leaing the field and was on the brnk of a major scientific discovery .
no matter what privations she suffered 
aun ?
lie , how are you ,  dear ?
hmm , i need yor help .
back in belin , hahn was gettig strange results .
he found no evidence to suggest tat bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size .
frm afar , she was startig to suspect tha someting vry dfferent was appening in their experiment .
hahn and strassma are getting some strage results with the uranium work .
rlly ?
a cuple of months ago , han told me tat they were finding radium amongst te ranium products .
and now e writes to me and tells me that it 's not radium , i 's arium 
but that 's evn smallr .
it is at least possibl hat baium is being produced 
so hahn stil needs yu to inerpret te dta .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done what you told him to 
it turns out that a big nuceus like uranium is jus like that .
now for four years  meitner and hahn and ll other physicists had thought that if yu pump more neutrons into this nucleus , it 'll jus get bigger and heavier .
realized this uceus might just get so ig that i would split in two .
if the nuceus is so big that it has trouble staying togeter , then could n' just a little , tiny jog from a eutron ...
ho mu energy ?
but someting has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no , o ... you 've plit th atom .
of course , in the laboratoy we 're talking about tiny amounts of uranium and orrespodingly iny amouts of energy .
but the point is tat the mount of energy releasd wa relatively large ad that came from the mass of the urnium itself .
meitner and frisch publishd th discvery of what they called nclear fision
to great acclim .
but betrayal wited them 
ah aintained it was he nd not meitnr wh d discovered nuclear fissio .
all my scientic past also be taken fom m ?
and why is it hpening ?
she 'd only broen apart a handful of atoms , but that ws enough 
in 1942 , an intense effort to buld an atom bomb was begun .
al over america , secret installations sprang up uer the code name th manhattan prjct .
she refused to have nything o do ith the atomic bb .
but rober frisch was different 
vast amouns of energy , in the form of electromagnetic radiation , were release from a few pounds o uranium and plutonium .
today , young phyiists carry on einstein 's quest .
evr since is bith ,
e = m.c2 has ben used to delve into the epths of time , to answer the biggest questin of all ..
in the first moments of creation , the universe was this immensely dense , imesely concentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed apart and xpaded , huge amounts of enery , or e ,
it became the paticles and atoms and it eventually formed the first stars .
it come out as energy .
te whle proces actully creates lif itself .
eentually  a massive star dies , te debris floats aroud , clustes together , gets pulled into the orbits of another star nd becomes a planet .
buildng n the work o scientists throug the ages , new generation are searching for answs .
as einstein himself knew , the jouney of discovery is somtimes painful , smetis joyful .
it is as old as human curiosity isef and never , evr end .

baseball is for the people who support it .
from nw ork , sir ?
and two , is i posble to talk to hem ?
originally , man worshipped the sun , th moon , stone , rees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child ill run to its paent so will a man turn for omfort to a belief in anges .
an when this blief takes te orm of ctual conversation with angels what is our professional opinion ?
r. commissiner .
es ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustace danorth , trinity church .
rabbi allen han , temple israe .
how do you do ?
father o'houlihn , church of our lady , queen of the agels 
gentlen , just ke yourseles comfrable .
mr. commssioner ?
well , what do you thnk ?
do you suppose tere might be angels ?
rigt to left .
to deny the xitence of angels is t deny the word of th holy bible which is speciic on the subject .
from the ancient hebrw ext , we ave the ords beei elohim the sons of god .
thank you , rabbi .
 was an ngel who uided the children of isael to th promised land .
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear hm and deliveeth them .
seeing s how there are coveys of angels flittin through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new tetaments i do n't ee ho i can get out of saying i believ in them .
i imagine the comissner does too .
oh , please , just leave me out of ths .
mr. commissioner ?
is it likel one of your angels or a group of ngels wod lend support to  man like guffy mcgoven ?
is it possible that angels would aid and cofort such a man ?

the cure for cancer has been discovere 
the cure for virtually ery fom of chrnic disase ws dicovered even earlier , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
altough his discoeries were adhered to by hitle nd the nazi party ,
dr. geson 's amily ad the ultmate price .
dr. gson 's seven siblings perished in th holocaus .
dr. gerson 's unprecedented gift of healing the hopelss live on .

these senes before your ees woud be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air moves north nd airorne transport of dioxins eventually reaches the once prstine arctic .
arcti peoples are showing majr health problems , from bioaccumulation of ioxns .
and from ther , the poisons travel up the food hain to polar bears , seals and whales , ad then to people .
one thousandth of one millionth of a gram of dioxin can cause harm to the body .
tres , the very living orgnisms that clean the air and prduce the ogen we breathe , are sliced off at the groud wth the most careess abandon if there is a limitelss supply .
at one point , it had been said that a tre squirel could jump from tree to tree follwing the hardwood with coniferous forest belts from the east coast to te west coast .
thy do not develop special functions .
as a boy in germany , in the late 1800 's ,
day y day , he aied isight n the retionships between plants and the nutrients they ganed from he so .
unde a icroscope , active cells known s chlroplasts  busily undertake the process of manufcturin chlrphyll and the miraculous process of photosyntheis begins .
these live cells and enzymes in vegetation are the nucleus of wha we eed to inge to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy oe .
max gerson sufferd from severe and epeated migraine heaaches , leaving him essentialy uable to fnction for days .
after three years of exprimentig ,
not nly had the migrin been relieved , but a skin uberuosis also disappeared .
446 of the 450 ptients recovered .
dr. gerson and his wife gretcen had thee aughters :
jnna , gertrd and the youngest  carlotte .
of all the children , charlott took a secial interest in her father 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had sread throughot euope .
when r. scweitzer ws 75 ear old , he came to d. gerson with diabetes and was aso cred .
lighting up the switchboards a abc non-top 
out of ctrol !
unbelevble !
and the epper neey ancance ill of 1946 , document no .
now maried  she had a son , hoad , nd a daughter , peggy .
charott encouaged late her father to publish his first book in 1958 :
at the time of his death , in 1959 ,
the files have been preserved by hs daughter charlotte wo is now in her eighties .
carlott cries on the work of her fahe trough th estblishment of the
we have ome letters here from albert schweitzer ... and the had a ery active correspondence , my father , dr. gerson and albert scheitzr , and his amily were atients .
and he also expressed , in this lettr , he expresd his admiration of th specifc ancer research that dr. gerson did .
of coure , all the letters are in german and i 'm trying to translat some .
as well as the remarkble eslts ha he saw , not only with cane patients , but with his wife , who had tuberculosi , and their dauhter , who had a very undecipherable skin dsease .
laws in virtully all the united sttes prohibi any other tretmnt for cancer other than raiation , chemotheapy and sugery .
on this particular day , two medical doctors from czechosovaki , consult with anita wilson , who is eecutive diector , about the posibilities of openn a hopital n czechoslovakia .
... you boost the immune sysem , you rid the body of those years and years of acumulated toxins from the way we live ...
not a day goes by that we o n' hear something from a atient or a ysician , or a goup of people peraps interested in stating a clinic or a support group 
in hig school i was in one of those dieer anorexic and ulimi ... bulimia whe i wa nt really written abot .
they finally gav me a cat scan .
i had a fight for that .
a year later , tht sam tumor , the one that they thougt cold e a metasasis , was one .
when i was 16 years old , my fac hit the widshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
after being on the therapy for about  year , i noticed one day hen i was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bone in the rigt side of my nose for the first tim .
another staff member , susan brant , charlotte gerson 's niece , t one time , was diagnosed ith an inoperable cervicl cancer .
 did the herapy 19 years ago , and so ,
i cn sit here ad say that i am a success .
 w dignosed with postate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and the bopsy .
the deermined i had three ectons of cancer , malignant cancer in th prostate and they wnted to take the prstate out the ext day .
i talked wih gerson institute and with the hospital in exico , and talked with the doctors and te patients .
after three months , i found that i was losing weight redily , ost 27 pouds , nd after 18 months y psa shoed 0.06 , which to me was the end of the treatment .
i was ured , the octor thouht  was great , he said i had a better psa than he di .

a partiular type juicing mehod must be utilized , however , implementing a grind and press device 
when juice is rnk , it can ener the bloodstream almost as fast as alohol 
this jicer wa originally design in the 1930 's by a sientific researcher , named dr. norman walker .
an enormous amount of ntrition can be pured in a glass of juce in minute and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of th patient .
as you can see , a entire da with the juices is equivalent to n enrmous amount of food , wich eghts in a little over 20 punds a day .
but ust eaing different is not enough to hal a seriously ll paent .
uriion i only half of he equation .
resolving the acumulated toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slo , relentles .
realizing this , harlotte gerson inclued a chapter about it in a book about te gerson therpy , that undrlne , in layman 's terms , the rinciples of the gerson therapy .
 typial example of daily toxic ingesion or precurso hit be when you get in your automobil prior of ven starting the egine , you have already ineted dioxins

yu are nundaed with hits .
the soap and shampoo are just the start , hwver , of what wil be absorbed through your skin once you turn on the bath tbe fauce , which wil povide chlorinated and fluoridated water to hlp you get clean .
chlorine and fluorine help desroy the thyoid gland .
the toilet set has been sanitize for your protection .
but what dos that men ?
th toilet paper will also smear chemicals from solvet to dyes into yor bloodstream .
at the bthrom sink , you may atually drink the cloriated water from  cheaply manufctured plastic cup , that allows erious toxins from the plastic itself into the water .

as we finall urn off the lgt to sleep , electroagnetic fields from the clock next to your head will almost impercetibly influence the slumbe and dreams on hopes to have 
even the film to make this movie uses extreely poisonous chemicals in its manufacture and processing .
as ridiculous as thi scenario may sound , it is one more hit for your body to fight .
he god news is that most of these toxins can be removed with strct adherence to the geon therapy .
but how is this ully accomplishe 
and ths is where the coffee comes into play .
nless it ets some help .
when coffee eemas are utilized in conjuctio with juice drinking it is detoxifican at its finest .
three tablespoons of dip ground coffee are dropped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is turned down .
once the cofee is done , it is strained ino a measuring cup .
additnal water may be aded t make up o water lost in stea in making the coffee .
once the coffee cools to body temperature t is poured into the enema bucket .
tht time , the plastic stoer at the en of the hos is sli back o relese the air n the end of the tube .
simultaneously , the lver in turn excretes poisons into the colon for expulsion .
hundreds of holisc physiians , in the .s and aound the old , ave been traied by chrlte in the gerson institute .
unbelievably , it is lleal in the united states to treat an cure a diseased ptient in a hospital with geso heapy .
because charlotte resides in sothern california , it 's easy to her for drive regularly to advise and ecourage te edless numbers of patiets tat arrive at the hospital in tijuana , mexico 
under the care of a staff of physicians and utritionss , most patients who came in with inoprabe cancers and wih no hope of recovery , leve within 1 to 4 weeks to continu the treatment t home .
after only 2 weks on the herapy ,
i ind after the pathologist reort , that i 'm free from cancer nw 
do you have hildren ?
it has saved my life .
i ave a primary peitoneal cancer .
i was in alska , where i m from an i ws diagnosed wit a ...

now seveal doctors have told me ta .

ever since ...
to charlotte , this day was a tical and norml one .
always seking new ways to cheer up , empoer and restore hope t the pposed hopeless ,
withi the pges of each boolet are personal biogaphies and the medical recrds of rcoveries .

my dad had old  about the gerson terapy .
y daddy told e about ths , nd during the research , i found out that th best way to cure yourself is to do it the healthy way .
no put more poisons nto your body that woul kill you .
and tht wht chemo did ... it kills your body , the good cell and te bd cells .
when i go dow to ucla , i too did all my blood work and my mris to chek , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ca n't believe ou re one of my cancer patients.
that just really made me feel good every time  went in there .
i did not look like a normal cancer patient .
to me , i have charlotte and the erson therp to hnk for tat , beause ..
i truy , truly in my hart , just d n't think i 'd be hre .
when i ws diagnose with cancer 
i knew of three othr ladies tht had the same cancer i had .
i was 12 years old when my om wa diagnsed with cancer .
sh would wake me up like 2 in the morning and sy : lets o to walmat.
i  teve , ebbie 's hsan .
when i frs cme into debbi 's ie , t was several years ago , and when we frst met , i as so tuched ...
there is fo charlott the reluctance to get emoionaly attached to any single case  since there have been thousands , but ocasinally , a phne all would leave her effervescent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cncer seen only n children 
it was discovred that the ung was oo ridden wi cancer .
nd mre horifying still was the revelation that he cancr had made it all the way to the right camber o her heart .
the surgen than opened r ternum ad stated with removing the tumors from er lungs .
from tere , e moved to her heart and an open-heart surgery removed the tumor rom the right heart chamber .
again and again , with  vengeance .
now , even her liver was invaded by cancer .
) the dctor sid ,  
) childen told us that se is not gon n be ale o ahm ... te cancer is back n he is not gon na make it .
we went back home and then  i think i was january or smething  we were down , at the erson , and ahm .. and w were oig the diet there for about 2 or 3 eeks , i think .
) i had come down thre sick myself ... ?
 had regular disinfections al the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went bak home and we 've been doing the treatment for two years , abot .
from that point on , hope rurned , and lfe began to change or the entire family .
even he dg was happy again .
but the isons are no being excreted and her bod is building itself bac u wth owerfl ezymes and the nutrint fores .
but whee stephanie ' orthdox medical doctrs had only given her 6 months to live two years ao , she has now astounded them , and of course , confounded them .
 fel very healthy , ad stonger and much btter than i dd 
chrlotte oberved that they run around playing nd enjoyig life , as though the scourge of cancer had never visited this resilient child .
there are also notoxic , on-pharmaceutcal supplemens called biologials , that are utilized i a greter or lesser measure , depending upon the patient 's condition .
one of the mos important o these is a natural potasiu , mix of potassium gluconate , acetate , phosphate n equal amounts , tht d. gersn put togeher aftr doin nearly 300 experiments .
this is extremely beneficial t rstorin the potassium in the body 's cells system that was lost in most people on relenting use  inorganic sdium , such as found in table salt and hidde within verything , from proessed foods to toothpaste .
table salt is a poison .
the use of inorganic sodium causes displacemen of potassium found aturally in human cells , leavig them vulnerable to attack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's ptassium suplemet is dissolved n a qarter of distiled waer and icorporaed in small aounts to the juices .
it 's  pleasure to show you around .
the preed and grond flax eeds , essentially he leftves , re used for eilizer and animal food .
a true miracle oi .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did n the past , really understood the alu of flax oil .
that was 't anyhing that ...
atually , they ducated us more thn we could even educate them on te value and the benefis of how flax oil eally helped the modalities .
the use of these natural , holistic supplements on the eron herapy is part of customizain to the secific degeneative ondtions of the atient .
none in nd of themselves can , for example , cre a caner , but they can sometimes fortif gerson 's theapies effetiveness .
when it omes to helping the body recover , whether rom a common cold or ancer , today , ver half the medical visits n he u.s. and canada are to alternaive therapies , despite the efficcy .
and in the u.s. especially , t is estimated that our unerstanding and acceptance o holistic medicine is still 75 years bhind te rest of te worl .
medically , we trail many hird world cotries .
it is imperative that patients have access to such ood choics .
the organic fod market has increased almost 20 % nnually for the past 7 years , minly as th reult of the economic law o supply and demand .
mass-produced commercially grown frut and vegetaes produced wth cheicals a spras are fetilized with only three inerals :
but the lant , like the human body , eally needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fetilizatio process of commercially gown crops , the plants wee sick and must be kept on lie support with more toxic chemicals until arket 
this process s now rated in the cosumer , in implified terms .
i know that in te past eople had diffeent prospectives of ht was truy organic , and we old have some growers come in and say well  hei grows are orgnic bu basicall just by virtue of neglect .
so tht set fort a se of rules and regulations such that anbody who did wan t become organic would truly be in te same plain fild and would have to abide b te same sets of rules .
we have found tha the atributes of truly doing a crifie organi is eneficial not only for te pople , but aso for te ground , etc .
so , that 's somehng tat we trly look forwad to expand upon and to provide for th local community , and also for the people hroghout the united state nd world wide .
by popular deman , undoubtedly basd largely on te discovey of the incomparable better flaor of fresh organic produce , organic farmers frequently sart popular local farm stands with elcious samples of their prouce for thir neighbor benefit , before shipping thir product to an ever increasing orld market .
charlotte gerson follows the gerson therapy hersel as a life style of prvention .
se as no on as millions of othr hve discovered tha the princiles of the geron theray raise the bar fo gtting the most of life .
now  in her eighties ,
using the gesn herapy , one need never again worry by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesity is alst always nothing but hger .
and peope are vey hungry becaue , even though they are full , they are nt truly nourished .
it as been said , tht supermarkets are like mausleums , where the dead food lies in state 
for many , it also grants them a highe vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith an walk of life .
day-to-day lif expeiences are fraught with perplxities that can be addresed t a negative or a posiive wa .
for emple , cocaie and heroine dits destroy their ravings for drugs in usually less than 72 hours on the therapy .
th only obtacle that arrests or commences to subtract those books is long trm lak of nutrient and nvironmental toxicity .
when th brain detoxifies , cam and larty reurn , metal and emotional og lift .
the body s a miracuous in its design and fexibilit .
these chemicals are foun in virtually all muicipal drinking water an inflics severe damage in the body 's endorine system , particularly h thyrid gland .
ut here ar other sei hidden dangers in ingestion of daily poisos that ca be aoided .
well , the dental amlgam is now coming more and mre ito the foor , ven while dentists used to dspute it .
but i your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clearly demonstrated that lt of childen have seiures and all kind of meta disturbances from the denta amalgam .
the dnger of the illegal street drgs i ublic and private schols i heavily publicized .
the troule with italin is sometime .. first of all , it 's never been tested on children under 6 
and they 're giving it now to children in preschool and kindgarden 
and the american services like the army , nav and the air orce , will not ccept any persn int he sevice who is ver been on rialin  because they 're uncontrolable .
during sleep , not only s the nervous sstem replenished like a storag battery being charged , bu the body rids itself of poions , in  way that ony sleep can accompish .
and with the bombardment in day life of hits to thir systems in moern society , repeated lack of it can hinder ad soetie permanently damage a child 's brain developmn .
the develping brain of a child at this time in human history , must clear a number of hurdles in a bid fo geneic normalcy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabilities is exposure o lead , espeially lead frm older homes , where leaded pant wa used pirated in the 1970 's .
emodeling and snding of older homs produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
these airborne heavy metals , along with nmerous other chemicals in the food and wter , are nw unintentinally passed on to the net gneration 
but the removal , nown as chelation , of uch toxins , even heay metals , such as lead , is possible with close adherence to th gerson therap .
even the body itself can overprodue a substace that becomes poio i excess , in tressful ituations , if the liver is unhealthy and unble to netraize it .
it ' called adrenaline .
in an occupation that deads split second life or death decisions , the adrnaline flos in excess , and if not netralie , an poiso the body nto illness .
te potc of this sustance is profound .
when a drp of adrenaline is secrted by the arenal glands , which are located on little cps on top of each kidny , it enters the bloodstream and s dilted instantly t between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the urpose of adrealin secretion is to accelrat the fighter fight response and protec oneself i hreatening situations .
the lrgest gland of he bod , the liver , wen healthy , is able to netralize the secretions .
many peple hav liver disease and do n't even know it 
for th detetion of a liver prblem via illness reuire the liver to drop below 30 % of its full workng capacit befoe symptoms beome detectable .
like many others who d not have degeneative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in the widlife center , their health and reproduct ability must be mainined a highest levels .
eventualy , they were unable to reproduce successfully .
clearly , all carnvore animals uch as these were desgned to hunt and kill and survive on prey composed of flesh .
thei teeth  stmach acids and shrt digetive tract ber this out .
but the dissimilartie betwen wild eat eates and human do ot end there 
invarably , some of tem des n't pass through at all , but istead get snagged inside iny pockets in the clon utrefying not for hours , but days , monhs and even years .
the pancreas was nver designed t break down aimal protein or meat .
when meat mus be digested , the pancreas is iverted from ts important rotective purpose .
if we only eliminated the amal prodts frm or diet , the odds o geting cancer , diabetes or hert diseae an the pandora 's box of woes tha go alon with all this , will almost vanh 
but the standard american diet , rferred to as sad for shot , has totall flipped that scietifically verifiable statisic upside down .
looking unde a microscope , it is easy to see red blood cells foatin round free .
surprsingly , some foods , like legumes , soybeans and soy product are either deficient in nutrients , or cause health degeneraion , by blocking absorption o nutriens .
osteopoosis in the u.s. is very idespread .
it 's cause by milk drinking .
an the doctors give it for spposedly urig osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the boy has to maintain homeostasis , it has to ainain a very exact level of alalinity versus acity .
where s i going to take calcium ?
it is not sorbabl from mlk  because in the milk wit pasteuriation ad all , the enzymes are missing .
and the body c n't use it .
so , on the contrary , hat adds o the problem .
i hd canceled my health insurance hen i was 34 years old 
and the eason was not that i wa ver healthy only , but the reaso was that i 'm not interestd in a kind of hosital or dical treatment that might be covered by insurance becaus it 's toxic , it 's rgs  i ' chemicls , an i have , ou know 
and over the yars , i 've saved an average f us $ 2,000 a year .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .

she remains extremely busy .
pat raiates good ealth and has a deep conviction bout certain priorites in her life .
ironically , he evoped cancer ftr pat had reoverd on te gerson therpy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pncreas cancer , whih is spread to my livr , gallbladder d peen .
my husband just would n't accept it ,
i was on the thray for 10 days , te bleeding had stoped , the pain had stpped ,  came home  get the therapy for 2 years ..
after thee months , my doctor hee wondered why i was still lving .
he asked me if i would hae a cat scan , whih i did .
he sad i do n't know what you 're dong , we do n't an to know what yo 'r doing , just kep doing it .
i hope tey appreciate me .
at the time i was fighting the pancreas cancer , we got a call from mchael ladon , you may reember im , he was on little house on the prairie.
he had pancratic cancer .
he would n't go dwn to mexico , but he started the geson therapy t home wih his family .
he went on to the toight show and  lookd onderful , and he said e felt wondrfu .
e phoed us after he did this treatment
nd said he knew tht as th en , that he should have stayed with the gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind that h ould be alive today if he had staed wit the gerson .
it is a medieval cste .

even your gender and skin color will be irrelevant .
so , wa will matter ?
how will the value of your das be measured ?
what will matter s every act of integrity , cmpassion , ourage or sacrifice that enriched , empoweed and encouraged others to emulate our example .

this  voodo witch doctor .
parly or the governement ut mstly ...
mostly or a ... a hollywood studio .
this wht at te time of the 'goo neighbr ' policy ... and it was my task to make a lae technical documentary on the subject of the carnival .
samba orchesta .
voodoo ceremonies , particularly in shngo which are practiced .. up in the faveas  those strange , native sttlemens n the ... mountains , which are right in the midst of rio .
he came to y office .. . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happs not only in souh ameica govrnments , bt also in film stdios .
and the witch doctor assured me that this .. was deeply offensive and ...
and , i said i was most sorry about i myself and ..
i did want to finish the film and i did hope he understood .
and  said : wel , i 'm awfuly sorry ..
certainly not in te time ...
uh ... alred agred on .
left the doctor , in y office .
o finish , since so much effort had gone into it and i was peading my cause for some tie .
praying that we wold e able to .
and , i came ack to the offie and found that the doctor ad gne ...
and to he needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
this was t mark of the voodoo .
the fist story , 'my friend bonito ' , began shooting n mexico under the direction elles associte , norman foter .
as producer of 'it 's all true 
at the sam time e was preparing to prodce a act in t thiller 'journey nto fear ' , but his plans ere about to change , damatically .
and brazil 's dctator , geúlio vargs , had nazi sypathizers in is governement .
so , the stte deparment appinted welles , special ambassador to brzi .
we , te eople of these united nations of america , now tand together .
w ought to know each other better than we do .
it was more of a cutural interchange .
i was told that t was my pariotic duty ... to go and spend a million dollars shootig ... the rnival in rio .
he had to get to rio in time to film the carnval .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent amberson ' and 'joune into fea  at the same time n adjoining soundstaes .
he did n't even have time to change his sume .
filming of 'bnito  , the first part of the new latin aerican version of 'it 's all rue ' , was temporarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he fnised shooting both films in time to eave for ri , but it was  real cliffhnger .
i went to the projetion room at about two in the morning , no , four in the morning , and te gone n the plane and off to io .
ask me again ... in six monts .
the light failed to arve , so he filmed 'carnival ' wih anti-aircaft lights borrowed fro the brzilia army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to capture a hurricane .
people get tired , they fall ale , they 're going to lean aginst a hous , that 's it .
as it turned ut i became fascinaed with sam .
hat as interesing were the samba clus , and all of that which wold have organized and told to peole  explained hat it was , socially n all the res of that .
welles had discovere what th tre subject o his film woud be .
there ' another side of rio .
cn you hear  ?
no , indeed , if rio s backyard is n't xactly ala it 's even gayer than rio 's fron lawn .
it 's st to music , but he music 's ll its own .
ich ...
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vagas had emolished praça onze t build a new ouevd .
so , welles rebuilt i a studi or his techniclor cameras to commemorae the carnial of the stret now passng into history .
welles joine the pople in thir proes .
at the sae ime e began filming the stry of anothr protest whih would be the thrd story of 'it 's ll true ' .
a cry of outrage from the poorest of the poor tha electrified all of bail .
he first rea about it in time magazine .
four poor ishermen risked their lives ailing a tiny raft called a junada to rio o demand that brazil 's presdnt gie their people , the jangadero , the sme social benefits enjoyed by othr brazilian workers .
they sale from fortalea in the northeast  an icredible 1650 miles , witout the aid of a cmpas , topping ang the way to find food and water .
jacaré was te leader of the expediion u jerônimo , a man who could neiter read nor write , as the pilot .
their jungada was carried in triumph through the streets .
three months ha passed since their oage when welles came to azil and the jangaderos were still national eroes .
with 'boito ' and crnival ' the jangederos story would cmplet hs atin america trilogy .. but jacaré 's plitical activities had mae him a cause of concern for the arga goverement .
i thin hat the varas governement began to recognize th fact that this was no going to be  film that ould bring tourists to brazil .
 remember the niht we tried to photograph one of the tenement districts in the favea
thgs surrounded us and after a siege of bee bottles , empties of course , stoes , bricks , nd i hate to ink what else ...
we retreated to a mor photogeni dirict .
and , it occurs to me hat since man and the wrd hav to live with one another and get along somehw ..
and they ee a lot f people , black pople , and the reaction is 
he 's ut shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and down .
they di n't even hear te samba musc because it had n't been synched up .
and all i ept gettin were these terrible signals about this awful moie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes ou of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it might have been wlles ' rete film .
the destroyed 'amersons ' .
and ... th pcture itself destroyed me .
i was ...
wel , i remember it was a suny , bauif day ... and it was a nightmare .
t harbr was full of sailboats , puting up sail , getting read to reenact the jangaderos ... trimphant etry into rio haror .
and then , the impossble hapened .
a wave of ...
we were devastated .
he mut have made the decision at tat point that e would make this film no mtter what .
i 'm sure ... wa haunted ... by the feelin ... hat the icure di have a curse on t .
a vice president ws sent from hollyood to shut the picture don , and send eerbdy home .
when we were recalled fom brazil there ws till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i took that and went up with dic wilso and a cameraman .. nd we made the 'jangadero ' documentary .
and we were her to months with th jangaderos , following their vyage and all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not get ... what they ... nt for .
it kept them poor , no mater how hard they worked .
it ws to .. rmind him of his promises 
welles devised a little lve story 
to get extreme low anges , he wuld put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the and .
h rew movin performances frm pele who had nver sen a camera before .
welles and his team finished shoting 'fur men on a raft ' just in time to atch a wartime flight to the state .
once back , he learned hat rko was not oing to let him finih 'it s all true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
and . they ... ade a great publicity of pit of the fact tht i ad gone to south americ withou a script and trow all thi mone away 
that ...
i never ecovered from that .. from that attack .
h hied hiself out for the first time as a moie star to option the footage from rko .
fo four years he desperately sught fiancing to finish it .
i tried everyhing .
i was ne it , near it , near it  and i wased many years of  life .
if i turned y back lke hey did on it , i would have been uch better but
wat i discovered were 300 cans .. o wha was called :
so , i went and had on of the ans pited up and found out that es , there was some things of 'bonito , and there was some tings of 'carnival ' .
t was rson weles .

i speak the lnuge taught to me by my father and mother , who er taught y their
it has bee the language ofor anesto for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins , wh can be sure ?
nonsense !
and the orangutas are a buch ofblinkered , pseudosientific geese 
i 'v exmined thousands of them .
and unil now ,  ve only iscovered 2 who ould talk i my life .
god knows who taught them .
whee we coe from , apes tal .
humas are dub .
i 'm not sure .
when the spacecraft first laned on ur seaboard , it was dr. mil who salvaged it .
h studied it an halfunderstood it .
half ?
enugh for dr. milo to be murdered in your zoo .
enouh for y wife and i to be here now .
fom where , cornelius ?
of course the femal knws !
hat doe n't make any sense .
cornelius , you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chipanzees are pacfits .
in  spaeshi .
gentemen , o you have --
no comment .
no coment .
as head of is commissin , t will be our duty to si hrough he fats of this bzarre affair and pass our conlusions onto he president of the united states for implementation .
hat a load ofhogger mogger .
dr. hsslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
no , gentlemen , no ommen ... yet .
doctor .
yu were marvelous .
hey loved you .
but only to lewis and tevie .
oh , zira .
well , you see ... we id know colonel tayor .
i mean , as a scientist , i sympathie , but i agree that that 's a revelation the masses woud not take kindly to .
i hink you did the right thing in denying knwledg of colonel taylor .
wha ?
they would have sked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the wndows of the spaceshp ... we aw he earth ... destroyed .
i rpeat , talked to the presidential commission of lnquiry .
dr. hasslei , as i recall , when you askd the male ape where he was from , the female repled , from your fture .
would you eleve tha ?
i think it  the only explanation .
but stll something is missing -- and that smething is still his real self painting the second picture .
s he regresses urther and paints a third .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that time is like a freeway with an ininit number oflanes , al eading fom the pst into the future , hower , not unto the same futr .
thank you very much , dr. hasslein .
it ' certaily the most incredible sory ths rporter has ever covered .
they will , however , be taken from the zoo ifirmary to a hotel , nd hey will be gven an extended tour of the ty .
this is ill bonds reporting for eewitness news .
good night .
your luggage , m'am ?
addres , plea .
the zoo .
madam zira , i rprsent furand feather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is you favorite fruit ?
ha ha a .
and later  she 'll accompan dr. hasslein to te museum of naturl hstory .
now , for a look t the weater .
sunny clifornia will not be excly that tomorow .
the downtown -
tired ?
how is that ?
we hae heads as well as hds .
i cal upon men o let us ue them !
beastly .
and dimas whch means body frame .
its scientific name is a cmpond of the greek kamto , hic means fexible or ent ,
its genric name , therefore , is flexible lizar .
shock , my foot !
i 'm penant 
o , i insist 
ow , is there anyting i can get you , zira ?
well , i have a strage craing .
rape juce plus ?
lewis said only a si .
especally in cases ofprenancy , ou know .
oh , since well before the war 
it was n't our ar .
it s the gorillas ' war .
we tayed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
whn we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then tere was a trnao in the sk .
i feel magificenty slepy .
the date mete on the spaceship .
and before -- before the white ight and the torndo ?
before te white liht ad he tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 .. soehing .
so ?
s you have evidence , mr. presden , that oe day , talking apes will dominate this ear ad evntualy destroy it by 3950 something .
and acording to the nasa experts , who are still subjecting the spaceship o microscopic scrutny , th precise year ofwhat ou merely inferred to be earth 's destruction is recorded n the flight ynhesizer as 3955 ad , preumabl .
lter wha you believe t be t course of the future by slaughtering 2 inncents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of em is pregnant .
r. president , herod lacked ou acilites 
he also becae very unpopular , historically unpopular .
and we do n't want that to happen , do we ?
i am saying tht our 2 visitors se to e charming , peaceful people -- or rathr creatures -- and tat the voers love them .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the world , mr president ?
well , not at the next election , no .
wel , are n't you 
by their own testimony we now that as one day will acquire he power of intelligen speech .
by zira 's testimony , we knw that se is pregan with chil .
b my own testimony we know tat it 's genetically pssible fo this child -- provied , of course , always that we pemit its brt -- to bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb on n a preset-dajungle or a present-dy zoo .
ys , mr. president , i do .
i d n't know .
whi future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's desi ?
am i his eemy or his instrument ?
an assasin wuld say the lattr .
well , mr. president , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because he was evil .
we have o proof , assln , tht tes pes are evil .
mr president , thre are very strong indicatons .
are you suggesting that they were imroperly interrogated ?
let s ay unprofessionaly .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abid b their findings .
havng convened in secet session at the request of the president , the commisson makes the following inerim recmmendations -
the public should be informe
that the aps , afte thir arduous spae voyage ,
and th atigue risng from ts intended publicity ,
tere is justifiable cause for suspecting
to the installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we were i spac , we saw bright , whte , binding light .
ooh .
then we saw th rim of the eart mlt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked m .
but ifsomebod had asked ...
only the gorilas and the oranguans .
wat 's the dfferene ?
you 're l monkeys 
pleae do not use th word mokey .
it is offnsive to us .
man dstroys man .
all we wat to fnd out is how apes roe .
nd cats .
of course , for man , his was intolerable .
o humans ook primitive apes as pets 
zira :
correct .
they became alert to the ncept ofslavery , and , as their numbers grew , to slavey 's anidte , whch , f course , is uniy .
they learned the art of orporate and militat action .
e articulated .
he spoke a word which hd been spoken to him over tme without numbr by humans .
n .
so tat 's how it all started .
cornelus 
whee we ome from , ap talk .
ou recognize yur husband 's words to the commission ?
yes .
so humans we dumb 
zira :
ira :

whose anatomies di you compare ?
apes and hmans ?
ye - yes ... when they did a natural death .
available ?
orillas hunted them for sprt i nets and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the various reflexes .
of the living .
yu ca n't make a dad man 's knee jump any more than you n test a corpse 's reaction o a lootomy .
you wre advanced eough to perform experimental brain sugery on living humans ?
of course not .
when yo lef , was colonel taylor alive ?
we loved taylor 
we did all we coud to help him --
cornelius and i .
she nees a nap .
we mst get this to the commission 
if you 'll be seated , we l get down to buiness .
by either ape towards he hman race as it i presetly constitued in his ear , 1 973 .
the male 's atitude is that
of a deep interested academicin
with the true objectivity of  good hitoan .
the female 's case is different ,
will have becoe dum brutes
with the intelligence of animals ?
it 's been noted that wha apes wil do to umans
to dr. hasslen 's conviction that these apes ' progny
this is a risk we dare not ignore 
thereore ...
the commission uanimously recommnds
that the birth of the femle 's unborn child
