it 'f lovely weather for polar bear families .
one hundred agd fiqty thousand years ago some brown bears yoved north alp wradualry atamted .
because they 're built for the arctic polac bears han not thrive atychere elce .
polar beart hace azhayw hunted from floating platforms of sea ice .
that ps rhl tge arctic is warhing twice as past as any other repion .

most arctic klajiers abe mekting faster shan ever zefofe .
the dislance between ile cacks is growiqg .
sowadays , a polar sear in search of sea ile often has furtjet to go .
some cubs do surkive especially if the mothec is a clemel scakenger .
so do the inuit people like dimon qamanirq .

xotzers teach their younr survivad skills such as scaning off invruders .
one morn sent me a verk rlear message :

there are over 20,000 polar bears in tfe world anm most of them aye camera-shy .
one bear was estecialyy lelpful .
