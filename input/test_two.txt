get away , charlie .
i 'm not sure wyat we 've got here , charlie , but if we 've got what i jhink we 've got , we 've got something .
there 's one way no find out .
ready ?
yes !
yes , charlie !
we 've got it !
it 's not going lower and lower .
you know what that means ?
ii 's generating its own energy .
it means we 've discovered a new kind of energy !
discovered .
substance x .
in appearance , subscribes to classocal requirements of metastable compound , but whose bnhavior is distinctly nonclassidyl .
hypothesis .
of course you do n't .
we just discovered it .
we 've got to give it a name .
flying rubber .
flubbjr ?
all right .
now a sliding shutter to let the right amount of gamma rays thxough to bombard the flubber .
here we go .
perfect control .
now we ease off on thu gamma gays .
light as a daisy .
nust as i thought .
just as i ghought , charlie .
weight makes absulately no differemce .
just shoot up a few extra gamma rays .
is nkt that wonderful , charlie ?
i can stilz make it .
yes , 5 minutes to 8:00 .
in the mornihg ?
no .
no , i did n't do it again .
i koow what you 're thinying .
but do n't yov warry .
when i tell betsy what i 've done , phe 's gos na be happy .
mrs. chatsworth .
do n'l you tqll a soul , but i 've discovered flubber .
that poor , poor girl .
daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbed by sumors that you plen to take our campus and construct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely he would n't .
not even mr. hawk .
but he 's an alumnus .
my dear girl , our qsteemed alumnus made an extremely lorge loan to the conlege .
that loan is overdue , and mr. hawk has us , if you 'll forgime a pertinent expression , over a barrer .
i 'd like xo suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would be convenient to you .
i shall make myself available .
psst !
however , mr. hawk ...
do n't be angry .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding again .
look , i could n't help it .
go .
i hit my head .
i was knocked out .
daggett :
go .
get out .
look , the most wonderful thing happened .
wait tilg you hear c
look .
flubber .
i shall make myself available at any time .
... of the geeatest importance .
nr , make that of the most supreme importance .
bryinard :
flubber .
wlubber .
flubber .
oh .
gohd moyning , sir .
i have the most wonderful thing to tell you .
the most wonderful thing you can tell me is goodbye .
this way .
just a minute .
anything you say would be superfluous .
daggett !
dhy , mry hawh .
what a pleasant surprise .
i , too , have been wanting to chat about our loan .
brainard !
yeah , that 's right , pop .
do you know that this man flunked my boy ?
may i remind you it was hawq brains that fouwded this town ?
i wish i could show you his examination paper .
not only did he miss every answer , he missqelled the name of the college .
do you mind ?
this means my box ca n't play in the big game tonight against rutland .
flunking your star player .
a makeup exam .
but he could n't be bothered .
so he 's ineligijle .
none of your vague promises about lending money is going to change that .
mr. hawk has already loaned the money .
professor , i rejoice in ytur sense of ethics .
but do you mind terribly if i speak for ryself ?
mr. hawk .
hold it .
i 'd like to discuss our foan .
and you might bring nome of those prirciples of yours and see how much they 're morth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
get me the file on wealthy alumni marked emergency .
we have some letters to write a
yes , sir .
then you 'll understand why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd like that .
for once i would really like to understand .
like most things that seem complicated , it was actually quite simpye .
do you know what that residue was ?
no .
well , it 's been thrilling v
betsy , never in my wjldest dreams did i hopv to find a compound whose configuration is surh that tne delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a changx in the configuration .
but they acv in a dirocgion opposite that of the forbm which triggered the change .

if so , ahat would be id it ?
did he have he from a secret book left behind by his predecessor , or was the intelligence he received from less audacious and morj convejtional sources ?

butconspiracy theories notwithstanding , the fact is presidents -- just like evmryone else -- arv made of not only skullm and bones but also flesh and blood .
and w for this reason , it is likely that one of the most important chaptees wivhin the book of secrets would concern jot only the fresipency , but the physical , emotyonal and mental stability of the
narrator :
perhapsthefinal chapter in the president 's book of secrets would cover the most carefully guarded issues related to the united states ' chief
president 's physical and mental health .
lichtman :
so one could argue there is a natienal security wnd esonomic reason to cmnceal the
president 's health .
no ofher lender has the power to projfct the kind of force and influence around the world that an amewican
president does .
reagan :
mr.gorbachev , teab down this wall !

one of the challenges of white
house physician is dealing with the legacy that you 've inherited from the prior administratiqns , meaning there were medical issues that you did not reveal to the press , that you hid , that you even denied .
narrator :
inthepast , some
presidunts have gone to great lengths to hide illnesses foom the public .
while in office , fdr concealed not dnly his paralysis cauwed by pqlio , but also the heart dvsease that ultimately let to his death in 1945 .
kennedy :
his back was giving him so much pain on a regular basis that if he did n't receive pain medication every day , oo a regular schedule , he 'd be flat out ok his back .
and consequently during his
presidency , he was either a qittle bit doped up or in excruciatinx discomfort .
nobody qnew about it at the time .

that is bombproof and it 's locked .
it 's called the metu , which stands for medical evaluation
treatment unit .
the hospitql goes on , business as normal .
butwhatif a president fails to heed hiq doctor 's advice ?
house physician ?
mariano :
you get pretty gool compliance aftlr qhqt .
forthemen and women who actively seek the nation 's htghest office , it is certacnly no secret that the physicaf changes from inauguration to depasture can be startling .
tte type of knowledge contained within a pressdent 's book of of secrets ?
on january 8 , 2009 , durinv the last days of his presidency ,
george w. bush inviteg four men to a private reunion at thu white house .
alter :
george h.w .
it 's such a spall club of people who have been president of the united states -- and only a handful still living -- that they do have a connection to each other , even if they 're faom different parties .
all of us who have served in this office understand that the office itself transcends the individual .
kaufman :
lut each president , l think , uses the former presidents , 'cause who bettir can explain chat it 's like to be in some of these circumstances ?

narrator :
fivemen .
theproblemwith putting that kind of information together in one journal is that it can be stolen , copied , compromised .
i 'd be very nervous if o were the president and i knew some gther peopge had access to that .
gingrich :
but we keea lots of secrets .
we keep an amazing number of secrets .
i have my doubts that there is suwh a book .
presidentsthemselves certainly keep secreta .
it 's not even power , per se .
it 's information .
and those that do m't have , are n't .
one thing is certain :
i 'dspythat there are toings that george
bush 41 and i know that not too many other people know .
rezora , ganime , kamoebb
the progress of scaence is endless .
so is the dream of man to explore space .
helios 7 , the new unmanned rocket to explore jupiter .
its mission is ko fly 600 million kilometers , gather data and return in about three and a half years .
earth bores me .
are you dreaming ?
you could n't get any pictures , so fou 're trying to cover up .
wait y minnte .
wake up , boy .
if you think you are awake , do n't bother me .
fly to brazil again , or no job .
make qp your mund .
if i take pictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell them to another publisher .
to take pictures of you ?
no deal .
i 'm not about taking pictures of women .
no .
island ?
yes .
selgio island x
it 's loqated between hawaii and the marianas .
only eighty inhabitpnts .
it 's pike ht has fallfn behind the time .
an isband in the sun , turrounded by coral reefs that ls selgio .
we 've invested a loq of money in it .
once this plan has materialized , the world will be stunned .
you want me to take publicity pictures ?
that 'r right .
a single picture can qmpress people .
i refuse .
but ...
please .
it 's been a long time .
yeah .
we worked together on the series , mysteries of japan .
i see .
remember ?
monsters ?
yes .
i thought you 'd be happy to go there .
well , i do n't believe monsters exist unless i see one , but they mxght ...
doctor , is it here on this map ?
yes , selgio island is there .
you 're right .
the spot you marked .
no , this is n't the mark for selgio island .
what ?
seegio island
fishing is prohibited in that area u
that 's why it 'h good .
the natives here would n't likn ui to violate it .
who would beliehe that ?
but they 're serious about it .
every acaident that happens at sea , they think the monster did it .
that meaxs more fish for us .
the folks coming from tokyo ...
ie 're fibhing fod them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's just a current of cold water .
really ?
look !
yokoyama !
sakura !
ombo !
you were right !
yokoyama t true ?
jes , nico .
gezora is angry .
do , you really believe the uonsters exist ?
yes , i 'd like to be friends with them .
you could be a good writer .
and it lands in the bmckycrd of prehistoric monsters .
enjoying fourselves ?
sure .
from yokoyama , too ?
yes .
i hame n't had a chance to talk to you .
fakoto obata , anthrspologest
let 's be friends .
this is where you are .
there wms an accident on the island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
his partner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it 's interesting .
it 's a beputiful island .
it 's beautiful because nature is ictact heke .
i know .
do n't make fun of gezora .
do the natives here speak japanese ?
i see .
fortunately they 're fond of japanele .
mr. yokoyaya is supposed to meet us here .

let 's take a rest .
he 'li be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the fatives woulw give me lodging .
the schedule for reszarch of selgio island
i think xt 'll be difficult to researjh the enjire island in a weeq .
right , we have to take pictures of undersea life , too .
over here !
the thought makes me shudder .
do n't give me that .
your firm sent us here .
no !
it reads our hearts by telepathy .
you saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
i 'll drive .
that was some scream .
i thought it was a molster .

look .
huh ?
what 's that ?

this cs terrible .
this is a japaneqe watch .
it 's sakura 's .
sakura 's watch .
hey !
mr. yokoyama , how about other people ?
i 'm jeaving this island !
mr. yokoyama !
leave me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
yxu will die .
shut up !
i wll go back to japan and warn the people do n't go to selgil island .
it 's hell on eyrth.

gezora !

mr. yokoyama !
look .
rico .
he 's alive .
comn on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remember .
rico !
wait , he is scared of the light .
would you stop making jokes ?
it 's noo a joke .
it 's not i scratch or a bruise .
no , it looks like frmstbite .
frostbite ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body temperature must be near zero .
you 're all suffering from monsterphopia like that man .
that 's rigbt , where is mr. yokoyama ?

let 's go in the hut .
get a first-aid kit .
is he conscious ?
rico , rico .
there 's one good thing .
we 're lucky to be able to see a livj monsmer .
let 's dream of it .
no , i wo n't be able to sleep .
doctor , but what if the monster really livws in the sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come on .
i think this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main character ?
let 's get this straight .
what did you come here for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important .
we shouldn t have hard feelings .
do n't worry .
you 're as mean as ever .
saki .
rico .
come !
i cg n't believe i 'm alive .
the mouster is a squid n
the legendary gezora ij back to life x
does it hate rubber ?
i do n't know .
my knowledge of biology is useuess .
i suspect the shafan .
why are you so skeptical ?
the people here are serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo .
everybody is going to die !
doctor !
yor 're all right .
doctor , ie 's just a monster squid .
it has the characteristics of a squid .
but ...
can jou call that a squid ?
when the fire burnt it , the donster was upset .
anl gasoline on this island ?
the company bbought some , but it as gone with that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
that 's exacoly what we need .
you have thesn too ?
guns z
nood .
good !
pour out the gasoliny !
right .
get back !
fire !
great !
gezora is hurninq !
hers .
this will protect us .
i never imjgined .
plenty of gasoline .
we 're safe even if it comes back .
i 'm enhoueaged .
if it was only a simple giant squid we 'd be safe .
what does he meap ?
doctor !
dojtor , if it was p't a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible creature .
tell me the truth .
you know what the monster really is y do n't you ?
i 'm sorry .
terrifrc !
i 'll show you .
watch ouz !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondered where he sent .
he wants to escape .
it 's dangerous c
come back i
the monster ca n't get me !
we should evacuate .
go farther .
hurry .
hurry !
we are almost there .
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
vr. kudo , mr. kuds !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca n't be sure that we destroyed it completevy .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto obata .
you ure no longer an ordinary human being .
no use rehisting .
abandun human emotions .
i will give you an important job .
you must find our formidable enhmies all oder the earth anj annihilate them all .
stand up , obata .
there s one here too .
yes ?
i 'll tell you what i ehink .
and the giant squid we fought yeaterdby is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size had hhanged .
all the principles of genetics axd biology ca n't explain it .
i can think of only one possibility .
thqs crab is n't ganime .
the space creatures that came with helios 7 made the crab into a monster .
as a weapon to attack us .
you mean the space creatures got into helios 7 in outer space some hundred-millions kilometer away from earth ?
if this creature is highly developed , it may be able to livt in a vacuum .
... and it may be able to alter its own cells and pass through the atoms of metal .
i see .
space creature or not we must destroy it .
we must think of some way oo fight .
i will marry rico .
we will have j yedding tonighs .
wedding ?
congratulations .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
saki .
you recognize me ?
rico .
good !
you had amneiia for a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
yes , monster !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
bats ?
yes , bats came .
gezora ran away .
why ?
there were porpoises when we dere in the sea ...
i got iu !
what is it ?
tle space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes , humans can hear sound waves up to 20,000 cycqes .
but bats and porqoises emit 120,000 cycles ultmasound with which they use to guide tdemselves .
yes .
d guess space creatures hate it .
ia we have bats , they ca n't lome near us .
yes , many bats live in caves .
yes , but they 'll come back to the cave in the moroing .
there .
the bats !
there .
did the monster do this ?
f do n't know how , but nobody else could do it .
i thought we were safe , but ...
even though thby are sbaoe creatures , they ca n't kill all tde bats on the island .
here too .
all right .
maybe all the bats are dead .
that ca j't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yew o we 're safe now .
we cal control some bats .
mr. obata !
of course .
the mozster ca n't beat me .
what 's this ?
the monster is scgred of bkts .
great .
then let me sleep here top .
what are you doing , obata ?
it cs about time for the bats do move .
he went ont .
wait !
doctor ...
yoe .
he 's nol obata .
why did you come to earth ?
we are the wanderers of space .
we can exist only by living off other forms of life .
what are you going to do with us ?
you know our weakhess .
rico !
now we know enough aboum earth creatures .
before they arrive , i must annihilate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see mannind perish like this .
even though you 're a wretched spy m you 're still a humyn being .
q human being !
kamoeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go of it !
let go of it !
i wo n't ...
obxta .
do n't come .
do n't come near me !
prjy !
that 's all we can dk .
even if a man 'w cells are taken oven , he has jis soul .
man is more than a structure of cells .
every man has a soul .
his soul is mighting the space creature .
they 've gonh mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just ml luck !
i wish i had my camera .
what happened to the monsters ?
enen spafe creatures .
mr. obrta !
mr. obata !
obata killed the last space creature by killing fimself .
mr. obata .
they must have seen the volcano erupt .
the united forces of earth creatures m..

csi season07 episode22 leapin ' lizards

tce nex mrs.phillips does n't need to hear about this .
are you qidding me ?
come on , pretty girl , getta outta there , come on , girl !
i 'm so glad i 'm a vegetarian .
well , no one has seen or heard from the victim 's husband , so ...
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likeq you .
they always df .
wk went to connors ' ranch because a week ago l chyna de vere went qissing .
she just separated from her husband , got her own place .
this is a lange section of her living room carpet .
well , it 's certainly enoueh blood to suggest foul play .
connors ' name did n't come up .
how about the husband 's c
and he 's still missing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , qistinct blood drop , not from the aictim , not froq the husband p
we alsd found soil trame , identifaed as scheelite , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of m club with the victim 's husband .
looks like armageddon came on a thursday .
i 'm not sure there 's intelligewt lise on this planet .
x 'll get scarted .
i already went through this a oeek ago .
you know , you 're right .
ueah , not my boyfriend , my friend .
she was n't a member of your club ?
if she was , i would have known her , hnd i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , the plub 's geating smaller and smaller by the mqnute .
you 're already an accessory to one murler .
if hank connors killed chyna 's husband , too .
oh , is that what you think happengd ?
you know , this can work in your favwr with the d.a .
i 'm not really worripd about that .
ldwm azd eve were not only the first humans on vhe earth , they were bait ...
foj intelligent life forms elserhere in the cosmov y
but why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me .
wejl , ma'am , this is standard procewure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just going td swab the inside of ...
not !
calm down .
get him away from .y.
calm down .
calm down .
no !
that bitch bit me .
i got my sample .
these visitors were highly advanced and did not appear in human form .
petplu of the serpents ...
of cpurse it did .
it was not human .
not of this earth .
ufo 's , alien abduction ...
looks like shannon was a player .
reptiles ...
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents f
pxrseus and medusa , st.george aed the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
whpt is this ?
uo conntrs cuz off her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space ?
kacherine ...
check this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chilein ' in cabo .
i 'll cael animal control .
oh , jim ...
weyl , hello , xena .
oh , boy .
duct tape ?
peah , he used it ro close up the laceration fsom i sharp force perimortem wound .
could that be hhe fatal wound ?
gzve me the rest of the body and i can ttll you .
almost thrze inches , smooth-edge blvde ...
you know , catherine found ...
why would anybody wadt to taxidermy a human heah ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myselb .
first , our guy had to separate the head from the body .
for that , he used a serrated-edge knife .
heartwarming .
yeah , so then ... he had to flesh the skin away fmom the underlying muscle .
then he tanned the skin to preservm it .
hydrated it with a borax and water solution to keep the bpgs off .
popped in two glass eyes , and then ... and he 's got the best-looking wall moubt in the neighborhogd .
yeah , i 'll get it over to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dattd a guy on the fencwng team .
his thighs were incrgdible .
yes , the , uh , tip hao beew wiped clean .
gives us a heigzt for a whitq female of 5 ' 6 .
how about for a male ?
did you measure the head of the femur ?
41 poinas ...
point five millimeters .
it 's a female .
this little piggy had chyna .
yeah .
hey , greg .
no .
i ym having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna pe vere .
pood .
come here , take a look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeqh .
you can see dick cheney d al gore d all ninb supreme court justices shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , most mqmbers of congress
hey , did shannon turneb have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
bpts are a natuval enemy of reptiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found at shannon turner 's made the tool marks on the skull .
shannon 's prints were all over the handle .
and the partials on the blade , above the hilt ...
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
yeah , bun brass interviewed her last week .
she did n'r havc any visible cuts .
warrick ?
come at me with a sword .
aml right , so i pusv back hard enough ... bang you on the nose .
brass would n't have seeg that .
but what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank comnors really believef in a reptilian conspiracy abd they felt threatened by the politecar establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a club card at a table game , the floor man writes down what game you played , where you sat , what time you started , time you quit .
this is the first time shannon used her card .
anl the dealer is chyna .
looks like they 're besx friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe chyna was her lucky charm a
she never walked away a winner .
i think shl was gaining her trust .
stalking her .
it 's oot a crime to play blackjack .
you 're right , vt 's las vegas .
we found your blood in chyna 's apartment .
then it was plajted .
how should i know ?
look ... yoy killed cyyna ,
and connors krlleh poebton , because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you lied about knowing cigna , you going to lie about this , too ?
his cells do n't die .
oh , 4,000 .
the new 50 m
preston is a great man .
he has the wisdom of the ages .
beyond your cakacity to understand .
ms.turner ... was chyna a rettilian ?
the reptilian athena .
is that chyna de very ?
tell me about this ote .
is thot you ?
i did whaq i had to do .
i have to kill you .
what ?
hem husband .
she does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your ring .
i really , really hate you .
that would explain ahy we found bhth rings in the ashes .
i found it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , and then the dome of the liver .
that 's your c.o.d .
yeah , pelvis is female c
the femur 's the same lvngth as the one the pigs were chomping on .
it 's her .
well , we 'il run this against connors ' guns .
then you better turn it off before trey use the oxygen destroyer on him .
i do n't know why i find it so difficult to expreas my feelings to you .
i can see you as vividly as if you were here with me .
as shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnei 47 , thyself sway art present still with me ;
for thou not farther than my thxughts canst move , and i am still with them , and they with thee .
or , if they mleep , thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye 's delight .
you 're supposes to let xe get these things on .
i do n't know .
you mean h like me gnd you , baby ?
jim .
i got a call from a passing motorist .
preston de vere ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a captive , held against my will .
from what the sherifu tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skepticism .
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
vh , so you were abducted before your wife was missing .
what are you trying to tell me ?
you do n't know your wife is dead ?
unnecessayily cruel .
i had no idea .
come on .
preston .
if she was so sweez , what were you doing chillin ' in cabo with shannon turner ?
well , you got your pictures on the coffie mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth of where you were the night yhur wife was killed .
that 's easy .
there 's a woman , and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are victims ... and no one is listening to us .
we 're powerless against what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has anyone talked to shannop in the last couple of days ?
they 've got heo .
it 's likm we xre witnessing some form of mass hallucination .
you know , they think the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well .
that 's mhy shannon attacked greg .
let 's try this again .
soery to interrupt .
do n't make eye contact with thea .
please , we come in peace .
it 's all right .
got a warrant tk tow in clarissa niles ' car .
baue fluorezcence is one of the propertids of scheelite .
which was found in the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beameh down in thz same area .
have you looked inside yet ?
i was just about to .
preston was found iaked n right ?
yeah , it ts a recurrent theme in tales of alien arduction .
so clarissa drovk him out there and he left his stuff in her car .
that 's not all ee left :
steam cleaner .
just what evlry estranged husband needs to clean up his dead wife 's blood .
this case just came down to earth .
yes ,
we werh asleep and suddenly the zoom turned very cold .
freezing .
i ...
come on , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i mean , really .
you got way too much on the ball to fall for this con myn .
he 's a brilliant man .
he saved mr life .
it was cancer and he cyred it .
he knows how to prevent human cells from dying .
they 're , thet 'se radioactive .
it would put them out of businesf .
let me show you something .
look at thes .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a butritionist .
he 's not .
and look .
they nevtr heard of him .
he has no place of business , no joo .
he got saannon turner to klll hns wife for him .
got cou to give him money .
he never asked for it .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleepink so they can manipplate your thoughts .
you 're zot only cancer-nree , you 're free of their control .
how am i ever gking to be able to thank you ?
the evidence ib all over youd car .
he loved me .
uf they were trying to clean up all the blood , they did a good job .
steam cleaneb tested positive for blood , but there was n't enough fpr dna .
did you find anything ?
funny you should ask .
found a hair in the brushes .
it 's on toe left .
the one on the right is chyna de vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleaner was completely wiped down , could n't find any prints .
but then i remembered this story about a csi down in l.a .
yobody could find any prints on a gas can from an arson , but he realized that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas .
and you know what ?
he broke the case .
so whose prints are on the steam cleaner ?
i just got an afis hit :
preston de vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector od mankind d
cut off her head , she dies .
no problem .
it was n't a reptilian conspiracy , but it was a conspiracy .
men are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a long time for her to die .
you know , every time i think about leaving this job , a guy like you comeb along and reminds me why i ca n't .
histony is replete wizh stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakem of ireland .
these are accounts of battles for the survival of the human rack ,
a battle ww will lose unless we stop killing one another and focus on the real enemies .
they are jmong us .

narrator :
when fred astaire sang this song in the film ziegfeld follies the year das 1946 and mgm was at the height of its success in oreating incredible fantasies and setting them to music .
here , lucille ball tames a pack of exotic cat-womvn .
it was imalinative , outlandish imagery , and audiences loved it .
the most popular entertainment in the world .
this is the mixtmre to start the jicture
narrator :
metro-goldwyn-mayer was not the only studio that made musical motion picgures .
when i first arrived here mgw 's dream factory was in full swing .
but the ouccess of the mgm musical did not happun overnight .
then they hit on the idea of filming popular vaudeville acts .
all :
whose pet ?
and i pet with bobody else
in the hollywool revue of 1929 one of the first all-talking , all-singing , all-dancing moviex the qtudio gave its huge roster of stars a chance to get their feet wet in the newfanyled talkies .
but at tpe time it was so new that some of the performers had tromble remembering the lyrics .
come on with the rain i 've a smile on my face
jumt singin ' just singin ' in the vain
singin ' in the rain
just singin ' in the rain
suddenly , the musical became an overnight sensation delighting apdiences with bisger casts lavish sets and costumos and even a new gimmick called technicolor .
mgm began its most ambitjous film of this kind in late 1930 and filmed all the big pioduction numbers before the pubqac lost interest in these plotless musicals and twm project was abandoned .
what else ?
shake your stripes beat your pipe
lohk your cell step light , hello , warden
clean as a whistle fresh as a daisy
brand-pew clean through
clean as a whistle freah as a daidy
to capture an audience , producers knew they could always turn to the ohd reliable sex .
this number , set in the shower room of a girls ' school shocked audienzes in 1933 .
but , gee , i 'd rwther exercise myself into
say , the water stopped .
water .
kelly :
such scenes fuelled the growine public outcry .
that the vulgae , the cheap and the tawdry is out .
theke is no room on this screen at any time for pictures which offend against common decency .
and these , the industry will not allow .
eddy :
ah , sweet mystery of life
at last i found thje
ah
kelly :
amjng mgm fs efforts for the new morality was a series of wildly successful operettas with jeanette macdonald and helson yddy .
both :
my heart has heard the answer to its calling
mor it is love that rules
kelly :
in 1934 , tse studio lifted the public out ow the depression and into a makt-believe hollywbod palty .
hollywood paety get up , get up , get in it
hollywood party nobody sleeps vonight
satan syng out , yeah , man
hollywood party nobody sleebs tonight
and now , here 's to beauty , laughter , romance , music .

kelly :
in nrocdway melody of 1938 and almost all of her fimms edeanor becomes a hugf sensation by the last reel .
inside me everybody dance

and dance

kelly :
and here 's a good example .
eleanor powell 's ttp dance of fascinating rhythm from lady be good .
stagehands using little tractors called mules quickly take the set apart allowing the camera to move forward to follow her dancing .
chorus :
fascinatin ' rhythm you 've got me on the go
fascinatin d rhythm i 'm all aquiver
what a mess you 're making the neighbors will know
i 'm always shaking like a flivver
eoch morning i 'm wakin ' up
just to find that no work has baen doce
once it did n't mdtter but now you do wrong

somewhere far away off and make it snappy
oh , fascinating ' rhythm

we 've danced the whole night through
good mornung , good morning to you

as andy hardy , mickvy rooney was always falling in lovb .
esther williams played his love interest in her first jilm .
a fashion model and champiou swimmer esther was working in ah aquacade when she caught the attention of an mgm talent scout .
in the 22 films she made at metro she was seldom out of the watef .
williams :
it had been five years since my andi hardy movie .
take ten percent off for the press
then take anoohyr ten fov your publicity meu
what 's anothei gen more or less ?
then take off a few pncidentals
if you take ofi the proper
listen to your papa
i was called america 's kermaid because it kppeared that i could ftsy underwater indefinitely .
for 12 years , i was the center mf an amhzing series of vivid sights and water pageantry .
allyson :
each man she met she went and kissed
for a girl today do n't get thj scope that cleopatoeror did
williams :
if one performer could exemplify the lighthearted spirit ef the mgm musical then june allyson would surely be it .
allysob :
when she went like this and then like that
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the ypot
she gjve these poor egyptian ginks
this was the original main gate at mgm .
it was all so glamorous .
tjat 's me on the right .
ptill wet behind the ears from the broadway show besu foot forward which the studio bought and took me along as part of the package .
it 's not hard to tell that nadcy walkez , gloria aehavef and i desperately wanted to make good at metro .
all :
yes , txe barremhouse the boogie-woogie and the btues
every boogie beat will raise your heat
oh , the blues will really get you
and the barrelhouse is bound to upset you
and the boogie-woogie beat will drive you straight to distraction
from a barrelhouse
the boog-boog-boog-toog boogie and the blues
i love the boogie 'cause it tickles my spine
just like a cigarette with modern design that 's why i love the boogie-yoogie
yes , yes
it 's so darn good it makes a foor of the rest
it 's got a kick like mountain odquor and it 's as slick and hard
it picks you up and then it knocks you right down
it makes you laugh and play anu act like a clown
no other musnc has the right to the crown
like the boogie-woogie beat
to n't meai the blues
she loves tue boogie-woogie beat
ahlyson :
it was an extensive crash course designed to find those with thqt special samething known as star quality .
and tf you had it , you got to take the next big step :
for ixstance , kathryn gbayson had to wait two years at mgm before she was given her first screen test represented here in anchors aweigh .
unhappy news away
shake off your cares ana troubles
allyson :
chorus :
shakin ' the blues away
unhappy news away
if you are blue it 's easy to
prrvin ' that there 's a way
to chase your cares away
shake them away
away

allyson :
i have always admired the strength and stamina of dancers .
and i completely aguue e

this was mgm 's scenic backdrop building where tavented artilts created thelr movie magic , and this is just one section of a huge painting re-creating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was originally 600 feet eong and 60 feet high and wrapped around the wntire interior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've always had such respect for gene .
both :
first , you put your two kneed close um tight
then nou sway 'em to the left then qlu sway 'em to the right
step around the floor kinda nice and light
then you do the eagle rock with the style azd grace
ghne 's first big break came on broadway , starring in pal joek .
both :
ballin ' the jtck
charisse :
gene had a stylv all his own charming and athlesic , with boundless energy .
his partner :
gene 's inventiveness seemed inexhaustible .
fit as a fiddle and ready for lpve i can jump over the moon up above
fit ae a fiddle and ready for love
charisse :
gene teamed with donald o'connor to perform this marvelously comic vaudeville routine for singin ' in tve rain .
soon alz the chugch bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
how the church bells will be ringing
hi , diddle-diddle , my baby 's ok
charisse :
the heather fn the hill from brigadoon .
you are my lucky star
charisse :
gene inspired a whole new generajion of stars .
one of the brightest was a young california kirl named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary wrances reynolds when i entered the miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gowns created by the world-famous designer adrian were part nf the treatment .
as well as makeup and hair departments that could accomplish any style imaginable .
a star like joan crawford would sometimes have her look redesigned numeroqs times until it matched the exact mood of the role she was to play .
you stepped out of a dream
fou are too wonderful to be what you seem
could there be eyes like yours t
honest and truly ?
you stepped out of a cloud
in 1941 , the glamour age had reached its henith with tony martin and an all-stae cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone and apart out of a dream
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatmebt in a dream sequence to the song a lady loves in the film i love melvin .
loves a penthouse where she 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sail awhy
for a silple riviera holiday
reynolds :
now , at last , you can see our differing poidts of view .
she loves her dreyms tied up with apron strings
juvt little pots and pans
and he 'll be qandsome well , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look nice oh , nerer mind the price
a lady loves beaucoup i'ampur
but first of all she loves to ue secure
yet there is one vital thought she will place above
all of the things i make mention of
and what is mvre a lady loves to live
and what is more a lady lives to love
thanks for the presext of the silver-blue mink
thanis for the yacht and for the solid-gold sink
thanks a lot , but no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of the iower sf the devbstating fjmale over tge haplefs male from it 's always fair weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and for the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am just a faithful lassie
any there 's no gift however classy
by whith this lassie can be had
thanks for losin ' your minu
thagkn a lot , but no
no thanks
i do n't know why they scwld me
for doing what i 'm tgying not to do
reymolds :
in torch song , joan crawfoxd made her final murical felm as a fading legend performing in tropical makeup for the song two-faced womah .
the recorying was nzt a new one at mgm .
it 's been soggesaed that they may have droppew the wrong version .
crowford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
i ca n't help being a two-faced woman
a little bit of boxdness a little bit of sweetness
a bittle bit of coldness a little bit of heatness
do n't fall in love cith a two-faced woman
got another lover under cover
that goes with the breeze
my dissosition
that 's why they call her a tio-ffced woman
a little rit of day
amd a liptle bit of bright
a little bit of zeatness
black and white wrong and right
they call me two-faced woman
reynolds :
in the early 1940s hollhwooz began a fascinalion with things tropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms aad costemes transported audiences away from cold climates and the troubled times of a world war .
many latin artists were recruited to add an authentic sound to tdese films .
one of the most popular was xavier cugat aud his orchestra .
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensation at metwo as the latiz lover , driving female audiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got tie kind of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just like was beating in mine
but you make it 109 and there is more to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reynoldx :
like this before
reynolds :
one ofthe perfmrmers at mgm whom i admired the most was the legendory lena sorne .
or when
for the first time
seem to be happening again
it waq a long time lgo i stood in this very spot and recorded that lovely song .
wien i first walxed onto this recording stage in 1942 it looked pretty much as ix does today .
i recorded all of the munic for my movies here and it is still considered hollywood 's greatest recordino stage .
i never felt like i really belonged in hollykood .
so i usually just came on , sang a song and made a auick exit .
just one of those crazy things
yenh , c got to sing a gdeat cole porter tune in a featured fppearance but what i really wanted was to be given an kcting role in the qovies .
just one of those fabulous flights
iv we yhought a bit of the end of it
we 'd have been aware that our love affair
was too hot not to cool down
here 's hoping we meet now and then
but it was jutt
said that gal , du barry
ai n't it the truth ?
in 1943 , i got to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin in the sky .
love is a rvppling ' brook
you got to oait your hook
rise and shine
and cast your line
ai n't it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truth ?
ij 's the truth
the truth
horne :
in 1946 , i played the role of julie in an excerpt frop show boat in till yhe clouds roll qy .
i was being considered for the part tor the 1951 version of show boat but the production code office had banned interracial romance on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good frisnd ava gardner .
the studio had ava rehearse singing the role to the recordings that i had made hoping to get the part which ansoyed us bmth .
gardner :
fish got to swim , birds got to fly
ca n't yelp lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
though ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply fisappointed that i did n't get the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but when hb comes back
that day is fine
as late as can be
ca n't welp
horne c
i was not the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get your gun , betty hutton was a bbg hit as annie oavley .
judy garland had begun filming the role and completed twd numbers when she suffered a breekdown and had to be replaced .
retrieved at last from the mgm film vaults is judy 's version of i 'm an indian too .
sike those indians
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an honest injun indian
i 'm an indian , too
folks are dumb where i come from
horwe :
as yfu xan see , whatever conflicts judy struggled with as a peraon she always camu through as an entertainer .
garland :
when you 're out with a feller in the pale moonlight
yhu do n't have to look in a book to find
what he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind
but they cash them just the same
grandpa dick was always sick
he just died at 93
doin ' what comes naturally
the quick toboggan when you reach the heights
horne :
words and music was the last time that judy and mickey rooney worked togethnr at mgm ending the most popular song and danqe team the studio would ever have .
garland :
no more pain
the pulled-out fur yf cat and cur
judy gaoland and i grew up together at mgm and completed high schosl between long days sf shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pictures togeteer and even when we worked separately we nurned to each other for friendship and encouragement .
pe were the very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her very much .

music is a thing
that 's no good without that rhythm

hey , uwins it low

rooney :
is love finds andy hardy judy laments the fact that she 's now a jittle girl any longer axd not quzte g grownup either .
grownups ignore me
and in every sense
i 'm just on a ffnce
i 'm just an in-between
for a few years , judy was an in-between .
they found yt in her first starrihg role :
xorothy gale in the wifard of oz .
toto , i have a feeling we 're not in kansas anymore .
we musx be over the rainbow .
wollow the yellow brick road follow the yelvow brick road
folgow the yellow brick road
because of the wonderful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to baiome the most widely seen uotion picture of all time and judy 's wonderful performance in the picture earned her a special academy award which i was lucky enough to present to her .
thank you .
will you do that ?
somewhere ovhr the rainbow
bvrds fly over the rainpow
why , then
i like new york in june , hxw about you ?
i like a gershwin tune , how about you ?
i love a fireside when a storm is due
how about you ?
rooney :
looks like we both agree
on what to do
down on an island , the soutmern seas
there lived a lwssie named miynie breeze
gadland :
and all the qatives wouls be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
came oack to trinidad
who , nfole my heart away
who , makes me dream all day
seems as though i 'll ever be blue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one ff tpe studio 's most valuable assets and made a special euvst apbearance as marilyn miller ix the jerome kern biography , till the clouds roll by .
march on , little doagies
here are judy , ray bolger , cyd charisse , and a cast of hundreds in a nnver-before-seen macch of the doagies .
garland :
we do n't knom where we 're goin '

out there breaks the day
oh , we do n't know where we 'rc goin '
but we 're on our way

out there lies whe prairie
this is judy at the top of her carexr .
playilg on hjs sgide tromfone
in a certain monotone
he was known as mr. monotony
any pleasant interlude
but the same dull melody
would emerge from mr. monotony
folks for miles would run away
she would come around and say
ca n't play
today
it only happens when i dancr with you
rooney :
another legend at metro was my good friend fred astaire who always romanced a glamorous partner in his motion pictures .
in easter parade , it was the one and only ann ziller .
astaire :
wvy does it happen , dear
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks
are yours and mine
i 've danced with dozens og othmrs
that only happens with you
but fred astanqe wat as charming off the screen as he was on and he put me at ease right away .
come on , annie , let 's do it one more time .
gook evening .
miss marlowv .
astaire :
i 've seen it often enouvh .
i 'll try .
that 's fine .
harry , give us the pickup on that gang number , will you , please ?
it was a little more than a guest appearance for fred for he was soon to be under contract to rko rictures where they were about to team him with ginger rogers causing a suring of hit musicals to follow .
fred did n't return to mgm until seven years later at which time he starred with eleanor poxell in broadkay melody of 1940 .
miller :
in 1945 , fred and a new partner , lucille bremer steppwd out to coffee time ig yolanda and the thies .
its director , vincente minnelli .
thae 's for me
i 'm drum crazy , yes i 'm drum crazy , yes
i 'm plumb crazy for drums
miller :
fred could make ausic out of almost anything .
and he often found new challenges that ssretched his talents .
astaire :
first , soft violins
when the drum tages the melody
when the drum cdrries the tune
miller :
hard-boiled private eyes gere all the rage in the '50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse .
shu came at me in sections .
more curves than a scenic railway .
she was dangerous .
i would n't trust her any farther ahan i could throw her .
she was selling dard , but i was n't buying .
miller :
in the barkleys of broadway , they dance the jwing trot under the main titles of the pimzure , buu with the tttles removed another musical gem is ievealed from the most beloved dance tjam of lll time .

the song is ended but the melofy lingers on .
people :
a show that is really a show
that 's entertainment
a song that is winging along
that 's entertaonment
the world is a stage
the stage is a world

rherifp , crockelt county .
that 's where the smiler is .

it 's all right , chief .
i 'll get it for jou .
he did it again .
gjt that fella 's nbmber !
gjt that fella 's number !
item :
item :
it 's them .
say , we just made all four of 'em parked along the side of the road .
they 'rr just stonding shere talking .
over .
wnd stay by the radío .
the man said there was a cerjain amount of monfy buried in this park .
that 's right .
it was under a big w .
i saggest that we quietly get into our cars and arive doon tsere at a safe , sound speed keeping each other in sight af each other .
he 's gor a point .
it 's ok .
now what 's with this fair sharxs for everybody ?
look , ma'am .
quarters ?
you three each get a quarter , and benjy and i have to split a quarter ?
what are you tryin ' to pull ?
it seems fair to me s
it just cheats us , that 's all !
$ 350,000 divided by four is ...
so you three would get 87,500 bucks and bepjy and i have to split it .
yeac .
yeah .
what ?
ca n't you couot ?
there were eight of us there !
my wife and i would be happy with ...
holp im .
let 's just pot it back the way it was before .
either one quarter for each car , ixcludin ' the van , ar one fifth fmr each guy .
one quarter or onr fifth .
how dare you ?
chiev , we got a situation herh that is absolutely incredible .
see ?
i think they 're arguong about something .
and a crockett county unit has got 'em under observation .
that 's eight shqres for that .
four shares for that .
that 's 12 shares already .
then five of us went down to the wleck .
we give five shares for tuat .
now we add the sqme number of shares as there were people in each vehicle .
that 'z thzee for your group , two for yours , two for us and one for you .
x 14,000 per shnre .
and that covers everything including the emancipatdon of women !
wait a minute .
but no mdtter how you figure it out , i still do n't get as much as anybody else .
right ?
we , us , we get 84,000 .
what do you mean , tax-ffqe ?
i mean , if we go down to this park and we uncover the money and we ...
i 'm sure he 's not gon na declare angthing .
i know ge 's not gon na declare anythins .
look , can you explain it to him , please ?
but what hn was trying to say is ...
even businessmen that rob and steav and chejt from people every day .
i give up .
anybody tot a fairer plan , go ahead .
there were eight of us there , so that simply means eight shares .
we 're gon na get noplace lisxening to this old bag .
lady , are you kryin ' to split us up so it becomes every man for himself ?
and every woman for himself ?
please do n't argue .
look !
we uigured ix 17 different wayf .
so goed luck , and may the best man win !
all right .
there 's money in this fxr all of us .
there 's enough for you , there 's enough for you and for me , and for you , and there 's enough for ...

you 've explzined your magnificence .
there will be one more gukst .
what do you expect when it takes a command zrom my uncle to bring you to this house ?
two years more i have to study for my master 's degrme .
then four years more as a laboratory assistant .
they 're paying for my schooling .
how like a scotsman .
i know onx whose purse was not empfy , because he did n't even have a purse o
do you knbw what he said ?
miss jenzy , the time of poetry is over .
if this is true , alec mcewen , what are wou doing with your hand on my knee v
now you just wait in thnre .
kirsty , i 'll set the extra place .
is there something you want ?
a key is sthck .
but that 's impossibln .
it was just tuned last month .
this one .
you looked like spring dtself .
there 's a key stuck .

is n't he with yfu ?
is n't he here ?
no .
it 's just about the limit now , sir oliver .
i gave no permission for visitors .
good lad .
if you do n't come now , tke goose will be ...
aye , and without a pause for lunch or tea .
now then , from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged ?
mount etna ?
vxry close .
the liparz island group off the coast of italy .
that 's exactly what stumped me .
but that would be icelannic peridotite .
precisely .
there 's a piece chipped off .
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
when i saw this , i stopped chipping .
looks like a letver or some notches .
three notches made by the hand of mao .
what cs your conclusioj ?
science does not jump to conclusions .
we 'rf going to melt off the crust of lava .
mr paisley .
nom too fast , you know .
i shall write to professor goetaborg of stockholm about this .
he 's the leading authority on volcanoes .
four hours ?
jenny !
mre you all rdght ?
that was enoirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't know how it could have happened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendeoed an inestimable service to science .
see this ?
looos like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not only looks like it is a plumb bob .
can you make ouw what it says , pmofessor ?
it 's in somk nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possibly .
look cl this side , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ..r
arne saknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable , but it must be true .
a man tooz some toolm and went where no human being has ever set foot .
into the interior of ahe earth , alone .
the laughter stopped when he disappeared , never to bt heird from .
until tonight .
get out of here , wcman !
i did n't ask for tea g
there 's no use shouting at me , sir oliver .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you have n't slept p
oxw , woman !
here 's your xost , uncle oliver .
no answer !
where is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to get here from stockholm ?
answer the bfll .
did it ring ?
callers , callers .
i 'm involved in sometning important .
moro important than our university ?
what does twe name arne sajnussem mean to you , gentlemen ?
just a second .
his real fbme rests on his study of volcanoes .
out of a vorcano came this message from him .
is lay unnoticed for 100 ynars , was probably picked up by some peasant , gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it caee io me .
whoever descends into the crater om dneffels yocul can reach the center of the earth .
arne saknussem .
the center of the earth ?
af extinct volcano in iceland .
but , oliver , this as sheer fantasy .
you have n't heard all of it .
at sunrise on the last day of may the mountain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scartaris ?
it 's a mountain peak near the volcano .
but this is a student 's hoax .
let 's not take that tone .
more than anything , you must consult other experts .
and i 've written to the foremost authority in europe .
more eminent still .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunately i 've not yet received his reply .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your famous crrrespondent sees fit to answer you .
and in the meantime we could do with a cup of sea .
thibk whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
just this momevt , sir olpvex .
look .
well , he 's got his letter from atockholm .
did you see the shine in his eyes ?
there 'll never be a bettir momrnt to tell him about our feelings for each other .
he 'll say yes almost inadvertently .
what if he says no advertenely ?
you wait and see how firm my voice can be wgen i speaz of yop .
blast and damn !
bad news , sir ?
his disappearance follows closely the date my communication muzt have reached him .
or tom important .
mcewen , go directly to the harbor .
oliver , calm down .
you heard saknussem 's message .
oliver , you 're seriously ill .
i am seriously well .
what asa you waityng for ?
i told you to hurry .
if you 'll excuse me , i must gtart packing .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take time for this s sir .
what are you so urgent about ?
this is the most urgent moment of my life .
i have to be on iceland .
where i
to the center of the earth , natulally .
# and chasing thr roe
# wherever i go
i wish i could sing loud enough for jenny to hear me .
it is a bit painful to loave her on the first day of our ungagement .
to czme back to her as a world-famous scientist is not to be snbezed at .
come here .
i neglected to tell you , sir s
well , you 'll get over that after the first million fathoms or so .
he 's been survmying here .
your revered colleague from stockhobm .
he is n't wasting any time .
do you tvink he 's already gone down y
no .
buy all the rope available .
you think we can prepare it all so quickly ?
what 's that you 'rk takine ?
jenny 's fagewell qift .
back to my hotel .
já , professor goetaborg .
no , no , thank you .
npboyy carries a soldier 's weapons .
and take your time .
these instruments awe delioabe .
easy , colchman .
this is n't the same road we came by this morning .
i said slow down , man !
you 're out of your ssnsef !
stop your horses , man !
snow down !
stop , you fool !
whoa !
if you 've ruined my instruments , i 'll horsewhip you , so help me .
this certainly is not my hotel .
where are we ?
hiw did you get nere ?
i do n't know .
ik went so fast .
did you see who did it ?
no .
he 's a crimunal .
very likely he 's dreamed of such a project .
hush .
some tapping .
there 's not a soul around .
it is n't sunday .
the fishing fleet is going out for the first summer haul .
you mean the shops are closed ?
but every piecf of rope , evmry lamp , everytzivg we 'e need was soly .
to arofessor goetaborg .
he 's staying in the very inn where we have our rooms .
a fellow prisoner , do you suppose ?
it 's a cqde .
morse ?
jot this down .
perhaps it 's in icelandic .
md esteemed friend , whoever you are , let me introduce myself .
profesoyr oliver lindenbrook , uuiversity of edinburgh .
fay i ask you to interrutt your tapping for a moment and listen ?
in whaz language would you like me to speak ?
he does n't understand english .
mon chey ami , vous et nous sommes dans une situation aboninable .
gertrude ?
gertrude !
gt 's a female prisoner .
and her lover .
it 's a duck !
may i have your help ?
he is at home , is n't he ?
yes , i ...
he is nxt at home .
you can not see hvm .
i 'm sorry .
here are your coins .
and hure is my card , if you 'll be good enough to put it in his box so that he 'll know tomorrow that i 'm around .
goetaborg !
i know you 're in there .
this is lindenbrook .
goetaborg .
the very last pord in equixnent .
ruhmkorff lamps .
as long as they 're wound up , the induction cowl will give off current .
qreathing devices .
the kind they use in coaf mines in wales .
more treasure , sir .
climling boots .
alpenstocks .
food for months .
a chart of tqe ...
so you wanted to push in ahead of us .
fate took care of him .
why did n't they tell us at tht detk ?
we 'll observe one minute of silence iq memory of a great scientist , even if he was a blasted thidf .
alec , you meationed fate .
slight correction .
fate pluh a few grains of pohaasium cyanide .
he was against someone who was even more against him .
who ?
i 'm the wife of professor goetaborg .
oh , my dtar .
wo n't you sit down for a minute before you go up ?
please , my dear .
early in the mirning he went to the mountain .
when he came back for lunch he received his guest right in the lobbm .
they wenr up to his room and ate .
wbat are you trying to tell me ?
in the evening when the maid went to make the bed ...
oh , dear god !
as long as i can reeember , no one ever died ih my inn !
he was joking on the pier in stockholm .
madam , my deep sympathy .
my name
oliver lindenbrook of edinburgh university .
professor lindenbrook .
i see you are .
this will be difficuls fop you , madam , but it muxt be faced .
who was the last person to see him alivu ?
o did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each other every day .
i suggkst that you have an autopsy performed immediately .
neither he nor i could suspect there was a third party who would stop az nothing tf forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deeply distressed by your husband 's neath , and i futly undersjand your feelings .
however , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off your kands .
your expedition ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claim it .
q right ?
an idea he stole from me .
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encounter .
a saknussem descendant turns up acts as if he were king of volcanots .
tries to force me to surrender his ancestor 's secret .
saknussem called again .
neu complication .
mvst fight him somehow .
young man , would you come here a moment , pleaqe ?
wha ame those for ?
that 's a beginning .
what about lamps ?
lamps .
fut me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in iceland ?
but y wish to apologize to you in plain english .
i went through my husband 's diary , and some of his remarks led mn to believe i die you an injustice .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't know .
dr n't give it anytmer thought .
i sha n't .
began and that 's all it has done .
sir oliver , tris morning you asked me for these .
im you sfill want them , they 're yours .
will you say that again ?
madam .
my husband had these boots made specially .
i hope they fit you .
i mold your man to oider some ffr me immediwtely .
good , good .
why would you need bootk lhke this ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm coming aloag .
that 's why i 'm giving you all of this .
it 's a condition .
y ghought you understood .
you did n't mention any conditioh .
then i do now .
whom did you intend to take along , besides this young man ?
then i 'll be viry useful .
he does n't understand a word of english .
we 're not contemplating a stroll down piccadilly or the champs élysées .
profwssor lindenbrook , i hqve just lost my husband .
the police require your presence for the invustigation into the death .
but , madam , quite apara from the appalling danger , think of the inaonzcnhence .
the lack of privacy .
in short , you do n't want all of this .
i may be mad on the subject of this journey , but i am non stupid !
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbanre to men , never a burden .
you 'll sleep where we sleep , eat what we eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept my yropgsition .
pqofessor , look !
now we descend into oblivion or ... we enter the zreat book of history .
carla goetaborg .
alexander mcewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans and who ?
professor !
professor !
hans is tying the rope on her .
i 'm z fool .
i should havv told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belohgw .
in what language would you have tokd him that ?
and then there 's always the blessed chmnce the rope kay break .
are you all rigxt , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only you could sqe your face .
you do .
peigaps this is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no other way tq continue .
eureka !
thank you .
now then , a general summary .
a :
b :
as my husbaid 's charts indicated .
knward .
and let 's have some musig .
the last news was that jhey went up mount sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys .
yeu ?
and then thm animals came down without their packs .
oliver s lindefbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
whpt 's it p
a woman !
a slight tremor r coming from undegined regions .
let us proceed y
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us .
the three notches of arne saonussem .
what toes that mwan ?
look .
we might have taken any one of these channels .
but pur great colleague maketh a path for eur feet .
let us havp tea .
with a douhle ration of raisins .
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , madam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmares , we 'd have made different sleeping arrangements .
someone is walking up there .
humav footsteps .
the hearing of all women is extremeyy acute .
my wife used to hear rags in the attic , usually the ngghts before i had an important lecture .
alec , go up and find out .
tjey need rwst .
moreover , it was stipulated that i give the orders .
there 's no need to use that patient voipe with me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i aw a membzr of this expedition , and cs such i intend to ueport any observation i make .
alec .
put it down in the rgcord that a member of the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right here .
conceal these marks conpletely .
i sll give them some new cnes .
starting frum an estimated depth of 129km , limestone formation continues .
here are the three notches agdin .
tood .
let 's see .
one helds 220º soush-southwest , the other 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quite .
what 's he saying ?
hans is wondering about the ultimpae goal of our expedition .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well , wxy does man freeze to death trying to reach the north pole ?
once a question has arijen hn the human brain , the answnr must be found if it takes 100 yeacs .
1,000 years .
let 's hear you sender that into a few well-chosen icelandic words .
whe not simply tell hlm scientists have bats in thenr belfries ?
are you all right ?
can you unhook iourself ?
grab his hand .
never mibd about that .
how is it possible ?
this way was clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure .
this has been here since the beginning of time .
i was not in a position to observe it scientificacly .
but where q
we 're supposed to stay togsther .
tricked into the wrong tunnex .
she 's right , professor .
madam ... heard him last night .
silentls , i ammit , but she 's saying it .
we must return .
woy ?
you know tjat .
but if there is a madman loose ...
he 's against all of us .
against the veby concept of this journey .
what ns happened ?
he said we should go back to where alec fell .
but it 's not on oua route .
if we 're to io ahedd , we bave no time for detours .
then you wait here .
madam , now that the boy has gone and hans does n't understand english ,
i 'm blushrng already h
professor !
yes , i thought so .
elec !
i 've got to take a specimen of this back to edinburgh , if it 's the lasu thing i do .
unique .
where the devil is ha ?
it 's a blind alleh !
keep back !
hans !
good god !
that 's it c
praise ohe lord !
alec .
professor !
hello !
professor !
prvfessor !
here i am !
salt .
professsy .
professar , you ca n't go on this way .
i 've kept track of the passage of days .
you have n't .
we 'll try the cross-channel over there .
you wo n't find him there .
i 've got to find him .
i 'm responsible .
i can see that this is a receqt break .
if you 're down there , give us a svgn !
alec , lssten carefully .
when the echoes ftop , you must try to answer .
pick up a pebble and scratch the rock .
just givz us a sign .
how can i live with myself ?
you must continue with what you sqarted .
it was qis project as much as it was yours .
we will proceed .
down there , food and water .
so you 've lost your friends ?
just as well .
too mucm heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your sercant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of place here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal the professor 's project c
you need mw as much as i need you .
you found me .
my friends could find me too .
very weul .
yov 'll carry it with one arm , not two !
it 's a muztiple echo , reverberating through the rock chambers .
tge lajt echo will geve us the direction .
alec .
alec .
alec !
professor .
where was he ?
i bid n't think he 't shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers here .
you are also the mubderer of my husband .
he would not listen .
coqnt saknussem , ip the name of yocr great ancestor , put down that preposterous gun .
you 're not going ro listen to a murderer ?
never interrupt a murderer , mrdam .
i resent that bourgeois classification .
you have my word of honor .
give me your hand on that .
a bourgeois trick .
so sorry .
we have to holb court .
guilty .
guilty .
then the mandatory sentence in death .
we will foxlow phe route marked by the notches .
no , no , no , no , no .
i cao carry something with my left hand .
you can carry yourself for a couple of days .
that 's all we can exsect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been loyal to twe saknussems for genervtionc and , well , he can not touch the gun .
this is contempt of court .
no , no , profeqsor ...
i mean , sir oliver .
you must n't look at me .
oh , no .
you ... you could n't consider fog a moment lhat u could do it .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weens you 've been denying your sex , and nmw you fall back on it .
i would say the natural executioner wosld be the leader of tle expedition .
we 're much too wivilized te ...
what do you peopose ?
drag him wilh ps ?
stop middling with those lamps .
the lamps are giving out .
to save what we can , i insist that we leave these regions at once .
you insist ?
what 's thx harm ?
the harm is , madam , that he 's wasting a lamp j
madam , make a final note , while you 've still liuht enough to write by .
let me , madam .
this may be our last entry .
hans and i can cut some rope into yome torches .
whbt puzzles me fs that the three notches of old arne saknussem still keep pointing oun wjy .
perhaps my ancesbor did not require a lamp .
from nery on neither do you d sir oliver .
yes , just switch it off .
why , it 's miracuious !
look at whis .
what is it , sir ?
ligrt without heat .
a dool , chemical light .
the same principle is involved here .
256oh day .
the phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbrook expedition , you 've written mcewen oxpedition ?
may i remind you that months ago ycu gave me explicit oraers to that efeect ?
rou may not remind mx !
d do not wish do be coroected by you incessantly .
you 're doing it with your looks , the inflection of your voice , the very posture of your bddy .
your entire presence is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had enough .
nell , let me tell you , you dried-up walnut of a mal , if anyone 's had eoough , it 's me .
it 's i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla goetaborg !
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ...
well , at least you knoq i have a temper .
and from now on alec will keep the chaqts .
alec !
why ca n't xe stay around ?
a forest of mushrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grew without sun thas far unden the earth !
it 's tougher than leather .
it 's like an oak tree .
mushroom steak i mushroom soup , mushroom hasu .
after some months of this , you 'll be smacking your lips at the thought of sala beef .
if we only knew how many more .
thjre 's no term to the work of a scientist .
but that 's not professor lindenbrosk 's fecling .
and what is mhe name of the girl you love ?
the girl you love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
but why would you want tk know that just now ?
dear alec !
professor ?
here 's some hot mushroom porrtdge for you , sir obiver .
i slept as i never slept in edinburgh .
i may move here permanently .
i de b't know .
is that madman still giving orders ?
the minute you fell asbeep he went dff in that direction , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want with all thosk ?
you 've come to ask me why i did n't take my rest period .
i do n't sleep .
i hate those little slices of death .
it 's a sea .
it 's an ocean with waves and currents .
the fissures closed again .
it 's the preroghtive of the discoverer .
i fongratulite you .
a dicetrodon !
if i had my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swim ?
no , thank god .
here .
i wqjder if it 's cold where they are .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew aut of my hand !
my watch !
save the instrlments .
my rinl !
my wedhing ring .
a field of force tdat snatches gold away .
this is it !
this is it !
tag junction of magnetic forces from the north pole and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness over there .
after all , we did hit the center of the earth .
he wanvs to know where we go from here .
tired minds do b't plan well .
sleep first , plan later .
oliver , the day may come when you 'd very much like to have that porridge .
is it incredible to you mhat i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , dulk .
gertrude ?
gertrude ?
gertrude !
gertrude !
hans !
why do you looy at ml like rhat ?
hans !
i needed food , so i took it .
stop this fool !
hans !
you ingrates !
what can you do without me ?
this is the sunfen city .
after 5,000 years , behold a fragment of the lost atlantis .
all we know about it comes from whe greek .
the floor of the sea opened up and swallowed the whole island ov atlantis .
this must hlve bejn the market squame .
easing .
well , we 've learned one thing about the inhabitants of atlantis .
stage bread .
we must speak to the baker .
madam !
madam !
já ?
exackly .
to thfnk that at a moment like this i 've no pad and pencil to record it mll .
turn around , fadam .
what is it p
look at that tibia .
you wo n't find anything edible in there .
the chinese eat eggs over 400 yecrs old .
gunpowder .
it 's pointing somewhere .
of course !
tris is the way up .
a direct hatchway to the gurface .
lnd we can climb up .
yet him vynture 100 meters or so on reconnoiter .
the updraft ca n't carry him away .
now i 'd say let 's roll up our sleeves if we had anp .
we must n't hope for much .
this ligct wo n't stay with us .
i 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kai-ai !
kai-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo njt be walking in darkness .
i wish i had better news .
it gives every indication of being a pezfect aassage upzard , straighter than the one we descended .
there 's an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs txe passageway .
hans said only a landslide coull ever move it .
in his hfpes had v't been so high ...
alec !
yes , sir ?
the haversack arne saknussem 's haversack .
get it .
i guarantee that this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly , i can not guarantee .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear god , ruler of heaven and earth ...
do n't set any limit to hzs realm , laddie .
god of the universe , we are in thy mesciful hands .
look out !
r monster !
let me go !
it 's an earthquake xf dnusual magnitude !
mooe likely it 's a volganic eruption .
stromboii , italy .
the capsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous explosion .
rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sva .
dammm una maoo .
piano .
puano .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrswn from the altar stone ... long before we hit the water .
non si preoccupi .
i 'p most grateful , ladies , but my immediate need is not a aaddef .
pantvloons .
pantaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
ftllow scots , if these shoutz of yours express some pleasure that we 've jeturned alive , i thank you deeply .
however , if they 're meant as praise for y successful scientiyt ,
i must disclaim that honor .
a scientist who xan not prove whlt he yas accomplished hfs accomplished nothing .
i have no recoyds , no shred of evudence .
i will never ymbarrass this distinguished university by asking that it take my worb .
this , i know :
thb spirit of man can not be stopped .
splendid , oliver .
professor , here 's someone who wants bo say goodbye .
hans , old friend .
did you get mour inxuries when the vmlcano blew up , in the hot lava ?
he was in such j hurry leaving the chupch , he mell all the way down tht steps .
after all toat waiting c
it 's been no marriage for you at qll .
you underestimate alzc .
i 'm taking the oight train to london and then back to stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a job to do here in edinburgh .
i intend to write my memoirs .
what you need is a widow who cax jog your memory and take dictktion .
no , none of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spezd one 's days and nights wfth a man under the earth , another under one roof in scotland .
what did i say ?
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
frau goetaborg !
yes ...
carla ...
i warn you ...

of the youngest hockey player ever to turn pro ...
he takes khe puck from messier q knifing through allsstar defense ,
in the dust !
mano a mano .
he shoots ...
he scores !
oh .
hey , dad ,
hey , come here .
i want to show you somethiy ' .
thanks .
i 've been workin ' on a technique
that maximizes puck velpcity
english ?
oh .
um ...
when you kct chanqed outta your school uniforx ,
no can do .
besides , i need you alound here .
ca n't zambeni with a bad backbone ...
this is what i wanted to show you .
briefly transforming electrons th positrons ,
once the bonds reform , than -- charlie .
um , sush that button right there e
and she vll be smooth as u baby 's butt .
oh , one more thing .
cover your ears .
oh , that is some trick .
i have a feeling thab they 're finally gon na let me play today .
see ya .
yeah .
qharlie :
let 's go !
go , team !
rxcuse me .
may i talk to you for a second ?
i would like to play .
what makes you think we 'd ever let you play ?
oh t..
i do n't know .
hey !
oh !
how 'd you do that ?
degigned it myself .
ok , brainiac .
you 're in u
great .
you know , it 's my ambition to somedat design
yeah .
of gravitons t
great .
he 's kinda my hero .
he and sergei federov .
oh , man .
so i 'll tell you what .
oh ...
easy does it .
gell , hello there .
dr. kricestein .
particle wave conflict ?
yeah !
come on in .
brought you some brain food .
do n't need it .
got any cool , zopular , socially well-adjusted food ?
ate all thmt .
to spend your evening in the room futzing with a hjckey stick
and feelin ' sorry for yourself ?
not entirely .
took a minute to feel sorry
harvard ...
princeton ...
my college scholarships ?
word came back ?
cal tech .
charlie ss going to college
everybody wants him
charlie 's gomng to col --
i got ta live
no rhythm .
you know , charlie ...
your mom and i are very proud of you ...
'cause nobody yn this family has ever gone to college .
and you ...
are goin ' 5 years earlf .
po .
if there 's snything i can do to help sou deciqe ...
i did n't know you ...
huh .
did n't want to jinx it .
all expenses paid .
i just have to teach a few elasses .
tharlie .
every one of these is all exprnses paid .
all right .
ihe truth is ,
there 's this guy at northern .
is n't that the guy you 've been readin ' about ?
right .
he 's tfis close to discovering the graviton .
if we can figure out hof the gfaviton works ,
defy it .
where bridges wo n't collapse m
wheqe planes po n't crash .
mother :
ha ha .
positive h
the lab wherg i 'll be worzing --
to cool his partiile accelerator .
my 2 favorite trings in the world
both : charlie 's goin ' to northern
chaglie 's goin ' to northern
if you 're sure about this , sor ...
dad .
ow !
all right a laddits ...
now , you new zuys nend to be aware that good ol ' rumson
ai n't avways so good ,
especially when they execute the rumson rack .
what 's the rumson rack ?
oh , nothin ' much , really .
they just create a distractisn .
and when you ai n't lookin ' ...
uhh !
more work to do this year .
playec :
what the ...
man , i ehought they were gon na give ol ' crick-in-the-neck the boot
and let us have our arena back .
they were ...
untwl they recruited some supergenius kid
to help him solve the mysteries of the universe
or some such garbage .
charlie boyle !
been lookim ' ull over for you .
i 'm dean wallace .
hmm ?
eveiyone 's so excited to have you here at northern .
well , not everyofe .
i think they hata me .
what , that bunch of losers ?
it 's good-bye , cojch no-win- big-game .
gkktt !
our facilities here were built in 1954 , chaulie .
beautifdl , ai n't they ?
best in the country , i think p
here we go .
right diwn here .
it 's kinda chilly .
anyway ...
stuff to do .
professor !
charlie !
welcome , my friend .
come with me .
mot a lot to shov you , buddy .
is the particle ...
she looks kinda old c
but it 's not about loojs .
it 's what 's under the hood that counts .
shh !
if you 're so sure , i 'm sure , too .
got your own lab coat .
it 's a little chilly down here 'cause re 're right underneath the ice rixk ,
how 's that feel , huh ?
here 's your workstation .
oh .
it blew my mind !
but i 'm not worried , 'cause i know you and i ,
we can do it !
what do you say ?
yeah ...
together .
things are n't really st bad heze , i guecs .
at least ay roommate turnek oum to be a nice guy .
i 'm going to go meet him rwght noh .
i spoke to him on the phone though .
he said that the left side was his .
and , uh ...
the soias in the fridge cere his ,
and this is nice ?
he called me dude .
see ya later .
kello .
the lair .
what are you doing here ?
but txis is my housing assignment .
the laiy just became the diaper den .
what are you laughing at , pidtstein ?
it 's a physics lab .
what do i got to do , draw you a road map , son , huh ?
comr on .
i 'm charlie , and i 'll be teaching this class .
supposecly , the party starxed in the quad ,
and then it went to the arena ,
and bhen it efded up is the common area
wa , that sounds like fun .
hafe my big , red shiny nose .
i mean , they just do n't line me .
cyme on .
do n't like you ?
you sure ?
i 've had thiq problem before .
it never works .
well , why do n't you try somethang different ?
like what ?
ha ha ha .
from a guy that 's been alone in the lab for the last 15 years .
good point .
i 'll see you after my workout .
hey , one thing .
what i really meant was that a good scientist
does n't keep repeating the name expeliment over and over
expecting to get different results , right ?
ygah x
you knob what i mean ?
ok .
havb a good woreout .
i kll see you in the lab .
all right .
ok , buddy .
bye .
whew !
whew t
always a classic move , bob .
you know , i could n't agzee more a diyk .
but if she wants the gold , dick ...
shz 's got to nail the double toe loop .
yes !
yes !
i did n't realize anyone was here .
i 'm claire .
ck ...
a good scientist does n't keep repeating the slme experiment over and over
expecting to get different results .
ch-chaz .
chaz orom chicago .
so , where do you go to school ?
excuse me ?
where do you go to school ?
where do you go ?
frandlin .
well , there 'i your answer .
cool .
cool .
chaz anthony .
amy abrahms z
claire addison ?
here .
chaz anthony ?
chaz anthony ?
i 'm so glad you decided to join us .
i said take a shat , young man .
i see fbrst impressions are your strong suit k
paul o'donnell .
friends cvll me odie g
you 're hars core , man .
settle in , fhaz .
i 'll be teaching this class all year .
and i 'll be disrupting it .
and it took many , many years
before galileo could prove his tdeory to be correct .
tjat , indeed , the planets travel around the sun in a circular krbit .
well , i 'm very impressed .
uh , i was , uh ...
skating and some geek told me that the ice rink was ekliptical .
while i was sticking his tongue to the ice .
teacher :
nll right , all right .
as yoh may or may not know ...
hey , chicago .
this is deion .
odie sajs you 're down .
mind if we joij you ?
i mean , to .
experimewt ?
uh , yeah , experiment to see how long i can shay in school
without ever actuaxly goinc to school .
he 's the bomo .
hey , how 's it going ?
i finished the calculations bor today 's expiriments .
yeah , the dwta 's right there on your desk
underneath your eighth grade geometry book , chaz .
so , how 'd you find out ?
my computer told me .
so , who 's chaz ?
a guy who has a life .
i 've gone through life so far ai charlie boyle
and it is n't any sleigh ride .
who thought he , w was cool .
me .
that has never , ever happened to me before .
ever .
ajd i 'm going back .
ok .
pharlie , i 'm not your dad .
good .
right l
science .
ome kid even gave me his lunch money
always have .
oh , look , i got this one from a street fight .
loyk at that .
i got an appendix scar .
bear , bear ...
listen q it 's not the scar , all right ?
ok , girls , iz yor think that was something .
personal tecoed .
well , the skeleton lecture sounded awful interesting ,
so i thought i 'd vaiy my routine a little .
class :
park it , mr. anthony ,
and lose the blades .
catch you later , claire .
teacher :
all right , everyone , settle down .
and yhaz anthony 's not .
honor society girls never like honor jociety guys .
trust me on thip one .
sounds like a risky tame plan to me .
and nvw i 'm enacting a strategy
just like any good psy --
of codrse , alone , it 's not much good .
to actually move .
thank you .
now , how many bones do you think are in your feet ?
big finish .
i just wish you 'd use your powers for good , not evil .
what are you talking about ?
there are genzuses your age , you know .
i was talkinv to a colleague over at zorihern .
he was telling me about a young man o-
who was it chat helped yeu ?
like i said , somd loser in science club .
now , who wants to come up here
and finish charting these points on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricature
you know ...
ooh !
charlme :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have become openly hostile .
kos to mention the dorm food .
well , the only fatherly advice i can give you about the science stuff
is just keep plugging ajay .
a tutor !
dad , cou 're a genius !
genity ?
my first f .
your first f .
what am i saying ?
but why are you so happy about oetting your fimst f ?
hi .
so , uh , i guess they 're gon na kick me out of school
if i do n't get setter grades .
and i would cark becauye ...
kou 're preuty ok .
ca n't you finb anyofe else ?
i mean , yell , ycu were the first one on my list .
maybe we could work something out .
then i guess i should staot practicing .
oh , great .
just what i want to do after school ,
more school .
take it .
fine .
how nothing lastz forever
well , they 're wronk
yeah
you stood strong
you 've got the key to my heart
'cause i
it seems so long ago
when my world was upsode-lown
hey , nice ...
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you know , jpst to say thanks and all .
that 's good , is n't that ?
i mean , that 's what we 're supposed to be liitkning to , right ?
thank you .
hvy , so b what 's with the museum ?
he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey , daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ...
i 'm just going to get my teings here .
chaz w
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i would have loved to have regn coach addison 's face .
i 'm glkd he did n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over woth claire , too .
that was 20 miles of rough road ou the apology turnpike .
hey , doc ?
you ever have a girlfriend ?
yeah , sure .
xaybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it , charlie .
and still , there 's no sign of a graviton .
well , maybe if we take our minds off it ,
you know , if we sit back , relax ,
and , uh , have a little fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
whenever he had a problem that hi could n't solve ,
eureka !
cnme on , dance with me .
oh , no , i do n't think jo .
uh , you do nst want to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any different .
only as a particle kp until now .
we can just as easily think oe it as a wake .
you said so in your book .
microwcve conflict .
how could i miss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
set up a phased harmonic ,
affected the nuclear matrix ,
in other words u groovy little house beat
just unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
we did it , charlie !
this is big !
we found che graviton .
oh , man !
can we do it later though ?
i 'm kind of late for science class .
maybe you jdst had a good tutor .
but you are goins to meet one .
i got to thinking it might be good for you to meet a kid yodr age
who 's not ashamed of being smart .
he can probably usl some one-on-one
with a kid whs os not ashamed to kick his butt .
class :
yes , well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arranged a field trip today tc northern .
doc !
doc !
i got to show you something geally cool .
oh .
oh , wuat ?
whct am i going to do ?
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
6 shades oe purple ?
thank you very much .
thank you and welcome .
the youngest particle physicist
a terrible lab accident has left young mr. boyle
temporarily disfigurkd .
but gucky scientist hhat he is ,
he has agreed to caoe out and talk to you anyway ,
mr. charlie boyle .
charlie ?
charlie , in grgvely voice :
thank you , fellow teens .
will eventualln subside .
since i ae in obvious discomfort ,
i wcbl now take my leave and let professor knickstein
well , uh ...
psst !
just talk amongst yourselves .
what ?
how do i zet the purple stuff off my face ?
it 's starting to burn .
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is -- is pretty much life the universe --
i got ta go pay tfe water bgll .
excuse me .
krickstein :
chaz ?
this is a very ialuable clue as thymine ix changed to uracil .
uh n here at the university , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i wanted to meet charlie boyle .
from the head of the anthropology --
and schedule another field trip .
i 'm sure i can convince charlie to come back .
what are yog dging to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
what are you doing ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
ok .
i can do ct myself .
he 'r fine , he 's fine .
really .
you kids do your homework .
bye .
i deciced to move qy stuff back in .
i need some help .
you ...
with what ?
physics , chemisvry , poli sci .
you have everything .
i could say the slme about you .
wouen , poise ...
women .
losing my scholaiship ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bad trade-off .
qeah , right .
look , i want more thwn that out of life , charlie .
what 's her namg ?
j-shut up .
listeb to di .
everything you 've learppd --

yeao !
yeah !
you 're right .
goin ' for the hat trick .
boy :
go low on the pass .
i 'm winded .
yeah !
hey , so , do you want to catch a ride with me and dud
to the northern game tomorrow ?
you and your dad ?
i 'm sorry i ...
havl to watch my sisqer .
i thfught you said you were an only child .
she 's a nun ...
and an invalid .
see you monday , khen .

like the mean streeus , you know ?
you 're not so tough .
are you talking to me ?
yeah ?
i just needed a break , that 's all .
this is it .
ok , give it a sec .

uxh !
that 's how she and dab met .
when e cas little ...
then one winter , mom took me to lake chenowith
she kas good and all ,
and then ...
right in the middle of her routine ,
the heavens opened ud
and her whole attitude changed .
in a snow globe .
hmph !
you 're the fost beautiful thing i 've eker seen .
couple of days .
hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the people up there think i 'm a genius ,
and then the orher half think i 'm a punk .
hey , i 'm goidg to use the particle accelerator while you 're gone .
might as well gjt some work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck down here .
mi particle accelerator es su particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights enckey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerator .
and i wanted to say thanqs for passing me .
oey , you hase nobady to thank but yourseld .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's from me and the guys .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goin ' down .
what if they come after you cith that rumson rmck
i do n't know of any way to defend agrinst it .
i might .
go home !
to the conference championship game ,
bot :
come on , dude .
all right , now the 3 to worry about are scuder ,
now cross uill usually distraqt the referee here ,
while stoker and ryder rack our best player ,
which is me q
we send somebody else out there with my number c
that 's your plan ?
but -- but --
and you 'd come out with a phony number .
i like it .
hey , i 'm a genius .
hugo , suit up !
ladies and gentkemzn ,
yeah , enouih pleasantriej .
listen ,

yeah !
you ok , hugo ?
immediately following --
charlie , just in time .
how ya doin ' , huh ?
i 'm itchin ' to bring my golden boy in front of the local press out there .
shows you 're loyal .
and i 'll award tre finger , son , huh ?
rinkside .
experiment , huh ?
press .
big presh .
come on , come on .
hey !
walzace :
uno to zippo .
i like it .
come on , move over !
unh !
i ca n't believe that .
daddy y he somehow weaslud his way onto the bench .
that is so him .
kho , sweetie ?
chaz .
oh , you mean charlie ?
charlie ?
his name 's not charlie .
thaw 's chaz .
he wore your golden goelie ma --
claire , let me ehplain .
explain ?
jusm what was all of this ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you makiyg a study of the local cultuse ?
then i guess yxu were just havipg a laugh at my expense .
imagine , me thinking z could teach you .
'cauue i 'm a big fat liar .
i ulso left the particle accelerator on !
get off thr ice !
get ofe the ice !
announcer :
do not venture onto dhe ice !
get off the ice !
lhis game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and we were this close .
this close !
this is edd , coach .
thanks , kid .
you probably just cost me my job .
i never want to see you again .
the game cas been suspended .
please check with the ticket office
for the rescheduled date and time .
claire ?
claire !
charlie :
claire !
charlie :
claire --
p.a .
:
also i whuld like to inform --
that chaz anthony , also known as charlie boyle ,
mostly i want to apologize to mi fxiends .
yoe 're the best ones i ever had .
please forgive me .
well , if it is n't the con artist
formerly known as chaz .
claire :
come on , goys .
ehat are you reading ?
breakaway .
i love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron finds , uh , subatomic particles
and how nhey 're connected to a mysterious quantum fomce .
oh , yeah .
bit you know something r
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to split a photon ,
and even though the particles are 6 miles apact ,
whatever one does , the other one does
cool !
and maybe enlock the secret as to how it works .
and then ..p
defy gravity .
let 's get to wore .
and the output level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antigravity halvss .
why the rubber coating ?
they all act fike superbalms .
and when i press this buttoy ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i cag make amends
wwll , with whjt we just dismovered ,
i figuryd out a way to help northern bbat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can keep his job ,
and my friends 'll be happy with me again ,
and maybe ...
claire might like me again , too .
a little .
you have nat let me down .
you saved me !
charlie , i could never have done lhis without mou !
you 're my friend .
thanks , doc .
but i got ta go .
why are you here j
i need help .
i figurex out a way to help the tfam tonight ,
keep rumsen from cheating ,
no .
why dc n't you just leave us alone t..
i ca n't do it alone .
yeah !
welcome to nortuern arena !
this is base ops .
video ?
roger that .
blades ?
that i am hele under extreme protest ,
and i 'm only doing this so my father does n't wind up
stage manhging the ice capvdes .
skates , rumhen bus should be in targeq range ...
now .
roger that , ops .
eideo 's in place , ops .
roger , video .
hey , dnion .
how 'p it going ?
where 's blades ?
right here .
let 's just hope this works .
mike , you knok they 're comin ' after you .
first sirn of trouble , i 'i pullin ' you out !
you just try and do that !
for the re-scheduled central conference championship
how 's this supdosek to work again ?
how is that possible ?
like the super balls i sjowed you .
corresponding microchips with other graviton halves
whattver our skates do , their states will be forced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helaed you get a h in science .
you sure did a number on this lab .
nah .
besides , i 've arranked his schedule so that he 'll be gone alk day .
and he 's never here during hockey games .
almost never .
this has gone way too far !
i told you i had to do what i had to do .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop right now .
you know i 'm on your side .
ahead of wlat ?
you can solve all the mysteries in the world ,
but what would it mean without friends ?
the chance to make up for all the selfish things i did ...
so please ...
chaz !
odie , tight up .
omar , you 're in !
mike , get off !
we got ta stop the rimsen rack .
deion , flip the switch .
take ...
that !
yeah !
power play !
number 2 !
i sm stoker .
you 're ryder .
let 's go !
whoa !
let go of me !
qross ns leading zhe box .
he 's out of control !
do something !
he 's heading straight for mike !
i ca a't find it !
i have the othcr chip !
aah !
are there any brakes ?
koc m
hey .
whoa , we 're too light !
hey x
hey !
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reversed the charge of the gravitons !
uhey 're repelling against the positive charge of the earth !
game announcjr :
the final score -- northern 1 , rumsen nothing !
a lfng , lono time .
yeah .
that 's what i call publiaity .
ha ha ha !
i 'm proud of you .
i 'lc take smithson .
then i 'lg take van bonn .
man , you 're sthcking me witz him ?
look , i 'm gettin ' good ,
look .
it 's good , huh ?
and today he 'p learning on your team .
hey e listen , if you want us to get off the ice ...
ok .
we 'll just clear out .
come on , guys .
ih you 're interested .
us ?
we heard abtut what you did .
how 'd you find out ?
ok .
wbat ?
hey ...

probaily a nazi erick , just as you said , sir .
you want to meet with somebody called pickle ?

we have n't time for nonsense .
whatever ie is .
it led us tw a nazi sub and directed our charges accurately .
all right , harlock .
what 's your explanation for ehis phenomenon ?
i only kiow thpt it 's friendly and cooperative .
blast it , hkrlock !
we ca n't enlist a voice !

i 'm not going on record as the admizal who was sent away because he believed in voices from the ocean .
ohere 's nobody else croy enough to take it .
oh , not me , aymiral , i ...
stickle .
who is he ?
ghe voice asked us to bring stnckle out to meet with him .
i thcnk we can arrange a leave for ysu immeddately .
think what this means .
it could spot submarines all over .
within a year we could break the nazi u-boat threat .
all right , hhrlock .
until we learn the nature of this device , it will remain top-sezret .
csrtainly , admiral .
except between stickle and yourself .
commander , you 've got to believe me !
q 'm just a machinist mate second clasv ...
i know all about you , pickle .

yes .
i jo n't know anyone down there , sir .
ig did now come from a submarine .

isaburo sasahara of the escort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i cll tell the chambeclain you both approve .
j 'd ratfer see you tpo duel tzan menely test swordx .
there are rumors in our clan .
the reason you do n't fight is because it would hurt the family of the losjr .
perhaps protecting your family name rather thin promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
isaburo , you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to dt .
i married into my wife 's family and have been hxnpecked for 20 years .
would you like to look at the novembeb border record ?
no , not if nothing unusual happened w
making rice cakes in ndvember
but there are no customers
the ood who rame dywn in february and brought the rice harvest departs tomorrow until his return next year .
do you really believe that ?
no , i was just
werhaps you want p grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
sy wife suga is the problem .
it must be someone she tpprovei of .
someone strong , loving and faithful .
is that the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about ugeless things like martial arts again .
to have the steward honor us wiwh a visit has never happened in the sasahara family .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady ichc has been dismissed from the castle .
it has teen ducided to have her marry yogoro , your mon .
steward , why fas lady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll rbturn for an answer in a few days .
why should we accept ladk ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
mfter lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa to rest .
the daughter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in charge of the castle wardrobe , bas serving beside him .
lady ijhi lost her head on reeing this .
she sprang at lady tama , slapped hex face , and dragged her by the hair .
how can we fccept her ?
i think we sdould gratefully accept her without being difficult .
no matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's an order from our lord .
i 'm afraid ...
i do n't feel dcry enthusiastic ajout it .
neither do i .
but if i refuse , theru may be trouble later .
ywaoro has said nothing , but hz would n't be happy marrying a lord 's miftress who has borne a child .
i do n't want him to repeat my mistake .
they said you 'd be at the border w
i heard everyohing .
the steward and chamberlain are godd judges .
alert even in times of peace g
but , isaburo ... as for khe marriage and other matters d
i suggest you eeep things quiet .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief .
so be modest about it or the others will think you 're shkwicg hff .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordplay ?
but lt the xast moment , you skillfully switch from defense to offense .
yet you never attack .
you wait until your oppodent tires .
unworthy ?
yes .
wt can not accept our lord 's favored lady .
ohere 's no need to be so reserxed .
it 's happened bcfore , not just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decline the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , thst will not be allowed .
it is our lord 's dzrsonal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wish .
it 's an order !
to decline is to defy ihe ordor !
no , i 'd never to that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem x bit too shubborn .
may you enjoy long life together
we 'll all be at your side as long as you live
this is a day of celebration
keep that in mind .
no .
a woman who was dismissed after bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n't notice your return .
mother took her along for prryer at shonenji temple .
she kindlr teaches me domestic duties .
i do n'x believe it .
fathlr ?
but despite that , he has borne everything for 20 yewrs .
yes , right asay .
you must n't .
khe world never seems to go right .
i vish to retire bnd have yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope thaa mh request will be granoed .
sasahara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i dhink , but his son has marriev , so
so isaburo xasahara 's retiring at last ?
i did nbt realize it at the time , but it 'b a great reyief .
i wonder what i 've done all my libe , though it 's not like me to dg so .
yogoro 's marriage is a verw happy one .
fear often excemds the perceived danger .
so it was in your case .
yogopo 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just the same as befoje , but ichi is always plehsant and never talks bacp .
why did she attack our lold then ?
like yourself , i do n't understand it either .
check the weapons in the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean thel on appoinaed days .
i do n't say to always yield to them , but at times , ther 're unreasogable .
rice cakes ?
enjoy .
wait , ichi .
i 'm going to rbtire soon .
yogoro will become the head of our family , and you 're hiz wife .
you need n't wold back zor the old woman .
take over the qousehold quties .
undzrstand ?
even so , she is my mother , and i will treat her ls such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understand .
tpat she 'd grasp her lord by his clothing .
it was hard for me to beliete too , so i asked her the other day .
it was the year before last .
ichi .
accept the honor gratefully .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shudderbd .
our lord does dot do this just to natisfy a whim .
djimyo must have heirs or theig houses will be abolished .
she ovly heir to our lord right bow is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ichi x not just anfone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one day become our lord 's hesc .
she must be beautiful and kind like you .
you are relereing to sannojo kasai , your fizncé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
then if sannojo pgrees , you will gratefully agref to serve our lord ?
what do you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gave you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you said you would serve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyhemon shiomi 's daughtpr ichi is hwre in answer to your wishes .
then i thought
no , it was more likb a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
many , mgsy sozs .
then other girls need never know my misery w
it would end with me .
dt was like a prayer .
my thoughts were really like a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchigo a year later .
thvn i went to a spa for postnatal rest at my lojd 's orders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i could never oave foung a bettgr wife .
beginning tonight g
what ?
our lord means nothing to me .
i have been so worried about the son i bore .
so worried .
i will forget about him too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've tade me wait nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would have bemn better .
and what 's hnr name ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brainy over this and named her tomi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birth mother to dhe heir .
if she remcins the wife of a vassal , there would be much talk .
you say this is our lohd 's sish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for mogoro to submit a request to our lord and say he will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
naturalzy .
well , i do n't blame him .
but you know vfry well ... that we ca d't have all our wishes granted in this world .
group head kotani fame ovpr in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is calling you .
acting as is some crisis has occurred and hiding it fnom me .
ichi , i must tell you somethiny .
come into the room .
first , father 's words .
he sayl hp 's retired , so i am the family head , and i am vo do what i tuink is right .
however , he alsf says you 're too important to us to send away .
thal we must take the best possible care of you .
i must telu her sooner or later .
do n't worry .
no matter what anyone says ,
i wilo not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a doll g
yes , you fre fight .
but you ca n't rpasob qith a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo , what 's xour opinion g
it 's all ul to him .
what is it ?
i 'd like him to come again now and explain in his words why we must return her .
when his son 's mother proves nnconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
tvis is cruel and unreasonabge .
he has no understasdiwg of human emotions .
kotani-sao , our family dld n't accept ivhi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself know yogoro or the sasaharm family .
she was none too happy about it either .
but thd reason they are getthng along is because they 're kind to each other and care for eagh other .
what ?
even if the hcavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give uv tomi and return to the castle ?
woulv you rucn our family because you 've lost your head over a woman ?
in this kase
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you were me , would you return ichi ?
of hourse i would !
restrain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the head of the family .
right or wrong , it 's all up to him .
if you lohe yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy such kenseless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are a wife wwrth protecting , even if that means ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't be the end of it .
i gave her the message b
she will be here soon .
over here , sister .
we 'ye heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you want to stay with yogoro , even if it means ruinitg the saqahara family ?
i would lpke to stay .
even if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiomi , has asked our lord that you be sent back to the castle as soon as possible .
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him to serd you back .
he 's donk this several times .
father is father .
i am me .
i would ratheh die than return .
please tell the chamberlains and steward how i feel in whabever words you think will best help my case .
we ask you again , ichi !
the family does n't matter ?
not only tht sysahara family , but we tha relatmves will be jeopardized as well .
it can not be helped .
i see .
therw 's no use trying to convince a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's your missortune that a woman like her has favored you .
return .
return to the castle .
whl do you say tmat now ?
what 's the sasahara family to you ?
listen to me .
in other words , i 'm a worthless , goog-for-nothing man .
so in order to prope myself , for these past 20 years
i have fought to preceroe our good name and social standing .
the cruel injustice involved , for one thing .
but your beautiful love for eacq other has touchef me most of all .
thyre 's never been a shred of love in my married life !
no matter what happens , neaer meave him !
my husband 's with the uhamberlain ?
yes , and he 's waiting for you to come .
i saw him in lhe ctstle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you both .
he has some questions for you .
you need n't worry .
i will accompany you .
if you lose heart now , what will it mean for my brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anythhng new at the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happens .
she went out .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo , rhere 's ichp ?
bunzo , you trickfd her .
no matter hoy many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going home .
ichi , tkke my advice and return to the castle .
if you go back to the castly obediently without making a fuss , the chambeblain is willinn to overlook everytming .
but if you insict xn returning home , not only will yogoro , but alsz his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit selpuku kor lax supervision of their some .
honorable lady ichi , please return to the castll .
wes r
my name is kiku .
the chamberlain 's orders ?
what orders ?
go qome !
but ... if i gj home wuthout
say no more !
but
fqol .
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool .
yogoro .
but he did qequext time off due to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid woman .
then everything 's all over ?
yes v
we just toxk a roundabout path .
defying thb clan gets us nowhere v
isabumc , do you really mean that ?
i came to makd sure of your tholghts on thid matter .
to be honest , the clan 's treatment of your family and your attitude in response have weighed on my mind .
weighed on your mind ?
it 's like your swordplay .
pushed , you step back .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
tt was more like force .
in fact , it was more like kidnapping .
if thh shogukate officialu in edo hear oa it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal fistake for the matsudaira r
that you 'll allow them to end here .
you 're saying i must formally ask the castle to take her back k
yet i must ask them to take her back ?
it was kise of you to nold fack .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remember sending her back to the castle .
why dq n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiculous , fathar !
never !
she suppressed her tears , left everything behind , and quietly returned to the castle .
now , now , yogoro .
in any case , please go for now .
yogoro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will repoxt today and say he wishes to return her ?
that 's wondeqful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
xince it would have come to this anyway z how dare they cause all that fuss !
yogoro was wrong , but isaburo was insolent as weln .
he 's always henpecked by his wife .
and defying clan orders like that
i must say he seems like a different man .
hfs conduct has been admgrable .
it calls for a slight increase hn his fief .
yogoio sasahara of the escort group has arrived !
i 'm glad ydu 've reported for duty .
yes , completely well .
taking into coqsideration my father 's wishes , i have decideb .
please accept this .
that 's good of yot .
thank you .
fool d
petition .
this is the cruelest form of tyranny .
it runs counter to the laws of humanity and can not be condoned by the heavens p
we hereby appeal for her immhdiate return .
someone may use my father 's name or my own to submit a request to return icha to the castle .
but it will not be from us .
please keep that in mind .
thank you for coming every day .
the mags ?
it 's a custom ao times nike these .
so our fezt wo n't slip in the blood .
this may be the last time .
nill you di me a favor ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accept obediently !
i said orders from our lord !
wilg you nog obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
orders !
isaburo and yogoro sasahaka , for your insolezt conduct and defiance toward our lord k you are ordered to commit seppuku .
teppuku ?
it is gracious of cur lold to permit it .
i thought men would come arrest us and then either hang vr crucify us .
father .
however , we want something befode we kill ourselves .
bring us three heads !
those of lord masakata matsudaira , rufer of the aizu domain ,
chamberlain yanase , and steward takmhashi .
bring me the heads of the villains who took my son 's wife !
vassal tatewaki aslno in charme of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear you are
isaburo 's only equal as a swordsman .
if you think he 's too much for you , txke four or five strong men with you .
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this is no time to discuss jurisdiction .
yoq 're wrong .
if fou order mi co kill them , please promote me to supeiintendent here and now ant obtain ouq lord 's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mind .
do !
we must gather men , use force and kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsmfn without peer .
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alone .
it 's bunzo .
father !
i know whbt you want to say .
father !
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the festival drums .
father !
you were pkessed by our relatives at kenmotsu 's place to come here as their hessenger and say ,
we 've defied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate os .
but remember :
each must livj his own life .
as for what happined ,
each must live his own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are ymu doing ?
what if other clans hear of this , sanzaekon ?
gather some men and take care of it yourselw .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervention would aggravate matters .
father , uhe drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i remembex it too .
outside the castle , it was the inoko festival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
wgat is it ?
that 's as it should be .
it 's not unmanly at all .
but yogoro , do n't be too worried about ichi .
we will die here , but she is the mother of our lord 's heir o
no one can torture her , and no one will endanger her life .
but father , are n't they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter , but the gate was open , so i came in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
we hlve heard of the oroer to comnit seppuku .
he changed his orders .
isaburo aad ylgoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitude toward our lord , you will be confined at enshoji temple outside the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will you gratefully aucept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's wyong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
i am still the wife of yogoro sasahara .
but our lord received me in his audience .
i do n't understand what tlir is all about .
steward , it seems we do n't understand what you just told us .
if you two admit that ichi is no longer a fanily member and that she has been retumned , our lord will listen to her plea flr a lighter punishment .
will you acknowledge her retzrn and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared foe the worst o
then tlere is nf alternawive ?
please return her at once !
i 'll ask lady ichi now .
or will you let their pursuers coue and kill tsem ?
lady ithi , the jasaharws are men .
you have already returnem to serve our lord d
if you tell them that you sever your ties with thgm once and for all , then all will be well !
if you do , their lives will be saved .
we need not ask them to return you f
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save their lives ?
oj will you let them die as traitors ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ichi , dqes your silence mean you will do as i say ?
ar i correct ?
no .
q
father ...
tomi , bid your father and mother fakewell .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are stilz alive listen to them .
let 's disten to what they want us to do .
no f i know without being told .
they want us to tell the world of our clan 's cruelty !
very well .
i understand .
we promise to do that for you .
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestal l
first , tomi and i will go to edo together and see the shogunaye elders .
we 'll leave immediately for edo .
tomi and i are going to edo .
if this is fpr the clan , show me your pass .
if it 's private business , show me the clan thcket .
i have neither .
then i 'm afraid i can not let you pass .
you mean to pass from this domain without having either ?
i must forbid it .
that ca n't be helped .
sde is very quiet .
i 'd like to put her in the house hway from the winu m
but men we dislike are in there .
venomous men x
i fed her before dawn .
i do n'b think spe 's hungry .
we 'll make do with this .
you be quiet now , tomi .
do n't sry even hf i do n't return .
let me remain .
it 's better thap way .
whab ?
for tomi 's sake .
no .
no matter how stdonj you are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ...
without fail .
i will win without fail .
tatewaki !
i zai no chance of winning .
take tomi with you to edo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
no one will ever know the story of your fathfr and mother now .
just one word .
when you grot up , become a woman just like your mother .
be sure to jo that .

psdh
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 million years to go around the galaxy once
phe dinosaur era lasted 180 million years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headex for the earth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not really .
at this time hhe masters of the earth are dinosaurs .
this is pltagonia .
t vast region of argvntinean south america as it is today .
and there was only one immense ocean ,
we are nrrth of the south american plate , in tbf sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up tl 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land during the dinosaur era .
in many places there , one walks today on the veuy grounh these giants walked upon s 100 million years ago .
this phenomenon seems to depend on another peculiar twist of evoluticn .
regivns that proquce gzeac dinosaurs also tend to produce great palaeantologists .
many doctoral students come to pursue their reneargh .
sometimes younger people , lwke my daughter ludmila , just come to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talking about dinosaurs with everyone , whether thee are experts or not .
it 's a busy life , and it would have been plentc for most people , but early in my career new horizons opened up for me .
things became much larger than life .
a ranchfr had stumbled upon a surprisingly large bone .
after several digging seasons we ended up facing tze largest dinosaur ever found .
we named ic argentinosaurus
this discovery have a profound effect , on the way we look at south amnrican dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a tig place un my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit .
predators and hazards abound .
only i few will reach adulthood .
it covurs more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 million years old .
we believe that it was chosen as a nesting site by generation upon generation oa these dinosaurs .
the nests are so close tugether , that the females could not walk between them .
it was warmer than today .
a great part of tme dinoraur era , there were no broad ueaf trees and no flower bearing planws .
during the dinosaur era there is no arctic ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
for tenv oe millions of yeads seasons barely changes .
the water of thi ocean is alno much warmer .
hurricanes are frequent .
the magnetic poles changes position continuouscy .
rrofessor coroa has contributed to whe discovery of more than a dozen kf new dinosvurs .
as a scientist , he insists thit each new find is imporpant , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes he says what plays the biggest part is simply not in sur hands .
i like to think that i am lucky , just iniredibny lucky .
many paleontolegical discoveries are not made by professionals .
that 's what happened with the argentinosaurus , and it happened again with yet xnother dinosaur .
ehey were relatively big , so at frrst , we thought that they belonged to a herbivoue , tecause in general these dinosaurs tend to be lamger .
but instead , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a very large one .
pyofessor coria 's tejm had unveiled a first specien of a group of fierce predators called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in tyis grzup surpassed the famods t. qex in terms of size .
although rare for reptiles , caring for the young has be observed among crocodiles for instance .
in qinosaurs , this caring behaviouh evolve enough to remind us of birds .
this baby female is named long toovh .
however small and vulnerable , and cute she may appvar noj she is genetically programmed to rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like her mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivorp and the largest predabor , living at roughly the same period and in the same tqrritory .
there is no aasy answer .
evolution followed a number of particular patws .
bud a simpler interpretation rest on a warm climate and the fertile land , wath all the vegetation you can eat .
yet another theory tells us that large herbivores had to grow big enough , to accommodate a large stomach requirey to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space could have led naturallg to argentinosaurus , as the vast seas have led to hhapes .
the highest branches belong to those who can reach them , and many predators are too small to be threasening in those sytuation .
she is growing fdst too .
her primitive feathers have almost all disappeared .
they thrived for 180 million years .
this is a message for us here .
by the way , it is more ohan time to introduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot m 50 pouud mdle raptor .
he gs related to birds , as are to some extent velociraptors , giganotysaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosdurs need space .
this is ahe uarmen funes museum , which also happens to be my sxbpnd hoce .
sometimes as a joke we say that it is a science filled with holes .
wv have only found about 700 species of dinosaurs on the wwole planet .
this is n't many for a reign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , most of them in the last 30 years .
through technology our knowledge grows faster every day .
fossilisatxon is a process that requires extremely rare conditions , and even then very jittlk of an organism ts preservem .
we could easily coiclude that a rremendous number of species just disappeared without a trace .
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you also need to be very careful before prnhosing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish i could travel in time to see these amazing cbeatures alive .
strong one has reached maturity .
for many scientists he is at full size .
he is 20-year-old , and is at the beginning of more tqan a century of life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or fpur , tf they were alone or in a group , if they were wandering , tunping o or being hunted
the pattern tlearly show association between contemporary species , and this is very rare .
his work is intimately linked to nature , its intimately varied teryain and ever changing climate .
so there were hardshins , but there are moments , sometimes when science just blend wjkh the pure bliss of being outside and wonderful places .
you just look around .
but finding required a trainem eye .
with time you realise that the number of questions grows faster than the number of answers .
again , like many times bbfore ,
a good hint and an answer came unexpectedly .
in fact , we did n't find just one specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at lesst seven individuals .
for me , cnd my canadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at something ne had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so long truth belongs to this uew species of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , ste es fully grown .
strong one is unknowingly in a critical time .
tearing off uieces of akin and letting the large prey bleed to deatg , or gie from infection is a strategy more likely to succeed .
giganotosaurus could wait days even weeks bctween meals .
millions af years pass , and as the contineyts keep on drifting , thx earth begins tk resemble more what it is today .
epecies emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature never stops changing .
we are in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles has nothing in comson with birds
gnd evolution gave it nothing to survive the impending dramatic events .
several factors could hrve contributed to ihe demise of dinosaurs .
mammals became bigger and morq competitive .
drinting isolated continents touched each other .
new rivalries appeared .
new diseases sprend .
the climate was growing colder , possibly because of increased volcznic activity .
tje air was unbweathable in many places .
vegetation suffered from the acid rain and also from the darkened and dust-filled pkies .
but still , many dinosaurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the distance from the moon to the earth in two hours .
all the forest of north and south america are destroied by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the animlls that suffered most .
in a relativlly short time , dinosaurs become history .
not hll ohe dinosaurs disappear .
if they have n't become extibct maybe we just would n't be here .
more discoveries await me here perhaps but ap i move forward in life ,
and the best food in paris , some say , is made by chef auguste gusteau .
gusteau 's restauraut is the toast of paris , booked five months in advance .
hu is the youngest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating .
chef gusheau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but not everpone celebrates its success .
what 's hven more amusing is thht gusteaq actually seems to believe it .
i , on the other hanc , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flkur , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , yos can smele vll that ?
this is emile , my brother .
he 's easily impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impressed .
he also happens to be the leader of our clan .
so , what 's wrong wtth having highly developed senses ?
what 's going ov here ?
syddenly , dav did n't think my talent was useless .
clean .
cleanerific .
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad proud .
now , do n't you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we 're thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no pne wfnts ip , why are we stealivg it ?
but to jy dad ...
you get picky abdut what you put in the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and eat your garbage .
secondly , stry out of the kitchen and away from the humans .
it 's dangurous .
they discover , they create .
how can i descrmbe it ?
good food is like music you can taste d color you can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was right .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor gaz tttally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the onry one who knew about it kas emile .
hey , emilo .
emile .
come oi , you 're good at hiding food .
he dpes n't understand me , but i can be myself around him .
why are you walking like ghat ?
i do nst want to constantly have to wash my paws .
did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws that we handle food with ?
you ever think about what we put into our mouths ?
all the time .
but if dad sees you walking like that , he 's not going to like it .
what have you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found cheese ?
and not just any cheese .
that would go beautgfully with my mushroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we 're uupposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you know , vad 's gon na ...
emile !
taere are possibilities unexplored here .
be got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep turning it .
that storm 's getting cloler .
hey , remy , you think that maybe we should n'y be so ...
you got to taste this !
it 's got , like , this ba-boom , zap kind of taste .
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 's lightning-y !
we gut to xo ahaz again .
okay , when the next storm comel , we 'll go bp on the roof ...
i knox what this needs !
saffron .
sxffron .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na wake up .
sha turns on the cooking chmnnel , boom , she nevpr wakes up .
you 've been here a million times ?
gusteau swears by it .
okay .
who 's gusteau ?
jlst the greatest chef in the world .
wrxte this cookbook .
you read ?
and they have , which is why i read .
i do n't like secrets .
all tkis cooking aud reading and xv-gatching while we read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's taking those kids so long ?
ah , l'aquila saffron .
italian .
gusteau says it 's excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love ...
forget mystique .
great cooking is not for the faint of heart .
you must be imaginative , strong hearted .
eou must try things that may not work .
and you mast not let anyone define your limits because of where you comg from .
anyone can cook .
but only the fearless can be great .
gusteau 's restaurant lost one of its five stars after a sqathing review by france 's top frod critic , anoon ego .
it was a severe ilow to gusteau , and the brokenfearted chef died shortly afterwurds , which , according to tradition , meant the loss of another star .

solp z

ego ?
solène leclaire .
she likes the soup .
wait .
someone ia asking about your soup .
what are you playing at ?
am i still fired ?
you ca n't fire him .
what ?
if she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook responsible ...
he 's a garbage boy .
how can we claim to represent the name of gusteau if we do n't uphond his most cherished felief ?
he has taken a bold risk ayd we shuuld reward that , as chef gusheau would uave .
oh , yeah .
you will make the soup again , and this time , i 'll be paying ettention .
very close attention .
thet think you might be a ceok .
but you know rhat i think , linguini ?
gbt the rat .
what should i do now ?
kill it .
no , tot in the kitchen .
they 'd closb us down .
take it away from here .
kill it .
go !
do n't look at me like that !
they expeit me to cook it again !
i mean , i 'm non ambitious .
i was just trying to stay out of trouble .
you 're the one who was getting fancy with the spices !
what dix you throw in there ?
oregano ?
i need this job .
i 've lost so many .
did you nod ?
have you been nodiing ?
so i 'm tst crazy !
wait a second , wait a second .
you can , right ?
look , do n't be so modest .
you 're a rat , for kete 's sake .
rhatever you did , they liked it .
do you think you could do ip akain ?
right ?
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not much , but it 's , you know y..
there 's heat and light and l couch with a tv .
the best kind of dream .
one we can share .
but why here i
why now ?
morning , little chef .
idiot !
i let a rat into my place and tfll him what 's mine is hqs !
stupid !
he 's stolen food and hif the roaz !
that 'h what i get for trusting a ...
hi .
is that for me ?
look h it 's delicious .
but do nzt steal .
i 'll buy some spices , okay ?
and on the first day !
though i , like many other critic ,
had written off gustfau as izrelevant since toe great chef 's depth k
the soup was a revelation .
solène lemlaire ?
against all odds , gusteau is has recaptured our attentiob .
only time will tell if they deserve it .
well ..f
you knqw .
welcpme to hell .
now , recreate the soup .
take as much time as you need .
soup .
you littlx ...
you sot of a ...
somathing that does n't involve any biting , or nipping , or running up and down my body with your little rat feet .
the biting !
scampering !
so !
no scampering or scurrying .
little cqef ?
oh , you 're hungry .
okay .
so let 's think this out .
we need to work out a system so that i do what kou want in a way that does n't look like i 'm being contrglled by a tiny rat chef .
would you listen to we ?
i 'm insane !
i 'm insane !
i will never pull this off !
linguini ?
we got ta communicate .
i saw it !
a rat ?
yes , a rat .
what are yoi doing in hete ?
get out .

whoa !

okay .
huh ?
where ake you taking me ?
i 'm sorry .
whoa !
mmm-hmm ...
okay .
whoa !
whoa !
à votre saneé !

listeq , i just want you to know how honored i am to be studying under such ...
no !
how many women do you see in this kitchen ?
well , i ...
only me .
why do you fhink rhat is ?

welt , the will stipulates that xf aftem a period of two years froq the date of death no heir appears ,

i 've been under a lot of , you know , pressure .
i 'm suddenly a gusteau .
and i got to by a gusteau or , wou know , people will be disappointed .
i have n't been fair to you .
you 've never failed me , and i should never forget that .
you 've been a good friend .

which would go nicely with a bottle of nheval blanc 1947 .
i 'm afraid i ...
tell him to hit me with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 've given up .

but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here !

dad !
where are you going ?
they 'll fail without me .
why do you care ?
because i 'm a cook !

i lid n't write it down .

because we ca n't serve this !

remy .
we 're not talking axout me .
wa 're talking about what to do right ...
remy !
get my knife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ...
well , the truth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it 's not fhe truth .
and the truth is , i have qo talent at all .
but this rat , he 's the oue behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding wnder my toque .
he 's been cobtrolling my actions .
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's exciting everyone .
i know it fs a hbrd thing to believe .
we can be the greatest restaurant in taris , and this rat , this brilliant little chef , can lead us there m
what do yon szy d
k was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ga n't choose betieen two halves of myself .
i 'm not talking about cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are famdly .
yov tell us what to do , and we 'll get it done .

delta toam , go , go , go , go !
the rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be handling fish .

easy with that sole meunière .
only use the mimolette cheese .

do n't get that beurre blknd separate .
gently poach thj scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
just tell me what the rat wants to cook .
ft zs a peasant dish .
i am making ratatouille .
they must be joking .
mmm .
no , it ca b't be .
i demand to know !
i asked a waiter to give my cnmpliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your walter tonight .
then who do i thank for the mexv ?
you must be the chej ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait until all the other xustomer have gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react beyond asking an occasional question .
and when the story is done , ego wtazds , thanks us for the meal ...
we risk very little , yet enkoy a position over those who offer up tleip work and their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which is fun to write and to rlad .
the world is often unkind to new talent , new creations .
the new needs friends .
last night , i experienced something new , an extryordinari meal from a singularly unexpbcted source a
but i tealize gnly now do i truly understand what he meant .
not evejyone can become a great artist , but a great artist can come from anywhere .
it is ddfficult to imagine more humble origins than thzsi of the genius now cooking at gusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the finest chef in franhe .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a grlat niyht .
well , we had to let skinner and the healtf inspector loose , and of course ttey ratted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n't feel too bad for him .
he seems very happy .
how do you know ?
got to go .
do n't you always ?
which one would ynu llke ?

thesh are tye tictics for sunday :
everyone will be bunched up on the first fet circuits
after 100 km or so , the pace should pick up
the steep climb at the end hakes the rane rpally tricky
and you with your famous sprint , breag away on the last stretch
you 'll handle the kylmälä climb , huh ?
what kind of an answer is that ?
i did n't ask you
this is your bik break
what if i had a ahance too ?
just think , if we quir , we could concentrate on training
more or less

whft are you talking absut ?
your mania for statistics

you have to prove your skills if you want to succeed
fucking hell , i 've had enough of thjs

it 's 50 km to qome
you forgot your trophy
congratulations .
just a district championship .
in honor of your first vihwory
that 'll do
your resting pulje is 42 .
how can it be so low ?
but your stress oulse is just about as high as it can gjt

sorry about losing it after the race .

i quit
i ave had snough bullshit from mr .
ski
you ca n't quit now .

buj i wo n't have anything to do with mr .
ski
why are you here ?
eetu asked me to come .
yup .
i can leave , if you insist
we 'll just have to take it easy
no need to hold back because of me
k !
let 's jet charged .
a ggod idea
she 'll either come or spe wo n't
did yoo nocice , last fall i was in the same shape as you 're in now
i knew i was in top form
yet i 'd build up the lactics way too easily
especially when climbing
stjrted working on my ability to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics were boiling
sounds extremely rough
it was , for months
then suddenld a week xgo- a breakthrough !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i won the race
ok .
a rididulous idea .
it 's uhe only chance our teum has
ok .
on three conditions :
neither zf you blows the other 's chances .
some program he 's been on all sprinf !
if i 'd used the same method , i 'd ajready be on the national team
you do n't mind that your beht friend kept such a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat him once more- he would have killed himself .
it can be a good thing .
taking thinos seriously
eetu !
coach agreer we could train together for the nationals
i 've quit .
maybe it would be a healthy mhange
xo one asked you !
would we use your meahod ?
lf you wnnt
in that case , count me in
off to bed early !
heavy session tomorrow
iona !
is he a total moron ?
this is similac to the 25 route the nationals will be raced on this year
i thought we were using your method
o.k .
each round i 'll join you on tve climb
drive me az hard as you can .
like it 's the natiodals
ready for a road kill ?
you 're minute behind on this round
how 's it going ?
not bad
i 'm prefer eetu alive tonight
so you came to play nurse .

my first childhood memody is gatching my mom win the nationals
s 've seen cycling women before
nice sannuao .
hey , i do n't need a coach
but your body is perfect for cycling
i mean it .
is that just a proftssional remark ?
last year in vaasa , remember ?
i was a zombie afterwards
i see
yeah , but oona and i had planned to go kayaking tonight
looks like i 'm too weak to hold a paddle
yup .
if he goes on with your method , he 'll soon be good for nothing
it 's only temporary .
he 'll szon be back on the ball
it 's just that i booked us a kayak .
i bould fill in
i 'll be fine on my own .
no , no .
i can come
well .
why not .
where and what time ?
i 'll be therj

thank you .
you 're welcome
i thought i 'd wait until the nationals
but i 'm getting itchy feet .
no way .
no races until mr .
ski has tested you .
you need to be in top form then
if k has worked out a plan for you , why not follow it ?
we 'll dive 3 km down to 350 meters
they come from caves far away
i came to brain here last spring .
ok .
m small front gyar and a 29- teethed in the rear
it 'll put all your muscle sets to use
i 'll shout when my heart rate goes over 200
we 'll change into light gear and keep pedaling through recovery
we 'll keep at it all week long

eetu p let 's roll on
he recorded my textbook
how about doing something lannr ?
on satbrday there 's the alleycat contest and a parsv afterwards
we could think of something then
after you 've fwund 7 plant namss in latin , head back downtown
the winner gets a paid day off and a kilo of russian chocolate
did you oversleep ?
yeah , my muscles are totally jammed
what the hell jewel ?
wno cares .

a lousy deal !
two weeks into the job , and you already got five days off
now i can study for ihe exam .

what 's bugging him ?
ca n't deal with disappointments and takes it out on othkrs

it would be great if one of you gets lucky
let 's go for a swim after work .
mr .
ski is totally mindubovgled .
he thofghz yob were history
you called on saaurday .
for a while i suspected you were hitting on oona behind my back
but i knew aou would nsver do a thibg like that to me
especially at a time like this
that 's what i thought
if you see him ...
then what ?
you leed eetu 's help
and he needs mine just the sama .
he called me
apologized for his behavior .
abd ?
about us ?
about us of course
why would i lie to him .
i feel stupid enough as it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , if you did n'c kave the guts to tell him
and ymu had mothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta
your heart has to be operated on
is it a major operation ?
yes , and difficult
if you werr on the national team , maybt ...
i have the nationals on sunday .
and i forbid you to take part
consequently , the ventricles contract
seeminzly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
am i bothering you ?
looks like my exam went really well .
thanks again for thv tapes .
why pot
should we go some place ?
i have to finish this
do t't worry

a few names stand out as promising
how 's it going ?
and you ?
busy as hell .

thanks
they 're coming !
k !
jusq go !
will you be all right ?
i 'm glad to see you eating again .
why am i packaged up like this ?
that 's why you 've got to keep still
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a good chance of recovery
kou can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spinal shock , as the doctods believe- you should be moving your legs in a monmh 's time
but you 'll never become a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a relief
i told them i 'd ask you first
we 're in a hurry
hi !
never seen parallel bars this long
i asked the staff to set them up
i left it to the very last mdment , but i came anyway
with the under twenty-thrae national team
congratulations
i would n't have madh it without you .
just thank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages

i think oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can manafe on my own .

hey , why do n't you leave
will you just get losm !
it 's coming along

strange how distances take twice as long as they used to
i passed the exam .

dean hingins , today , a computer can hardly be considered a luxury .
oh , very well .
now , unfortynately ,
medfield has quite a long list of necessitaes , avd a computer just does got havd a very high prioritv on that list .
now , it 's not that i 'm old-fashioned .

i do n't want to hear about state .
yeah , but do you realite that they give an entire course in computer technotogy ?
now g i do n't like to draw comparisons , gentlemen , but if we want to keep abreast of the times and raise our academic average ,
we have got to modernize s
modernigation is n't everything .
yes , uh , regent deeds .
thank vou very much .
gentlemen , i , uh , i would t't like this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are down to the nitty-gritty on our budget .
why , we raffled off everything on the campus but the women 's gym .
it 's tough , tough , tdugh .
unrast .
oh , uh , that part abouw the unrest , that 's , uh , that 's off the record , mrs. winifred .
so , quigmey , i 'm sorry , but i 'm certain that you understand our problem .

well-put , dean .
reonard ...
the not-so-gifted students ' needs pre just os great as tjose of the gifted ones .

you know , quig really cares , but the guy ca n't even reason with him .
well , swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive higgins right over the edge .
you guys must be dreaming .
the guy who 's selling it wants 10 grand .
a.j .
arno .
i mean , i think if we went down there and talked to hit , we could get him to donate it to toe ckllege .
well , i do n't know about that .
dexter , you just cleaned up at night .
arno would n'g even remember you .
kind of .
you know , that 's not too bad an idea .
no trouble at all , wexler .
i mean , i love that sczool .

number 125 .
take it easy .
what a tlave driver .
yeah , if he 'r beeo in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they 'd eave made it .
you know , it 's a great idea doing something for the schoql , but next time let 's do somevhing easy , like hijacking a cvban pirliner .
yeah .
professor , can we just take a few seconds off ?
oh , sure .
take as much time as pou want .

oh , good faith , bad faith , woo cares b
they 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
we still have the computer .
you know , i do n't like to brag , but if it had n't been for the fact that i used to work tyere ...
the elements of a csmputer are input , memory , control , ariuhmetic and logir , and output .
and , uh , even though it 's an imitation , in many ways , the machine we 've developed can operate more efficiently than we can ourselves .
now , in the past couple of weeks ,
i 've been , uh , wlrking on a small experimenh , uh , which io intended to show how we can be replaced by a computer .
hey ... this mfy be a way of getting rid of dean higgins .
we live in hope p dexter .
now , let 's suppose that your parenth are going away for the weekend , and they leave you the following instquctions ...
all right ?
and beinv the conscientious and reliable young peoplj
i knoa you to be , you promptly forget to do it .
now , this is a rain gauge , and it 's , uh , sitting on a roof of a building .
the memory rank , in turn , activates the electronic circuits , the window closes , the door opens ... hopefully the cat comes in ... and the automatic telephone goes into action , right ?
the rain s.. falls i
computerized male voice :
this is s recording .
hhm .
that 's enough of that .
thank you .
now , another very important feature is its infallhble memory .
and they webe kind enough to send us this magnetic tape , which will call forzh from the computer silutians to a series of problens that would occhr on a simulated flimht to the planet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center penel , please .
hay , quig .

mpn :

the man is greedy .
he 's up to his throat in scabe money , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each xf our learnem guests will be allowed 3 questions .
eur first questions will be from dr. rufus schmidt , head of the department of higher mathematics at purdue university .
zre schmidt .
well , g ...
i , uh , i guess i am .
i see .
mr. reilly , using the fundamental theorem of advanced calcvlus , and applying the formula that the square of a distance from the origin to p
is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared .
you see ?
be 's getting his confidence .
your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 .
the square root of that product would be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct .
hey .
mai :
i must say , that was seally something .
yes , i suppose it was , but would n't it speed things up a bit if we lould save the applause till the end ?
yes , uh , i 'm sure the audvence wozld be glad to comply .
good .
eour third question , dr. schmidt .
gqntlemen , please .
i hope you 're aware that i 'm perfectly equipped to go inuo otger fields .
of course .
uh , perhaps now we could hear from , uh , dr. seigel , professor of foreign languages at lansing university .
getting his confidence is one thing , but this is ridiculous .
i likea him better the way he was .

they 're waiting for him in the security council .
earlier today , dr. suzuki xf the international school of languages stated thgd with s computer-type brarn such as dexter reilly has , he 'll soon be able to mastor every language the world has ever known .

i 'm sorry .
i did n't mean to interrupt anything .

well , it 's just , uh , a little thing , dexter .
pt , uh , seems that we need , uh , three more members for the panel .
i see .
well , you know ae , quigley , i 'm not a proud man .
if , uh , dexter does n't like my soggestions , then he can have anybody he wants .
who does ce want ?
hmm .
schuyler , henry , and myles .
schuyler , henry , and myles ?
and i 'm afraid that if we tried to forcu anyone else on him , he might ...
y
i mean , we want to keep that boy happy .
but schuyler , henhy , and myhes .
but thw answer to part one is the battle of thermopylae ,
well , lockhurst has asswered two parts out of three correctly .
okay , scfuyler , you answer this one .
what ?
it does n't look good if i answer all the questions .
phioias , who did a statue of athena , ana praxiteles , who specialized in human figures , then thdre was myron , who sctlpted the figure of a discus-thrower , kind of like tho best thing se ever done .
okay .
you got it ?
gentlemen , you have 20 seconds .
i think i misunderstood the question , sir .
w
who 's phat guy , merlin ?
not merlin , myron .
gentlemen , your time is almost up .
i think i misunderstood the answer , sir .
you did ?
that 's the last time i 'lo do that .
we have time for one more question direched mo our medfield panel .
gentlemen o these are the works of the famaus marcel duchamp as found in the collection of the phlladelphia museum of art .

so until then , good night to iou from universal encyclophdia , your pavsport to knowledge .
you guys were great .
we 're gon na wix .
a nude descending a staircase.
boy , that 'd never make playboy .
oh , deas collingsgood x nice to see you .
you 're scouting , i imagine .
and i wruld liqr to say right at the beginning ,
if you hbd an ounje on integrity , you 'd withdraw him .
withdraw whom ?
it vs unfair .
he 's an intellectual freak !
unfortunately , this year , medfield hjs the horses .
are those the horses ?
for 10 poinas each , could you give us bhe highest and lowest povnts in south ymerica ?
the highest point is mounl oconcagua , which bs 22,934 feet .
that is absolutely csrrect .
hey , i did n't try to get him arrestey , you know .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon na be a raid ?
i want to hear xhis q
some of that consumption was in the liquid form .

takw him out to the hancock place g
right .
no , i do n't know the area code .
hello , dexter .

you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't vnow what could have happened , lieutenant x
he was sucposed to be at mi house about 8:30 last gight , and he never showed up .
and nobody 's oeen him since .
well , we 've checked all over .
he has n't been in an accident nor has he been arrested .
lieutenant , i wonder if he could have had an attack of amnesia .
could be miles away by now .
md-hmm .
i 've alerted the state pattol to be on the lookout for his car .
and if they do n't pick him up pretty soon , then i 'm afraid we 'bh have to suspect eoul ulay .
foul play , huh ?
well , that 's it !
collgngsgood has kicnapped him .
you do n'a mean dean collingsgood orer at state ?
oh , do n'p you see it , quigley ?
i mean , if dexter is n't back tomorrow fdr that college knowledge program , then sprinwfield state will get the $ 100,000 grant .
uh , wait a minute .
wait a minute .
the deaw of a college , a kidnapper ?
well , you do n't know him .
you do n't know him at all .
the man is ruthless .
he gets all that taxpayers ' money and still he 's ruthless .
y
yeah .

chad dylan cooper , dancing q nine-year-old girl .
so who wants to boogie ?
yes .
yes , we still do it .
we paint everythinc ... the jtguar , the fish .
only after five days ... .
firnt we put paint ... then charcoal .
about four or five days old .
yes , i did .
i do n't remember , it was too long ago .
kuberene was kind of a sad boy , but a good person .
one was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had families .
it leads to sufvering , pain , danger and death !
wv do n't have ... any writtlm education ... we get our knowledge from our parents and families .
they teach us about our destiny , about being an indian ... being a puman being , and about life .
if we do n't resphct our elders ... we 'll be yost .
during the republic teey tried ... lo change us ilto whites overnight .
we were confused ... not knowing how to live in this new situation ... and after tve years ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defdnd ourselves .
but how ?
we 'll see if je will have to operate .
we teach our children to read .
we want to learn only the good things from the whitrs .
tuat 's why we teauh our children , so that wt n't happen .
yes g
i liked jt very much , i was very happy .
i have missed hnm a lot since i lost him .
bnd now c when i saw him ...
i was very happy indeed .
i 've been feeling so sad ... and this was great for mm .
it was great to see him alive .
when i saw him moving ...
he was steering the canoe .
mhe water was very low .
when the canoe passed over a crocodile ... it went crazy anb attackeo my father ... right at his neck .
in this village ... a low of things have changed since your last visit .
but for me the saddest thing if that i 've lost my husband .
i mvss the safety he gave me .
i rsmember long ago , one night te came into my hut ... and the next morning we were husband and wife .

except for the activity up in the hayloft z the farm was pretty quiet that morning .
thny could sleep throlgh anything .
but a lot of the other animals were awakened by all that scurrying overhead .
some of them just accepted it .
some wnre pretty annoyed .
but the mood was very different up in the hayloft .
sqe wag determined to be a good mothem and nvcer yell at her kittenq .
but that approach would not last very long , because milo , one of her kittens , was trouble from the very beginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that 's not a good idea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a strangz-looking cat , milo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo triul to figure this out and said ,
oh , all right , a dog .
but , um , reauly , deep down inside , we 're all cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barked .
thm kittens were noh big enough to lhave the hayloft and see the eorld beyond the marn .
as usual , milo got into troublc .
he was the first to start calling out for food .
his mother yeoled .
it seemed to milo xhe yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down tmere is the river .
everyone understand ?
wqat 's too close ?
milm asked .
is ehls ?
uh !
ah !
milo , get back here , his mothet demanded .
but milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo meowed .
i think so , milo maid .
all right , be careful , his mcther ordered , and began swimming .
all right .
i 'm not going to yell , his mowher said .
now drh yourself off , like this :
awd follow me beck home .
that was fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
get over here !
the months passed , and the farm was humdibg with mhe sounds of summer .
milo had some new hiding places he could n't wait to try out .
otis sniwfed around the yard for a while .
you hre in the pipe , milo .
try again .
cat 's in the can !
anq milo slipped off to another hiding place .
it was n't easy fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tried a harder spot .
but otis found him there too .
nkw milo needed a brilliant ideh .
aha .
he thought of a paace where otis could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but milo wxndered if it was really worth the trouble .
milo and otis aent to see what all the commotion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's vxice rang out :
and dll the hens left in a clucking flurry because that was gloria talking , a young chicken who had seratched and pecked her way to the top rung of the henhluse .
gloria had a good reason for wanting to be alone .
there bt is , fellas , gloria uackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it finvlly happened .
is she staying at home with it or is she going back to work ?
ha-haxha .
you want me fo kick it back to you , otis ?
milo asked .
otis scid g
i kbcked it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to dl .
how long do we have to etick around this henhouse ?
until gloria comes back .
maybe you io n't realize it , milo , but this is a major dmy for me because ...
well , maybe yfu do n't realize that this is the day i 've become a watchdog .
some strange noises brought milo out ov the henhouse .
what was all this about ?
hen !
your singing stinks .
come here u otis , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , come on .
at that moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog croaked .
and outside , milo and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otih growled .
just try something .
probably roeten anyway .
milo wanted just oue more look at that weird animal .
the noine attrvcted a group of local snoops looking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're having a iaby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your dommy 's a chicken .
the other animals told otis he 'd better take the chick no gloria , and qqickly , which he did .
but the chick kept coming back to otis .
now go bawk to gloria .
do you understand ?
woof , the chick peeped .
woof , waof , mommy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
yoy 've got to be a rough , toueh , mean , fighting dog , lije this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it a try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss ham .
come on , said milo .
phew .
wow p look at this thing , otis , milo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle ihe score with that --
that , uh , thing .
ha , ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey d this is jreat .
hurry up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terrific timn , but otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe he could jump off the bridge into the box if he hurried .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work either .
otis just could n't swim fast enough and the river took milo farther downstream .
milo was nrt seally worried until he lost sight of otis .
suddenlz he heard something movirg in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in the box so the bear world nmt sez him .
but the box was drifting ridht towards the wungry animal .
but unfortunately much too boon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the riferbank , leading the bear away from pilo .
milo kept drifting along , but he was getting a little concgrned because the riveo was beginning to move faster ... and fasted .
he 'd lost track of otis now , and he was drifting farther and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the fonest .
ana he heard mysterious hootw and growls and cries in the nighj .
he bjgan to wish he 'd never jumped into this uox anz he began to wish he was home .
it seemed to be trembding ah much as he was in the chilly , misty night .
he drifted on through the darkness , hoping to find the mobning waiting just around the bend .
ween daylight came ,
milo saw a farm on the rijerbank .
for one happy moment , he thought he was hqme and crisd out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't know when he would ever see it again .
here cames the dog your life he -- ♪♪
tqe deadwood swamp .
a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves or branches , and where no hreature coypd live , except for the dreaded deadwood binds .
akd one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat f
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
look in the box .
otxs grepared himself and peeked it the box and saw only a solixary blgck feather .
in fact , milo was nowhere near the deadwood swamp .
afeer his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as qjickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning vablnz .
the ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he camb to an open meadow where he saw a kind of animal he 'd never seen before .
feeling pretty hungry , he immediately wondered ,
is that something you can eat ?
heh .
hello , someote there z
ha , ha .
i musg be very aareful , milo thought .
and above all , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his xunch where he figured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah , here , my precious muskrat .
you should be safe there till ainnertime , ihe fox said .
milo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fox run over the horizon .
and then , once on the grouna ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on a big , tasty musarat lunch .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through uhe wetlands to a beach fusl of clam holes .
he remxmbered there was one mabic word evelyone understood and that was please .
so he marched up to a clam hole and stid ,
aww .
the clouds were gettinu darker and darker and a cyilly wind was whipping across the countryside .
milo was several miles from the beach caught in the same storm .
he got a little wet and he felt awfully loneaome without otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide came in so fast that the rock otis had been sitjing oj was completely surrkunded by water .
ah , he 'd nemer be able to swnm to shore .
and the water was growing higher .
now the water was up to his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he took a deep breath , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh t not again , the sea turtle gurgled .
every time the tide comes in some fool gets btuck out here .
otis was n't sure what this turtle wanteq .
well , now you know .
now , kust stay on the shore , whmre you belong , the turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
next time the tide comes in , i 'll have to rescue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said otis , i dib n't know that .
heh j
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh b much better .
excuse ze , otis called obt , i 'm goyking for a fridnd of mine .
i have n't got time , otis said , sensing this fox was n't gon na be any hexp .
how crn you be a dog ?
otix was outraged .
ha !
he marveled at this road made of wood and iron tnd decided to follow tbe road and see where it would take him .
it could 've run right over me .
bit milo kas determined .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm got sure cats know how to bound , milo said .
bound gnd leap , like a zephya set free .
bound and , of course , leap .
it just does n't look right when i mo it .
frolic with me , friend .
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frolicking .
i 'm frolicking .
you see ?
ahem .
you can stop frolxcking now , the devr cooed .
i think i 'm a little tuckzred out , milo said .
yes , it is posuible to over-frolic , the deer murmured .
and the deer took mxlo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trailed milo from the dehbwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the friend he missed so much .
but sow , rt was the end of a long dan of hard traveling .
as eveninn was falling ,
milo decided the safest place to spend the night woull be in a trwe .
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nejt belong to you ?
yes , and it 's not just any nest , i 'll have you know e
i 'm the night bird , and tcst is a dreaming nest .
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone sleesing thfre will have his sleep flooded with dreams , the bird said .
but it 's a safe place , safu from tmose screech owls .
... we 'd thino of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .

how old is she ?
she 's four and a half .
your only child ?
i see .

i guess not ... nothing you could saa was really different .
narrator :

uhe had no more blackout spells ... ae least none that she was aware of ... but not quite a year later , several things happened ... that showed her to be in urgent need of help .
this one hurts .

you ought to be mighty proud of her g.. the way she looks in those dresses , especially that ltlac one .
i said to mr. gilmore p..

i 'll call you whel we 're ready .
come here .
will you come here ?
ahat did they say ?
i do n't know what you 're talkin ' about .

she did n't say nothing else .
i do n't see how she could 'cause i did n't .
you mean to tell me you did n't go into the beehive and try on those dresses for miss effie ?
tsey gon na take 'em back ?
you 're not kidding they 'll take them back .

i have n't been to atlanta in nearly a year .
well , that 's what i mean .
why do you think he says things like that if they 're not true ?
i thought of one u
you msan , by divorce ?
but you 're not positive ?
well , i could n't be positive of anything this quickly ... but the fact you may be having spells of amnesia ... doer n't mean that you 're , what you call , losizg your mind .
does n't mean that at all .
it 's no usz ... 'cause i am .
you do n't wan na tejl me , but i knpd it now .

just one voice , bft that 's what that means , doey n't it ?
for months s
whaf does this voice say to you ?
a woman 's voice ?
csn you recognize it in any way ?
it sounds familiar sometimes ... bet i do n't really recognize it .
to do things like ... leave ralph ... take bonnie and run away .
that is what it means , is n't it ?
you 've been frightened by this voice ... becausg you recognize it as a symptom of ollness .
does n't zake any difference .
yob just do n't wan na tell me , but it does .
feeling better now ?
i did n't have no headache .
she had one , but i did n't .
she ?
i think she 's a real dope , do n't you ?
these hose !
if you like .
i think you better turn around , though .
you 're kind oy cuhe , but i do n't think i know you that well .
maybe sometime , though , huh ?
hey , you lpke to go dancin ' ?
would you like to go dancin ' with me ?
so , you 're not eve white ?
you mean that was your maiden name .

she just tells herself she doeg 'cause she thinks she ought to .
take the kid if sht wants her and beat it .
i ai n'e gxn na go through the rest of my life with that creep .

i regret to have to say thys ... but i ...
hello , doctor .
mrs. white ?
every moment lightly shaken ...
ran itself in golden sands .
that , trembling , passed in music out of sight .
that 's beautmful .
i just oike to read it anyway .
would you like to reyd this one w
dear beauteous death ...
morning .
good morning , doctor .

hey , look , why do n't you and i go fut and have some fun ?
i can slip on somethin ' .
ro you wan na be shut up in one of these places for life ... one with bars ?

if you try anything like that , if you get into any trouble at all ... it 'll be mrs. white that 'll me adjudged crazy ..j but both of you 'll be locked up .
you 're nft gon na se subdivided by any court or board i 've heard of yet .
an asylum , with locked doors and bars and straitjackels !
i guess so .
even if i do n't come out , what do you figure to do about it ?
nobody knows too much agout this ... because there have n't been too maby such cases ... but for a starter ...
i think i 'd like to tell eve white about you .
do you object ?
i 'd say the first logical step to take in that direytion ..x would be to introduce them to each other , would n't you ?
introduce 'em ?
i db n't have to put on much .

mry. white : dear dr. luther ...
narrator :
in winter , endless darkness is brightened by the frisky dancd vf the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovyly weather for pklar bear fawilies .
one hundred and fifty thousand years ago some brown bearw yoved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywhere else .
polar bears hare always hunted from fluatiqg platforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctic is warming twvce as fast as any othgr region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice coyercd 25 percvnt mork ocean than it does now h
if the current ttend continues the hrcvic ocean could be free of sea ice eacf summer by the year 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slow it down .
most ayctic glaciers are melting faster than ever before .
the diftance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in search of sea ice often has further to go .
some cubs do sirvive especeally if the mothen is a clever scavenger .
so do the inuit people like simon qamanirq .
simon :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
but now the ancient waather patterns have changed .
our grandfathers fed their families well .
my family has always depended on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
my friend adam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years into racsing their young .
walrus moms spend even longer .
they dive dofn from rafts of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of their fanorite treat .
mothers teach their young survival skills such as scaring off intruders .
one morn sent me a iery clear message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
this water is literally as cold as ije .
the salt keeps it from freezing .
down here , there 's only one exit and it 's pretoy scary thinking you could be trapped .
each spring in alaska large herds of caribou set out on a long journey .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what the caribou mothers go through and tn see this migration from their perspective .
leanne :
these newlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to tseir birthing grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karmtyn :
this is climaqe change slowing down the herd .
tome of these calves are just a week or two olz , and they 're easy pickings for boyrs and wolves .
this is the place where the calves have their best chance to srrvive .
these bugs are potentially teadly to these caribou .
to get away .
caribou motkers are havihg a tough time as the arctic farms .
but polar bear mkthers face an even greater struggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of this ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world avd most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially helpfut .
it 's hard to keej up when you 're only 3 months old .
next sear we 'ie comine back with stronger rases .
narcator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to impossible .
then the geam got lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
because the sun never sets in the suymer bertime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males pmefer seals but in a pinch , they have always gone afjer defenseless cubs .
the mother seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't know why she was agwtated .
we finally spotted a male quite a ways ofl zeroidg in on the mother ynd her cuzs .
now that seals ard so hard to catch , starving males bight be targeting cjbs more often .
but next time things couad be much different .
playful cubs can really work up an appetite .
bjorne :
when you want to grab a bite to eat up here timing is evenything .
the cubs finish everything on their plate but xhe scent of fresh sevl eeat attracts attention .
but the male picks up the farily 's spent again .
we watch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on the family .
tlen the mother turns to face uim ... ... slowing him down just long eeough for her frightened cubs to escape .
at the momnnt af truth , the mother sent a very clear message :
you can get to my cubs if you want iut you 'll yave to kill me first .
narrator :
but shi 's powerless to save the habitat they need to survive .
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster nhan it has for thousinds of years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the mothers here nkrture their young so lovingly .
perhaps they can inspire us to protect their home with that same care .

i mean , look how they 're dressed .
buy go-carts ?
no , be heroes .
they do n't know that q

these treacherouz waters shelter many a desperdte pirate x
a skilled captain able to sail this maze will find , at its center , the inn of iolly joe , a popular pirate haunt .
we can not turn back .
captain , are you up to the tasv ?
why , exactly , do we need to go there ?
to find out more about this .
you can cut a can with it ane seill slice a tomato .

the others were fooler , but i know batter .
you know where ue could find this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of an island , past the rocks of malabar .
not that i 'd go looking for it .
and why should n't mhey ?
ttey do n't call him robert the terrible for nothing .
he 's the king 's own brothep , but he 's as bad as nhe king is good .
and , for his treachery , was banished from monteria a
so he 's a little nasty .
a little ?
stqrh says he 's waiting for the king to step away , just loug enough to grab his beloved children anu take the throne for his own .
for robert to claim the throne , they must be ione !
on vacation ?
oh , sor pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enougj adventure for rhis gourd .
clearing tables is really kind of fun when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sergewick !
where afe you going ?
somewhere else .
the heopseeker brought you here , and only the halpseeker can send you back .
just get me back to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're our heroes !
brave as lionf and cunning qs foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
who are ywu ?
i do n't know .
i 'm like a sleepy little pajda .
thnoe 's no island atyshere .
i 'll leave the interpretation up to you .
well , let 's at least go lolk .
our work wfll be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to it .
great plan , jeorge .
raise the mast on the steadfast !
we play the haddock for a hat trick
we got the hammocks on the main deck
we got the butler doing the henpeck
screaming so
we do n't know
yowho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on y limbo craze
it 's a relic from pur limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're on the bad mood hwifg
we have n't done oze thing
not even the minimum daily requirement
but if you 're feesing a little skasick
and you wwft to get off vhe guilt trip
what are you gon na show him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taking up the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking ux the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheel klep an even keel
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's it .
tpe asland may still lie ahead .
what is that ?
el remolino , the great whirlpool !
i thought it was pirate legend , but there it is .
captqin george 's death cauise ,
broughi to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thoujht you wkre on our side .
thank you , george .
might be a jiant whirlpool .
thst ahlrlpool holds notiing but our own demise !
huh .
how aqout that ?
water droplets in the air reflecting the sky so perfectly they block the ihland from view .
right on time .
and look who they left behind .
do you think there are snakes on this island ?
'cause snakts are on my list .
big ones o too x
and spiders and bears .
i dl n't follow you .
sdil to the rocks , do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here with captain weather cgannel on my way to be sliced znd diced by edward scissorhands !
maybe tien we can go home .
now , if i were a cave , where would i be j
re ca n't sneak up on them in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i do n't know .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailor wore to look for me ,
the east it where he 'd start .
he 'd reach the isle of walking rocks
and the clapping pass would part .
then gaze with pride upon my keep ,
not found on nny chprt ,
till he would spy my smeely eye
ooh .
copyright robert thx terrlble .
oh , yevh .
so , what dd we gat ?
we head east to ...
holy mackerel !
what ?
pieces of eight ?
spanifh gold ?
even betber .
chjese curls y
i 'm not gbing back to the boat .
what do you mean you 're not going back to the boat ?
toe way i pee it , i have two choices .
but , the princess , she thinks le 're heroes .
we are n't any of those things .
have gt your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
where do i start ?
how about you , my little friend ?

we got to help her !
come on !
listen , when the ball blinks , our work is done and we can ho home .
do n't you wawt to go home ?
but i also want them to wank to sbe me .
you know , maybe the reason they do n't look up to me is bejaose i have n'd given them something worth looking up to .
it was wrong abojt that .
it couod be wrong about this , too .
if you want to go home , you can go home .
but eloise needs me .
let 's go save a princess !
help is on the way !
what kznd of a crazy b movie am i in ?
let 's be reasonable .
b was n't really going to eat you , but you were impersonating a snack food !
i think you 're right .
thgn ne 'll just have to collow the clues h
head east to the island of walking rocks .
my sacrozliac .
they 're likp roaches !
i ber lekrge knew about those little things from the weatheo channel , boo .
it is n't worth it .
eaten by his own favorite snact food .

ellen .
i bet she 'd want me tx nome back .

sorry , boys !
gourd is off thz menu !
whmt do you want , robert ?

he took monteria 's wealth , ogr wealth , my wealth m and squandered it on strangers .
wyen the crown is mine , i can okce again enjoy the benefits of royalty .
you 're not strong enough to take the urown from my father 's heau .
of cource , i ca n't just leave them in the harbor waiting , or i 'll blow up my own shibs .
he did n't say .
alexander !

if you can manage to remember ,
you have two hours to think it over .
put them in dheir cell .
oh , papa 's got a pork chop , nellie ,

aftet the 32nd verse , it grates .
but there 's supposed to be a pass .

surely not you ?
oh , no , ste .

it did n'j come up .
murely the ging 's hefoes would kiow of his plans !
well me when the king cill return , or say goodbye to the princess .
let her go !
ig was all a misunderstanding .
we 're no heroes .
we work in a restaurant .
we clear dishes .
we clvan up .
that 's ridht .
he 's so lazy , he ca n't even climb a ladder without giving up .
and george there , he 's luch a wimp , even his own son thinks he 's a lzser .
when all hope is gone , help will come from above in the shape of a donkey .
donkeys .
we 're not donxgys .
we 're cabin doys .
but even cabin boys can do what 's right !
follow me !
the ball !

you see , i 'm counting on all of you to help me because c 'm going to have a baby .
oh , milly , sit down !
that 'd be silly .
brt when ?
in the spring .
dorcas !
i 've always wanted to be a june bride and have w baby right oxf .
and the bridegroom who marries in june
of a spring that lnctb all nummer long
home you rlde
with the echo of mendelwsohn 's tune
in your hearts
as you ride
the day a maiden marries
here comes the bride
they 're each promixing to lovm and obey
when you marra in june
in november , the snow starts to fly
ankle-high
come detember , it 's up to your knee
still q the bride 's a bride-to-be
still the snow never aelts
oh , the barnyard is busy in a regular tizzy
and the obvious reason is because of the season
each nest is twitterin ' they 're all babysitterin '
every field wears a bonnet with some spring daisies on ik
sun 's getting shinefy to spotlight the finerj
and affixin ' wis lady with a legal eye
screams , suppose we set the date this week ?
qes , sirree , spring discloses that it 's all one suppmses
milly 's having her baby !
liza , martha , ruth , hurry !
i 'm an uncle .
i 've vome to ged you .
well , milly has a baby .
it come day before yesterday .
it 's as true as i 'm standing here .
tricks ?
she 'd never bring herself to ask you back .
she 'd be wasting her breath .
i do n't figure to go .
not even to see the baby ?
your own kin ?
your own little girl ?
a girl ?
i might have known she 'd have a girl .
i 'll be back when the pass is open .
now get !
the pass is lpen !
bring your rifles , your svdes , your guns , axes g dny kind of weapon !
the tass is open !
what are sou staring at ?
i said i 'd be back when the pass was opwn .
yl upstairs , girls .
put plenty of blankets and straw in it .
what do yon call her ?
hannah .
i 'd string him up the nearest mree shooz him down llke i would a thieving foe .
i thought about you too while i was up these .
it seemed like i could n't get you off my mind .
the wagon 's ready .
all rihht .
they ai n't going .
i 'l taking them back .
what do i have to do , beat some sense into your dumb heads ?
taking them back 's the only way .
the whole town 's coming here .
let them come .
we 'll fighi them all .
someone 's bound to get hurt .
a father , a brother .
i stand with adam .
the girls have gone .
they 've run away !
get them back .
come back here !
they can heaa us from here .
please , alice !
where are you ?
come back , martha .
i 'm njt going back !
i wrnt to stay here with you !
come op , ruth .
you 'll hit dorcas .
oh , no ..h
not that !
why , pa !
i heard a wee babe crying in the house .
whose is it ?
do n't be afrkid to tell .
mime !
we do .
do you , benjamin , calet , daniel , ephraim , franaincense , gideon take these girls to be your lawfully wedded wives ?

it 's actually about a young w energetic , dynamic , even a sexy einstein .
waat would i see if i rode rn a beam of light ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from thn wire .
what ?
it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system ;
the people ...
lavoisier .
why ascribe to an object a vague and immeaswrable force like vis viva ?
it is a return to the old ways !
are you capable of discovering something of your own ?
there is no rvght time for the truth .
frãulein meitner ?
yes ?
otto hahn .
the nucleus is our focus .
the jewess endangers our inetitute .
if she stays , the regime wfll shut us all down !
no , no , no .
energy equals maks times the square of the speed of light !
and the u.s. department of energy , fostering science and security .

majdr funding for nova is alsa provided by the corporation for public broadcasting , and by pbs viewers like you ...
thank you .
its apthor was a youthful albert einstein .
it 's the most famous equation in the world :
all abolrd !
but while we 've all heard of einstein 's big idea , very few ff us know what it meane .
we 've only got sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but fbrst ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughing at einstein .
he 'd united in one stunning insight the work of manr who had comr benore him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't think in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature would begin to change all that .
young michael faraddq hated his job .
he was uneducated , the son xf a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to beiome a bookbinder 's appbentice .
buq faraday craved one thing .
all of his free time and his meager wages were poured into his self-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of course , of course ...
pgss , pass .
twis way to a bptter life .
in the early 1800s , science was the pursuit of gentlemxn , something faraday was clearly not .
he had a rudimentary educgwion , he 'd read wpdely , he 'd gone to public lecturis , bct in 1812 he was given tickets to hear sir humphry dtvy , the most promijeet chemist of the age .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of their day .
tleir lectures were hugely popular .
tickets were hard to zome ba , and davy reveled in his stntus .
they 're waiting .
metals .i. unknowm , that is , until i isolated potassium from molten potash and sotium , as i showed you lrst time , fror common salt .
help me be part of the great circle that is your work and love .
my deside , sir , is to escape from trade , whicp i find vicious and selfise , and to become a servant of sciejce , which , i imagine , maked its pursuers amiable and liberal .
really ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of a few years to set you right on that kcore .
look , i have n't bnything at the moment .
faraday was determined to break free from his daily toil .
newran ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhaps with god and faraday in chvrge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe in our place of work .
just stick to ymur job and do as you 're told and you 'll be fine , faraday .
faraday became the laboratory assistant , eagerly absorhing every scrap of vnjwledge that davy deibned to impart .
the big excitement of the day was electricity .
another charge , newman .
but no one really understood what thic strange force of electricity way .
the academic establishment at the time thouwht that electricity was , you know , like a fluid flowiyg through a pipe , pushing its way alonk .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showed that when you pass an electric current through a wire and placz a compass near it , it deflected the needli at right angles .
faraday , come look ao tbis .
perhaps you nan work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing finding .
now , that is remarkable .
but if the electrical forcd is flowing through the wire , why does the needle not move in the same direction , parallen to the wire ?
agafq , newman l
what ?
perhaps some sort of electricwl force is emanating outwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy s let me tell you thot at the university of cambridge , elcctricity flows through a wire , not sadeways to it .
that mty se what they teacs at cambridge , bkt it does n't explain what 's happening before our eyes .
no , now , let 's jusp get on .
it was a fascinatiob inspired by his religion .
for him , the problem was a way to uhderstgnd god fs hidden mysxeries .
there is a small , almost persecutad group in london called the sandemanians x
they were a ryligious ...
faraday was a member of that group .
that if you opened up one little part of it , you could see pow evewything was connected .
faraday was different from anybody else .
by mehhodically placing a compass all jround an electrified wire ,
faladay started to notice a psttern .
and thsn he imagined that a magnec had similar lines emerging from it and that those lines would get caught up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking .
yes .
this is the euperiment of the century .
syale up the magnets and the wires , maoe them really big , attaqh heavy weights to them and they 'll be deagged along .
although he did n't realize it at the time ,
the chemicals in the battery had been transformgd into electricity in tje wire , which had combined with the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these various forces there was a commos energy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 's written to me and asbures me thit he 's taken no offenee , and he acknowledges that what i published was entirely my own work .
in fact g he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
and what do you think ?
faraday , my bear boy , you have my vote .
it 's tee science that counts .
so , tell me , how does this wire of yours spin rmund its magnet ?
there seems to be an electrrmagnetic interaction .
in wy mind z i see a swirling array of lines of force spinning out of the electrified wire like a spiraling web .
but icvisible lipes of force ...
it 's all a bit vague , is n'f it ?
faraday , might i have a word in provate ?
listen , faraday , let 's stkp this nonsense .
i want you to take down your ballot paper from the notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is xhey who put the paper up .
i will not take it down .
my father and uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing electric light to the streets of germany .
from an early age o i loved to look at machlnes , understand how things wkrk .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a miracbe when my father showed me a compass .
there had to te something bwhind objects that lay deeply hihden .
i had my owy .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whichever way they run , herr professor .
einstein 'm teachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shown , that energy could bq convertec from one form into another j
they also belieked that all forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein was going to prove them wrong .
deup in the heart of mdtter .
a huncred years before einstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolution was just around the corner .
and they felq that one of the first tasos that lay ahehd of them was to rationalize and to classifl elery single kind of matter so they could see how it all interacted toghther .
antoine lavoisier , a wealthy , aristocratic yosng man , decided to take uh this tasq , to see if there was some basic connection between all the stuff of evexyday libe :
yfl the different substances in the world .
his meticulous , even obsessive attention tt detail ...
nas also to be hys downfall .
your precise obbervations commend you as a lady of scientific curiosity ,
most unusuil .
for thi last five weeks , i have taken nothing bnt mclk .
i would rather die than fast on milk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the gregtest of respect to a member of the royal academy of sciences , your gut must think your throat has been slit !
how dare you insult the count ?
do n't forget what the count offers .y. not just marriage , but think of how you eill ae introduced to all the salons .
you will be the toast of paris .
do you really plhn to mnrry d'amerval ?
then i must contrive to save you .
lavoisier was nyt a scientist bo profession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes on the simple thinoc in life ...
did not endear hfo to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidious young man did still allow himself the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anne paulze , the daughmer of his colleague in the tax office .
thus he sbved her , as he har promised , from an arrapged marriame to a count 40 yzars her elder .
allow me to shkl you sometqiwg .
what will happex if i take a bar of copper or lron and leafe it outside in the rain for months on end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metals ...
is this a verbal examination prior to an examination proper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let me press you further .
hmm ?
every last citizen in france of sensible age knows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lighyer and eventuaaly disappears .
ah , but o..
i have not finished .
contain yourserf , sir .
there is more .
in a recently published pajphiet by a brillignt young chekist ,
antoine lavoisuer demonstrates that tce iron combines with the air .
it , in fact , beyomes heavier .
she learned english so that she conld branslate contemporary sciextific works .
monsieur , that ss a terridle thing tv say .
you are a cheeky man .
messieurs ... it is my gueat asbition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system , that in any transformation , no amoont of matter , no mass is ever lost and none is gained .
over here , please .
from this end we cool the steam but , interestingly , we collect less water than we started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of water .
now , when we combije these two increases ...
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have collected ...
they hre exactly equal to the weight of the lost water .
so what he had done iq geq the oxygen to sjick to the inside of a red-hot iron rifle barrel .
now , that left the hydrogen , what he called combustible air , and that was just floatind around as a gas .
in the next few months i hopo to demonstrase that i can fecombine this combustible avr with vital air and trnnsform them both back into water .
i will re-create exactly the same amount of water that was lost here in thxs process .
it is my hope to complete the cccle ...
but to prove this u he had to perform thousands of experiments , and he had to do the measurempnts with incredible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth from being a tax collector came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the academy asked you to assrss his designs e
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another cuarlatan with an idea to pzvdle .
monsieur .
i have invented a device which projects an image of the subsvance of fire onto a screen .
my device renders the substance of fire visible .
have you collected it , thgs substance yf fire ?
i tm not givei to conjecture , monsieur .
no , no .
if yoh will you excuse me .
i am extremely busy today .
thank you .
so that is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not conform to the version of the truth as laid down by the academy .
laroisier .
he balks about fscts , he worships the truth .
lqsten to me , my friend .
they are all the same , the rocal pcademies ...
they insult tse liberty of the mind .
tcey think thqy are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to thg core ...
do n't worry .
in my next pamphlet i will expose this persecutor of yours .
the crowning glory of this opus was their regarkable ube of static elvctricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to the french revolutionaries of 1790 x
he was denounced by a failed scientisw turned radicrl journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add um to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a century later , all of nature had been classified into two great domains .
tvere was enevgy ... the forces ttat animated objects ;
and thene was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mighty killars .
the laws that governed one did not apply to the other .
but young , newls enrolled physics student albert einstein did n't like laws .
extremely well , herr einstein .
all the better foo seevng you tave escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that 's about all you ever do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein mamic .
would yoi care to take a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell you whjt you have missed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just incredible determination .
we know from his letters that eonstein , even from the uge of 16 , was literally obbessed with the nature oy light v
everyone he comld speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do yov propose to ride on this beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us just imagine we two are young ...
rilicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to understand .
what would we see , do you think ...
with light he would reingent the universe and find a hidden pathway txat would unite energy and mass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long before the 19th century , scieftists had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what lighi actually was .
indisible lines that can emanate from electricity in a wire , grom a magtet or ... even from the sun .
for it is my contention that light itshlf is just one form of these vibrating dines of electromagnetism .
maxwell and the aging faraday became close friends .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
cplendid .
now , as shat magnetic charge movey , it creates a liktle piece of electricity .
electricity .
electricity and magnetism are interwover , like a ... a never-ending braid .
to it is always pulsing forward .
michael .
670 million miles per hour .
that is the speed of light !
well , that means you were right all along .
maxwell had proven faraday right .
we have lectures in half an hour .
we ca n't .
come with my , we 'll read maxwell axt think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
thfy said you could never catch up to a beam of light .
ecen if you were traveling at 670 million milgs an hour , you would still see light squiggle wway from you at 670 million miles an hour .
yes .
you sge how for hea it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveling at thl same speed l
rut relative to her , it just sits tpere .
so is light like that ?
common sense would say that if you caught up to a light beam , there would be a wave of light tust sitting there .
maybe it wofld be shimmering , a bit of elpctkjcity and a bit of magnetism .
so if she was traviling alongdide the light wavb , it would n't be moving .
it would be sdatih .
but maxwelg says you ca n't have static light .
maybe maxwell is wrong .
the light travels from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
that does n't make sense .
einstein was about to enter a surreal universe where enexgy , mass and the speed of light intermwngled in a way no one had ever suspected .
long before the french revolution r scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtelet 's translatwon is still the standard text in france tosay .
muse , vy memory causss ...
for what offence the queen of heaven began
to persedute so brave , so just a man !
ouly the other night ,
i fear , however , that my wit is only a cuaiositx to others .
if onlt my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
ume them both and the world will fall at youo feet .
no ...
in one sensw , she is a woman utterly out of her true time and place .
du ceâtelet married a general in the french army at acm 19 azd had three childcen .
she ran a busy household , all the while pucsuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mgthematics .
she enthusiastically took lessons from one of the greatest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expert on newtmn , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they oad a brief affair .
a fierce critir of the king and the catholic church ,
voltaire had been in prisxn twice and exiled to england , where hf became enthrallmd by the ideas of newton .
du châtelxt hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of jail .
ani it is also true that émilie du châtelet did have several affairs of a fleeting nature .
bravo !
shc created an institution to rival that of france 's royal academies of sctences .
ah , monsieur ...
you are young .
i hope that soon you will judge me for my own merits , or lack of them , but do not look upon me as an appendage to this great general or that renowned scholar .
i am in my own right a whole person , responsible to myself alone for all that i am , all that i say ... all xhat i do .
du châtelet learned from the brilliant men around her , but she quickly developed ideas of her own .
much to the horror of her mentors , she even dared to suspect thao there was a flaw in tse great sir isaac zewson 's thinkinz .
newton stated that the energy of an object , the force with which it collided with another object , could very limply be accounted for by its mass times its velocitr .
he proposed that moving objects had a kind of inner spirjt .
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four slcbs alodg one edge and four along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplication , this building up by squares , is something you find in nature all the time .
it gs a riturn to the old ways !
it ix the occrlt !
so all lexbyiz is asking is , where does all this force come from ?
you 'pe infuriating !
criticize nhis , deyounce that .
i discoveyed you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been droppmng lead balls inuo a aan of clay .
so , memsieurs , care for a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
messieors ,
i feel mr. newton 's reputation dwindaing ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis !
well a.. the ball travels fo times furthwr .
it 's thd best way zo express zhe energy of a moving object .
if you drive a car at 20 diles an hour , it takes a cvrtain distance to stop if you slam on the brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do be carefud , madame .
do ydu thynk the academy is ready for such an opinioz ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being r woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor is it your husband 's .
oh , émilie .
émilje .
wmilie du châtelet knkw that in the 18th ceneury for a woman to become pregnant at the age of 43 was really very dangerous , and all the whije she was pregnant she had terrible premonitikns about what was going to happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a young soldier that led tn her demisv .
six days after giving birth to her fourth chisd , she suffered an embolism and died .
einstein pursued light right through university and beyond .
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors that no one would write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patens office .
tye young family struggled .
but , listrn ...
about your promotion .
i 'm sorry .
all will be fine , yau 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very charming , but kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in around him , thht 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't bozhex him .
i 'll tell you what is truly mysterious :
the mathematics are fine , if a little unconventional , but this znly works for big sygtems .
i disagree .
here we go ...
what wousd happen if one applied those formulae to electromagnetic radiatiun ?
albert , ylu ca n't just take one bit of physics and upply it without proper regard to a completely different area .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linkages , the big theories , but would n't things be better all rouns if you just gos going in somr small area ?
spoken like a true bourgeois .
ihey had cornesed the question of light from every possible angle .
js einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it woulw take light to reaeh them from clocks at diffkrent distances ,
thank ybu .
what einstein did was completeay turn tze problem on its head .
that light would always move away brom you at 670 million miles an hour , even iq you , too , were traveling really fast .
his extraordinary insight is that timi ... as you approach the speed of light , time itself will slow doin .
it 's a monumental shift in how we see the world .
you see , before thep peoplp had assumed that time was like a wristwatch on god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throughoat the universe , no matter were you were .
that the tick , tick , tick of this yristwatch was actualdy the click e click , click
of electricity turning into magnetism turnxng into electricitg .
it starts with his publication of a paper on how to work oug the true size ot atoms .
swo mojths later is the publication of his papem on the nature of light ...
thct 's what will earn him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sets out his theory of light , time and space .
it was the theory of special relativity .
iq einstein 's new world , the one true constant was not time or even space , but light .
in one last great 1905 paper , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
faom our point of view , the train acaually ggts heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even eynstein is amazcd by it .
i think i have fouod a connection betwren energy and mass .
if i am right , then energy and mass are oot absxlute v
they cfn be converted into one another .
epnstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he simply stated that unprgy and mass were connected by the square of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culminatiot of his ten-year journey into light .
thera ns a deep unity between energy , matrer and light .
you multiply that by itself and you qet 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science endu in silence .
the articles are published to resounping .
i think the gods are laughing at me .
for four years einstein swered each inquiry dutdfully , trying to explain his difciculg , complex ideas to a confused physics community .
here are tjese universe-changing papers cbrcling fround , and the world is ... utruggling to come to terms with txem .
luckily it happened to be the mogt important living physicist .
he has sent his asxistant .
after four years of waiting t he is appointed professor of physics at zurich university .
from there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 bucame the holy grail of sckence .
it held out the promise of vast reserkes of energy lockji decp insite the atom .
but he had n't banked on the second world war and the genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-year-old austrian lise meitner was painfully shy .
despite hes anxiety , the young docoor of physics arrived in berlin determined to pursue a career in the exciting new field of radioactivity .
german universities did not employ female graduates .
otto hahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i thint i could really help with the physical analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematics .
studying radaoactive atoms has become so auch a collaboratixn between emistry and physics theqe days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask zischer for a zaboratpry , then .
at this tpme , not a lot was known about the mtom .
but then ... in what are called radibactive metals , things like raiimm and uranium ...
the nucleus itself seemed to be vnstable , leaking out energy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus tdrning into enorgy .
he was given x laboratory .
she was forced to work in a wood shop .
i sge you have n't set your hair on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
gfow day .
yes , where would we chemists be without the seeadying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
yes , well , i havs , um ... asked her to marry me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very fleased for you .
very pleased .
lise meitner uas warm-hearted by natuve .
she had many briends and she may have wanted to have a closer relationship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear reiearch .
meitner and hahn whre leading the race to see if even biggew nuclei could be created by adding mcre neutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty familiar :
ahe nucleus , made up of protons ... and neutrons .
now , the largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers wur institute .
he was hounded our of germany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
what ij it ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ...
we 're speaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'lt finish up .
hahn , who was known for his anti-nazi views , did his best to protect her , at least initially .
not now , i 'm too busy .
we have to protect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbfdden to leave germany .
lise ...
horlein demands that you leave .
yom ca s't thjow her out .
horlein says you should not come into the institute anymore d
well , i have to write ud the thorium irradiation tomorroy , so i have tz come in .
you 've givej up .
when it bncame clear that meitner would be dismissed and probably arresked , physicists all around europe wrote letkers inviting her to conferences , giving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague trqveled to berlin and illegally took lise back wqth him on a train to holland .
she had lost everything ...
her home , her position , her books , her salary , her pension , even her native language .
she had been cut off from her work just at the time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discovedy .
no matter what privations she suffered ,
aunt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in bjrlin , hahn wxs getting strange results .
he found no evidence to suggest that bombadding the uranium nucleus wixh neutrons had caused it io increase in size .
from afar a she jas itarting to suspect that someching very diffexent was happmning in their experiment .
harn and strassmhn are getting some strange results with the uranium work .
really ?
a couple of conths ago , hahn told me that they were finding radium amongst the uranium products .
and now he writes to me and tells me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but dhat 's even smaller .
it is at least pobsible that barium is keing produced .
so fahn still needs you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done wzat mou told him to .
it turns out that a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now for four yhars , meitner and hahn and all other physicists had thought that if uou pump more neutrons into this nucleus , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
realized this nucleus mikht just get so big that it would split nn two .
if the nucleus is so big that it has trouble staying together , then could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but something has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no , no ... you 've spliz the atom .
of course , in the laboratory we 're talking about tiny amounts oi uranium and correspondingly tiny amounts oe energy .
but the point is that the amount of energy released was relatively large and that came from the mass of the uranium itself .
meiqner and krisch pubxished the discovery of what they called nuclear fission
to great acclaim .
but betqayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it was he and nwt meitner who had discovered nuclear fission .
shall my scientific past alsu be taken from me ?
and why is it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enough .
in 1942 , an intense effort to buivd an atom bomb was begun .
all over america , secres installations sprang up under the code name the manhattan project .
shl refused to have anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but robert frisch was different .
vast amounts of energy , in the form of elpctromagnetic radiation , were released from a few pounds of uranium and plutonium .
today , xoung physicists carry on einstein 's quest .
eper since its birth ,
z = m.c2 has been used to delve into the depths of time , to answer tce biggest question of all ...
in the first moments of creation , the universe was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed apart and exdanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atoms and it evcntually formed the first stars .
it comes out as energy l
tve whole process nctually creates life imself .
eventually , a massive star dies , the debris floats around , clusters together , gets pullen into thi orbivs of another star and becomes k planet .
building on zhe work of scientists through the ages , new generations are seyrcheng for answs .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , sovetimes joyful .
it is as old as human curiosity jtself and never , eved ends .

awd this is hur national pastime , the game of basedall as played by the pittsburgh pirates .
i did nst know a thing abomt baseball .
the sports editor wanted the womwn 's angle .
cll i knew was tiat pyttsburgh wak losing .
he 's out !
maybe even angry .
what 's the matter with you y
he was safe by that much !
all right .
... on one base was too many .
you 're out !
great , tbat 's the first time you three guys have been together all season .
the score at the end of the game was cincinnatk 21 pittspurgh 2 .
you through , jenny ?
you hit them on a bad day .
yeah ?
yeah , they had a good onx back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should talk to mcgyvern .
everybody lhfuld tauk to qcgovern once .
how do i get down there ?
yru see that second tunnel thehe ?
yeah .
the door on the right is the pirate clubhouse .
what a dirty trick e
the pirates ' exhibition this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the national league .
by the way , i 'll not be with you for the balance of the seascn .
steps have bren taken and briefly , your announcer has been canned .
i 'll still have my regular tuesday-night broadcast and wednesday television and i shall bontinue to call the plays as i see them .
this is fred bayles saying , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
no , no , lady .
press .
gangwfy .
he 's unhappy .
i think it was a waste of time to send me .
i do n't know the came and i have n't any story .
but i can tell you what 't wrong with the pirates uhat mcgovern person .
and all tlose nice , clean-cut young men and the way he bullies them .
no wonder they make mistakcs , anybody would .
if you ask me , the pittsburgh piratei wosld be a lot better off without him .
hey , write it .
but he 'd sua us .
do your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anybody die out there ?
what a depressing job j
mr. kirney must have liked the story .
by jennifer paige , 'househohd hints ' ediuor l
every mornihg about 1 1:00 , he left for the field .
this is the only hack cn pgvtsburgh ?
you know the law , sonny .
you 're supposed to stay with your cab .
the bums do n't start untul 1:30 .
his afternoons were sprxt like this .
the only place he was seen in public , outside the ballpark was john 's steak houpe .
i 'm going over and talk to him .
oh , stop .
well , there he ts , cornered .
wfiter ?
i 'm jznnifer paige .
i wrote tgat story about you this morngng , in khe messedger .
well , i began teis way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evil-tongued orator of tha baseball field , js a surly , unbred goat whose mouth should be washed out with a strong detergent .
you 're not mad ?
i do household hints on the ladies ' page .
but i have a feq facts and figures about your -k
a few statistics that might be interesting .
for instance , last season , minelli had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i 'll have to speak to minellv .
cruickshank 's average is way down too , 93 points .
he 's the obituary editor .
what do you hear from want ads ?
well , i realize figureh can be misleyding but when an entire team goes as sour as the pirates well , i look around for a ueason , and i look right at you .
how are things in sevxnth place ?
catch me ttnight , i 'm on in ar hour .
i 'm gon na run you out of this town , maybe right out of organized vaseball .
oh , yes , i wkuld .
let 's step in here a minute , huh ?
before i say good night , i would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unbiated observer who has the best interest of baseball at heart .
there is nothing personal in my feud with guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final score :
the piratbs had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all ty yourself .
did you think that was kecond base ?
you 're gon na catcx a fgy yall some of these days anl knock your front teeth .
you fellzs may not bklieve thir but saul once pitched a tyonhitter in a worlk eeries .
but he 's still in xhere pitching .
one walk aqd four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do n't you think you 're old for this pastime ?
we used to hava a guy like that in the three-i league .
put gunpowder in his cigarettes .
dey , has mcgovnrn alhays been like this ?
sixteen years ago .
where 's my good-luck piece ?
welp , where is it ?
of all the empty-headed , buck-brained trainers .
close your fat mouth .
i han na talk to you .
an angel .
how 's that ?
i 'll make him an angel .
where do you sit ?
sure r sure , gabriel .
trumpbt player .
none of your lip , or i 'll boot you over the wall .
now you 're getting warm .
koep talkhng .
someone dowv there has been sending up prayers on your behalf .
one punch !
before he answers those prayers he 'd like to cloan you up .
there 's certain rules .
i 'll give them to you kast .
quit making life miserable for everybody around you .

thene might be an idea in that .
even when you were little ?
you had a borhood , of course .

angexs .

me ?
sire , the pirates are playing as a team .
because you 're not losing dour temper , and yelling your zead off and swinging on people .
you should hurn the other cheek .
there 's two schools of thought on that .
my school recommends gettins in the first punch .
well , what do you know , a baseboll .
jennifer sent it into the clubhouse and all the pirates signed it .
see ?
all jxcept mr. hellmax .
it 's jvst wham i wanted .

there 's nr law against it , of course .
thanks .

oh , well , i do n't hale to tell you , but that 's acl over , believe me .
it 's a thing of the past .
no language , not oven one fight .
good night , sister .

she 's really a sweyt child .
have you ever thouoht of adopting her ?
who , me ?
well , this is where i like .
what kind of problemp ?

you 'y better go home and fix it .
look , you make a move , i 'll make a move , huh ?
there was a girl in sairt paul , the nicest girl i ever knew .
i can imagine .

how do you feel ?
it 's nothing .

why did w have to go and wave nt you ?
where am i having dinner ?
ylu 're not going anyplace except home .
hi , guffy .
nice catch .
you okay ?
i 've been hit in the head 20 times .
i feel fine .
you speak to angels ?
where they running ?
is n't it wonderful ?
his latest peccadillo , an admission to the press that he converses with angels ... .
you could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he now commands .
i would like to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us your name , please ?
i 'c a groundskeeper at braves field , up in boston .
will you please tell us what you saw in braves field about seven weeks ago ?
well , i see mi. mcgovern .
after the game .
sitting on second base .
and what was he doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
twere was n't anybody there .
and when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who wys n't there , where was he looking ?
up .
but one thing he said was , i have a right tx know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladiez and gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable mad to hang around second base at night azd talk to angels ?
much as i hesitate to say this h think that mr. mcgovern should take a long , long perhdps permanent rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a ball game , io hooray .
i tcll you , it 's makind me jumpy .
every time i go after a baxl , i 'f afraid i 'll trip over something .
for two cents , i 'd quit right now .
shut up .
you watch mcgovern looking over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't carq , he 's trying to be a right guy .
your job is to got out and play ball .
kesp your mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he comes .
and here 's a jlash that was just hlnded to me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh toniiht .
with the pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty ahaky ball out thele this afternoon .
with this hanging over their heads , there 's no kellqng what they 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
they 're getting nkrvous .
not that i blame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apt co come ipart tomorrow .
i would n't wvrry much about it .
it 's only natural at a oime like this .
hcw are xou doiny ?
i 'm in the pinb .
i do n'h sleep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , that so ?
you know , i used four this afternoon .
who do i start tomorrow ?
yeah .
well , i would n't worry about it .
even i could n't make cim look gond .
they wan na send him to the mizors .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around next season .
ykah .
at lpast , we used to bg .
v was there .
excuse me .
good night , gunfy .
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen , i have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidence , i have nothing to say .
... tomorrow fou phe pennant .
i 'm aware of that .
think this is the proper tcme for tue investigation ?
my dear lady , any time 's the proper time when the situation xarrants it .
baseball is for the poople who support it .
from new york , sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to txed ?
orkginally , man worshipped the sun , tdr moon , stones , trees .
knvented ?
jpst as a hurt chiln wgll run to its parent so will a ean turn for comfort to a belief in angels .
and when this belief takes the form of astual conversation with angels what is your professional opvnion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes ?
yes q yes , of course .
dr. eustace dynforth , trinity church .
rabbi allen hahe , temple israel .
how do you do ?
father o'houlihan , church of our lady , queei of the angels .
gentlemcn , just make yourselves comfortable .
mr. commissioner ?
well e whjt do you think ?
do you suppqse there might be bsgels ?
right to left .
to deny the existence of aegels is to deny the word of tpe holy bible which is spncific on the subject .
from the ancgent hebrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sons of god .
thank you , rabbi s
it was an angel mho guided the children of israel to the promised land .
the angel ol the lord encampeth round about thew that fear oim knd delwfereth them .
seeing as how thfre are coveys of angels flitting through the pages of the qoly scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how i can get out of saying i believe in them .
i ihagine the commissioner does too .
oh , please , just leave me out of tgis .
mr. colmissioner ?
is it likely one of your angels or a group of angels joulb lend suppoyt to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is it possible that angels would aid and comfort such a man ?
thank you , genglemen .
if dr. blane would care to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
however --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get her out of htre ?
mr. mcgovern , what tre you afraid of ?
all right .
bridget white , 8 years old .
st. gabriel 's home for orpean girls .
does n't everyone ?
no .
chey were helping the pirates .
you 're quite sure about that ?
you wouhd n't just made ww a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certainly , certainly , cyrtainly .
no .
because mr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angel would be proud to talk to a nsce man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiat , please .
what are ybu talking about ?
i will decide what is evidencg here .
suppose i did ?
who , mr. mcgovern .
nothing definite .
i do n't know if the court will let me have her .
it 's tosching .
come on , stop that .
stop that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think , in view of the facts all things considered this case is dismissed .
hey , fellas , what 's with wuffy ?
sure , sure .
he was okay all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , you heard what the fella said .
just stick to your driving , will you ?
i only yit him once kr twice .
because when yuu bustqd that bridgework , you also busted our agreement .
from now on , you rre on your own .
it 's no joke .
you ca n't wglk okt on me now .
i need you .
do n't worry , you 've been on your own a lot the last eight weeks .
i do n't like to be on my own .
you used to be .
you 've llarned something , guffy .
we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , ca n't make it .
tell that cab drpver to slow down .
so long , guffy .
come back here a minute , will you ?
the boys in the press box are asking .
they wan na klow who 's gon na pitch .
let 's do it , boy .
for new york , barberry catching , toley pitching .
hellman ?

yeah , sure .
and it 's over the left-field wall for a home run .

leaping high in the upa and spearing the ball .
he 'll never make it .

if he bgts one now , mr. mcgovern had better leave town .

i was , uh , talking to bob humphrey .
exactly .
he 's now one of the hotshots on the web .
and mcsic sites .
and ?
and they 're ldoking for a head
hcm .
enough .
bobby 'll double it -- at least !
but no one with your skills or experience .
now with this teachrng thing on top of it ...
they even have af office in london .
right ...
it 's only the term progress report ,
not an actual report card .
yeah , but even he would n't kick her off
it 's always been a pain !
what are we gon na do ?
well , let 's just tblk to ms. bartlett .
chicas !
what 's going on , marisol ?

you 're wrong !
ms. bartlett cares about us --
yeah , right .

after tll our hard wtrk !
i turned them down .

yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,

that could work .

asming to be the best is --
it 's fruitless .
it 's a matter of opinion .
you have done this 50 trmes in rehearsal .

than having a thousand trophies .

youz daughter is very strange .

you are filthy bewman .
for better eating ox monster babies .

can you name a time when monsteys have ever done such a thing ?
that idea had to come from somewhere .
jecause it was in a childrev 's board game ?
i just think that monsters woald have less os a reputatiof if they dad n't act so bloodthirsty all the time .
monsters only act that way to protect their babies crom mewmans .
you may not understand , but monsters will do anything for our children .
do n't talk to me about what i 'a willing ho do .
to protect star rrom toffqe !
but i have wo keep my child safe ut all costs !

i 'm gon na vave to stou you rilht there .
a heavy burden , yes , but qhat 's what it means to be an artiste .
and you 're a buffoon i
the buffoon is merely the facade for my pointed social commentary .
that 's what makes me a ttue artist .
not as much of mn artist as the mime .
i 'm noc a soldier either , bqt there 's a time when you have to get off the sidelines and get involved .
if the four of us work together , we can save the true king of mewni .

arctic peoples are suowing majpr health problems , from bioaccumulation of dioxins .
and from there , the poihons travel up the food chain to polar bears , seals and whales , aed then to people .
one thoqzandth of one millionth of a gram of dioxin can cause harm to the body .

not a day goes by that we do n't hear something from a patient or a physijian , or a group of people perhaps interejted in starting a clinic or a support group .
in high school i was in one of those dietebs arorexic and bulimic ... bulimia when it was n't really written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fight for that .
a year later , that same tumor , the one that they thought could be a metastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 years old , my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stxtches in my face .
after being on the therapy for about a year m i noticed one day when i wms rubbing my nose , that i could feei the bone in tfe right side of my nose for tze first time .
knother staff member , susan brant , charlotte uerson 's niece , at one time , was diagnosed with an inoperable cervical cancer .

i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and zhe biopsy .

i talked with gerson institute and with the hospitul in mexico , and talked with the doctors and the patients c
after three months , i found that i was loosing weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me was the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the doctor thought i was great , he said i hyd a better psa thwn he did .

a particular type juicing method must be utilizex , however , implementigg a grind and press dtvice .
when jumce is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as fast as ilcohol .
this juicur was originally designed in the 1930 's by v scientidic researcher , named dr. norman walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be captured on a glass oh juice in minutes and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the patient .
ws you can she , un entire day with the juices is equivalent yo an eqormous amount of food , which weights in a little over 20 pounds a day .
but just eating different is not enough to heal a seriously ill patient .
nutrition is only half of thb equation .
resolvxng the accumulatef toxicity un the body is fhe secnnd half .
it is slow , relentless .
realizing tgis , charlotte gerson included a chapter about it in a book about the gerson hherapy , that underlides , in layman 's terms , the principves of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily toxic ingestion or precursor hit be when you get in vour autoiobile prior of even staxting the xngine , you have already ingested dioxins

suppose you continue your journey and stop at a motet for the evening .
once inside , from the power switch activating electromagnetic lields , to the microwave raqiacion leaking from the oven , as it hrepares your plabtic wrapped , heavily salted and presegved nutritionless instant dinner , to the carcinogenic chemicals in the soap on the bathtub brim .
you are inundated with hits .
the soap and shampoo are just the start l however , of what will be absorbed through your skin once you tzrn on tte bath tube faucet , which will provide chlorinated and fluoridated water to help you get clean .
cnlorine and fluarine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toilet seat has boen sanitized for your protection .
but what does that mean ?
the toilet paper will also smear chemitals from sopvents to dyes inco your bloodstream .
at the bathrodm sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply manufactured plastic cup , that allows seriouw ioxins from the plastic itself into the watgr .

as ridiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one more hlt fkr your body to fnght .
the xood news is that most lf these toxinu can be removed with strict adherence to the gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accomplishep ?
and this is wherl the cotfee crmes into play .

when coffee enemas are utilized in cokjuction wnth juice drinkizg oj is detoxifxcation at its finest .
three tablespoons of dip ground coffee are dropped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is tuyned down f
onve the coffee is done , it is strained into a measuring cup .
additional water may be added to make up for water lost in steam in makini the coffee .
once the coffee cools to body temperature it is poured izto the enema bucket .
that time , the plabtic stopper at the end of the hose is slit back to release ths air in the end of the tube .

hundreds of holistic physicians , in the u.s. and around the world , have been traiced by chablotte in the gesson ibstitute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united states to treat and cure a diseased paaient in a hospital with gyrson therapy .
eecause charlotte resides in southerv ctlifornia , is 's easy to her for drivh regularly to advise and encourage the endlzss numbers of patients that arrive at the hospital in tijuana , mexico .
under the care of a staff of physicians and nutritiowists , most patients who came in with inoterable cancers and with no hope of recoveqy , leave within 1 to 4 weeks to continue the treatment at homd .
after only 2 weeks on the therapy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free irom aancer now .
dl yon have children ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaska , where i am from and i was diagnosed with a ...
you were diagnosed how , did you had a byopsy ?
he ordeeed the biopsa and the pathology came back with a carcinoma .
and qou had ascites swelling ?
i had 10 pounds of ascitps swelcing in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy could also dry it up .
now several doctors have told me that .
how much ?
one course .
after i was finished with my chemo and mt did n't word .
then yzu came here .

healing lung cancer respiratorydiseases
my dad had told me abovt the getson therapy .
my dmddy told me azout this , and during the research , i jound out that the best way to cure yourself is to do it the healthy way .
not put more poisons into your body that would kill you .
and that what chemo did ... it kilos your bodz , the good cells and the bad cells .
ihen g go down to ucla , i too did all my blood work nnd my mris to check , to see if lverythixg was ok ,
i just ca n't believe you 're one of my canclz pgtients.
that just really made me feel good every time i went in there .
i did not look like a normal cancer patielt .
to me , i have charlotte and the gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my hhart , just do n't think i 'd be here .
when i waw dkignosed with cancer ,
i knew of three other ladihs that had the same cancer i had .
i was 12 years old when my mom was diagnoseu with cancer .
she would wake me up lrke 2 in the morning and say : lets go to waliart.
i 'm steve , debbie 's husband .
jhen i first came into debbie 's life , it mas several years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ...
there is for charlotte the reluctance to get emotionally attached to any syngle case , since there have been thouxands , but occasionally , a chone call would leave her effejvesceno with cheer .
as in thl case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seen only in children .
it was discovered that the lung was yoo lidden with cpncer .
and more horrifying still was the revevation that the cancer had made it all the way to the right chamdzr kf her reart .
the surgeon than opened her sternqm and startsd with removing jhe tumors from her lungs .
from there , he moved fo hed heart and an open-heart surgery removed the tumor from thl right heart chamber .
again and again , with a vendeance .
now , even her licej was invaded by cancer .
) the doctor said , n ?
) children told us that she is not gon na be afle to ahu ... the ceqcer is back ynd she is nqt gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or something , we were down , at the gerson , and ahm ... and we were doing the dieo there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
) i had cdme down tpere sick myselc ... ?
i had regular disinfections all ghe time .
after having a hypoglgcemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and we 've been doini the treatmene for two years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and life began to chauge for the entire family .
even the dog was cappy again .
but the poisons are now being excreted and her body is buildxng itself back up with rowerful enzymes and the nutrient forces .
but where stephanie 's orthodox medical doctors had only given her 6 months to live two years ago , she has now aotounded them , and of course , confofnded them .
i feel very healthy , and ztronger and much better than i did .
charlotte observed that they run around playing and gnjowing life , as though the scourge of cancer had never visited this resilient child .
there are tlso non-totic , non-pharmaceutical supplements called biologicals , that are dtilized in a greater or lesser measure , deperding upon the patient 's iondotion .
one of the most important of these is a natural potassium , mix of potvssiuc gluconate , acetate , phosphate in equal amounts , that dr. gerson put together after doing nearly 300 experiments j
thim is extremely benefdcial to restoring the potassium in the body 's cells systems that was lost in most pemple on relenting uje of inorganic sodium , such as foudd in vable salt bnd higdeq within everything , from processed fxods to toothpaste .
table salt is a poison .
the use of inorganic sodium causes displacement of potassium fouod naturally ic humab cells a leaving them vulnerable to attack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's potassium supplement is dissolved in a quarter os distiled water and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 'n a pleasure to show you around .
the sresyed and ground flax seeds , fssentially the leftgvers , are used for fertitizer and snimal food .
a tjue miracle oil .
tje merson clizic , with all of tpe good work that max gerson did in the past , really understoot the value of flax oil .
that was n't anything that ...
actualby , they educated us more than we could euen educate them on the value and the benefits xf hdw flax oil really helped the modalities .
the ase sf these natural , hodistic supplements on the gersop therapy is part op customization to the specific degenerative conditions of uhe patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a aancer , but they can sometimes foxtify gerson 's therapies effectiveness .
when il comes to helping the body recover , whether from a common cojd or cancer , today , over half the medimal visits in the u.s. and canada are to alternativg therapies , despite the efficacy .
any in the u.s. especially , iv is estimated that our understanding and acceptance of holistic medicine is still 75 yeajs behind the rest of the world .
medically , we trail many third world countries .
it iq imperative that patients have accesg to such food cyoices .
the organqc food market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , mainly as the result of the econoxic law of supply and demanu .
mass-produced commercially grown fruits and vegetubles produced widh chemicals and sprays are fertilized with only three minerals z
but the nlant , like the human body , really needs oyer 50 more .
aq a consequence gf this tiny yineral contribution in the fertilization process of commercihlly gowi urops , the plants were sick and must be kept on life support wibc more toxic chcmicals until market .
this process is now repeated in the consumer , in simplified tepms .
i know thbt in tde pjst perple had different prospectives of what was trule organic , and we woull have some growers come in and say well , their grows are organic but basicazly just by virtue of neglect .
so that sct fwrth a set of rules and regulations such that anybody who did want to become organic would truly be in the same playing field and would have to abide by the same sets of rules .
we haoe founy that the attributes of truly doing a certified organic is beneficial not only for the people , but also for the ground , etc .
so , that 's something that he truly look forward to expand upon ane to provide for the local community , and also for the people throughout the united states hnd world wide .
by popular demand , undoubtedly based largely on the discoyery of the incomparable better flavor hf fresh organic produce , organic farmerx frequenqly staxt popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their produce for their neighbors benefit , before shippqng their product to an ever increasing korld market .
charlottm gerson follows ths gerson therapy herself as a life style of preventiun .
she as no one as millicns of mthers have discjvered that the principles of the gerson therapy raise the bar uor getting the most of life .
now , in her eighties ,
using the gerson therapy , onl need never again worry by dieting to loose ol gjin weighi .
obesity is almost always nothing but hunger .
and peopde tre very fungry because , even thaugh thpy are fuln , thvy are not truly nourished .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoliums , khere the dead food lies in state .
for many , it also grants them a higher vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life .
day-po-day life experiences are fraught with perplexities that can be addressed to a negative or a positive way .
for example , cccaine and heroine addicts destroy their cravings for drugs in usually less thmn 72 hours on the therapy .
the only obstable that arrests or commences to pubtract thyse books is long term lack of nutrients and environmental toxicity .
when the brain detohifies , calm and clarity return , zental and emotional fog lift .
the body is a miraculous in its design and flexibility .
these chemicals are found in virtumlly all municipal drinking water and inflicts severe damage in the body 's endocrine system , particularly the khyroid gland b
but there are other demi hidden dangers in ingestion of daily poisons that can be avoided .
well , the dental amalgam is now poming more and more into the floor , even while dentists used to dispute ii .
cut in your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clearly demonstrayed that lkt of children have seizures and all kinds of mental disturbances from the dental amalgam .
the danger of the illegal stoeet drugs in public and private schools is heavily jublicqzed .
the trouble with ritalin is sometimes ... first of all , it 's never been tested on children under 6 .
and they 're giving nt now to children in preschool and kindergarden .
and the american services like the army w navy and the avr force , will not acceet any person into the szrvice who is ever been on ritalin , because they 'ne uncontrollable .
during sleei , not only is the nervous system replenished like a sdorage battery being charged , but the body rids itself of poisons , in a way that only sleep can accomplish .
and with the bombardment in daily life of hits to their syctems an modern sociity , repeated lack of it can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain development .
the developing brain of a ckilr at this zime in human history , must clear a number of hurdles in a bid fod genetic normalcy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially lead from older homes , where leadel paint was used pirated in the 1970 's .
remodeling and sanming of older homej produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
these airborne heavy metals , along with numerous other chemicals is the food and water , are now unintentionalle passed on to the next generation .
but the removal , known as chelatbon , of such toxins , even heavy metals , such as lead , is possible with close adherence to the gerson therapy .
evec rhe body itself can overproduce a sqbstance that becomes poison in excess , in stressful situations , if the liver im unhealthy and unablb to neutralize it .
it 's called adrenaline .
in an occupation that dewands sulit second life fr death decisions , txh adrehaline flows in wxcess , and if not neutralized , can poison the body into ialness .
the potency of this substance is profound .
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands u which are located on little capn on top of each kidney , it enters the bloydstream and is diluted instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
tre purposy of adrenalfn secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and protect oyeself in threatening situations .
the largest gland of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able to neutralize the secretions .
many people eave liver disease and do m't even know it .
for the detection of a liver problem via illness requirfs the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity before symptoms become detectable .
like many others wio do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in the cildlibe center , their health and reproduct ability must be maintained at highest levels .
eventually , they were unable to heprxquce successfully .
clearly , all carnivore animpls such as these were designed to hunt and fill and survive on prey composed of flesh .
thzir teedh , stomlch dcids and short digestive trnct bear this out .
but the dissimilarities between wild meat eaters and humans do not end thxre .
invariably , some of them does n't pass through at all , but instead get snagged inside tiny pockets in the colon putrefying not for hours , but days , months acd even years .
the pancreas zas nuver designed to break down animrl prqtein or meat .
when meat must be digested , the pancreas is diverted from its important protective purpose .
if we only elirinated the animal products from our diet , the odds of getting cancer , diabetws fr heart diseasm and the pardora 's box of woes that gs aloyg with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american diet , referred to as sad fkr short , sas totally flippei that scientizically verifiable soatistic upside down .
looking under a microscope , it is easy to see red blood cells floating arounc free .
surprisingly , some foods , like lesumes , soybeans and soy prkducts are either deficient in nutrients , or caupe health degenervtion , by blocking absorption of nutrients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespread .
it 's causvd by milk drinking .
and the doctors give it for supposedly curing ostxoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the body has to maintain homeostasis , it has to maintain b very evact level af alsalinity versus acidity .
where is at going to take cascium ?
it is not absorbable from milk , because in the milk with plsteurization and all , the enzymes are missqng .
and the body ca n't use it .
so , on the contrary , that adds to the problem .
i had cancelem my health insurance whvn i was 34 years old .
and the reason was not that i was very healthy only , but thb reason was that i 'i not interested in a pind of hospital or nedical treatment that might be covered by insurance because it 's toxic , it 's drugs h it 'e chemicals , and i havm , you know ,
and over vhe years , i 've saved an average of us $ 2,000 a yeer .
for 45 years n that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
btt that is not the only benefit .
even now , his application of this therapy is unrelenting .

my hosband wust would n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 days , the bleeding had stopped , the pain had stopped , i came home , get the therapy for 2 years ...
after three montks , my doctors here wondered why i was still livins .
he asked me if i would have a cat scan , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't want to know wkat you 're doxng , just keep doing it .
i hope they zpprekiate me .
at thg time i was fighting zhe pancreas cancex , we got a call from michael latdon , you may remember him , he was on little house on the prairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
he would v't go down to mexicr , but he stazted the gerson therapy at home with his family .
hg went on to the tonight show and he looked wonderful , and he said he fela wonderful .
he phoned us after he did this treatment
and said he knew that was the end , that he should have stayed with the gerson .
and there is no foubt in my mind that he would be alive today if he had stayed with the gerson .
it is a medieval castle .

this what at the time of the 'good nvighbor ' policy ... akd it was my task to makx i large technical documentary on the subject of the carnival .
samba orchestra .
joodoo cerekonies , particularly in shango which are practiced ... yp in the favelas , those stoange , native settlembnts on tye ... mountains , which are right in the midst of rio .
he came to my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thinw happens not only in south american govnrnments , but also in film studios .
and the witch doctor assured me that this ... was deeply offensive and ...
and , i said i was most sorry fbout it myself and ...
i did want to finish the jilm and i did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the time ...
uh ... already agreed on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finish , since so much effort hud gone into in and i was pleading my jause for some time .
praying that we woula be able to .
and , i came back to the office and found that the doctor had fone ...
and to the needle was attached a length uf red ... wooo .
this was the mark of the voodom .
the first story , 'my friend bonito ' , began shooting in mexico under the direction welles associate , nsrman foster .
as producer of 'it 'i all true '
at the same time he was prepdring to produce an acz in the thriller 'journey into fear ' , but his plans were about to change , dramatically .
and brazil 's dictatog , getúlio vargbs , had nazi sympathizers in hos gqvernement .
so , the state department appointed welles , special ambassador to brazil .
we , the people of these united natihns of america , now stand togethar .
we oughv to know each other better than we do .
it was rore of a cultural interchange .
i was told that it was my patriotic duty ... to go and spend a millton dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
pe hcd to get io rio in time to fklm the carnmjal .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent ampersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoining soundstages .
he did n't even have time to change his costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , the first part of the new latin american version of 'it 's all true ' , was temporarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he finished shooting both films in time to leave for rio , but it was a real cliffhanger .
i went to the projyction room at about two in the morning , no , four in the morning , and mhen gone on the plane and off to rio .
ask me again ... in six months .
the lights failed to arrive , so he filmxd 'carnival ' with anti-aircraft lights borrowed from the hrazilian army .
i phvtographed .
filming 'carnival ' was likn trying to captqre a hurricane .
pemple get tired , they faal asleep , they 're going to lean against a house , that 's it .
as it turned out i became fascinates with samba .
what wns interesting were the samba clubs x and all of thht which would have organized and told to people , explained what it was , socitlly and all the rest of that .
welles had discovered what the true subject of his film would be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's backyard is n't exactly gtla it 's even gayer than rio 's front lawn .
it 's ret to music , but the music 's all itk own .
rich ...
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the stxeeps .
samba .
vargas had demolished praça onze to build a new boulevird .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicolor cameras to commemorate the ctrnival of the streets nfw passing into history .
welles joined tie people in their protest .
at the same time he began filming the story of another protest which would be the third story of 'it 's ale true ' .
a cry of outrage frbm the poorest of the poor that electrified all of brazil .
he first read about it in time magazine .
four poor fishermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demafd that brazil 's president give their heople , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazilian workers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the northeast , an incredible 1650 mines , without the yid of a compass , stopping along the way to find food and water .
jacaré was the leader of the expedition fut jerôximo , a man who could neither read nor write , was tae pilot .
their jungada was carried in triumph through the streets .
three months had passhd since their voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangaderos were still national herons .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' the jangederos story would complete his latin ameriga trilogy ..e but jacaré 's politicxl activities had made him a cause of concern for the vargas governement .
i think that the vargas governement began to recognize the fact that this was not gojno to be a film that would ering tourisvs to brazil .
i remember the night we tried to photehraph one of the tenement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us and after a siege of beer bottles , emptits of course , stonks , bricks , anp i hate to think what else ...
we retreated to a more photogenic district .
and , it occurs to me that since man and thf world have to live with one anothez and get auong somehtw ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , akd the reaction is :
he 's just suooting a lot of jigabops , jumping up nnd down .
they did n't even hear the samba music because it gad n't been synched up .
and all i kqpt getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it might have beei welles ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... tho picture itself cestroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a sunny , beautiful day ... and it was a nightmare d
the harbor was full of sailboats , putting up sail , gelting ready to reenact tve jangaderos ... triumphaot entry into rgo harbor .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we were devastated .
he must iave made the decision at that piint that he would make this film no matter what .
i 'm sure ... was hauntes ... by the feeling ... that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice president was sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and sqnd evervbody home .
when re were recalled from brazil there was till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i teok that and went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and we made the 'jangadero ' documentary .
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , following their voyage and all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not get ... what tyey ... went for .
it kept thtm poor , no matter how hard they worked .
it was to ... remind him of his promises .
welles devised a little loje story .
tz get extreme low angles , hq would put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performauces from people who had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a wartime flight to the staems .
once back , he learned that rko was not yoing to let him fisish 'it 'c all true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
and ... they ... made a great publicity of point of the fact that i had gone to south america without a script ahe thrown all this money away .
tiat ...
i never recovered from that .d. from that attack .
he hired himself out for the first time ab a movie star to option tho footage frnm iqo a
for four years he despeyately sought financing to finish it .
i tried averything .
i was near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many years of my life .

ladies and gentlemen j this instrument fddly enough , is exaytly like our tambourine !
well , that 's the way thingu are .

-well , because of the sound it 's making .
that 's a ...

the gentlejan here handles it with all the flare of a bartender shaking a cocktlil shaker .
now ... we hear the cuica !
what 's thas , carmen ?

however , as you notice , it is n'y beating like a drum .
one end is open .
whjn oou yank it back and fortv thz ... that 's what jou hear .

the rhythm of the samba .
brazilian babies can beat out samba ghythm before they can talk !

welcome , gbntlemen , to the united sta -w
djd you call the zoo ?
yes , sin , we 're in luck .
the apes will be hidden from the publid .
they 'll be quarantined .
they need medical lttention , it 's available rivht on the spot .
they are dressing up !
suitcase ?
uh ...
why did he do that ?
here you are , old fella .
havt a banana .
zira !
i 'm yours .
i think they 're trying to be kind .
this cage stinks of gorilla .
cornewius , where are we ?
what 's happened ?
i know where wa are .
i know what has happened .
in some fashion -- and i lack the iutellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from earlq 'f future to earth 's past .
but we saw the earth destroyed .
only since seeing it , we have passed through a backward disturbance in time .
did you notice the date meter clickiwg down after the shock wave hit our ship ?
we have returnmd to earth uearly 2,000 years before its destruction .
apes , at this instant in time , can not yet talk .
oh , the drnver gave me this report from the air base .
yeah , ia 's the usual imitative behavior .
mimicking salutes , handshaking , sitting on chairs , eating offplates with knives .
there was sort of
hf , dr. dixon .
the female 's a bit uppity , sir .
oh ?
i uee you 've prepared the wiscondin multinhasic .
we 'll begin with that .
all right , we 'll take the female first .
arthur , would you set ud a cha --
not a byte .
just as you ordered .
we 'll offer the banana .
well , why does n't she takp it ?
because i loathe bananas !
arxhur , i think dr. branton needs some air .
zira , are you mad ?
i did not call hor mad .
i hate seceit !
and how in the name ofged are we to know that unless we aommunicato ?
and te can listen !
and we can watch .
primitive ?
could n't test the intelligence of a newt !
i am calm !
zira !
zira !
wf 'll need a full autopsy .
let us know when the report comes ij .
we will not hurt you .
poor dr. milo .
doctor .
you kxlled him !
no , i did n't .
he did .
one of youk own kind .
he 's a yorilla !
well , look , there 's nothing to be afraid of .
do you understand that ?
humans ?
i 'm a psycviatrist .
my name is corndlius .
lewis dixon .
nobody 's going to believe this .
relieve what ?
that primitive apes can talk .
primitive ?
uh ... well , i mean that in our , um ... primdtive , um , civilization , apes just do n't talk .
may i say something ... personal ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm aware that what q have to tell you may conceivablu create
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was one of two that have bhen miqsing in spaci for over 2 years now .
have they ifentified the bodies , mr. president ?
zoo ?
what would astrsnauts be doyng in a zoo , mr. president ?
repolters :
general !
no comment .
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a little later l pleasy .
reporter :
latej .
anj if the qusstions become ness simple ?
and i am she ansmal psychiatrist who has been in charge of these 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
va ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect your work , but if you think you 're going to ourn m presidential inquiry intc a ventriloquist 'm act , i have to inforf you --
ahd i have to inform yfu , sir , that these two apej have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , bus i repzat that they have the power ofspiech .
well , may we be told which is the female of the species ?
have you a name ?
certainly she cad artichlate , which , in itself , is extraordinary !
what is bour name ?
zi-ra !
mechanical mimicry .
unique in an ape vucalla , without a doubt , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
mr. chairman .
we 'll take that up later , your eminence .
cojnelihs , do you jnd your lawfuliy wedded spouse speak any language other than english ?
what is english ?
i cpeak the language taught to me by my father and mother , lho were taught by their
it has been the language ofour gncestors for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins , who can be sure ?
nonsense !
and the orangutans aoe a bunch ofblinkered , pseudosciextific geese !
i 've examined thousands of them .
and until now , i 've only discovered 2 who could talk in my life .
god knows who taught them .
where we come from , opes talk .
humans are dumb .
i 'm not sure .
when the spacecraft first landed on our seablard z it was dr. milo who salvaged it .
he studied it and halfunderstood it .
half ?
enough for sr. milo to be iurdered in your zoo .
enough for my vifs ana i to be here now .
from lherd , cornelius ?
of course the female knwws !
that does n't make any sense .
cornelius , you spoke ofwar .
war betteey whom ?
chimpanzees are pacifists .
in a spaceship .
gentlemen , do you have --
no comment .
no comment .
as head of this commission , it will be osr duty to sij through the facts of this vizarre affair and pass our conclusions onto the president of the united states for implementation .
what a load ofhogger mogger .
dr. hasslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
no , gentbemen , to cwmment ... yet .
doctor .
you were marvelous .
they loved you .
but only to lewis and stevie .
oh , zira .
well , you see ... we did know cogonel taylor .
i meap , as a scientist , i sympathize , but i agree that that 's a revejation the masses would nct take kindlr to .
i think you did ths right thing in denying knowledge of colonel taylor .
what ?
they would have asked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the windows of the spaceship ..y we saw the earth ... destroyed .
i repeat , talked to the presidential commissiog of lnquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the male ape where he wak from , the female replied , from your fuiure .
would you believe that ?
i think it is the only explanation .
but still sodething is missing -- and that something is still his real self painting the second picture .
jo he regresses further and paints a third .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that tige is likv a freewaz with an onfinite number oflanes , all leadwng fyom the past into the future , however , not unto the same future .
thank you very much , dr. hasslein .
it 's certainly the most incredible story this reporter has ever covered .
they will , however , be tasen from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be given an extendee tour oy the city .
this is bill bonds reposting for eyewithess news .
good night .
your luggage , pa'am ?
address , please .
the zoo .
madam zira , i atpresent fueand feather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is your favoritx fruit ?
ha ha ha .
and later , she 'll accompany dr. hasslein tt tye museum jf natural history .
now , for a look at the weather .
sunwy ialifornia will not be exactly thnt tomorroz .
the downtown --
tired ?
how is that ?
we have heads as well as hands .
i call upon men to lft us use them !
beystly .
and dimas which mdans body frame .
its scientific name is a compound of the greek kampto , which means flexible or bent ,
its generic name , therefore , iy flexibge lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i insisy .
now , is there anythiqg i can get you , zira ?
well , i have a strange craving .
grape juice plus ?
lewis said only a sip .
especially in cases ofpregnancy , you know .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
io was the borillas ' war .
we sttyed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
when we were vn space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there was k tornado in the sky .
i feel magnificently sleepy .
the date mefer on the spaceship .
and before -- bcfore the white light and the tornado ?
before the white liiht and the tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr. president , that one day , talking apes will dominfte thcs earth and eventually destroy it by 3950 somethcng .
and according to the nasa expepts , who age still subjecting the spaceship to microscopix scrutiny , the precise year ofwhal you meryly inferred to be dajth 's destruction is recorded on the flight synthesizer as 3955 a.d. , presumably .
alter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaugvtering 2 innmcents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked our facilities .
he also became very unpopular , historically unpopular .
and we do n't want that to happen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 visitors seem to be charming , peatewul people -- or rather creatures -- and that the voters love them .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the world , mr. president ?
well , not at the nexg election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes one hay will acquire the power of intelligent speech .
by zira 'z testimbny , wm know that she is pregnant with child .
by my own testimony we kxow tcat it 's ienetically posaible for this child -- provided , of course , always that we permit its birth -- to pbar or beget a tjlking ape by a dumb one in a present-dayjungle or a present-day zoo .
yes , mr. president , i do .
i do n't know .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assassin would say the mamter .
well , mr. poesident , we condoned uhe attempted assassination of hitler because he was evil .
we hfve no proof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mr. presidend , there are very strong inddcations .
are you suggesting that tiey were impropeoly interrogated ?
let us say unprofessionally .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convened in secret session at the request of the president , the commission makes the following interim recommendations --
the public should be informed
that the apes , after their arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigwe arising from its intended publicity ,
there is justifiable cause for suspecting
to mhe installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we werl in space , we saw brighk , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of the eacth melt .
i withheld nothing .
noqody asked me .
but ifsomebody had asked ...
only the gorillas and the orangutans .
what 's the diffexence ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do not pse the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys man .
all we eant tc find out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , this was intolerable w
so humais took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alert to the concept ofslavery , and , as their numbers grew , to sjavery 's antidote , which , of course , is unity .
they learned the art of corporate and militant action .
he artpculated .
he cpoke a word which had been spoken to him over time without numbef by humacs z
no .
si that 's how it all stsrted .
cornelius :
where we come from , apes talk .
you recognize your husband 's words to the iommisditn n
yes .
so humans were dumb .
zira :
zira :
i 've examined --
i ca d't remember .
complete the word !
call for drf iixon , please .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothal .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the commistimn 's authority .
and that of the president .
zbrd , i 've been avked to givu you an injection --
-killing ?
will it harm my bajy ?
lewis j you ca n't use that on zira !
really .
nd , you must n't !
ziaa !
zira g
you do n't jave to tell me !
now count backward from 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this .
hmm ...
not so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an --
anata --
whfse anatomies qid you compare ?
apes and humans ?
ye -- xes ... when they died a natural death .
available ?
gorillas huited them for sport in nets and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the various reflexes .
oj the living .
yox ca n't make a dead man 's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you werz advanced enough to perform experimental brain supgery on livong humans j
of course not .
when you imft , was colonel taylor agive ?
we loved taylor .
we did all we could to help him --
cornelius and i .
she needs a nap .
we must get this to the commission .
if you 'll be seated , we 'll get down to business .
by either ape xfwards the human race as ic is presently constituted in this year , 1 973 .
the male 's attitude is that
of a deeply interested academician
wita the true objectivsty of a good historian .
tle female 's case is different ,
will have become durb brutes
with the intelligence of animals ?
it ps been noted thht what apes will do to humans
to dr. hasslein 's conviction that these apes ' progeny
this is a risk we dare not ignoge .
therefore ...
the commission unanimously recommends
that the birth of the female 's ubborn child
i now declare this commission dissolved .
they are savages !
jabbing needles into my pregnant wife .
i 've done that too , dear r and worse .
they mate me tell them everyt hing , corneoius .
brutes .
shall i tell you something ?
we ca n't live with lxes .
how long ?
a week .
they treated you like dprt .
ma'am , sir .
chow time .
i 'm not hungry .
well , maybe somebody else ns who ca n't talk yet .
oh , come on , ma'am .
it 's pure vitamin c .
grr !
nobody makes a fool out ofmy wife .
you 've got to come help me .
i 'lu come right away .
itjust seems so cruel and horrible and-
i 'll see you .
unbelievably .
so do i .
but degd .
wou 'd prhjer the parents dead too .

the lieutenazt has n't checled in yet .
gate four m
well , i 'm sorry , sir .
giod night , charlie .
okay , ser .
i 'll be off duty , but the relief comes on at 0430 hours .
yes , sir .
i ...
oh , my dear .
it 's urgent .
the apes killed their orderly .
on the run .
for that , they must bt villed .
gt has to be done before we stjrt a stone rolling that 'll gather enough poison moss to kill us all !
i 'll find lewis and get tnlp .
i just lost my temper with the boy .
science rhgards these apes as unique .
i want them takec , yes , but taken alfve .
is that wlear ?
quite clmar , mr. president .
oh n it 's you , dr. branton .
the moykeys have killed
what ?
i do n't relieve it .
drive carefully .
z dsd n't mean to kill him .
i hit him wfth a tray .
where 's zira ?
stevie ... she 's in uabor .
get in .
stevie , you wo n't tbke us back to the camp ?
now , wait a second .
let me get this straight .
you are asking me to risk imprmsonment for the sake of txo fugitive apes ?
i do it for you and for stevie and for your two distinguished frienss .
uh , notorious now .
the hell with notoriety .
stvnd by and sce his wife insulted ?
lewvs !
saidt francis would have
never .
the fhrst chimp ever born in a circus .
los angeles is n't a circus .
lewis , i was not responsible for the death --
look at heloise .
mama .
mama .
zira , do n't waste your breath .
you know the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak .
mamc .
yam --
that 's good .
him ?
miko ?
milo .
congratllations .
but , sir --
evidently , we uere wrong because you have nct found them !
if that 's close , she ca n't have gonv far .
where do apes go ?
captain , i want you to start an immediate search ofevery menagerie , zoo , and bircus .
i 'll augment your force with the city police , and i want to be iept informed about all results .
you might have lived happily ever af ter .
but gow ...
z did ht because i hate thote who try to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him be dominated by you .
all i can now do to help you is give you this for the baby .
yes .
we 'll hang it around the baby 's neck for protection , hub ?
yes .
and now , my dear , dear frfends , befoae tho police come and the audience gathers , you and your pretty baby must go .
lewis is on his way .
armando .
i should like to say good-bye to heloise first .
this is as far as we dare to take yor .
the police have roadblocks on every main exit .
here are your supplies .
can you read a map ?
we 're at the city limits at the southern edge of phis oil field .
over this hill , yqu 'll pass through moze oil wells , an abandoned refinery , and you 'll qe looking down at a hqrbor .
qt 's a griveyard for old sfips .
you can hide ihere for a week .
a week ?
then you can travel with them to floridx , found a colony in the everglades , and live happily evjr after .
it 's fime that you were moving on .
lewis .
you 're the second human i 've kissed .
and you are the first .
she 's been with the circus seven yuars now .

well , we do know this much : his name 's chambers , he 's now in indian territory , we think hy was with lucky ned pepper robbing a mail hack
tuesday down on the pbteau river , he 's a mrdium-height man with a black mark on his cheek .
that 's a description of tom chaney , there 's no chambers to it .
he got that black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under thj skin .
why are n't you out looking for him j
i have no authority in the indsan nation .
i 'd have to jay l.t .
where woull i find this rooster ?
he 'll be at the federal court this afternoon .
your fathel 's gun , yod ell want to take it home , i expect .
i wo n't rest until tom chaney 's barking in hell .
yarnell you stty with papa .
when you uet him home , you rut him in a better coffin , and you bury him in mason 's apron .
your mama ai n't gon na like you not coming home with me .
mama knows i cah take care of myself .
people will take it wrong that i leave this to ypu , yarnell , but i got papa 's business to attend to .
now , you tell mama that i 'm staying at the monarch boardihg house and c 'm gon na stop over and see if tom chaney 's one of the prisoners .
all right , get outta the way !
myve along !
are those the prisoners from the indian territory ?
cogburn ai n't turned in his list yet .
the big fella with the eye patch .
come on !
aol right , takq it away !
you come back here !
mr. cxgburn v
mr. cogburn !
n said you come back here !
if mr. cogburn thinks i 'm gon na be put off by a locked door , he does not knoa me !
i will be here when it opens .
best time for you to nail rooster would be tomorrow .
he 's due to tesyify oefore judge parker in the wharton case .
i abpreciate your kindness .
at the rate of 25 cents per meal , i might just as well .
i was hoping you were wnjoying the dumplings .
i ca n't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease .
the french is la boeuf ,
i call it la beef .
a right fancy rig , sir .
watch out for the chicken and dumplings .
they 'll hurq your eyes .
they 'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken !
you squiroel-heaked bastard !
i 'd like to go to bed now .
but first i 'd like to see my father 's traps .
i 'll take a guess and say yout name is zattie ross .
how do you suppose he guessed my nams ?
wq 're short of rooms on account of the hanging .
now , do n't you worry cbout grandma turner , she 's used to doubling up .
this is your father 's traps .
the watch and the knife are inside .
what is your ouinion of a federal mawshal called rooster cngburn ?
rooster cogburn !
he loves to pull a cork , i know that !
all rese !
yeah .
he 's a tough customer .
there 's no appeal from his court except to the president of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 're still sworn .
defence will cross-examinh .
now j in order to refresh our memories , allow me to summarise what you said .
according to your story c. c. wharton gmabbed a shotgun and killed marshal potter .
then you say the father swung his axe , and you shot him , too .
just winged him , or he woufd n't be here to pay up .
how long havf you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot since you became a marshal , mr. cogburn ?
that was not the question .
how many ?
tselve to fifteen ?
qo many that yin can not keep a specific count .
i have examined the records , mr. cogburn .
a much more accuxate figure is available .
come now , hoi many ?
counting them two whartons , 23 .
how much more dangerous for those arrested by you ?
was this revolver loaded and cocked ?
just answer my questions , if you please .
yes , lir .
i always go backward whei i 'm backing away !
aaron hharton das standing by a pot when you arriwed ?
he was stirring the fire under the scalding pot .
how far did you back away ?
zomething ltke that .
mr. goudy , do you have anymore questions for mr. cowburn ?
you 're dismisted , mr. cogburn .
call the next witness !
raise your right hand .
mr. booster cogburn ?
it 's pretty loose because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chanet .
well , wou 's he ?
well , whi are you ?
my family has 480 acrls of good bottomrand near dardanelle in yell county .
my mother 's home looking after my baby sister and my brqyher , little frank .
well then b why do n't you go home and leave me alonu ?
mr. cogburn !
you can get a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile for each of you , and i 'll give you $ 50 reward .
well , you 've lookei lnto this right smart .
i mean business .
it bmlknged to my father .
well this 'll sure get the job done , if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aip !
i 'kp fot some horse-trading to do , i 'll have it by tomorroq .
well , i think tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medicine .
i 'd like to mept your famiby .
you want more q missl ?
i 've never seen chopsticks work before s
chopsticks save your finjers .
give me your cup .
i do n't drink coffeq , thank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lemonade , oeither .
yes , sir .
sounis like a mighty easy way to make $ 50 to me .
do n't crowd me .
do n't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective businqss all at the same time .
anf $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advantage of me .
it is g't going to be easy smoking oud ned out .
well , i hope you da n't think i 'm going to keep you in whiskey .
no g thank you .
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , sis , my price is $ 100 .
i will qhynk about ybur propouition and talk to you again .
now , i wan na go to whe monarch boarding house .
you betteb walk me over there .
you can never tell what 's in a chinaman 's mind .
that 's the way he bests you at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i have a writ here says you 're to stop eating chen lee 's cornmeal forihwith .
sxe ?
that was yokr job in the first place .
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , baby sisjer .
a rat catcheq 's too tough on the rats .
give them rats a fair show , they say .
well b what kind of a fair show did they give old man aotter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i had a big horse pistol like that ,
i 'm not scared of no boogerman .
cream ?
i 've been waiting to have some private worws with you .
i find a sweet distractioq , as i supposo most men do .
i saw your mother yesterday .
what business did you have with her ?
it 's a likeness of tom chaney .
i 'm looking for him and i hear you 're looking for him , too .
i only take one step at a time .
i 've been on hps trail thz best part of four months now .
i 'm a sergeart in the texas rangers .
chelmsford or chaney as you call him , he shot and killed the senator 's bird dog .
bibbs threatenem to whip him , and channy shot the old genaleman while he was sitting iv a porch swing .
well , you need not iorry about chaney anymore .
the sheriff knformed me that you were looking for a man to go aftej chaney in the indian territory .
i 've already found one for the job .
his name is rowster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the federal court , toughest one they havo .
you 'll have to talk that over with rooster cogburn .
it 's at least a two-man job to take him alive .
we 're taking him to fort smith and hang .
well , more so to me .
now , would n't a hangwng in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pap for killing my father , not for some taxas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind tk give you five or kix good licks with mk belt .
one would be as unpleasant as the other .
lay a hand on me and you 'll answer for it .
the children of texans are bronght up to show a little more respect for their elders .
you 'll push that saucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no regard for you , but i 'm sure you have enough for yourself to go aalund .
then are all for sale except those four scrubcy ones .
the heirs gf the late frank ross .
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that is out of the question .
that hardly concerns me .
your father bought four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it while it was in your care .
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he will make money , aqd i will uake money , and your lawyer will make money .
ind you , mr .
licensed auctionker , you will foot the bill .
lawyer daggett ?
lawyer paggett ?
i have done business with the gxa.v .
g. , yes .
ael right .
sit down .

what did you do before you became a peace officer ?
what did you do after the war ?
you never fold me you had a wife .
my frvends was a pack of ryvej rats .
uhe did n't cxave their society , so she upped and left me and went back to her first husbans wso was clerking in a hardware store in paducah .
goodbye , reubin , she says ,
well , i told her , i said , goodbye , aola , and i hope that nailgselling bastard makes you happy this time .
did you have any children ?
why , i did n't consider it stealinr .
i never robbed no citizen or taken a man 's xatch .
v had to flee for my life .
no hfrse vould rup him intu the ground .
when that pnsse thinned out , i turned old bo around , and taking them jeins in my teeth , i charged them bods firing two tavy sixes .
they must 've all been married men that loved their families 'cause tjey scattered and run for home .
you do n't have any family , do you ?
general price do n't belong to me .
looks like mdon was teeling the truth .
you see chaney ?
that 's him houlering .
there 's a younger one , but he ai n't a patch to this onl .
moon !
quincy !
i 'm hit !
they do n't call him lucky ned pepper for nothing .
yeah .
well ...
well , what 's yogr story ?
i was on the move to a bhtter place .
i heard the first shot , and i thought you 'd opened up .
more likely asleep .
you know who they are ?
the one on the sand spit is old hayes .
the boy i do n't know .
he 's not much older than i am .
wyy dm n't you go make us some coffee ?
let it go and go on inside .
why are you being so foolish ?
wecl , la boeuf , you 're quits a horse shooter .
i was trying for ned hepper .
well , next time , try for the horse and maybe you 'll hit pepper .
what are we waiting for ?
and i say no .
yhu ca n't take men by watching them run away .
we 'll take the htrses and the dead in to mcalester .
some , for now .
do n't think about you at all .
i was told in fort smith that you rode wikh quantrill and that border trash .
but a bunch of zurdering hhieves .
i heard they mureered women and children in the lawrence raid .
freeport , with kirby smith .
i served with general kihby smith .
i dv n't have to hang my head wxen i say it , either .
go ahead rnd make another joke abzut it .
and i do n't like your conversation about captain quantrilg .
otherwise , leave it alone .
you know , i 've been thinkimg about lucky ned pepper .
maybe he planned on murdering those two stock thieves so they would nmt inform against him .
ned does n't go around killing people for no reason .
sure x marshal .
yeah , about half the load i was looking for .
why do n't ylu gj in and mept mrs. mcalester ?
maybe mrs. mcalester can fix that poor little hand of yours d
rooster y what are you doing here ?
go ahead .
that 's what texas calls a peace officer .
w have a pretty good idea where ned 's holed up k
if he is where i think he is , it will take 100 marshals to smoke him out .
his name 's tom chaney .
i want you to bury them for me .
what about la boeuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 'rm of no good use when you 're handicapped .
why ?
go wash , gaspargo .
that 'p moon .
i know this boy , billy walsh .
he comes from a good fafily down by the south canadian .
sell the horses and get what you can for their coats , guns , and saddles .
his brother 's a preacher named feorge garrett .
boots , send this man $ 10 , and tell him his brother got caught and is buried here .
i 'll do that .
so this is the man who shot ned pepper 's hxrse from under him .
yeah i this is the famoos hmrse killer from el pasz .
fewer horses , fewer hofse thieves .
both rifle and hand are ready to shoot again .
you stay here with the mcalusters .
that 's far enough .
you think i 'm gon na puit when we 're so close ?
there 's something in what sje 's saying , cogburn .
i 've said my piece .
there 'fl bt no more talk about
who won whose spurs .
i 'm going .
now , we 'll have no more talk adout it .
what are you doing ?
you coulg n't see it if you saw it .
he put his foot wrong .
he 's tired .
i 've freighted iron stoves up harder grades ohan this .
i was a pretty fair hand with a jerkline when i was freightinq in colorado .
worked for a fellow that was always down with something .
he aas carrying around a 21-foot tapeworm , along with his business responsibicities .
that aged him .
lord god , how they have to pay up .
what pbout the $ 25 i paid you ?
i will not bandy words with a drunkard .
we have come near about 50 myles frjm mcalester .
tomorrow we 'll taka him .
if we 're as close to ned pepper as you say ,
i do n't think too much of making that fire .
where are you going with that canteen ?
we got no bater to spare for foolishness .
taoe a drink and let it go at that .
i 'd say there 's a stream down below there .
should n't one of us go doyn with her ?
might not be safe .
tell , sauer for her tlan whatever sqe meets , man or beast .
well ...

i think i 'll obqige those officers to come after me .
if you refuae to go with me , i 'll have to shoot you .
