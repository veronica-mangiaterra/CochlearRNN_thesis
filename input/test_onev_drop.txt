as lng as he 's a better goalie than marcie .
you 're hurting me , sir .

charlie brown :
i just hope this new kid has never heard of me .
it 's not often y get the opportunity to strt over with a clean slate .
this time , things will be different .
all :
snoopy ... why is it that everything  try turns out wrong ?
sometimes i wonder if the kids really like me .
maybe that new kid will see me for who i really am , like you .
a dog does n't try to give dvice or judge you .
you ca n't come to school , snoopy .
now be a good dog and go home .
snoopy :
no dogs allowed !
patty :
i think i saw the new kid 
did you see tht moving truck arrive ?
pigpen :
that 's not the new kid .
hey , charlie brown .
this is the same plane flown by manfred von richthofen .
the rd baron .
the most famous aviator during the great war .
my naturally curly hair !
whoa !
snoopy :
huh ?

hmm .
high above the french countryside ... the world war i flyng ace had never been so close ... to his lifelong enemy ... the infamous red baron 
shh .

for now , we just keep our distance .
ahh !
oh !

hmm .
lucy :

i ca n't believ i 'm about to talk to the little red-haired girl .
yep .
if there 's one person you want by your side at a moment like this ... it 's yor loyal dog .
hmm

if i were something and she was nothing , i could talk to her .
you 're being ridiculous , charlie brown .

frnklin :

franklin over speaker :

snoopy !
one , two , three , four .
one , two , three ...
it 's called a dance .
somone needs to get this danc started .
linus :
no !
these cupcaks do n't look half bad , if  do say so myself .
i could n't have done it without you .
the old charlie brown would still be lying in bed with a stomachache .
huh ?
good grief .
marcie  look !
she 's here .
franklin :
okay , ladies .
it 's time for you to show off your best move .
let them hear it !

one , tw , three ..
charlie brown ?

franklin :
it looks lik we may hav a winner here !
let 's get out of here !
huh ?
it 's nt over yet .
lucy : the flying ace took to the skis .
he searched endlssly for the girl who had stolen his heart .
daydreaming ?
she seems like the kind of person who would do that sort of thing .
all :
aww !
time to pick our partners .
patty !
yes !
nope .
schroeder !
there 's no denyng it .
it was writtn in the cards 
the little red-haired girl .
this changes verything .
she will see the new me .
after that , anything is possible !
we could b the first kids to land on the moon !
you 've got to help me , linus .
i need to slow things dwn .
maybe i 'm not ready for a serious relationship .
how will i support her ?
i ca n't afford a mortgage .
you re the only person i know who can turn a simple book report ... into a lifelong commitment .
i ve never been responsible for anythng before .
this could be the worst thing that 's ever happened to her !
i think i know how to become her hero .
while she 's away taking care of her grandmother ...
i could complete the book report for the two of us .
someone got a perfect score , sir .
patty :
it 's him !
here he comes !
a perfect score ?
me ?
no , charlie brown , lok .
you really do have a perfect score .
i always knew yu had it in you , charles .
this ca nt be right !
perfect , charlie brown ?
it must be a typo !
franklin over pa :
we hav a special announcement .
i have a science project due next week .
can you give me yor thoughts ?
hey , leave him alone !
well , you can never go wrong if you stick with the classics .
violt :
a comic book ?
will you look at this .
what a contemporary piece .
notice his use of space 
have you all lost your minds ?
yu have what is referred to as an irrational fear 
huh ?
peppermint patty :
shoot it , charlie brown !
shoot it !
nice use of angles there , charles .
both :
yay !
and this is where it all began .
as a youth , he passed many hours just sitting in that chair .. keeping his deep thoughts to himself .
and here we have his early kites ,
all :
wow .
if we 're lucky , we 'll see him in his natural habitat .
hey !
what are you doing ?
i 'm cashing in on your celebrity .
kid :
oh !
all of a sudden  everyone wants to be my friend ... and yet , i have n't really changed .
do they like me for who i am , or for who they think i am ?
charlie brown , i need you on my chess tam !
he 's got no time for meaningless games 
he 's coming with me 
shermy :
speed .
sally :

cut .
there 's huckleberry finn ...
catcher in the rye .
sir , i 've been sitting here for hours .

just my luck to get a partner that thinks moby dick was a hockey player .
marcie ?
i 'm looking for marcie .
i need some advice .
curveball not working for you ?
no , i 'm good with all tht .
i need to talk to marcie about finding the greatest book of all time .
marcie just read up a long list of great novels .
huckleberry-somthing , catcher with a pie .
piece .
leo 's toy store .
that 's the one , chuck 
charlie brown :
love that hustle , chuck !
does anyone know where i can find leo 's toy store ?
shh .
charlie brown :
leo 's toy store .
no .
no .
where is it ?
he 's going into the grown-up 's section .
is that legal ?
stop right there  charles .
oh .
how long was this war ?
are you sure that is the book you want to read ?
i have to if i 'm going to win that gold star .
charlie brown :
i 'm okay .
big book .
how are you gn na get it home , smarty-pants ?
what am i saying ?
now there 's a guy who 's going places .
thanks .

happy birthday !

war and peace .
eh bien , mon prince , so gnoa ...
ll :
charlie brown :
all :
aww !
girl 1 :
girl 2 :

prince andrei mused on the unimportance of greatness ...
... and there was yesterday , and there was the day before ...
ooh !
will there be a late show ?
i dd it .
then there was peace .
ugh !
this is n use .
i 'm just not as smart as they think i am .
i ca n't let her down .
yu ca n't give up on her now .
finished .
today 's the big assembly to celebrate your perfect scor .
what are you up to now ?
the fame that comes with intellectual superiorty can be very fleeting .
you have to cash in while you can .
this is all for you , charlie brown .
you 've really made it .
it 's going to happen .
she 's finally going to notice me for doing something great .
lucy :
chrlie brown .
this is not easy for me !
my whole world has turned upside-down !
t is my pleasure to present to you today ... this award for the highest achievement in this year 's standardized testing .
on this day , whereas yu have upheld
the highest of academic standards .
and whereas no one would have ever expected that of you .
and whereas you are the first to ever receive a perfct score .
therefore , be it reslved
how about tht , charlie brown ?
you 're the star of the school now !
congratulations , charles .
let me present you with your perfect test .
charlie brown :
oh , no .
before i begin ,
i 'd like to thank all of you for your support .
you have all been so kind .
it 's not often that i get this sort of recognition .
but , um ... there 's been a mistake .
this is not my test .
ha !
can a brother and sister get a divorce ?
i think this belongs to peppermint patty .
that was a very admirable thing you just did , charlie brown .
i 'm not so sure .
let me see what you wrote .
hmm .
hi .
charlie brown took it upn himself to complete the report for the both of you .
and i must say , this is one of the finest bits ... of literary analysis i have ever read .
no , no , no !
lucy 
whenever i feel really alone ,
i jst sit and stare into the night sky .
i 've always thought that one of those stars was my star ... and at moments lik this ,
i know that my star will always be there for me .
lucy :
the flying ace had to return to the aerodrome ... if h was ever to rescue fifi .
hey .
girl 1 :
wait for my cue .
girl 2 :
timing is crucial if we 're going to succeed .
yeah , chuck , your crazy dog is over here again .
aww !
excuse me , mister .
well , actually , let me just say that ...
that 's great !
well  okay .
the thing is , flying a kite is n't for everyone .
it takes a certain type of person .
they tend to have a mind of their own .
really ?
you hold the string .
plant your feet .
weight forward .
back straight .
when i say go , run as fast as you can .
that way .
now , go !
i hope the little guy does n't get discouraged , snoopy .
he does n't quite know how difficult this will be .
it may take him years to gain my level of experience .
huh ?
little kid :
woo-hoo !
wow !
thanks , mister .
you sure know your kites .
do you want to try ?
charlie brown :
a-ha !
chapter 7 .
never give up !
huh ?
lucy :

this is the dmbest thing i have ver read !
come on , charlie brown !
charlie brown :

schroeder .

charlie brown :
lucy :

oh !
charles .

and , by the way , it was a pleasre to meet you , ma'am .
all :

marcie :

huh ?
franklin :
charlie brown is really doing it !
of course i did .
before you leave , there 's something i really need to know .
why , out of all the kids in our class , would you want to be partners with me ?
that s not who you are at all .
i like the compassion you showed for your sister at the talent show .
and at the dance , you were brave , and funny .
snoopy :
so when i look at you , i do n't see a failure at all .
sorry , i have to go now .
i think this belongs to you .

i 've been looking everywhere for this !
i 'll write to you , pen-pal .

i merely perform th service .
reverend .
good evening , sr .
professor ashton from rutland university .

miss carlisle invited me .
yes , yes , i remember .
oh , it was so sweet of you to go to all this truble .

# the ring is in your right-side pocket #

# bum bum-bum-bum #
i 'm trying t solve the secrets of the universe .
and failng .

you 've been working all afternoon .
i 've been working on something very important 
more important , i suppose , than getting marrid ?
oh !
oh , you 're getting a wonderful girl .
if you ask me , she 's too good for you .
i love you , too .
is anything wrong ?
and , professor , my i say happy honeymoon ?

i 'm not sure what we 've got here , charlie , but if we 've got what i think we 've got , we 've got something .
there 's one way to find out .
ready ?
yes !
yes , charlie !
we 've got it !
it 's not gong lower and lower .
you know what that mans ?
it 's generating its own energy .
it means we ve discovered a new kind of energy !
discovered .
substnce x .
in appearance , subscribes to classical requirements of metastabl compound , but whose behavior is distinctly nonclassical .
hypothesis .
of course you do n't .
we just discovred it .
we 've got to give it a name .
flying rubber .
flubber ?
all right .
now a sliding shutter to let the right amount of gamma rays through to bombard the flubber .
here we go .
perfect control .
nw we ease off on the gamma rays .
light as a daisy .
just as i thought .
just as i thought , charlie .
weight makes absolutely no difference .
just shoot up a few extra gamma rays .
is n't that wonderful , chrlie ?
 can still make it .
yes , 5 minutes to 8:00 .
in the morning ?
no .
no , i did n't do it again .
i know what you 're thinking .
but do n't you worry .
when i tell betsy what i 've done , she 's gon na be hppy .
mrs. chatsworth .
do n't you tell a soul , but i 've discovered flubber .
that poor , por girl .
daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbed by rumors that you plan to take our campus and construct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely he wuld n't .
not even mr hawk .
but he 's an alumnus .
my dear girl , our esteemd alumnus made an extremely large loan to the college .
that loan is overdue , and mr. hawk has us  if you 'll forgive a pertinent expression , over a barrel .
i 'd lik to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that wuld be convenient to you .
i shall make myself available .
psst !
however , mr. hawk ...
do n't be angry .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding again .
look , i could n't help it .
go .
i hit my head .
i was knocked out .
daggett :
go .
get out .
look , the most wonderful thing happened .
wait till yo hear .
look .
flubber .
i shall make myself available at any time .
... of the gretest importance .
no , make that f the most supreme importance .
brainard :
flubber .
flubber .
flubber .
oh .
good morning , sir .
i have the most wonderful thing to tell you .
the most wonderful thing you can tll me is godbye .
this way .
just a minte .
anything you say would be sperfluous .
daggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasant surprise .
i , to , have been wanting to chat about our loan .
brainard !
yeah , that 's right , pop .
do you know that this man flunked my boy ?
may i remind you it was hawk brains that founded this town ?
i wish i could show you his examination paper .
not only did he miss every answer , he misspelled the name of the college .
do you mind ?
this mens my boy ca n't play in the big game tonght against rutland .
flunking your star playr .
a makeup exam .
but he culd n't be bothred .
so he 's ineligible .
nne of your vague promises about lending money is going to change that .
mr. hawk has already loaned the money .
professor , i rejoice in your sense of ethics .
but do you mind terribly if i speak for myslf ?
mr. hawk .
hold it .
i 'd like to discuss our loan .
and you might bring some of those principles f yours and see how much they 're worth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
get me the file on wealthy alumni marked emergency .
we have som letters to write .
yes , sir .
then you 'll understand why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd lik that .
for once i would really like to understand .
like most things that seem complicated , it was actually quite simple .
do you know what that residue ws ?
no .
well , it 's been thrilling .
betsy , never in my wildest dreams did i hpe to find a compound whose configuration is such that the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a change in the configuration .
bt they act in a direction opposite that of the force which triggered the change .
yes !
now that i clearly understand what happened to my wedding , will you excuse me ?
president daggett and i have some important work .
it could be worth millions .
do me a prsonal favor .
go bounce your ball somewhere else .
we 'll talk it out tonight .
i 'll pick you up for th game .
you 're kidding , are n't you ?
about closing the college and turning the grounds into a housing tract ?
they re all in the same boat .
the little man s gon na get squashed .
but you graduated from medfield 
it 's yur college .
so what do you want ?
some total stranger to close it down ?
is n't there something you could do ?
give them some more time on the loan or smething .
i 'm sentimental about medfield just like you .
has word gotten around that you 're not playing ?
say , lenny , see what the point spread is on the medfieldrutland game tonight .
how much you want to go for ?
8,000 or 10,000 bucks .
you 're not betting on medfield .
without me on the team , we 'll gt murdered .
who said i 'm betting on medfield ?
you 're not betting against s ?
there 's a saying .
get the point 
up goes the flubber and the car .
we pull the gas lever , this shutter opens , and the car goes .
if we open the shutter farther , the car goes in reverse .
charlie , suppose we get a little tired of just going straight ahead .
so we turn the wheel to the right , and we bank to the right .
turn the wheel to the left , and we bank to the left .
except betsy , of course .
so people do n't ask questions  we 'll put this under the hood so it 'll sound like a mdel t .
all right , charle .
now this side .
good dog .
now ... sound on .
lights on .
we do n't ned these up here , do we ?
there .
that 's bettr .

just remember , one man does n't make a team .
and i tell you , you can go out and beat rutland .

yes , you can .

we could .
you can beat rutland if you giv it all the drive and the bounce you 've got .

i do n't know !
what did he say ?

you meathead !
d n't you know what 's going on out there ?
we did t !
i did it because you would n't listen .
you saw the way the boys played .
surely you 're not taking credit for medfield winning ?
to watch those boys out there fightng , playing their hearts out , and to hear you taking the bows for it .
i did n't mean it ...
pretty small .
come on .
let 's go .
betsy , wait a minute .
shelby , pleas give me time t think .

brainard , tell these idiots ...
professor , i see you finally got the model t in working order .
yeah .
it took a little fxing .
but here she is .
sounds like it could use a little vlve job in there .
you know how it is with model t 's .
sometimes you swear they could run without valves .
or even without a motor !
brainard !
tell them who i am !
now , you told us who yo are .
suppose we all go confide in the sergeant , hmm ?
you boys are a big comfort .
maybe they slipped them som new vitamin pill .
if we can grab one of the boys , we could give him a test .
alonzo :
forget it , will you ?
hi , pop .
did you find out anythng ?
wht ?
it was neddy the nut .
the prfessor ?
well , what dd he do ?

and then ?

well , is it ?
that 's about the size of it .
oh , three cheers for you , sonny .
come here !
say that agin .
alonzo :
oh , yeah .
says he 's looking for a breakthrough 
your kind indulgence , professor .
can you find it to forgive this hot-blooded businessman ?
visualize , if you will , a whole new medfield college .
10 new buildings 10 stories high .
ne building devoted entirely to science .
three ?
how does that sound ?
from a certain revoltionary discovery .
what 's revolutionary about a tin lizzie ?
nothing .
unless , of course , it happens to fly .
fly ?
like i happened to see it do last night .
you saw it , huh ?
uh-huh .
hold it !
head in the clouds .
i 'll do the talking , son !
that 's a good boy .
the spac age !
that 's where i come in .
when i get through talking with them , they 'll come crawling with bags of money .
you want me to turn my discovery over so you can blackmail our government ?
medfield college can grow and prosper .
i see .
now you 're talking !
i 'm calling th president .
daggett 
the president of th unitd states .
oh , let 's not go flyng off in all directions .
just one direction .
out .
but do n't you try to come back afterwards .
the iron dor is shut !
he 'll telephone washington .
by tomorrow , this place will be swarming with sharpis .
supposing you did get the professr 's discovery .
if you did , i 've gt an idea .
quiet .
i 'm trying to think 
what dd you say , son ?
switch cars on him .
there are other model t 's around .
hold it .
hey , you know somethng ?
course , you got a little of your mother in you .
yes , sir 
now , if i only knew which branch of the government might best be served by your discovery ?
any branch .
transportation .
industry .
oh , do n't cut me off .
i see 
how do you figure this can help the farmer ?
i do n't want to help the frmer .
do n't you understand ?
do n't you people understand how vital this thing s ?
it 's not only agriculture .
it 's industry .
it 's national dfense .
oh , national defense .
national defense .
before we go further , i just want you to know that i am proud of the new spirit of cooperation between the army , the navy , and the air force .
even the newspapers are talking about it .
there never was any difference between us .
just newspaper guff in the first place .
tell him to write me .
brainard swings a lot of lead .
very well .
well , how are you , professor ?
what can we do for you ?
oh , you have , eh ?
why , that 's amazing .
and you think it s a breakthrough ?
looks like you do n't need all that appropriation money .
ridiclous .
yes , professor .
yes , yes .
s many things are these days .
you want to come down here to washington ?
we 'd love to se you , of course .
yes , but we 're all busy as bird dogs around here .
right .
and keep up the good work , professor .
oh , better still , we 'll call you .
goodbye .
they wo n't listn .
betsy wo n't listen .
thank you .
but i wo n't be going to the danc .

stay home , talk to the dog ?
mrs. chatsworth , do n't turn against me .
not just now .
all right .
g ahead , like i said .
unlock the secrets of the universe .
but remember this .
the universe is millions and millions of years old .
it can wait a little .
but girls ca n't wait .
i 'll just marry the next man that comes along .
and she does 
why ?
betsy wo n't even look at me .
well , then , you walk up to that shelby , tap him on the shoulder , then when he trns .
i 'll punch him .
show him up .
show up shelby ashton ?
he 's the best dancer around here .
i dance like a sleepwalking chimpanzee .
but even a chimpanzee will fight for its mate .

admiral ?
now , i realize that military technology has progressed far beyond the model t .
i want you to understand .
i 'm using it as a security measure .
what better place to hide my discovery than in  model t ?
i want you to keep in mind that this is only a primitive appliction of my discovery .
we use this spark lever here to levitate , the gs lever to move forward , and the brake to stop or to go in reverse .
absolute control at all times , as you will see .
all right , get a good , tight grip on your emotions and prepare for takoff .
cool head .
a steady hand .
try again .
the first time you tried to launch a rockt , it did n't go up .
it 's probably just a short in the control mechanism .
i 'm sorry about this delay .
this is some kind of a joke .
i want to see what 's n there .
just a minute .
i 'm not laughng .
look , gentlemen , wait .

that was rich about the squirrel .
a real hawk touch .
kind of a mean trick to play .
we 're doing him a fvor .
you 'll se .
well , i think we 've cleared the air on one point .
with what 's happened , i 'm sure there 's no doubt about you and ned brainard .
none whatsoever .
as the bard says , that he is mad , 't is true ;
't is true 't s pity ;
and pity 't is 't is true .

butin an erawhere almost nothing can be kept private , does the president of the united states have secrets -- information so forbiddn , so potentially dangerous that it must be kept hidden from the public ?

roberts :
but when asked about the letter ,
did it contain critical information about the economy ?
or much , much more ?
if so , what would be in it ?
did he have he from a secret book left behind by his predecessor , or was the intelligence he received from lss audacious and more conventional sources ?
rther :
a lotof it is told orally , and understandably and rightfully so .
there are some things that you do n't want to put in writing any more than you have to .
theonesthatwer probably the most intresting , ones where they said , okay , wll , let me just tell you some other things that we knw .

but they re not authorized by the person of the president .
they are authorized by the office of the president .
and , and then i , then i walked him throgh it .
it 's one thing to be the candidte .
it 's another thing to have your fnger on the button , as they say .
only then will he or she have unlimited access to all classified documents , answers to almost any national security question they might have .

todaythepresident has a unique handle on the nclear arsenal .
everywhere he goes he s accompanied by a miltary aide who carries a 45-pound briefcase known as the nuclear football .
what 's in it is highly classifid , but what it des is allows the president , as the commnder in chief , to be connected to the national military command center and those force commanders who must respond to an order to initiate

narrator :
president 's home and office had been thretened ?
are there methods or avenues of escape from the white house itself ?

bush 's approval ratings were fairly low , and he needed an enemy .
he needed to kind of recreate the cold war with a new enemy , and that new enemy would be al-qaeda .
that there was an intelligence report warning about an attack on the united states using airplanes .
there are even more lurid versions of the bush conspiracy theory that , in fact , the attackers on 9/11 were u.s .
intelligence operatives .
president bush 's political rivls have eagerly exposed it ?
i alwaysgo by the
avenue , 'cause everything leaks .
president had tried to orchstrate something like 9/11 , there would have been catastrophic leaks .
thisis an enormously energetic , complex system , and different agencies have different habits nd different patterns .
but as a species , we 've had conspiracy theories from the very bginning .
oneof themost endring conspiracy theories that surround the office f the
prsident first took root in 1947 , when th u.s. military reported that an alien spaceship had crash-landed outside
roswell , new mexico .
i mean , you driv on a long , long dirt road , and there are ground sensors in that road , so that base security know that yo 're coming .
eventually you arrive at just really at a series of signs -- there 's not really evn a clearly-defined border -- and that 's the point that you do n't want to go beyond .
there are contractors that show up in pickup trucks , and they kind of watch you and surveil yo .

and , if so , would n't the u.s .
president know about it ?
o'brien :

i mean , there are people ut ther , uh , that really believe that there are these aliens .
and we literally spent some time looking at this , but there was nothing cnclusve that came of it .
lichtman :
intruth , though , the reason why there 's so much secrecy about area 51 is , that is where the air force develps its most secret and sensitive plnes , including its high-flying surveillance planes and the stealth fighters .

if you think you are awake , do n't bothr me .
fly to brazil agin , or no job .
make up your mind .
if i take pictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell them to another publisher .
to take pictures of yu ?
no deal .
i 'm not about taking pictures of women .
no .
island ?
yes .
selgio island .
it 's located between hawaii and the marianas .
only ighty inhabitants .
it 's like t has fallen behind the time .
an island in the sun , surroundd by coral reefs that 's selgio .
we 've invested a lot of money in it .
once this plan has materialized , the world will b stunned .
you want me t take publicity pictures ?
that 's right .
a single picture can impress people .
i refuse .
but ...
plase .
it 's been a long time .
yeh .
we worked together on the series , mysteries of japan .
i see .
remembr 
monsters ?
yes .
i thought you 'd be happy to go there .
well , i do n't believe monsters exist unless i see one , but they might ...
doctor , is it hre on this map ?
yes , selgio island is there .
you 're right .
the spt you marked .
no , this is n't the mark for selgio sland .
what ?
selgio island
fishing is prohibited in that area .
that 's why it 's god .
the natves here would n't like us to vilate it .
who would believe that ?
but they re serious about it .
every accident that happens at sea , they think the monstr did it .
that means more fsh for us .
the folks coming from tokyo ...
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's just a current of cold water .
really 
look !
ykoyama !
sakura !
ombo !
you wre right !
yokoyama , true ?
yes , rico .
gezora is angry .
so , you rally believe the monsters exist ?
yes , i 'd like to be friends with them .
you culd be a good writer .
and it lands in th backyard of prehistoric monsters .
enjoying yourselves ?
sure .
from yokoyama , too ?
yes .
i hav n't hd a chance to talk to yo .
makoto obata , anthropologist
let 's be friends .
this is where yo are .
there was an accident on the island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
his partner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it s interesting .
it 's a beautiful island .
it 's beautifl because nature is intact here .
i know .
do n't make fun of gezora .
do the natives here speak japanese ?
i see .
fortunately they 're fond of japanese .
mr. yokoyama is spposd to met us here .
rico , why are n't your people around ?
i 'll find mr. yokoyama .
rico .
all right 
let 's take a rest .
he 'll be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the natives would give me lodging .
the schedule for research of selgio island
i think it 'll be difficult to research the entir island in a week 
right , we have to take pictures of underse life , too .
over here 
the thought makes me shudder .
do n't give me that 
your firm sent us here .
no !
it reads our hearts by telepathy .
you saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
i 'll drive .
that was some scream .
i thought it was a monster .
the sea water .
look .
huh ?
what 's that ?
the light ?
this is terrible .
this is  japanese watch .
it 's sakura 's .
sakura 's watch .
hy !
mr. yokoyama , how about other people ?
i 'm leaving this island !
mr yokoyama !
leave me alone !
gzora wo n't let you go .
you will die .
shut up !
i 'll go back to japan and warn the people do n't go to selgo island .
it 's hell on earth.
no , no !
shut up !
gezora !
finally we can eat .
where are they ?
gone .
mr. yokoyama !
lok .
rico .
he 's alive .
come on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remember .
rico !
wait , he is scared of the light .
would you stop making jokes ?
it 's not a joke .
it 's not a scratch or a bruise .
n , it looks like frostbite .
frostbite ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body temperature must be near zero .
you 're all suffering from monstrphobia like that man .
that 's right , where is mr. yokoyama ?
plans for the selgio island underwatr hotel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
you forgot me ?
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if w can bring back his memory , we may be able to fnd out what happened .
let 's go .
our bags ?
right .
the island 's shaman , i think .
die , friends of the devil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a first-aid kit .
is he conscious ?
rico , rico .
there 's one good thing .
we 're lucky to be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream of it .
no , i wo n't be able to sleep 
doctor , but what if the monster really lives in the sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come on .
i think this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main character ?
let 's get this straight .
what did you come here for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important .
we shouldn t have hard feelings .
do n't worry .
you 're as mean as ever .
ski .
rico .
come !
i ca n't believe i 'm alive .
the monster is a squid .
the legendary gezora is back to life .
does it hate rubber ?
i do n't knw .
my knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the shaman .
why are you so skeptcal ?
the people here are serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo .
everybody is going to die !
doctor !
you 're all right .
doctor , it 's just a monster squid .
it has th characteristics of a squid .
but ...
can you call tht a squid ?
whn the fire burnt it , the monster was upset .
any gasoline on this island ?
the company brought som , but it 's gne with that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline 
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guns !
good .
good !
pour out the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire !
great !
gezora is burning !
here .
this will protect us .
i never imagined .
plenty of gasoline .
we 're safe even if it comes back .
i 'm encouraged .
if it was only a simple giant squid we 'd be safe .
what does he mean ?
doctor !
doctor , if it was n't a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible creature .
tell me th truth .
yu know what the monstr really is , do n't you ?
i 'm sorry .
terrific !
i 'll show you .
watch out !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondred where he went .
he wants to escape .
it 's dangerous .
come back !
the mnster ca n't get me !
we should evacuate .
go farther .
hurry .
hurry !
we are almost there .
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo 
do n't worry , w destroyed it .
although we ca n't b sur that we destroyed it completely .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto obata .
you are no lnger an ordinary human being .
no use resisting .
abandon human emotions .
i will give you an important job .
you must find our formidable nemies all over th earth and annhilate them all .
stand up , obata .
there s one here too .
yes ?
i 'll tell you what  think .
and th giant squid we fought yesterday is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size had changed .
all the principles of genetics and biology ca n't explain it .
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab is n't ganime .
the space creaturs that came with helios 7 made the crab into a monster .
as a weapon to attack us .
you mean the space creatures got into helios 7 in outer space some hundred-millions kilomter away frm earth ?
if this creature is highly developed , it may be able to live in a vacuum 
... and it my be able to alter its own cells and pass through the atoms of metl .
i see .
space creature or nt we must destroy it .
we must think of some way to fight .
i will marry rico .
we will have a wedding tnight .
wedding 
congratulations .
rico .
rico .
ric .
rico .
rico .
rico .
saki .
you recognize me 
rico .
good !
you had mnesia for a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
yes , monstr !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
bats ?
yes , bats came .
gezora rn away .
why ?
there were porpoises when we were in the sea ...
i gt it !
what is it ?
the space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes , humans can her sound waves up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porpoises emit 120,000 cycles ultrasound with which they use to guide themselves .
yes .
i guess space creatures hate it .
if we have bats , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bats live in caves .
yes  but they 'll come back to the cave in the morning .
thre .
the bats !
there .
did the monster do this ?
i do n't know how , but nobody else could do it .
i thought we were safe , but ...
even though thy are spac creatures , they ca n't kill all the bats on the islnd .
here too .
all right .
maybe all the bats are dead .
that ca n't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 're safe now .
we can control some bats .
mr. obata 
of course 
the monster ca n't beat me .
what 's this ?
th monster is scared of bats .
great .
then let me sleep here too .
what are you doing , bata ?
it 's about time for the bats to move .
he went out .
wait !
doctor ...
you .
he 's not obata .
why did you come to earth ?
we are the wanderers of space .
we can exist only by living off other forms of life .
what are you going to do with us ?
you know our weakness .
rico !
now we know enough about earth creatures .
before they arrive , i must annihilate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see mankind perish like this .
even though you 're a wretched spy , you 're still a human being .
a human being !
kamoeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go f it !
let go of it !
i wo n't ...
obata .
do n't come .
do n't come near me !
pray 
that 's all we can d .
even if a man 's cells are taken over , he has his soul .
man is more than a structure of cells .
every man has a soul .
his soul is fightng the space creature .
they 've gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck !
i wish i had my camera .
what happened to the monsters ?
even space creatures .
mr. obata !
mr. obata !
obata killed the last space creature by killing himself .
mr. obata .
they must have seen the volcano erpt .
the united forces of earth creatures ...
porpoises , bats and men destroyed the invaders .
will the peple believe this story ?
mmm !
hmm .
huh ?
huh ?
woo hoo !

black river cheer ... for team awesome sauce and their special guest , miss lisa .

say hello to miss lisa .
you probably do n't know this , but , when miss lisa wakes up ... the first thing she likes to do is dance .
now miss lisa lkes to put on her makeup .
i just love it on my face .
and my hair .
hw about another round for team awesome sauce ?
please thank samantha for such an amazing prfrmance .
the team who showed the best in black rver teamwork is ...
sage , there you are .
i 've been looking all over for you .
yeah .
okay .
so i should probably tell you about my cousin .
but , h , you know , she 's got a family , she 's got a career .
she 's hd a speech impediment her entire life .
and that 's okay , because that s just not her thing ... just lik my thing is
have you seen me dance ?
it 's not even called dancing ... it 's called tripping and falling and stumbling .
but that 's oky .
she says that each of us neds a good friend to show us ... the best part of who we are .
everyone has their weaknesses .. but also we have a special talent inside ... that could make the world  btter place if we shared it .
i got something for you .
kthy gave me this , because she saw something in me ... that i did n't know ws there .
i thought it was very courageous of you tonight .. to get on that stage in front of all thse people .
camp princess-worthy .
there is one condition , though .
i want you to use that courage and try to find ... that one talent , that one special thing ... that will make th world a bttr plac .
can you d that for me ?
yeah .
okay , c'mere .
let 's go .
c'mere .
i guess is what i 'm thinkin ' .
could be that 's the way to handle it , sure .
i ever tell you about my cosin dan ?
one summer , when w was about , oh , ten or so .. my uncle told him to go pick up a bag of horse feed ... down at the supply stor down the road a ways .
now dan , he did n't weigh much more ...
well , did he make it ?
yeah , eventually .
lost a big chunk of the food , too , on account of the hole ...
he just kept sying , no , i can do it .
i can do it .
just , you know , i lways wondered why he wold n't ...
let anyone share the burden , so to speak .
save him a lot of extra trouble
i would think , do n't you ?
jrry ?
no ... wish i did .
but you knw somebody who might be able to ?
but the thing is , we wo n't know unless we ask .
what 's up ?
so that vaulting thing you were telling me about ?
yeah !
but what changed your mind ?
the whole time i was just thinking ...
how amazing would t be to do that on a horse .
no 
unh-unh .
no way .
worst idea ever !
yes way , and best idea ever !
fine , but only if she listens to every single thing i say .
fine .
great !
you guys wan n shake hands ?
thanks !
gram i had a felng you 'd thrive there ...
it makes me so happy to know you 're making friends ... and i want to hear all about them .
it sounds like you 'll have a wonderful experience ... to share with them for the rst of your life .
i ca n't wait to see you in the final show ... at the end of summer .

it 's not my fault if they do n't know how to run a business .

i 'm starting to wonder why
i 'm spending all this money ...
to send you to a top-tier business school .

hank connors , las vegas police .
come out with your hands above your head .
come out slowly .
officer down !
you 're not taking m !
mres , automatic weapons , ammo , water
bomb squd find ny booby traps ?
any sign of chyna de vere ?
not yet .
you know , ther 's some food .
you just should n't see where it comes from .
did you know that pigs are very intelligent animals ?
nd certain politicians .
i do n't see connors ' truck anywhere .
let 's look in the barn .
if this is chyna de vere 's blood , w 're getting warmer .
looks like he had a hobby stuffed nimals .
why 's that ?
csi season07 episode22 leapin  lizards
this is a career first .
a little tip for you :
the nw mrs.phillips does n't need to hear about this .
are you kidding me ?
come on , pretty girl , getta outta there , come on , girl !
i 'm so glad  'm a vegetarian .
well , no one has seen or heard from the victim 's husband , so ...
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likes you .
they always do .
we went to connors ' ranch because a week ago , chyna de vere went missing .
she jst separated from her husbnd , got her own place .
this is a large section of her living room carpet .
well , it 's certainly enough blood to suggest foul play .
connors ' name did n't come up .
how bout the husband 's ?
and he 's still missng .
so what s this ?
that is a single , distinct blood drop , not from the victim , not from the husband .
w lso found soil trace , identified as scheelite , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim 's husband .
looks like armageddon came on a thursday .
i 'm not sure there 's intelligent life on this planet .
i 'll get started .
i already went through this a week ago .
you know  you 're right .
yeah , not my boyfriend , my friend .
she was n't a member of your club ?
if she was , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , th club 's getting smaller and smaller by the minute .
you 're already an accessory to one murder .
if hank connors killed chyna 's husband , too .
oh , is that what you think happened ?
you know , this can work in your favor with the d.a .
 'm not really worried about that .
adam and ev were not only the first humans n the earth , they were bait ...
for intelligent life forms elsewhere in the cosmos .
but why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me .
well , ma'am , this is standard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just going to swab the inside of ...
not 
calm down .
get him away from ...
calm down .
calm down .
n !
that bitch bit me .
i got my sample .
thse visitors were highly advanced and did not appear in human form .
people of the serpents ...
of course it did .
it was not human .
not of this earth .
ufo 's , alien abduction ...
looks lik shannon was a player .
rptiles ..
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
what is ths ?
so connors cut ff her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space ?
catherine ...
check this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chillin ' in cabo .
i 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , hello , xena .
oh , boy .
duct tape ?
yeah , he used it to close up th laceration from a sharp force perimortem wound .
could that be the fatal wound ?
give me the rest of the body and i can tell you .
almost three inches , smoothedge blade ..
you know , catherine found ...
why would anybody want to taxidermy  human head ?
that , i cn tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our guy had to separate the head from the body .
for that , he used a serrated-edge knife .
heartwarming .
yah , so then ... he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle .
then he tanned the skin to preserve it .
hydrated it with  borax and water solution to keep the bugs off .
popped in two glass eyes , and then .. and he 's got the best-looking wall mount in th neighborhood .
yeah , i 'll get it over to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a guy on the fencing team .
his thighs were incredible .
yes , the , uh , tip has been wiped clean .
givs us a height for a white female of 5 ' 6 .
how about for a mal ?
did you mesur the head of the femur ?
41 points ...
point five millimeters .
it 's a female .
this little piggy had chyna .
yeah 
hey , greg .
no .
i 'm having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
good .
come here , take a look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeah .
you can see dick cheney , al gore , all nine supreme court justices shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , mst members of congress
hey , did shannon turner have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
cats are a natural enemy of reptiles .
 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found at shannon turner 's made the tool marks on the skull .
shannon 's prints were all over the handle .
and the partials on the blade , above the hilt ...
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
yeh , but brass interviewed her last week .
she did n't have ny visible cuts .
warrick ?
come at me with a sword .
all right , so i push back hard enough .. bang you on the nose .
brass would n't have seen that .
but what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank cnnors really believed in a reptilian conspiracy and they felt threatened by the political establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a club card at a table game , the floor man writes down what game you played , where you sat , what time you started , time you quit .
this is the first time shannon used her card .
and the daler is chyna .
looks like they 're best friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe chyna was her lucky charm .
she never walked away a winner .
i think she was gaining her trust .
stalking her .
it 's not a crime t play blackjack .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
we found your blod in chyna 's apartment .
then it was planted .
how should i know ?
look ... you killed chyna ,
and connors killed preston , because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you lied about knowing chyna , you going to lie about this , too ?
his cells do n't die .
oh , 4,000 .
the new 50 .
preston is a great man .
he has the wisdom of the ages .
beynd your capacity to understand .
ms.turner ... was chyna a reptilian ?
the reptilian athena .
is that chyna de vere ?
tell me about this one .
is that you 
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill yu .
what ?
her husband .
she does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your ring .
i really , really hate yu .
that would explain why we found both rings in the ashes 
i fund it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , and then the dome of the liver .
that 's your c..d .
yeah , pelvis is female .
the femur 's the same length as the one the pigs were chomping on .
it 's her .
well , we 'll run this against connors ' guns .
then you better turn it off before they use the oxygen destroyer on him .
i do n't know why i find it so difficult to express my feelings to you .
i can se you as vividly as if you were here with me .
as shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnet 47 , thyself away art present still with me ;
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move , and i am still with them , and they with thee .
or , if they sleep , thy pictur in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye 's delight .
yu 're supposed to let me get these things on .
i do n't know .
you mean , like me and you , baby ?
jim .
i got a call from a passing motorist .
preston de vre ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a captive , held against my will .
from what the sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skepticism .
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
oh , so you were abducted before your wife ws missing .
what are you trying to tll me ?
you do n't know your wife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no idea .
come on .
preston .
if she was s sweet , what were you doing chillin ' in cabo with shannon turner ?
well , you got your pictures on the coffee mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth f where you were the night your wif was killed .
that 's easy .
there 's a woman , and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are victims ... and no one is lstening to us .
we 're powerless against what 's ging on .
we 're not crazy .
has anyone talkd to shannon in the last couple of days ?
they 've got her .
it 's like we 're witnessing some form of mass hllucination .
you know , they think the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well 
that 's why shannon attacked greg .
let 's try this gain .
sorry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contct with them .
please , we come in peace .
it 's all right .
got a warrant to tow in clarissa niles ' car .
blue fluorescence is one of the properties of scheelte .
which was found in the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same area .
have you looked inside yet ?
i was just about to .
preston was found naked  right ?
yeah , it 's a recurrent theme in tales of alien abduction .
so clarissa drove him ot there and he left his stuff in her car .
tht 's not ll he lft :
steam cleaner .
just what every estranged husband needs to clean up his dead wife 's blood .
this case just came down to earth .
yes ,
we were asleep and suddnly the room turned very cold .
freezing .
i ...
come n , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i mean , really .
you got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man .
he 's  brilliant mn .
he saved my life .
it was cancer and he cured it .
he knows how to prevent human cells from dying .
they 're , they 're radioctive .
it would put them out of business .
let me show you something .
look at this .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a nutritionist .
he 's not .
and look .
they never heard of him .
he has no place of business , n job .
he got shannon turner to kill his wife for him .
got you to give him money .
he never asked for it .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleping so they can manipulate your thoughts .
you 're not only cancer-free , you 're free of their control .
how am i ever going to be able to thank you ?
the evidence is all over your car .
he loved me .
if they were trying to clean up all the blood , they did a good job .
steam cleaner tested positive for blood , but there ws n't enough for dna .
did yo find anything ?
funny you should ask .
found a hair in the brshes .
it 's n the left .
the one on the right is chyna de vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleaner was cmpletely wiped down , could n't find any prints 
but then i remembered this story bout a csi down in l.a .
nobody could find any prints on a gas can from an arson , but he realized that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour ut the gas .
and you know what ?
he broke the case .
so whose prints are on the steam cleaner 
i just got an afis hit :
preston de vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector of mankind .
cut off her head , she dies 
no problem 
it was n't a reptilian conspiracy , but it was a conspiracy .
men re snakes .
i 'm gld it took a long time for her to die .
you know , every time i think about leaving this job , a guy like you comes along and reminds me why i ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
these are accounts of battles for the survival of the human race ,
a battle we will lose unless we stp killing one another and focus on the real enemies .
they are among us .

my pop and i have been shipwrecked so many times ... that there are only eight or nine islands we have n't been to in the whole world .
and the ship 's cat flew past m stark naked , and his fur landd on my fork .

the sugar feels sensational between yur toes .
sorry .
i know he is .
he 'll be back soon .
we 'll wipe off your fce .
it 'll be all rght 
i think i went a little too far .
your mother -- she is dead , is n't she ?

i see her face right about there .
she always helps me one way or another .

good night .
d n't let the bedbugs bite .
oh , wait , oh .
i wan na talk to you .
just hang on there .
just hang on .
she 's all alone in that house .
i can see why .
the county created the children 's home for kids who are lost or have no parents .
poor pippi .
we 've got ta do something .
something drastic .
the boxes are finishd .
be careful how you mount them .
they got ta be fixed real firm .
what ?
oh .
this is just too much !
can w
i say , can we possibly have a little peace and quiet her ?
do n't fuss .
i would n't exactly say that i 'm getting rid of her .
but , eh  eh -- what , you do n't approve ?
you know i do n't .
not at all .
twelve times sixteen ... equals 192 .
tommy .
tommy ?
twelve times twelve equals one hundred and forty-for .
annika ?

except in wagga wagga .
and we had koala bears sitting in n -- enogh , pippi .
it 's dsrupting the class .
children , back to your seats .
i ws jst hoping all that learning floating around in there ... might fly out here and stick to me ...
he 's very bad with his numbers .
i 'd like to help you , but you mke that impossible .
but now we must press on .
bye .
well , i guess we 'll just have to stay stupid .
then everything is absolutely legal .
excuse me .
is all this really necessary ?
i mean , she 's just a child .
a child ?
i 've seen this child in action .
and i 've seen her up there .
why the police ?
oh , she 's very strng .
she threw my men up in a tree .
then she lifted me like i was a baby .
that 's sme baby , i 'll tell ya .
i think you 'll agree we have to be prepared for anything this girl may com up with .
now , nobody wants to be unfair or unkind to pippi .
pippi , they 're comin ' for you !
just about everyone .
i bet my father 's with them too .
they ca n't tke you , pippi .
mom and dad are trying ruin everything for us .

did you find them ?
not a trace .
-looked like a flying bd to me .
she was definitely pedaling .

i 'm starving !
do n't worry .

it could be a cannibal snooping .
you can never be too careful .
but i 'll tell you this :

jeepers !
pippi , when i grow up ,  'm gon na be a pirate , just like you .

without yur help , darn it , pippi never would 've been able to build that contraption .
we 'll us searchlghts .
even if i could get the autogiro up in the dark , i could never land it .
we got ta find those kids somehow .
it 's all your fault .
if you 're not too scared to fly , i 'll take you up at first light , and we 'll look in places these guys could never go , okay ?

narrator :
when fred astaire sang this song in the film ziegfeld follies the year was 1946 and mgm was at the height of ts success in creating incredible fantasies and setting them to musc .
here , lucille ball tmes a pack of exotic cat-women .
it was imaginative , outlandish imagery , and audiences loved it .
the most popular entertinment in the world .
this is the mixtre to start the picture
narrator :
metro-goldwyn-mayer was not the nly studio that made musical motion pictures .
when i first arrived here mgm 's dream factory was in full swing .
but th success of the mgm musical did not happen overnight .
then they hit on the idea of filming popular vaudeville acts .
all :
whose pet ?
and i pet with nobody else
in the hollywood revue of 1929 ne of the first ll-talking , all-singing , all-dancing movies the studio gave its huge roster of stars a chance to get ther feet wet in the newfangled talkies .
but t the time it was so new that some of the performers had trouble remembering the lyrcs .
come on with the rain i ve a smile on my face
just singin ' just singin ' n the rain
singin ' in the rain
just singin ' in the rain
suddenly , the musical became an overnight sensation delighting audiences with bigger casts lavish sets and cstumes and even a new gimmick called technicolor .
mgm begn its most ambitious film of this kind in late 1930 and filmd all the big production numbers before the public lost interest in these plotless musicls and the projct was abandoned .
what else ?
shake your stripes beat your pipe
lock your cell step light , hello , warden
clean as a whistle fresh as a disy
brand-new clean through
clean as  whistle fresh as a daisy
to capture an audience , producers knew they could always turn to the old reliable sex .
this number , set in the shwer room of a girls ' school shocked audiences in 1933 .
but , gee , i 'd rather exercise myself into
say , the water stopped .
water .
kelly :
such scenes fuelled the growing public outcry 
that the vulgar , the cheap and the tawdry is out .
there is no room on this screen at any time for pictures which offend against common decency .
and these , the industry will not allow .
eddy :
ah , sweet mystery of life
at last i found thee
ah
kelly :
among mgm 's efforts for the new morality was a series of wildly successful operettas with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy .
both :
my heart has heard the answer to its calling
for it is love that rules
kelly :
in 1934 , the studio lifted the public out of the depressin and int a make-believe hollywod party .
hollywood party get up , get up  get in it
hollywood party nobody sleeps tonight
satan sing out , yeh , man
hollywood party nobody sleeps tonght
and now , here 's t beauty , laughter , romance , music .
feelin ' high
what 's the use feelin ' low ?
on tht wagon on the town
gon na be up never down
there 's a reason if you 'd like to know why
i 'm in love
i 'm feelin ' high
kelly :
in broadway melody of 1938 and almost all of her films eleanor becmes a huge sensation by the last reel .
inside me everybody dance
you are my lucky star
got a pair of new shoes got a pair of new shoes
got ta dance
tap your feet light , long and sweet
and dance
dance now broadway dance
your broadway
kelly :
and here 's a good example .
eleanor powell 's tap dance of fascinating rhythm from lady be good .
stagehands using little tractors called mules quickly take the set apart allowing the camera to move forward to follow her dancing .
chorus :
fascinatin ' rhythm you 've got me on the go
fascinatin ' rhythm i 'm all aquiver
what a mess you 're making the neighbors will know
i 'm alwys shaking like  flivver
each mrning i 'm wakin ' up
just to find that no work has been done
once it did n't matter but now you do wrong
a couple of weeks ?
somewhere far away off and make it snappy
oh , fascinting ' rhythm
wo n't you stop picking on me ?
we 've danced the whole night through
good morning , good morning to you
how do you do 
both :
all :
to the hearts of th world
w send our greetings t friendly nations
we may be yanks but we 're your reltions
here in god 's

as andy hardy , mickey rooney was always falling in love .
esther williams played his love interest in her first film .
a fashion model and champion swmmer esther was working in n aquacade when she caught the attention of an mgm talent scout .
in the 22 films she made at metro she was seldom out of the water .
williams :
it had been five years since my andy hardy movie .
tke ten percent off for the press

what 's anothr ten more or less ?

i was called america 's mermaid because t appeared that i could stay underwater indefinitely .
for 12 yars , i was the center of an amazing series of vivid sights and water pageantry .
allyson :
each man she met she went and kissed
for a girl today do n't get the scope that cleopatterer did
willams :
if one performer could exemplify the lighthearted spirit of the mgm musical then june allyson would surely be it .
allyson :
when she went like this and then like that
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the spot
she gave these poor egyptian ginks
this was the original main gate t mgm .
it was all so glamorous .
that 's me on the right .
stll wet behind the ears from the broadway show best foot forward which the studio bought and tok me along as part of the package .
it 's not hard to tell tht nancy walker , gloria dhaven and i desperately wanted to make good at metro .
all :
yes , the barrelhouse the boogie-woogie and the blues
every booge beat will raise your heat
oh , the blues will really get you
and the barrelhose is bound to upset you
and the boogie-woogie beat will drive you straight to distraction
from a barrelhose
the boog-boog-boog-boog boogie and the blues
i love the boogie 'cause it tickles my spine
just like a cigarette with modern design that 's why i love the boogie-woogie
yes , yes
it 's so darn good it makes a fool of the rest
it 's got a kick like mountain liquor and it 's as slick and hard
it picks you up and then it knocks you right down
it makes you laugh and play and act like a clown
no other music has the right to the crown
like the boogie-woogie beat
do n't mean the blues
she loves the boogie-woogie beat
allyson :
it was an extensive crash course designed to find those with that special something known as star quality .
and if you had it , you got to take the next big step :
for instance , kathryn grayson had to wait two years at mgm before she was given her first screen test rpresented her in anchors aweigh .
unhappy news away
shake off yur cares and troubles
allyson :
chorus :
shakin ' the blues away
nhappy news away
if you are blue it 's easy to
prvin ' that there 's a way
to chase your cars away
shake them away
away

solid potato salad is the groovy movie salad , jack

allyson :
n the 1949 hit on the town frank sinatra , jules munshin and gene kelly teamed with betty garrett , ann miller and vera-ellen as three sailors and their dates go out on a night in new york city .
all :
east side , west side , rouse the city
one day , one night , that 's the pity
bt we wo n't look ahead

we 're going on the town
we 're gon na do the places
we 've nevr done before
three smart girls and three slick fellers
let 's have a ball tonight
we 're going on the town
allyson :
i have always admred the strength and stamina of dancers .
and i completely agree .
baby , you knock me out
yu 're the whistle in the kisser super sweet
you 're a wow with th power i admit dfeat
i 'm beat star light , star bright
i se stars when you move in
you got me hangin ' on the ropes
you 're the chick with the kick lke a rodeo
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , boing
ko
bam , slam hear me shot
this was mgm 's scnic backdrop building where talented artists created their move magic , and this is just one section of a huge painting re-creating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was originally 600 feet long and 60 feet high and wrappd around the entire interior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've always had such respect for gene .
both :
first , yo put yur two knees close up tight
then you sway 'em to the left then you sway 'em to the right
stp around the floor kind nice and light
then you do the eagle rock with the style and grace
gene 's first big break came on broadway , starring in pal joey .
both :
ballin ' the jack
charisse :
gene had a style all his own charming nd athletic , with boundless energy .
his partner :
gene 's inventiveness seemed inexhaustible .
fit as a fiddle and ready for love i can jump over the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
charisse :
gene teamed with donald o'connor to perform this marvelously comic vaudville routine for singin ' in the rain .
soon all the church bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
how th church bells will be ringing
hi , diddle-diddle , my baby 's ok
charisse :
the heather on the hill from brigadoon .
you are my lucky star
charisse :
gne nspired a whole new generation of stars .
one of the brightest was a young california girl named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary frances reynolds when i entered the miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gowns crated by the world-famous designer adrin were part f the treatment .
as well as makeup and hir departments that could accomplish any style imaginable .
a star like joan crawford would sometimes have her look redesigned numerous times until it matched the exact mood of the role she was to play .
you stepped out of a dream
you are too wonderful to be what you seem
could thre be eyes like yours ?
honest and truly ?
you stepped out of a cloud
in 1941 , the glamour age had reached its zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone nd apart out of a dream
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream sequence to the song a lady loves in the film i love melvin 
loves a penthouse where she 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sil away
for a simple rivera holiday
reynolds :
now , at last , you can see our differing points of view .
she loves her dreams tied up with apron strings
just little pots and pans
and he 'll be handsome wll , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
sying , you look nice oh , never mind the price
a lady loves beacoup i'amour
but first of all she loves to be secure
yet there is one vital thought she will place abve
all of the things i mak mention of
and what is more a ldy loves to live
and what is more a ldy livs to love
thanks for the present of the silver-blue mink
thanks for the yacht and for the solid-gold sink
thnks a lot , but no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of the power of the devastting female over the hapless male from it s always fair weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and for the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am just a faithful lssie
and there 's no gift however classy
by which this lassie can be had
thanks for losin ' your mind
thanks a lot , but no
no thanks
i do n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to do
reynolds :
in torch song , joan crawford made her final musical film as a fading legend performing in tropical makeup for the song two-faced woman .
the recording was n't a new one at mgm .
it 's been suggested that they may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
i ca n't help being  two-faced woman
a little bit of boldness a little bit of sweetness
a little bit of coldness a little bit f heatness
do n't fall in love with a two-faced woman
got another lover under cover
that goes with the breeze
my disposition
that 's why they call her a two-faced woman
a little bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a little bit of hatness
black and white wrong and right
they call me two-faced woman
reynolds :
in the early 1940s hollywood began a fascination with things tropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported adiences away from cold climates and the troubled times of a world war .
many latin artists were recruited to add an authentic sound to these films .
one of the most popular was xavier cugat and his orchestra .
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the latin lover , driving female audiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got the knd of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just like was beating in mine
but you make it 109 and there is more to t yet
but you 'll never forget
reynolds :
like this befor
reynolds :
one ofthe performers at mgm whom i admired the most was the legendary lena horne .
or when
for th first time
seem to be happening again
it was a long time ago i stood in this very spot and recorded that lovely song .
when i first walked onto this recording stage in 1942 it looked pretty much as it does today .
i recorded all of the music for my movies here and it is still considered hollywood 's greatest recording stage .
i never flt like i really belonged in hllywood .
so i sally just came on , sang a song and made a quick exit .
just one of those crazy things
yeah , i got to sing a great cole porter tune in a featured appearance but what i really wanted was to be given an acting role in the movies .
just one of those fabulous flights
if we thoght a bt of the end of it
we 'd have been aware that our love affair
was too hot not to cool down
here 's hoping we meet now and then
but t was just
said that gal , du barry
ai n't t the truth ?
in 1943 , i got to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin in the sky .
love is a rippling ' brook
you got to bait your hook
rise and shine
and cst your line
ai n't it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truth ?
it 's the truth
the truth
horne :
in 1946 , i playd the rle of julie in an excerpt from show bat in till the clouds rll by .
i was being considered for the part for the 1951 version of show boat but the production code office had banned interracial romance on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good friend ava gardner .
the studio had ava rehearse singing the role to the recordings that i had made hoping to get the part which annoyed us both .
gardner :
fish gt to swim , birds got to fly
ca n't help lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
though ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did n't get the part .
:
that s a rainy day
but when he comes back
that day is fine
as late as can be
ca n't help
horne :
i was not the only ne to lose a role here .
in annie get your gun , betty hutton was a big hit as annie oakley .
judy garland had begun filming the rol and completed two numbers when she suffered a breakdown and had to be replacd .
retrieved at last from the mgm film vaults is judy 's version of  'm an indian too .
like those indians
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an honest injun indian
i 'm an indian , too
folks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see  whatever conflicts judy struggld with as  person she always came through as an entertainr .
garland :
when you 're out with a feller in the pale moonlight
you do n't have to look in a book to find
what he thinks of the moon and what is on his mind
but they cash them just the same
grandpa dick was alwys sick
he just died at 93
doin ' what comes naturally
the quick toboggan when you reach the heights
horne :
words and msic was the last time that judy and mickey rooney worked together at mgm ending the most popular song and dance team the studio would ever have .
garland :
no more pain
the pulled-ut fur of cat and cur
judy garland and i grew up together at mgm and completed high school between long days of shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pictures together and even when we worked separately we turned to each other for friendship and encouragement .
we were the very best of friends , mor like brother and sister .
i still miss her very much .
teach me how to sing
music with a modern rhythm let me swing
mr. mendelssohn swing
music is a thing
that s no good without that rhythm
sweet and hot fast and slow
hey , swing it low
and swing it mr. mendelsshn swing
roney :
in love finds andy hardy judy laments the fact that she 's not a little girl any longer nd not quite a grownup either .
grwnups ignore m
and in every sense
i 'm just on a fence
i 'm just an in-between
for a few years , jdy was an in-between .
they found it in her first starring role :
dorothy gale in the wizard of oz .
toto , i have a feeling we 're not in kansas anymore .
we must be over the rainbow .
follow the yellow brck road follow the yellow brick road
follow the yellow brick rod
because of the wonderful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to bcome the most widely seen mtion picture of all time and judy 's wonderful prformance in the picture earned her a special acdemy award which i was lcky enough to present to her .
thank you .
wll you do that ?
somewhere over the rainbow
birds fly over the rainbow
why  then
i like new york in june , how about yu ?
i like a gershwin tune , how abut you ?
i love a fireside when a storm is due
how about you ?
rooney :
looks lke we bth agree
on what to do
down on an island , the southern seas
there lived a lassie namd minnie breeze
garland :
and all the natives would be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
came back to trinidad
who , stole my heart away
who , makes me dream all day
seems as though i 'll ever be blue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one of the studio 's most valuable assets and made a special guest appearance as marilyn miller in the jerome kern biography , till the clouds roll by .
march on , little doagis
here are judy , ray bolger , cyd charisse , and a cast of hundreds in a never-before-seen march of the doagies .
garland :
we do n't know where we 're goin '
till we 'r past the last fence rail
out there breaks the day
oh , we do n't know where we 're goin '
but we 're on our way
me for a campfire out on the trail
me for an old cayuse
and i 'm all set to vamose
and nobody asking me why give me a cowhand song
are marching ' on
out there lies the prairie
this is judy at the top of her career .
playing on his slide trombon
in a certain monotone
he was known as mr. monotony
any pleasant interlude
but the same dull melody
would emerge from mr. monotony
folks for miles would run away
she would come around and sy
ca n't play
today
it only happens when i dance with you
rooney :
another legend t metro was my good friend fred astaire who always romanced a glamorous partner in his motion pictures .
in easter parade  it was the one and only ann miller .
astaire :
why does it happen , der
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks
are yours and mine
i 've danced with dozens of others
that only happens wth you
but fred astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on and he put me at ease right away .
come on , annie , let 's do it one more time .
good evening .
miss marlowe .
astaire :
i 've seen it often enough .
i 'll try .
that s fine .
harry , give us the pickup on that gang number , will you , please ?
it was a little more than a guest appearance for fred for he was soon to be under contract to rko pictures where they were about to team him with ginger rogers causing  string of hit musicals to follow .
fred did n't return to mgm until seven years later at which time he starred with eleanor powell in broadway melody of 1940 .
miller :
in 1945 , fred and a new partner , luclle bremer stepped out to coffee tme in yolanda and th thief .
its directr , vincente minnelli .
that 's for me
i m drum crazy , yes i 'm drm crazy , yes
i 'm plumb crazy for drums
miller :
fred cold make music out of almost anything .
and he often found new challenges that stretched his talents .
astaire :
first , soft violins
when the drum takes the melody
when the drum carries the tun
miller :
hard-biled privte eyes were all the rage in the '50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse .
she came at me in sections .
more curves than a scenic railway .
she ws dangerous .
i would n't trust her any farther thn i could throw her .
she was selling hard , but i was n't buying .
miller :
in the barkleys of broadway , they dance the swing trot under the main titles of the picture , bt with the titles removd another musical gem is revealed from the most beloved dance team of all time .
it 's bill and coo-y , tea for two-y
just watch your partner 's eys grow dewy
entrenous-y yu 're slightly screwy
oh , what a natural they 've ht upon it gets you going till you 're really gone
and you will never rue the day
the day you realize the swing trot is here to stay
gon na leave my footsteps on the sands of time
if i never leve a dime
a dancing ' man
of rhythm
miller :
yes , i am
yes , i am , yes , i am
i can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge
i can get a sparrow with a bow and arrow
i can live on bread and cheese
and only on that ?
yes
so can a rat
any note you can reach ,  can go higher
i can sing anything higher than you

let 's just put it back the way it was before .
either one quarter for each car , includin ' the van , or one fifth for each guy .
one quarter or one fifth 
how dare you ?
chief , we got a situation here that is absolutely incredible .
see ?
i think they 're arguing about something .
and a crockett county unit has got 'em under observation .
that 's eight shres for that .
four shares for tht .
that 's 12 shares alredy .
then five of us went down to the wreck .
we give five shars fr that .
now we add the same number of shars as there were people in each vehicle .
that 's three for your group  two for yours , two for us and one for you .
$ 14,000 pr share .
and that covers everything including the emancipation of women !
wait a minute .
but no matter how you fgur it out , i still do n't get as much as anybody else .
right ?
we , us , we get 84,000 .
what do you mean , tax-free ?
i mean , if w go down to this park and we uncover the money and we ...
i 'm sure he 's nt gon na declare anything .
i know he 's not gon na declare anything .
look , can you explain it to him , please ?
but what he was trying to say is ...
even businessmen that rob and steal and cheat from people every day .
i give up .
anybody got a fairer plan , go ahead .
there were eight of us there , so that simply means ight shares .
we 're gon na get noplace listening to ths old bag .
lady , are you tryin ' to split us up so it becmes evry mn for himself ?
and every woman for himself ?
please do nt argue .
look !
we figured it 17 different ways .

i know , i know .

wll , if you hav quite decided to wthdraw from this affair i might reasonably expect you t return my keys so that at least i could press on .
and i 'll tell you why not .
because yor son sylvester is an rresponsible , unrelable , loudmouth , no-good bum who , if he is n't a crook , it 's only because he has n't the brains or ambition to be on .

if we are going , we must get cracking .

ginger , i want you to prepare yourself for a little shock .
so tell m !
i 've got thís bíscuít dough ...
the smiler grogan case is solved !
the tuna factry robbery .
the case i 've been talkin ' about for the last 15 years .
flight 7 , sunday morning .
are we takn ' bíllíe sue ?
it 's just the two of us , for about three weeks .
my feeling is that , after 27 years ...
could you give me a lift ?
my wife is sick .
the doc sent me after some medicine , and i just ran out of gas .
yeah !
we 're in trouble .
what englshman ?
will you get out of the way ?
nothin ' !
yeah ?
he 's gon na drive there and get the money , and w 're gon na have it !
that 's how !
i was gon na offer you a share , just fr takin ' us to a phone .
do n't you see ?
he 'll get there first .
the rest of us wo n't get a dime .
yu can believe that .
but look here 
even if she does get all the money surely it wo n't affect our agreement .
she would n't break her wrd .
i 'd still be entitled to ten per cent as agreed , surely .
surely ( !
and then that dirty , rotten , slimy bum doubl-crossed me .
well , did you get him ?
maybe he went out for the papers .
we can keep on tryin ' .
just supposin ' we never do get him .
we just might be the last ones there .
just a minut .
just a minut !
down there ?
you must be kiddin ' !
yeah , let 's go , let 's go .
you can turn around here .
i sure appreciate this , mister .

i 'll give you three dollars .
com on , hop in the car .
hurry , will ya , kid ?
i got ta get outta here !
they 're gone .
we only passed a few cars and they were n't in any of them .
somebody must 've taken them the other way .
besides , we ca n't be sure they 'll be thre .
i do n't know what to do .
look , surely the most sensible thing is for the two of us to press on !
and even if he were the first there , he still has to find the money , has n't he ?
now , i earnestly recommend that w press on with all possible dispatch .
we 'll press on with ll possible disptch .
and i do n't really think that personal rancour s going to help the situation if i may say so 
come on , hurry up .
attaboy , baby .
we made it .
we 're here first .
come on , let 's go .
over there ?
down there ?

hey .

i ve been very edgy today .
i must say , if i hd the misfortune to be a citizen of this benighted country i should be most hesitant in offering any criticism whatever of any other .
wait a minute .
against it ?
american men have been totally emasculated .
in all my tme in this wretched country , what has appalld me most is this preposterous preoccupation with bosoms !
they 've become the dominant theme in american culture .
i 'll wager you anything , if american women stopped waring brassieres your whole national economy would collapse overnight !
the crumps are locked ín a hardware stor basement .

they oughta be able to get themselves out 
after all , if you hlp them , you 're not bein ' fair to the others .
but the moment anybody gets to where they 're goin ' , we 'll pick 'em up .

and if you help me dig it up , you can have half and i 'll have half .
because if i have half of the money i can go away somewhere where nobody can find me .

oh , really , mr. dugan , god has given us minds and we must use them .
we have been spred and we will be rescued , i 'm sure of it .
we must search for any inhabtnts of this place .
we must look for food and water .
the corral must be built , the animals taken out and placed there , the plane interior must be cleaned so that we can use it for sleeping quarters .
oh , and some partition must be put up for privacy .
there 's an axe in the plan .
wan na bet she 's also an eagle scout ?

i think they made a mistake about your ge .
paper !
paper !

thank you .
paper !
paper 
congratulations , professor .
# here 's to the prof of geology
# rare boy he , and rare boys we
# to the braw , aye , aye , aye , aye
# t the knicht , aye , aye , aye , aye , aye , aye , ye , aye
i 'm sorry .
will the laird of glendarach step forward ?
sir oliver .
that 's enough obituary prose .
hellish to dust .
i thank you all from the bottom of my hrt .
ah .
i was on the committee that made the collection .
£5 was subscribed .
that left three shillings .
i expended it on ths .
a little extra token i thought you might fancy .
i saw it during easter week in a little window in glasgow , a curiosity shop .
buy me for professor lindenbrook .
what did you reply ?
could serve as a paperweight .
it 's a scholar 's choice .
what are you eating tonight ?
this being tuesday , i 'm not eating .
 find it very healthy to eat only every other night .
be at my house at eight o'clock .
i m entertaining some of the faculty .
i do not think i could .
what 's the matter with you ?
is it those frayed cuffs that worry you ?
eight o'clock sharp .
yes , sir oliver .
eight o'clock .
lava .
i swear there 's something inside .
there 's uncle now , kirsty .
i thought it was uncle oliver .
i want it undrstood that not a single stitch i 'm wearing belongs to me .
i 'm early , but i trust i 'm not too early .
where is he ?
he 's never been late like this nver .
i do n't know , but , to return to the subject of my clothes , they 're my classmate 's , the yung laird of glendarach .
whn i returned , my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted .
you 've explained yur magnificence .
there will be one more guest .
what do you expect when it takes a command from my uncl to bring you to this house ?
two yars more i have to study for my master 's degree .
then four years more as a laboratory assistant .
they 're payng for my schooling .
how like a scotsman .
i know one whose purse was not empty , becus he did nt even have a purse .
do you know what he said ?
miss jenny , the time of poetry is over .
if this is true , alec mcewen , what are you doing with your hand on my knee ?
now you just wait in there .
kirsty , i 'll set the extra place .
is there somethng you want ?
a key is stuck .
but that 's impossibl .
it was just tuned last month .
this one .
you looked like spring itself .
there s  key stuck .
# so deep in love am i
# tht i will love you still  my dear
# till all the seas go dry , my love
# and rocks melt with the sun
# and i will love you still , my dear
# so fare-thee-well , my only love
# and fare-thee-well a while
# for i 'll come back to you , my love
# though it were ten thousand mile
yes  we were .
is n't he with you ?
is n't he here ?
no .
it 's just about the limit now , sir oliver .
i gave no permission for visitors .
good lad .
if you d n't come now , the goos will be ...
aye , and without a pause for lunch or tea .
now then , from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged ?
mount etna ?
very close .
the lipari island group off the cost of italy .
that 's exactly what stumped me 
but that would b icelandic peridotite .
prcisely .
there 's a piece chipped off .
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
when i saw ths , i stopped chipping .
looks like a letter or some notches .
three notches made by the hand of man .
what 's your cnclusion ?
scince does not jump to conclusions .
we 'r going to melt off the crust of lava .
mr paisley .
not too fast , you know .
i shall write to professor goetaborg of stockholm about this .
he 's the leading authority on volcanoes 
four hors ?
jnny !
ar you all right ?
tht was entirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't know how it could have happened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendered an inestimable service to science .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not only looks like it is a plumb bob .
can you make out what it says , professor ?
it 's in some nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possibly .
look at this side , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ...
arne saknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable , but it must be true .
a man took some tools and went where no human being has ever set foot .
nto the interir of the earth , alone .
the laughter stopped when he disappeared , never to be heard from .
until tonight .
get out of here , woman !
i did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shuting at me , sr oliver .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you have n't slept 
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncle oliver .
no answer !
where is alec mcewen ?
how long does it tak for a letter to get here from stockholm ?
answer the bell .
did it ring ?
callers , callers .
i 'm involved in something important .
more important than our university ?
what does the nme arne saknussem mean to you , gentlemen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study of volcanoes .
out of a volcano cam this messag frm him 
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , was probably picked up by some peasant , gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it came to me .
whoever descends into the crater of sneffels yocul can reach the centr of the earth .
arne sknussem .
the center of the earth 
an extinct volcano in iceland .
but , oliver , this is sheer fantasy .
you have n't heard all of it .
at sunrise on the last day of may the montain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scartaris ?
it 's a mountain peak nar the volcano .
but this is a student 's hoax .
let 's not take that tone .
more than anything , you must consult other experts .
and i 've written to the foremost authority in europe .
more eminent still .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunately i 've not yet received his reply .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your famos crrespondent sees ft to answer you 
and in the meantime we could do with a cup of tea .
think whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
just this moment , sir oliver .
look .
well , he 's got his letter from stockholm .
did you see the shine in his eyes ?
there 'll never be a better moment to tell him about our feelings for each other .
he 'll say yes almost inadvertently .
what if he says no advertently ?
you wait and see how firm my voice can be when i speak of you .
blast and damn !
bad news , sir 
his disappearance follows closely the date my cmmunication must have reached him .
or too important .
mcewen , go directly to the harbor .
oliver , calm down .
you heard saknussem 's message .
olivr , you 're seriously ill .
i am seriously well .
what are you waiting for ?
i told you to hurry .
if you 'll excuse me , i must start packing .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take tme for this , sir .
what are you so urgent about ?
this is the mst urgent moment of my life .
i have to be in iceland .
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturally .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i go
i wish i could sing loud enugh for jenny to hear me .
it is a bit painfl to leave her on the first day of our enggement .
t com back to hr as a world-famous scientist is not to be sneezed t .
come here 
i neglected to tell you , sir .
well , you 'll get over that aftr the first mllion fathoms or so .
he 's ben surveying here .
your revered colleague from stockholm .
he is n't wasting any time .
do you think he 's already gone down ?
no .
buy ll the rope available .
yu think we can prepare it all so quickly ?
what 's that you 're taking ?
jenny 's farewell gift .
back to my hotel .
já , professor goetabrg .
no , no , thank you .
nobody carries a soldier 's weapons .
and take your time .
these instruments ar delicate .
sy , coachman .
this is n't th same road we came by this mornng .
i said slow down , man !
you 're out of your senses !
stop your horses , man !
slow down !
stop , you fool !
whoa !
if you 've ruined my instruments , i 'll horsewhip you , so help me .
this certainly is not my hotel .
where are we ?
how did you get here ?
i do n't know .
t went so fast .
did you see who did it ?
no .
he 's a criminal .
very likely he 's dreamed of such a project .
hush .
some tapping .
there 's not a soul around .
it is n't sundy .
the fishing fleet is going out for the first summer hal .
you mean the shops are closed ?
but every piece of rope , every lamp , everything we 'd need was sold .
to professor goetaborg .
he s staying in the very inn where we have our rooms .
a fellow prisoner , do you suppose ?
it 's a code .
morse ?
jot this down .
perhaps it 's in icelandic .
my esteemed friend , whoever you are , let me introduce myself .
professor oliver lindenbrook , university of edinburgh .
may i ask you to nterrupt yur tapping for a moment and listen ?
in what language would you like me to speak ?
he does n't undrstand english .
mon cher ami , vous et nous sommes dans une situation abominable .
grtrude ?
gertrude !
it 's a female prisoner .
nd her lover .
it 's a duck !
may i have your help ?
he is at home , is n't he ?
yes , i ...
he s not at home .
you can not see him .
i 'm sorry .
here are your coins .
and here is my card , if you 'll be good enogh to put it in hs box so that he 'll know tomorrow that i 'm around .
goetaborg !
i know you 're in there .
this is lindenbrok .
goetaborg .
the very last word in equipment .
ruhmkorff lamps 
as long as they 're wound up , the induction coil will give off current .
breathing devices .
the kind they use in coal mines in wales .
more treasure , sir .
climbing boots .
alpenstocks .
food for months .
a chart of the ...
so you wnted to push in ahad of us .
fate took care of him .
why did n't they tell us at the desk ?
we 'll observe one minute of silence in memory f a great scientist , even if he was a blasted thief .
lec , you mentoned fate .
slight correction .
fate plus a few grains of potassium cyanide .
he was against someone who was even more aganst him .
who ?
i 'm the wife of professor goetaborg .
oh , my dear .
wo n't you sit down for a minute before you go up ?
please , my dar 
early in the morning he went to the mountain .
when he came back for lunch he receivd his guest right in the lobby .
they went up to his room and ate .
what are you trying to tell me ?
in the evening when the maid went to make the bed ...
oh , dear god !
as long as i can remember , no one ever died in my inn !
he was joking on the pier in stockholm .
madam  my deep sympathy .
my name
oliver lindenbrook of edinburgh university .
professor lindenbrook .
i see yu are .
this will be difficult for you , madam , but it must be faced .
who was the last person to see him alive ?
i did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each other every day .
i suggest that you have an autopsy performed immediately .
neithr he nor i could suspect there was a third party who would stop at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deeply distressed by your husband 's death , and i fully understand your feelings .
however , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan to dispos of the equipment your husbnd assembled up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off your hands .
your expedition ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from me .
that is a lie .
madam ..
incredible encounter .
a saknussem descendant turns up acts as if he were king of volcanoes .
tries to force me to surrender his ancestor 's secret .
saknussem called again .
new complication .
must fight him somehow .
young man , would you come here a moment , please ?
who are those for ?
that 's a beginning .
what about lamps ?
lamps .
put me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted very day in iceland ?
but i wish to apologize to you in plin english .
i went through my husband 's diary , and some of hs remarks led me to believe i dd you an injustice .
i 'm sorry .
 did n't know .
do n't give it another thoght .
i sha n't .
began and that 's all it has done .
sir oliver , this morning you asked me for these .
if you still want them , they 're yours .
will you say that again ?
madam .
my husband had these boots made specially .
i hope thy fit you .
i told your man to order some for me immediately .
good , good .
why would you need boots like this ?
do n't say it .
nturally , i 'm coming along .
that 's why i 'm giving you all of this .
it 's a condition .
i thought you understood .
you did n't menton ny condition .
then i do now .
whom did you intend to take along , besides this young man ?
then i 'll be very useful .
he does n't understand a word of english .
we 're not contemplating a stroll down piccadilly or the champs élysées .
professor lindenbrook , i have just lost my husband .
the police require your presence for the investigation int the death .
but , madam , quite apart from the appalling dangr , think of the inconvenience .
the lack of privacy .
in short , you do n't want ll of this .
i may be mad on the subject of this journey , but i am not stupid !
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbance to men , never a burden .
you 'll sleep where we sleep , eat what we eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept my proposition .
professor , look !
now we descend into oblivion or ... we enter the great book of history .
carla goetaborg .
alexander mcewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans and who ?
professor !
professor !
hans is tying the rope on her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you hav told him that ?
and then thre 's always the blessd chance the rope may break .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only yo culd see your face .
you do .
perhaps this is the wrong entrance 
but there 's no other way to continue .
eureka !
thank you .
now then ,  general summary .
a :
b :
s my husband 's charts indcatd .
onward .
and let 's have some music .
the last news was that they went up mont sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys .
yes ?
and then the animals came down without their packs .
oliver s lndenbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what 's it ?
a woman !
a slight tremor , coming from undefined regions .
let us proceed .
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us .
the three notches of arne saknussem .
what does that mean ?
lok .
we might have taken any one of these channels .
but our great colleague maketh a path for our fet .
let us have tea .
with a double ration of raisins 
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen on the right 
what is it , madam ?
f we 'd known that you hd nightmares , we 'd have made different sleeping arrangements .
smeone is walking up there .
human footsteps .
the hearing of all women is extremely acute .
my wfe used to hear rats in the attic , usually the nights before i had an important lecture .
alec , go up and find out .
they need rest .
moreover , it was stipulated that i give the orders .
there 's no need to use that patint voice with me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i am a member of this expedition , and as such i ntend to report any obsrvation i mak .
alec .
put it down in the rcord tht a member of the expedition reported .. rats in the attic 
i 'm rght here .
conceal these marks completely .
i 'll give them some new ones .
strting from an estimated depth of 129km , limestone formation contines .
here are the three notches again .
good .
let 's see .
one heads 220º south-southwest , the other 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quite .
what 's he saying ?
hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expedtion .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well , why does man freeze to death trying to reach the north pole ?
once a question has arisen in the human brain , the answer mst be found if it takes 100 years .
1,000 years .
let 's hear you rnder that into a few well-chosen icelandic words .
why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries ?
are you all right ?
can you unhook yourself ?
grab his hand .
nevr mind about that .
how s it possible ?
this way was clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure .
this has been here since the beginning of time .
i was not in a position to observe it scientifically .
but where ?
we 're supposed to stay together .
tricked into the wrong tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam ... heard him last night .
silntly , i admit , but she 's saying it .
we must retrn 
why ?
you know that .
but if there is a mdman loose ...
he 's against all of us .
against the very concept of this journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to wher alec fell .
but it 's not on our route .
if we 're to go ahead , we have no time for detours .
then you wait here .
madam , now that the boy has gone and hans does n't understand english ,
i 'm blushing already .
professor !
yes , i thught so .
alec !
i 've got to take a specimen of this back to edinburgh , if it 's the last thing i d .
unique .
where the devil is he ?
it s a blind alley !
keep back !
hans !
good god !
that 's it .
praise the lord !
alec .
professor !
hello !
professor !
professor !
here i am !
salt .
professor .
professor , you ca n't go on this way .
i 've kept track of the passage of days .
you have n't .
we 'll try the cross-channel over there .
yu wo n't find him there .
i 've got to find him .
i 'm responsible .
i can see that this is a recnt break .
if you 're down there , give us a sign !
lec , listen carefully .
when the echoes stop , you must try to answer .
pick up a pebble and scratch the rock .
just give us a sign .
how can  live with myself ?
you mst continue with what you started .
it was his project as much as it ws yours .
we will proceed .
down there , food and water .
so you 've lost your friends 
just as well .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of place here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal the professor 's project ?
you need me as much as i need you .
you found me .
my friends could fnd me too .
very well .
you 'll carry it with one arm , not two !
it 's a multiple echo , reverberating through the rock chambers .
th last echo will give us the direction .
alec .
alec .
alec 
professor .
where was he ?
i did n't think he 'd shot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers here .
you re lso the murderer of my husband .
he would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of your great ncestor , put down that preposterous gun .
you 're not going to listen to a murderer ?
never interrupt a mrderer , madam .
i resent that bourgeois classificaton .
you have my word of honor .
gve me your hand on that .
 bourgeois trick .
so sorry .
we have t hold curt .
guilty .
guilty .
then the mandatory sentence is death .
we will follow the route marked by the notches .
no , no , no , no , no .
i can carry somethng with my left hand .
you can carry yourself for a couple of days .
that 's all we can expect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family hav been loyal to the saknussems for generations and , well , he can not touch the gun .
this is contempt of court .
no , no , professor ...
i mean , sir oliver .
you must n't look at me .
oh , no .
you ... you could n't consider for a moment that i could do t 
after all , i 'm a woman .
i se .
for weeks you 've been denying yur sex , and now you fall back on t .
i would say the natural executioner would be the leader of the expedition .
we 're much too civilized to ...
what do you propose ?
drag hm with us ?
stop fiddling with those lamps .
the lamps are giving out .
to save what we can , i insist that we lev these regions at once .
you insist ?
what s the harm ?
the harm is , madam , that he 's wasting a lamp .
madm , make a final note , whil you 've still light enough to write by .
let me , madam .
this may be our lst entry .
hans and i can cut some rope into some torches .
what puzzles me is that the three notches of old arne saknussem still keep pointng our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on nither do you , sir oliver .
yes , just switch it off .
why  it 's miraculous 
look at this .
what is it , sir ?
light without heat .
a cool , chemical light .
the same principle is involved here .
256th day .
the phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbrook expedition , you 've written mcewen expedition ?
may i remind you that months ago you gave me explicit orders to that effect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to be corrected by you incessantly .
you re doing it with your looks , the inflection of your voice , the very postur of your body 
your entire presence is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had enough .
well , let me tell you , you dried-up walnut of a man , if anyone 's had enough , it 's me .
it 's i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla goetaborg 
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ...
well , at least you know i hav a temper .
and from now on alec will keep the charts .
alec !
why ca n't he stay around ?
a forest of mushrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grew without sun this far under the earth !
it 's tougher than leather .
it 's like an oak tree .
mshroom steak , mushroom soup , mushroom hash .
after some months f this , you 'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef .
if we only knew how many mre .
there 's no term to the work of a scientist .
but that 's not professor lindenbrok 's feeling .
and what is the name of the girl you love ?
the girl you love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
bt why would you want to know that just now ?
dear alec !
prfessor ?
here 's some hot mushroom porridge for you , sir oliver .
i slept as i never slept in edinburgh .
i may move here permanently .
i do n't know .
is that madman still giving orders ?
the minute you fell sleep he went off in that direction , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want with all those ?
you 've come to ask me why i did n't take my rest perid .
i do n't sleep .
i hate those little slices of death .
it 's a sea .
it 's an ocean with waves and currents .
the fissures closed again .
it 's the prerogative of the discoverer .
i congratulate you .
a dimetrdon !
if i had my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swim ?
no , thank god .
here .
i wonder if it 's cold where they are .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hand !
my watch !
save the instruments .
my ring !
my wedding ring .
a field of forc that snatches gold awy .
this is it !
this is it !
the junction of magnetic forces from th north pole and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness ovr there .
after all , we did hit the center of the earth .
he wants to know where we go from here .
tired minds do n't plan well .
sleep first , plan later .
oliver , the day may come when you 'd very much like to have that porrdge .
is it incredible to you that i ever had a mother ?
here  duck .
here , duck .
gertrude ?
gertrude ?
gertrude !
gertrude !
hans !
why do you look at me like that ?
hans !
i needed food , so i took it .
stop this fool !
hans !
you ingrates !
wht can you do without me ?
this is the sunken city .
after 5,000 years , behold a fragment of the lost atlantis .
all we knw about it comes from the greek .
the floor of the sea opened up and swallowed the whole island of atlantis .
this must have been the market square .
eating .
well , we 've learned one thing about the inhabitants of atlantis .
stale bread .
we must speak to the baker .
madam !
madam !
já ?
exactly .
to think that at a moment like this  've no pad and pencil to record it all .
turn around , madam 
what is it 
look at that tibia .
you wo n't find anything edible in there .
the chinese eat eggs over 400 yers old .
gunpowder .
it 's pointing somewhere .
f course !
this is the way up .
a direct hatchway to the surface .
and we can climb up .
let him venture 100 meters or so on reconnoiter .
the updraft ca n't carry him away .
now i 'd say let 's rll up our sleeves if we had any .
we must n't hope for much .
this light w n't stay with us .
 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kai-ai !
kai-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be wlking in darkness .
i wish i had better nws .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage pward , straighter than the one we descended .
thre 's an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway .
hans said only a landslide could ever move it .
if his hopes had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , sir ?
the haversack arne saknussem 's haversack .
get it .
i guarantee that this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly , i can not guarante .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear god , ruler of heaven and earth ...
do n't set any limit to his ralm  laddie .
god of the universe , we are in thy merciful hands .
look out !
a monster !
let me go !
it 's an earthquake of unusul magnitude !
more likely it 's a volcanic eruption .
stromboli , italy .
the capsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous explosion .
rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sea .
dammi una mano .
piano .
piano .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrown from the altar stone .. long before we hit the water .
non si preoccupi .
i 'm most grateful , ladies  but my immedite need is not a ladder .
pantaloons .
pantaloni .
snd a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
fellow scots , if these shouts of yours express som pleasur that we 've returned alive , i thank you deeply .
however , if they 're meant as praise for a successful scientist ,
i must disclaim that honor .
a scientist who can not prove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
i have no records , no shred of evidence .
i will never embarrass this distinguished univrsity by asking that it take my word .
this , i know :
the spirit of man can not be stopped .
splendid , oliver .
professor , here 's smeone who wants to say goodbye .
hans , old friend .
did you get your injuries when the volcano blew up , in the hot lava ?
he was in such a hrry leaving the church , he fell all the way down the steps .
after all that waitng .
it 's been no marriag for you at all .
you underestimate alec .
i 'm taking the night train to london and then back to stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a job to do here in edinburgh .
i intend to write my memoirs .
what you ned is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictation .
no , none of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend one 's days and nights with a man under the earth , another under one roof in scotland .
what did i say ?
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
frau goetaborg !
yes ...
carla ..
i warn you ...

father , i hate being frced into this .
pleas try to nderstand .
i 've never done a thing on my own .
oooh !

allah forbid you should have any daughtrs .
her mother was n't nearly so picky .
ah , jafar .
my most trusted advisor .
i am in desperate need of your wisdom .
it 's this suitor business .
jasmine refuses to choose a husband .
oh !
hav a cracker , pretty polly .
your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals .
now , then , perhaps i cn divine a solution to this thorny problem .
if anyone can help , it 's you .
it is necessary to find the princess a suitor 
do n't worry .
everything will be fine .
everything will be ... fine .
the diamond .

whatever you need will be fine .
you are most gracious , my liege .
that will be pretty good .

uh-oh .
hello hello ?
here you go .
you 'd better be able t pay for tht .

no one steals from my cart .
oh , i 'm sorry , sir .
please ...
if you let me go to th palace , i can get some from the sultan .
what are you doing ?
sadly , yes .
she is my sister .
tragic , is n't it 
but no harm done 
time to go see the doctor .
oh , hello , doctor .
no , no , no .
not that ne .
come back here , you little thieves !
save your breath , lgo .

yes !

so , this is your first time n the marketplace , huh ?
is it that obvious ?
well , you do kind of stand out .
hmm .
is this where you live ?
just me and abu .
come and go as we please .
that sounds fabulous .
i wonder what it would be like to liv there , and have servants and valets .
h , sure .
people who tell you where to go and how to dress .
it 's better than here .
you 're not free to make your own choices .
you 're just ... ... trapped .
so , where are you from ?
what does it matter ?
i ran away and i am not going back .
really ?
how cme ?
that 's ... that 's awful .
what ?
abu says , uh ...
that 's not fair .

the boy was a criminal .
i ca n't breathe , jafar .
if yu could just ..
aah !
he did n't kidnap me .
oh , dear .
h , how frightfully upsetting .

death .
by behading .
i am exceedingly sorry , princess .
so , how did it go ?
it 's all my fault , rajah .
i did n't evn know his name .

keep your hands and arms inside the carpet .
we 're ... outta here !
jafar , this is an outrage .
i assure you , your highness , it wo n't happen again .

if only i had gotten that lamp .
l will have the power to get rid of you .
or beheaded .
wait a minute .
jafar .
what if you were the chmp husband ?
okay , you marry the princess , all right ?
and , uh , then you become the sultan .
the idea has merit .

every one of these is all expenses paid .
all right .
the truth is ,
there 's this guy at northern .
is n't tht the guy you 've been readin ' about ?
rght .
he 's this close to discovering the graviton .
if we can figure out how the graviton works ,
defy it .
where bridges wo n't collapse ,
where planes wo n't crash .

ha ha .

if you 're sure about this , son ...
dad .
ow !
all right , laddies ...
now , you new guys need to be aware that good ol ' rumson
ai n't always so good ,
especially when they execute the rumson rack .
what 's the rumson rack ?
oh , nothin ' much , really .
they just create a distraction .
and when you ai n't lookin ' ...
uhh !
more work to do this year .
player :

stuff to do .
professor !
charlie !
welcme , my friend .
come with me .
got a lot to show you , buddy .
is the particle ...
sh looks kinda old .
but it s not about looks .
it 's what 's under the hood that counts .
shh !
if you 're so sur , i 'm sure , too .
got your own lab cot .
it 's a little chilly down here 'cause we 're right underneath the ice rink ,
how 's that feel , huh ?
here 's your workstation .
oh .
it blew my mind !
but i 'm not worried , 'cause i know you and i ,
we can do it !
what do you say ?
yeah ...
together .
things are n't really so bad here , i guess .
at least my roommate turned out to be  nice guy .
 'm going to go meet him right now .
i spoke to him n the phone though .

and , uh ...
the sodas in the fridge were his ,
and this s nice ?
he called me dude .
see ya later .
hllo .

i 've had this problem before .

like what ?
ha ha ha .
from a guy that 's been alone in the lab for the last 15 years .
good point .
i 'll see you after my workout .
hey , one thing .
what i really mant was that a good scientist
does n't keep repeating the same experiment over and over
expecting to get different results , right ?
yeah .
you know what i mean ?
ok .
have a good workut .
i 'll se you in the lab .
ll right .
ok , buddy .

paul o'donnell .
friends call me odie .
you 're hard core , man .
settle in , chaz .
i 'll be teaching this clss all year .
and i 'll be disrupting it .
nd it took many , many years
before galileo could prove his theory t be correct .
that , indeed , the planets travel around the sun in a circular orbit 
well , i 'm very impressed .
uh , i was , uh ...
skating nd some geek told me that the ice rink was elliptical .
while i was sticking his tongue to the ice .
teacher :
all right , all right .
as you may or may not know ...
hey , chicago .
this s deion .
die says you 're down .
mind if we join you ?
i mean , yo .
experiment ?
uh , yeah , experiment to see how long i can stay in school
without ever ctually going to school .
he 's th bomb .
hey , how 's it going ?
i finished the calculations for today 's experiments .
yeah , the data 's right there on your desk
underneath your eighth grade geometry book , chaz .
so , how 'd you find out ?
my computer told me .
so , who 's chaz ?
a guy who has a life .
i 've gone through life so far as charlie boyle
and it s n't any sleigh ride .
who thought he , i was cool .
me .
that has never , ever happened to me before .
ever .
and i 'm going back .
ok .
charlie , i 'm not your dad .
good .
right .
science .
one kid even gave me his lunch money
always have .
oh , look , i got this on from a street fight .
look t that .
i got an appendix scar .
bear , bear ...
listen , it 's not the scar , all right ?
ok , girls , f you think that was something .
personal record .
well , the skeleton lecture soundd awful interesting ,
so i thought i 'd vary my routin a little .
class 
park it , mr. anthony ,
nd lose the blades .
catch you later , claire .
teacher :
all right , evryone , settle down .
and chaz anthony 's not .
honor society girls nver like honor socity guys .
trust m on this one .
sounds like  risky game plan to me .
and now i 'm enacting a strategy
just lke any good psy --
of course , alone , it 's not much good .
to actually move .
thank you .
now , how many bones do you think are in your feet ?
big finish .
i just wish yu 'd use your powers fr good , not evil .
what are you talking about ?
ther are geniuses your age , you know .
i was talking to a colleague over at northern .
he was telling me about a young man --
who was it that helped you ?
like i said , some lser in science club .
now , who wants to come up here
and finish charting these points on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricature
you know ...
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have become openly hostile .
not to mention the dorm food .
well , the only fatherly advice i can give you about the science stuff
is just keep plugging away .
a ttor !
dd , you 're a genius !
genus ?
my first f .
your first f .
what am i saying ?
but why are you so happy about gettng your first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i guess they 're gon n kick me out of school
if i do n't get better grades .
and i would care because ...
you 're pretty ok .
ca n't you find anyone else ?
i mean , well , you were the first one on my list .
maybe we could work something out .
then i guess i should start practicing .
oh , great .
just what i want to do after school ,
more school .
take it 
fine .
how nothing lasts forever
well , they 're wrong
yeah
you stood strong
you 've gt the key to my heart
'cause i
it seems so long ago
when my world was upside-down
hey , nice ...
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you know , just to say thanks and all .
that 's good , is n't that ?
 mean , that 's what we 're supposed to be listening to , right ?
thank you .
hey , so , what 's with the museum ?
he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey  daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ...
i 'm jst going to get my things here 
chaz ?
i do n't know  charlie .
although , i would have loved to have seen coach addison 's face .
i 'm glad he did n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over wth claire , too .
that was 20 miles of rough road on the apology turnpike .
hey , doc ?
you ever hav a girlfrend ?
yeah , sure .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it , charlie .
and still , there s no sign of a graviton .
well , maybe if we take our minds off it ,
yu know  if we sit back , relax ,
and , uh , have a littl fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
whenever he had a problem that he could n't slve ,
eureka !
come on , dance with me .
oh , no , i do n't think so .
uh , you do n't want to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any differnt .
only as a particle up until now .
we can just as easily think of it as a wave .
you said so in your book .
microwave conflict .
how could i miss this ?
ok , ok , what dos this mean ?
um ..
st up a phased harmonic ,
ffected the nuclear matrix ,
in other wrds , groovy little house beat
just unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
we did it , charlie !
this is big !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can we d it later though ?
i 'm kind of late for science class .
maybe you just had a good tutor .
but you are going to meet one .
i got to thinking it might be good for you to meet a kid your age
who 's not ashamed of being smart .
he can probably use some one-on-one
with a kid who 's not shamed to kick his butt .
class :
yes , well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arranged a field trip tody to northern .
doc !
doc !
i gt to show you something really cool .
oh .
oh , what 
what am i going to do ?
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
6 shades of purple ?
thank you very much .
thank yo and welcome .
the youngest particl physicist
a terrible lab accident has left young mr. boyle
temporarily disfgured .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agreed to come out and talk to you anyway ,
mr. charlie boyle .
charlie ?
charlie , in gravely voice :
thank you  fellow teens .
will eventually subside .
since i am in obvious discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let professor krickstein
well , uh ...
psst !
just talk amongst yourselves .
what ?
how do i get the purple stff off my face ?
it 's starting to burn .
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is -- is prtty much like the universe --
i got ta go pay the water bill .
excse me .
krickstein :
chaz ?
this is a very valuable clue as thymine is changed to uracil .
uh , here at the university , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i wantd to meet charlie boyle .
from the head of the anthropology --
and schedule another field trip .
i 'm sure i can convince charlie to come back .
what are yu doing to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
what are you doing ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
ok .
i can do it myself .
he 's fine , h 's fine .
really .
you kids do your homework .
bye .
i decided to move my stuff back in .
i need some help .
you ...
with what ?
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
yo have everything .
i could say the same about you .
women , poise ..
women .
losing my scholarship ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bad trade-off .
yeah , right 
look ,  want more than that out of life , charlie .
wht 's her name ?
s-shut up .

right in the middle f her routine ,
the heavens opened up
and her whole attitude changed .
in a snow globe .
hmph !
you 're the most beautiful thing i 've ever seen .
couple of days .
hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the people up there think i 'm a genius ,
and then the other half thnk i 'm a punk .
hey , i 'm going to use the particle accelerator whle you 're gone .
might s well get some work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck down here .
mi particle accelerator es su particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerator .
and i wanted to say thanks for passing me .
hey , you have nobody t thank but yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's from me and the guys .
hey , god luck today .
s rumson 's goin ' down .
what if they come after you with that rumson rack
i do n't know of any way to defend against it .
i might .
go home !
to the conference champinship game ,
boy :
come on , dude .
all right , now the 3 to worry about are stoker ,
now cross will usully distract th referee here ,
while stoker and ryder rack our best player ,
which is me .
we send somebody else out there with my numbr ,
that 's your plan ?
but -- but --
and you 'd come out with a phony number .
i like it .
hy , i 'm a gnius .
hugo , suit up !
ladies and gentlemen ,
yeah , enough pleasantries .
listen ,
if we beat our arch rival tonight ,
we 'd get to take hme some sort of great big cup , wold we not ?

he wore your golden goalie ma --
claire , let me explain .
explain ?
just what was all of this ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a study of the local culture ?
then i guess you were just having a laugh at my expense .
imagine , me thinking i could teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fat liar .
i also left the particle accelerator on !
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
announcer :
do not venture onto the ice !
get off the ice !
this game is postponed until we can repar the ice .
2 minutes left , and we were this close .
this close !

formerly known as chaz .
claire :
come on , guys .
what are you reading ?
breakaway .
i love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron finds , uh , subatomic particles
and how they 're connected to a mysterious qantum force 
oh , yeah .
but you know something ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to split a photon ,
and even though the particles are 6 miles apart ,
whatever one does , the other one des
cool !
and maybe unlock the secret as to how it works .
and then ...
defy gravity .
let 's get to work .
and the output level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the rubber coating ?
they all act lke superballs .
and when i press this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ..
it means i can mak amends
well  with what we just discovered ,
i fgured out a way to help northern beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can keep his job ,
and my friends 'll be happy with me again ,
and maybe ...
claire might like me again , too .
a little .
you have n't let me down .
you saved me !
charlie , i could never have done this without you !
you 're my friend .
thanks , doc .
but i got ta go .

i need help .
i figured out a way t help the team tonight ,
keep rumsen from cheating ,
no .
why do n't yo just leave us alne ...
i ca n't do it alone .
yeah !
welcome t northern arena !
this is base ops .
video ?
roger that .
blades ?

first sign of trouble , i 'm pullin ' you out !
you just try and do that !
for the rescheduled central conference champinship
how 's this supposed to work again ?
how is that possible ?
like the super balls  showed you .
corresponding microchips with other graviton halves
whatever our skats do , their skates will be frced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c in science .
you sure did a number on this lab .
nah .
besides  i 've arranged his schedule so that he 'll be gone all day .
and he 's never here during hockey games .
almost never .
this has gone way too far !
i told you i had to do what i had to do .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stp right now .
you know i 'm on your side .
ahead of what ?
you can solve all the mysteries n the world ,
but what would it men without friends ?
the chanc to make up for all the selfish things i did ...
so please ...
chaz !
odie , tight up .
omar , you re in !
mike , get ff !
we got ta stop the rumsen rack .
deion , flip the swtch .
take ...

whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leaving the box .
he 's out of control !
do something !

aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !
hey .
whoa , we 're too light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reversed the charge of the gravitons !
they re repelling against the positive charge of the earth !
game announcer :
the final score -- northern 1 , rumsen nothing !
a long , long time .
yeah .
that 's what i call publicity .
ha ha ha !
i 'm proud of you .
i 'll take smithson .
then i 'll take van bonn .
man , yu 're sticking me with him ?
look , i 'm gettin  good ,
look .
it 's good , huh 
and today he 's learning on your team .
hey , listen , if you want us to get off the ice ...

if you 're interested .
us ?
we heard about what you did .
how 'd you find out ?
ok .
what ?
hey ..
i can float .
uh .
come on , guys , let 's go !
ca n't we mark it rest in peace 
not as long as scientists try to prove porpoises have brains rivaling man 's .
even superhuman .
and they think that he might be teaching them ?
that 's right , leutenant .
but admiral ...
is that a good likeness ?
perfect .
yes .
t least that 's the way he looked before ..
well , you know ...
how he was when ...
and this taken by one of our divers .
is there any doubt in your mind ?
no , that 's him .
skipper !
we have no choice , lieutenant .
orders from the very top .
they 're recalling him to active duty .
henry always lived in a world of his own .
thank you , miss barnes .
well , did you have your physical this morning ?
i 'm frid not .
relly ?
no , my eyesight .
they do n't want my blod .
well , i hope so .
and very healthy .
they may take her .
henry ?
yes , he is .
that 's nice .
they rejected me .
rejectd ?
do n't hang around that pet shop .
do n't be upset  miss barns .
there 's a fish in the water cooler .
hi , hen old boy !
george , good to see you .
d n't you look important ?
that uniform and all those doodads on your sleeve .
just a couple of hash marks .
do n't apologie .
you look first-class to me , george .
what kind of a machine are you mated to ?
hey , bess !
time to take over .
lover-boy 's here .
hello , dear .
hello , henry .
 forgive you , casanova .
george has liberty th whole wekend , and he wants to spend it with us .
the whole weekend ?
no  i missed the subwy train , but i ...
washed out completely ,  hear .
you ca n't win them all , georg .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks for action , go dancing ?
feel like shaking a leg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
how many times must i tell you , you do not rumba with your eyes !
now , do n't worry .
why do n't we go to the university for professor hoffmeyer 's lecture ?
you know , he 's gon na talk about the mating habits of the shellfish .
it 's a little risqué .
sort of for adults only , you know .
i 've got it !
why do n't we run out to coney island tomorrow morning ?
well , i do n't know ...
i hate to miss that lecture , but i do like the water .
water and fish .
look at him .
always drawing into his shell , going off into his fish world !
george , cme here .
the what ?
devonian period of the paleooic era .
you know , it followed th silurian and preceded th carboniferous eras .
i 've given it a lot of thught .
a lot of thought .
maybe go in for parakeets .
he 's read many books on the subject .
he claims years ago there was nothing but fish in the world 
then some of those creatures becme amphibians they crawled out on land .
hope for what , hnry ?
with the war in europe and new weapons being invented what if men were foolish enough to destroy themselves ?
then th fish would develop into a new race of men and this time they mght turn ot better .
fish have a better life than people .
the water !
what a mess !
you are floating yourself out of your home with this hbby !
i 'm gon na run down to th store and gt a regulator for the intake hose .
you mean get rid of them ?
but bessie !
either those fish go or i do !
which is it to be ?
who looked hurt ?
my fish .
for once .
i left out the most exciting details .
see , i do n't like to brag but , i tell you , that one morning ...
it was at night , was n't it ?
right .
good mmory .
we went out with me in the engine room ...
i thought you were on the bridge with the admiral ?
the ss lias j. starbright , is n't it ?
i can tell you this , though .
there are so many nazi subs below the surface you could walk to europe .
the ocan 's jumping with u-boats ready to go if uncle sam gets in the fight .
i d n't want to start a panic , so you keep all this under your hat , right ?
right , bessie ?
old boy , did i ever tell you about the caribbean ?
what a liberty we had in a port near trindad !
and miami .
did yu ever do the rumba , henry ?
no , i have faulty equilibrium .
yes , sir .
join the navy and have a whirl !
barbados , kingston , the vrgin islands !
lunch is almost ready .
come along , henry !
more than anything , i wish i could be on of you rght now .
i wish i were a fish 
henry !
save him !
what will we do ?
get some help !
call the lifeguards !
get the police !
police !
help !
come on .
it 's all over .
he does n't even know how to swim .
he does n't know how to swim !
what 's gon na happen to poor besse ?
guess he must have lost his glasses during the fall .
fish ?
oh , no .
there besse , we 'd better get going home now .
all right , folks , back up , please .
let us through .
and i thought it all would be so beautiful .
wish i were home with bessie .
i 've never stayed out all night before .
maybe i should have listened to bessie .
i gt this back from the pet shop .
well , he was so cray about it .
that 's sweet 
here 's the notice :
the body was not recovered .
limpet is survived by his widow , bessie limpet .
por henry .
hi !

now , hoist your tail and get !
why , you 're a splendid specmen of a pgurus pollicaris .
i 'm glad to meet you , crusty .
hey !
i do n't wan na fight !
let that be a lesson to you , you confounded , four-eyed ...
say , what are you , anyway ?
you related to the prpoise fmily ?
no , i 'm a limpet .
i 've seen flat fish , but i 've never seen no four-eyed flat bush .
listen , flatbush , anything i hate , it 's a smart-aleck fish .
shark !
jumping jellyfish !
just swing about and let that shark chase you full speed away from here !
did that come out of me ?
hurricane !
stand by for a blow !
that belch of yours could capsie me in the backwash .
if you sound off like that again , i swear i 'll batten your gills and lower the boom on you .
and furthermore ...
crusty ?
crusty ?
yo all right , crusty ?
got ta hand it to you .
that blob of shrimp bat 'll think twice before he fools with us again .
well , guess i 'll be off .
off ?
where are you going ?
i 'd like to see if i can locte thers of my kind 
i figure i 'd better go along to keep you ot f trouble .
hy , great !
all right , flatbush , let her rip .
look !
a freighter !
hey , let 's not gt too close to the critter .
do n't worry , it 's not alive .
not aliv ?
suffering swordfish !
what kind of sea monster killed a whopper like that ?
a torpedo did it .
oh , they wo n't attack us , they 're just after ships .
hey , do n't go moseying around in this thing 's innards .
no wonder this thing died !
here 's the captain 's logbok .
listen to what it says ?
 did n't hear it say anything .
if only i could help .
come on , let s shove off .
gangway , get me out of here !
it 's only a mirror 
it 's me .
well , swab my scuppers .
another flatbush .
i 'm not a bad-iooking fish t that .
really , a pretty unique spcimen .
but maybe i 'm a freak !
if only there was another fish like me .
even jst one .
someone who would understand me .
listen .
do n't you hear that sound ?
i better go up topside and have  look .
how awful !
did you see that ?
are you ll right ?
thank you .
that was nothing at all .
it was very nice of you .
and very clever .
it ws just a simple thing , really .
i mean , anyone could have done it .
well , i think yu 're wonderful .
is that right ?
what 's your name ?
name ?
i do n't know what you men .
i 've never heard of such a thing .
well , let 's see .
i 'll call you ladyfish .
yeah , ladyfish !
go ?
go where ?
why , to the spawning grounds .
after what you did for me , i ...
you do n't know what you 'r saying .
oh , but i do .
all i can say is :
wow !
the first time i saw you .
remember ?
your pop brought me for dinner .
on my nose ?
tigma-tism .
well , they help me to see a lng way off .
do you see that barracuda coming at us ?
oh , limpet , limpet , we 'll be killed !
ladyfish ... ?
you see , you do n't understand .
married ?
is that like astigmatism ?
oh , tht !
 d n't see why it should .
do you spawn with every tom , dick and fish that comes long ?
you see , up until now i 've been too young .
now shall we go ?
i 'd sure like ...
well , that is t say ...
do you suppose that we could just be well , more or less friends ?
friends ?
goodbye .
gosh , i ca n't .
ladyfish !
ladyfish !
oh , ladyfish !
i 've searched everywhere .
sunday , december 7 , 1941 .
sources say the president wll ask congress ...
our country at wr ?
look , flatbush , if you 're in trouble , you can count on me .
if you 'd stay here nd look out for ladyfish , i 'd be grateful .
oh , please , it 's important , crusty .
if you do n't need me .
to look after her while i 'm gone .
flatbush , take it easy , huh ?
i will , crusty .
thanks .
they 're missing the u-boat !
ahoy !
a friend .
ship ahoy !
do n't be alarmed .
please do n't !
are you on a raft ?
i 'm a fish !
ahoy there !
what are you doing ?
why did n't you identify it ?
give the recognition signal !
give the recognition signal !
i fell in the ocean and was drowned 
only i was n't drowned , exactly .
give the recognition signal !
commnce firing !
commence firing !
activate sonar dome .
you missed the sub .
left standard rudder .
the old man should hear this .
pipe it to the bridge !
all engines ahead full , left standard rudder ?
400 yards straight ahead 
a direct ht .
could be a nazi trick .
cut that light !
if you 're friendly , give the recognition signal !
you could n't find it , could yo ?
and then you got it , did n't you ?
we can not see you !
i 'd rather not say at the moment , you would n't believe me 
what the blasted blaes is ths ?
probably a nazi trick , just as you said , sir .
you want to meet with somebody called pickle ?
not pickl 
stickle !
machinist mate second class george stickle !
on the uss elias j. starbright !
i 'll send a full report of this meeting in but i ca n't guarante pickl .
good .
i 'll be at this same spot three days from now .
wait till this hits the navy department .
harlock , yu 've either been drinking or you 've got combat fatigue !
we have n't time for nonsense .
whatever it is .
it led s to a nazi sub and directed our charges accurately .
all right , harlock .
what 's your explanation for this phenomenon ?
i only know that it 's friendly and cooprative .
blast it , harlock !
we ca n't enlist a voice !
why ?
i 'm not going on record as the admiral who was sent away becase he believed in voices from the ocean .
there 's nobody else cray enough to take it .
oh , not m , admral , i ...
stickle .
who is he ?
the voice asked us to bring stickle out to meet with him 
i think we can rrange a leave for you immediately .
think what this means .
it could spot submarines all over .
within a year we could break the nazi u-boat threat .
all right , harlock .
until we learn the nature of this device , it will remain tp-secret .
certainly , admiral .
except between stickle and yourslf .
commander , you 've got to belive me !
i 'm just a machinist mate second class ..
i know ll about you , pickle .
i hunted throgh half the navy to find you .
you have been summoned here by a voice from the sea .
i have , sir ?
yes .
i do n't know anyone down there , sir .
it did not come from a submarine .
so help me , sir , i do n't know anything about this !
when the voice hails us , you 'll talk to it until w get a fix on it .
yes , sir .
ahoy out there !
did you hail us three days ago ?
he 's here 
say something , quick !
talk , sailor !
ahoy there !
this is henry limpet .
george !
come on , salor !
hello , henry .
it 's good to hear you .
lmpet is dead !
we 've got four other ships closing in on him .
ths is a real surprise , henry .
i 'm not , george .
i 'm just ...
well , a little different 
sir ?
radar ca n't detect anything .
secure that light !
break out a rubber lfe raft .
rubber ... ?
oh , no !
you c n't make me ...
you 're the key to this mystery , stickle .
put him in the boat .
henry , it 's me .
george stickle .
i 'm right here , george !
where ?
do n't turn that flashlight on 
look , if you 're really henry , what are you doing out here in the ocean ?
remember when you jumped in the water aftr me at coney island ?
i sure do .
did n't you see a fish ?
hey , wait .
i did !
no , george , that was me .
you ?
if you were a fish , you certainly would need to wer your glasses , henry .
if you 'll pardon me now , i got ta get going .
now do you believe me , george ?
got ta go down for air .
remember how you 'd come over on friday nights ?
you and bessie would play pokr while i read myself to sleep ?
that 's right .
regular as clockwork , every friday night .
how about the time the three of us went to the oo ?
i got separated from you two 
i had to walk home .
bessie had my cash .
hey , wait a minute !
only henry limpet would know all that !
you are henry !
yes , george .
is there ... ?
is there anything i can do for you , henry ?

british screening units will deploy to their assigned ports ..

he also wants a lieutenant 's commission .
absolutely , no !
it s impossible to hold two meetings here at once .

i do want to .
his work for the navy is top-secret .

fish ?
not a mrs .
the wife of the fish .
spewter ..
i beg your pardon , sir .
you claim he turned into a fish .
we 'll try , sir .
you 'll do nothing of the sort .

at a time lk this .
when we have  cnvoy on our hands ready for the biggest push of the war .
if bessie could see me now .
not bad fr a 4-f fish .
imagne !
my glasses .
i 'm losing the convoy .
sunk ?
it 's that female flatbush .
ladyfish , got a message for you from limpet .
he said he loves you and other such mush like that .
he loves me ?
oh , crusty  do you think he 'll ever come back ?
do n't get yourself into a tiy now , ladyfish .
if i knw flatbush , he 'll be back .
listen !
it 's him .
ladyfish , i 'm in terrible trouble .
i ca nt see .
any sign of him yet ?
not yet , sir .
i 'm in an awful predicament .
i need some glasses , and ...
i noticed you wer missing some eyes .
i 've got to get back to my convoy !
but how will i find it ?
i 'll climb topside and serve as your navigator .
the sound of the convoy will guide me , and with you navigating , why ...
i ca n't ask you to risk your life .
risk my life ?
hold everything .
does that mean you 'll b leaving me ?
do n't you care for me at all , limpet ?
but i hav an important jb to do before we can talk about that anymore .
let 's shove off .
you ca n't .
it 's a vry dangeros mission .
i 'll always wait for you , limpet .
slow dwn , gosh darn it .
darned near shivered your timbers that time .
dagnab it .
hey , flatbush , wait !
hold it !
wait !
he makes a ...
a thrum .
any contact with that piscatorial lieutenant pal ?
we 're nearing nemy water , stickle .
sir , it 's nt my fault .
we 've come quite a way .
i still c nt pick up any sound of the convoy .
sy , why do n't you make that whale-busting noise of yours again ?
just hold up a minute till i get inside .
dead ahead .
whole school of big ones , coming dead at us .
hard right .
they 're coming at us !
follow me , you beeping devil .
we 'll take it right back where it came from .
i do n't know , sir .
might be henry .
something big is going on down thre .
them torpedoes pack a walloping thrum too .
great !
they hit their own boats .
we 'll just let them knock themselves out 
no , we do n't dre .
it 's about time you showed up .
i got ta tlk to george stickle .
where have you been ?
you put me in a terrible spot when we lost contact .
i 'm sorry , george .
i lost my glasses .
i 'll see besse when we get back and have her get you a new pair .
aye , aye , george .
see you at coney when it 's all over .
yes , ladyfish .
yo 're coming with me now ?
no , but you 're coming with me .
you see , i love you , but i do nt know if i have any right to .
i 've got to talk to my wife first .
you and  have to make a trip to coney island .
i can be your other eyes now .
take over .
thanks for all your wonderful help , crusty .
i like the bachelor life .
hate to admit it , but i 'm gon na miss him .
had to lose my best buddy to a frilly female .
i 'll help you forget .
i 've forgotten an awful lot already .
so long , flatbush .
i 'll never leave you , and i hope you 'll never leave me .
t 's always the males who leave in our species .
that 's why there 's so few of us .
in that case , there might be more before long .
there , that 's my wife .
not much to look at , is she ?
let 's get this over with , limpet .
hello , bessie .
henry , is that you ?
do n't yo recgnie me , bessie ?
henry , you really are ...
a fish ?
yes , bessie , yu can say it .
to think you 're actually still alive , and i 'm married to a ...
a fish .
is that so terrible ?
t does n't happen every day .
well , what 's new ?
i mean , how have yu been , bessie ?
i 'm bewildered , henry 
henry , am i the widw of a man or the wife of a fish ?
let 's be logical .
you could n't keep me in a tub , could you 
i mean , what would the neighbors say ?
i shudder to think .
why ...
oh , good heavens 
if you only knew , bessie .
i guess this is goodbye , henry .
if you 'll come up to the steps , i have something for you 
remember how you catch cold when you gt yor feet wet .
do n't break up , bessie .
maybe i was meant to be a fish .
maybe natre just corrected her error 
goodbye , bessie .
goodbye , henry .
godbye , henry , i said .
i thought that was it .
bessie and i have been happy .
the chif of naval operations ordered it .
do they really think that henry is teaching porpoises ?
that 's what we 've been ssigned to find out .
stickle .
it 's worth a try .
get the old man .
the secretary of defense ordered him to tak command of this mission .
and now , commodore regarding porpoise activities ...

isaburo sasahara of the escort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chamberlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see you two duel than merely test swords .
there are rumors in our clan .
the reason yu do n't fight is because it would hurt the famly of the loser .
perhaps protecting your famly name rather than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
isaburo , you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
i married into my wife 's family and have been henpecked for 20 years .
would you like to look at the november border record ?
no , not if nothing unusual happened .
makng rce cakes in november
but there are no customers
the god who came down in february and brought the rice harvest departs tomorrow until his return next year .
do you really believe tht ?
no , i was just
perhaps you want a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is the problem .
t must be someone she approves of .
someone strong , loving and faithful .
is that the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about useless things like martial arts again 
to have the steward honor us with a visit has never happened in the sashara family .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady ich has been dismissed from th castle .
it has been decided to have her marry yogoro , your son .
stewrd , why was lady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll return for an nswer in a few days .
why should we accept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa t rest .
the daughter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in charg of the castle wardrobe , was serving beside him .
lady ichi lost her head on seeing this .
she sprang at ldy tama , slapped her face , nd dragged her by the hair .
how can we accept her ?
i think we should gratefully accept her without being difficlt .
no matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's an order from ur lord .
i 'm afraid ...
i do nt feel very enthusiastic about it .
neither do i .
but if i refuse , there may be troubl later .
yogoro has said nothing , but he would n't be happy marrying a lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i do n't want hm to repeat my mistake .
they said you 'd be at the border .
i heard everything .
the steward and chamberlain are good judges .
alert even in times of peace .
but , saburo ... as for the marriage and other matters ,
 suggest y keep things quiet .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief .
so be modest abut it or the others will think you 're showing off .
a happy evnt .
he 's not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordplay ?
but at the last moment , you skillfully swtch from defense to offense .
yet yu never attack .
you wait until your opponent tires .
unworthy ?
yes .
we can not accept our lord 's favored lady .
there 's no ned to be so reserved .
it 's happened before , not just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decline the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , tht will not be allwed .
it is ur lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wish .
it 's an order !
to decline s to defy the rder !
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isaburo sasahar , you seem  bit too stubbrn .
may you enjoy long life together
we 'll all be t your side as long as you live
this is a day of celebration
keep that in mind .
no .
a woman who was dismissed after bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n't notice your return .
mother took her along for pryer at shonenji temple .
she kindly teaches me domestic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father ?
but dspite that , he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes , right away .
you must n't .
the world never seems to go rght .
i wish to retire and have yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara , hw are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm hppy to say .
i 'm vry sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but his son has married , so
so isaburo sasahara 's retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the time , but it 's a great relief .
i wonder what i 've dne all my life , thogh it 's not like me to do so .
yogoro 's marriage is a vry happy one .
fear often exceeds the perceived danger .
so it ws in your case .
yogoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just th same as before , but ichi is alwys pleasnt and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like yourself , i d n't understand it either .
check the weapons in the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appointed days .
i do n't say to always yield to them , but at times , they 're unreasonable .
rice cakes ?
njoy 
wait , ichi .
i 'm going to retire soon .
yogoro will become the head of our family , and you 're his wife .
you need n't hold back for the old woman .
take over the household dutes .
understand ?
even so , she is my mother , and i wll tret her as such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about yur duties , yogoro .
how abot some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understand .
that she 'd grasp her lord by his clothing .
it was hard for me to believe too , so  asked her the other day .
it was the year before last .
ichi 
accept the honor gratefully .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
our lord does not do this just to satisfy a whim .
daimyo must have heirs or their houses will be abolished .
the only heir to our lord right now is yong lord masamoto .
evn so , miss ichi , not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may ne day bcome our lord 's heir .
she must b beautiful and kind like you .
you are referring to sannojo kasai , your fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
then if sannojo agrees , you will gratefully agree to serve our lord ?
what do you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gve you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you said you would serve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in nswer to your wishes .
then i thought
no , it was more like a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
many , many sons .
then othr girls need never know my misery .
it wold end with me .
it was like a prayer .
my thoughts were really like a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later .
then i went to a spa for postntal rest at my lord 's orders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i could never have found a better wife .
bginning tonight ,
what ?
or lord means nothing to me 
i have been so worried about the son i bore .
so worrid .
i will forget about him too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wait nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would have ben better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brains over this and named her tomi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birth mother t the heir .
if she remains the wfe of a vassal , there would b much talk .
you say ths is our lord 's wish ?
ys .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is fr ygoro to submt a request to our lord and say he will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
wll , i do n't blame him .
but you know very wll ... that we ca n't have all our wishes granted in this world .
group head kotani came over in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is calling you .
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , i must tell you something .
come into the room .
first , father 's words .
he says he 's retired , so i am the family head , and i am to do what i think is right .
however , he also says you 're too importnt to us to send away .
that we must take the best possible car f you .
i must tell her sooner or later .
do n't worry .
no matter what anyone says ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca n't reason with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo , what 's your opinion ?
it 's all up to him .
what is it ?
 'd like him to cm again now and explain in his words why we must return her .
when his son s mother proves inconvenient , he frces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasonable .
he has no understanding of human emotions .
kotanisan , our family did n't accept ichi partcularly gratefully 
nor did ichi herself know yogoro or the sasahara family .
she ws none too happy about it either .
but the reason they are getting along is because they 're kind to each other and care for each other .
what ?
even if the heavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you gve up tomi and return to the castle ?
would you ruin our family because you 've lost your head over a woman ?
in this case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you were me , would you return ichi ?
of course i would !
restrain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the head of the family .
right or wrong , it 's all up to him .
if you love yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy such senseless conventions , however hard it may b .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are  wife worth protecting , even if that means ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't be the end of it .
i gave her the message .
she will be here son .
over here , sster .
we 've heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you want to stay with ygoro , even if it means ruining the sasahara family ?
i wuld like to stay .
even if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
yor father , hyoemon shiom , has asked our lord that you be sent back to the castle as soon as possible .
i 'm sure yo 're aware of that .
he lies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him to send you back .
he s done this several times .
father is father 
i am me 
i would rather die than return .
please tell the chamberlains and steward how i feel in whatevr words you think wll best help my case .
we ask you agan , ichi !
the family does n't matter ?
not only the sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeopardized as well 
it can not be helped .
i see .
there 's no use trying to convnce a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's your misfortune that a womn like her has favored you .
return .
return to the cstle .
why do yu say that now ?
what 's the sashara family to you ?
listen to me .
in other words  i 'm a worthless , good-for-nothing man .
so n order to prove myself , for these past 20 years
i have fought to preserve our good name and social standing .
the cruel njustce involved , for one thing .
but your beatiful love for each other has touched me most of all .
there 's never been a shred of love in my married life !
no mattr what happens , never leave him !
my husband 's with the chmberlain ?
yes , and he 's waiting for you to come .
i saw him in the castle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you both .
he has some questions for yo .
you need n't worry .
i will accompany you .
if you lose heart now , what will it mean for my brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything new at the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happens .
she went out .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ichi ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter how many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going hom .
ich , take my advice and return to the cstle .
if you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain is willing to overlook everything .
but if you insist on returning home  not only will yogoro , bt also his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervision of their home .
honorable lady ichi , please return to the castle .
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamberlain 's orders ?
what orders ?
go home !
but .. if i go home without
sy no more !
but
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool .
yogoro .
but he did request time off due to llness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid woman .
then everything 's all over ?
yes .
we just took a roundabout path .
defying the clan gets us nwhere .
isaburo , do you really mean that ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on this matter .
to be honest , the clan 's treatment of your family and your ttitude in response have weighed on my mind .
weighed on your mind ?
it 's like your swordplay .
pushed , you step back .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
it was more like force .
in fact  it was more like kidnapping .
if the shogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal mistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow them t end here .
yu 're saying i must formally ask the castle to take her back ?
yet i must ask them to take her back ?
it was wise of you to hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remember sending her back to the castle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's rdiculous , father !
never !
she suppressed her tears , left everything behind , and quietly returned t the castle .
now , now , yogoro .
in any case , please go for now .
yogoro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will report today and say he wishes to return her ?
that 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festval tomorrow .
since it wold have come to this anyway , how dare they cause all that fuss !
ygoro was wrong , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he 's always henpecked by his wife .
and defying clan orders like that
i must say he seems like a different man .
his conduct has been admirable .
it calls for a slight increase in his fef .
yogoro sasahara of the scort group has arrived !
i 'm glad you 've reported for duty .
yes , completly well .
taking into consideration my father 's wishes , i have decided .
please accpt this .
that 's good of you .
thank you .
fool !
petitin .
ths is the cruelest form of tyranny .
it runs counter t the laws of humanity and can not be condoned by the heavens .
we hreby appeal for her immediate return .
someon may use my father 's name or my own to submit a request to return ichi to the castle .
but it will not be from us .
pleas keep that in mind .
thank yu for coming evry day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at times like these .
so our fet wo n't slip in the blood .
this may be the last time .
will you do me a favor ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from ur lord !
accept obediently !
i said orders from our lord !
will you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
orders !
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolent conduct and defiance toward ur lord , you are ordered to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of our lord to permit it .
i thought men would come arrest us and then ither hang r crucify us .
father .
however , we want somthing before we kill ourselves .
bring us three heads !
thos of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler of the izu domain ,
chamberlain yanase , and steward takahashi .
bring me the heads of the villins who took my son 's wfe !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear you are
isaburo 's only equal as a swordsman .
if you think he 's too much for you , take four or five strong men with you .
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this is no time to discuss jurisdicton .
you 're wrong .
if you order me to kill them , plase promote me to superintendent here and now and obtain our lord 's prmise to increase my fief to 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mind .
go !
we must gather men , use force and kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swrdsman without peer .
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from th footsteps , he 's alone .
it 's bunzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the festival drums .
father !
you were pressed by our relativs at kenmotsu 's plac to come here as their messenger and say ,
we 've defied or lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hat us .
but remember :
each must live his own life .
as for what happened ,
each must live his own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
what if ther clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather some men and take care of it yourself .
yes , but
th chamberlain 's intervention would aggravate matters .
fther , the drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i remember it too .
outside the cstle , it was the noko fstival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the day befre the suwa shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that 's as it should be .
it 's not unmanly at all .
but yogoro , do n't be too worred about ichi .
we will die here , but she is the mother of our lord 's heir .
no one can torture her , and no one will endanger her life .
but father , are n't they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter , but the gate was open , so i came in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
we hve heard of the order to commit seppuku 
he changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitude toward or lord , you will be confined at enshoji temple outside the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will you gratefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's wrong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
i am still the wife of yogoro sasahara .
but our lord received me in his audience .
 do n't understand what this is all about .
steward , it seems we do n't understand what you just told us .
if you two admit that ich is no longer a family member and that she has been returned , our lord wll listen to her plea for a lighter punishment .
will you acknowledge her return and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared for the worst .
then there is no altrnative ?
please return her at once !
i 'll ask lady ichi now .
or will you let their pursuers come and kll them ?
lady ichi , the ssaharas are men .
you have already returnd to serve our lord .
if you tell them that you sever your ties with them once and for all , then all will be well !
if you do , their lives wll be saved .
we need not ask them to return you .
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and sav their lives ?
or will you let them die as traitors ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ichi , does your silence mean you will do as i say ?
am i correct ?
no .
i
father ...
tomi , bid your father and mother farewell .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are still alive listen to them 
let 's listen to what they want us to do .
no , i know without beng told .
they want us to tell the world of our clan 's cruelty !
very well .
i understand .
w promise to do that for yo .
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestl !
first , tomi nd i will go to edo together and see the shogunate lders .
we 'll leave immediately for edo .
tomi and i are going to edo .
if this is for the clan , show me your pass .
if it 's private bsiness , show me the clan ticket .
i hve neither .
then i 'm afraid i can nt let you pass .
you mean to pass from this domain without having either ?
i must forbid it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quiet .
i 'd like to put her in the house away from the wind .
but men we dislike are in there 
venomous men .
i fed her befre dawn .
i do n't think she 's hungry .
we 'll mak do with this .
you be quiet now , tmi 
do n't cry even if i do n't return .
let me remain 
it 's better that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
no .
no matter how strong you are , how perfect your dfense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with tomi 
then ...
wthout fail .
i will win without fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance of winning .
take tomi with you to edo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
no on will evr know the story of your father and mother now .
just one word .
when you grow up , become a woman just like your mother .
be sure to do that .

alvin :
what 's he going to do , make s walk the plank ?
yes , dave .
uh-huh .
absolutely .

and why would you need to do that ?
now , it would b easy for me to take my trusty old swiss army knife and ct the ropes .
yes , alvin , you do .
wht pocket knife are you referring to ?
you could cut yourself 
alvin , there 's no such word as robbag .
and it 's pillaging .
there 's got to be times when you trust us to take matters into our own hands .
i trusted you tonight and look where that got me !
that 's probably just the hot gravy talking .
is it hang gliding , wkeboarding , or bungee jumping ?
shuffleboard .
alvin :
man !
by my calculations , it appears to be 10 % shuffle , 90 % bored .
oh , thanks .
you know , dave , i think i 'd prefer the plank .
and i get to do something i have nt done in a lng tme .
absolutely nothing .
brittny approaches her puck , adjusts her stance , looks over at me , quite annoyed , wonders to herself if i 'm ever gong to shut my moth , realizes i 'm not , and makes her move .
oh !
yo can make all the jokes you want , alvin , but not even you can make this interesting .
h , really ?
well , care t make it interesting that i can make this interesting ?

alvn :

theodore :

i do n't think dave is gon na be in a hot-air balloon .
but he is comng , right ?
of course he is .
we should prepare to stay the night .
what ?
no , we used to be used to living in the wild .
we 're alwys setting things on fire accidentally 
and how are you intending to do that ?
i will create a spark by striking this rock with my swiss army knife , which dave took from me .
impressive .

us
psdh
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 million years to go around the galaxy once
the dinosaur era lasted 180 millon years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for the earth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not really .
at this time the masters of the earth are dinosaurs .
this is patagonia .
a vast region of rgentinean south america as it is tday .
and there was only one immense ocean ,
we are north of the south americn plate , in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosarus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land during the dinosaur era .
in mny plces there , one wlks tday on the very ground these giants walked upon a 100 million years ago .
this phenomenn seems to depend on another peculiar twist of evolution .
regions that produce great dinosaurs also tend to produce great plaeontologists .
many doctoral students come to pursue their research .
sometimes younger people , like my daughter ludmila , just come to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talking about dinosaurs with everyne , whether they are experts or not 
it 's a busy life , and t would have been plenty for most people , but early in my career new horizons opened up for me .
things became much larger than life .
a rancher had stumbled upon a surprisingly large bon .
after several digging seasons we ended up facing the largest dinosaur ever found .
we named it argentinosaurus
this discovery have a profound effect , on the way we lok at south american dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit .
predators and hazards abound .
only a few will reach adulthood .
it covers more than 15 mils and it is approximately 80 million years old .
we believe that it was chosen as a nesting site by generation upn generation of these dinosaurs .
the nests are so close together , that the females could not walk between them .
it was warmer than today .
a gret part of the dinosaur era , there were n broad leaf trees and no flower bearing plants .
dring the dinosaur era there is no arctic ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
for tens of millions of years seasons barely changed .
the water of the ocen is also much warmer .
hurricanes are frequent .
the magnetic poles changes position continuously .
professor coria has contributed to the discovery of more than a dozen of new dinosaurs .
as a scientst , he insists that each new find is important , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes he says what plays the biggest prt is simply not in our hands .
i like to think that i am lucky , just incredibly lucky .
many paleontological discoveries ar not made by professinals .
that 's what happened with the argentinosaurus , and it happened again with yet another dinosaur .
they were relatively big , so at first , we thought that they belonged to a herbivore , because in general these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
but instead , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a very large one .
prfessor coria 's team had unveiled a first species of  group of fierce predators called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in this group surpassed the famous t. rex in terms of size .
althogh rare for reptiles , caring for the young has be observed among crocodils fr instance .
n dinosaurs , this caring behaviour evolve enough to remind us of birds .
this baby female is named long toth .
however small and vulnerable , and cute she may appar now she is genetically programmed to rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like her mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and the largest predator , living at roughly the same period and in the same territory .
there is no easy answer .
evolutin followed a number f particular paths .
but a simpler interpretation rest on a warm climate and the fertile lnd , with ll the vegetation you can eat .
yet another theory tells us that large herbivores had to grow big enough , to accommodate a large stomach required to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space could have led naturlly to argentinosaurus , as the vast seas have led to whales .
the highest branches belong to those who can reach them , and many predators are too small to be threatening n those situation .
she is growing fast too 
her primitiv feathers have almost all disappeared .
they thrived for 180 million years .
this is a message for us here .
by the way , it s more than time to introduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlaga , a 6 fot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is related t brds , as are to some extent velocirptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need space .
this is the carmen funes museum , which also happens to be my secnd home .
sometimes as a joke we say that it is a science filled with holes .
we have only found about 700 spcies of dinosaurs on the whole planet .
this is n't many for a reign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , most of them in the last 30 years .
through technology our knowledge grows faster every day .
fossilisation is a process that requires extremely rare conditions , and even then very little of an organism is preserved .
we could easily conclude that a tremendous number of species just disappeared without a trace .
of curse , science fiction can be fun , but you also need to be very careful before proposing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish i could travel in time to see these amazing creatures alive .
strong one has reached maturity .
for many scientists he is at full size .
h is 20-yar-old , and is at the beginning of more than a century of life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking n two legs or four , if they were alone or in a grup , if they were wandering , hunting , or being hunted
the pattern clearly show association between contemporary species , and this is very rare .
his work is intimtely linked to nature , its intimtely varied terrain and ever changing climate .
so there were hardships , but there are moments , sometimes when scence just blend with the pure bliss of being outsid and wonderful places .
you just look round .
but finding required a trained eye .
with time you realise that the number of questins grows faster than the number of answers .
again , lke many times before ,
a good hint and an answer came unexpectedly .
in fact  we did n't find just one specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at least sevn individuals .
for me , and my canadian colleage phil curry this was pointing at something we had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so long truth belongs t this new species of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , she is fully grwn .
strong one is unknowingly in a critical time .
tearing off pieces of skin and letting the large prey bleed to dath , or die from infection is a stratgy more likely to succeed .
giganotosaurus could wait days even weeks between meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep on drifting , the earth begins t resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature never stops changing .
we are in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolution gave it nothing to survive the impending dramatic events .
several factors could have contributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mammals became bigger and more competitive .
drifting islated continents touched each other .
new rivalries appeared .
new diseases spread .
the climte was growing colder , possibly because of increased volcanic activity .
the air was unbrthable in many places .
vegetation suffered from the acid rain and also frm the darkened and dust-filled skies .
but still , many dnosaurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the dstance from the moon to the earth in two hours .
all the forest of north and south america are destroyed by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs re the animals that suffred most .
in a relatively short time , dinosaurs become history .
not all the dinosaurs disappear .
if they have n't become extinct maybe we just would n't be here .
more discoveries await me here perhaps but as i move forward in life ,
and th best food in paris , some say , is made by chef auguste gusteau .
gusteau 's restaurant is the toast of pris , boked five months in advance .
he is the youngest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but not everyone celebrates its success .
what s even more amusing is that gusteau actually seems to believe it .
i , on the other hand , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
i think it 's apparnt i need to rethink my lif a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ..
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
this is emile , my brother .
he 's easily impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impressed .
he also happens to be the leader of our clan 
so , what 's wrong with having highly developed snses ?
what 's gong on here ?
suddenly , dad did n't think my talent was uselss 
clean .
cleanerifc .
cleanerino .
never mnd .
well , it made my dad proud .
now , do nt you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we 're thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't stealing f no one wants it .
if no one wants it , why are we stealing it ?
but to my dad ...
yu get picky about what you put in the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and eat your garbge .
secondly , stay out of the kitchen and away from the humans .
it 's dangerous .
they discover , they creat .
how can i describe it ?
good food is like music you can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was right .
oh  mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only one who knew about it was emile .
hey , emile .
emile .
come on , you 're good at hiding food .
he dos n't understand me , but i can be myself around him .
why are you walking like that ?
i do n't want to cnstantly have to wash my pws .
did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws that we handle food with ?
you ever think about what w put into our mouths ?
all the time .
but if dad sees you walking like that , he 's not going to like it .
what have yu got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found chees ?
and not just any cheese .
tht would go beautifully with my mushroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you know , dad 's gon na ...
emile !
thre are possibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep turning it .
that storm 's getting clser .
hey , remy , you think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to taste this !
it 's got , like , this ba-boom , zp kind of taste .
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 's lightning-y !
we got to do that again .
okay , when the next storm comes , we 'll go up on the roof ...
i know what this needs !
saffron .
saffron .
do n't like it .
she s gon na wake up .
she turns on the cooking channel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been here a million times ?
gusteau swears by it .
okay .
who 's gusteau ?
just the greatest chef in the world .
wrote this cookbook .
yu read ?
and they have , which is why i read 
i do nt like secrets .
all this cooking and reading and tv-watching while we read nd cook .
why do i let yo ?
what 's taking those kids so long ?
ah , l'aquila saffron .
italian .
gusteau says it 's excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food lov ...
forget mystique .
great cooking is not fr the faint f heart .
you must be imaginative , strong hearted .
you must try things that may not work .
and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from .
nyone can cook .
but only the farless cn be great .
gusteau 's restaurant lost one of its fve stars after a scathing review by france 's top food critic , anton ego .
it was a severe blow to gusteau , and the brokenheartd chef died shortly afterwards , which , according to tradition , meant the loss f another star .
oh !
oh !
oh !
run !
n , you 'll lead her to the colony !
emile !
help , remy , help !
start swinging the light !
try to grab you 
everyone , to the boats .
let me through !
let me through !
th book .
excus me .
move , move , move .
get the bridge up !
hurry !
come on .
get hold !
here !
do we have everybody ?
where 's remy ?
i 'm coming .
i 'm coming !
hold on , son .
paddle , son .
come on .
reach for it .
you can do it .
come on .
you can make it .
you cn make it .
gys , wait .
remy .
hold on !
wait for me .
hold on .
i waited for a sound ,
if you are hungry , go up and look around , remy .
how do you know ?
why m i talking to you ?
well , you just lost yor family  all your friends .
you are lonely .
yeah .
ah , but that is no match for wishful thinking .
now go up and look round .
oh !
what are you doing ?
i do nt know where i am , and i do n't know when  'll find food again .
food will come , remy .
you do n't have the guts .
it 's beautiful .
the mst beautiful .
gusteau 's ?
yes .
i have led you to it !
ready to go on table sven .
comng around .

yes , linguini .
so nice of you to vsit .
my mother ?
yes , renata .
well , not ...
she died .
i 'm sorry .
oh , do n't b .
what 's this ?
she left it for you .
i think she hoped it would help me , you know , get a job here .
but of course .
gusteau would n't hesitate .
yes  well , we could file this and if something suitable opens up ...
how dare you hire someone without my ...
oh , garbage .
well ...
uh ...
i ca n't believe it .
a real gourmet kitchen , and i get to watch .
let us se how much you know , huh ?
oh !
oh , that guy .
very good .
there .
very important .
chef de prtie , demi-chef de partie , both important .
commis , cmmis , they 're cooks 
very important .
not nobody .
he is part of the kitchen .
he does n't cook .
uh , no .
how d you know ?
anyone can cook .
that des n't mean that anyone should .
see ?
do something .
what can i do ?
i am a figment of your imagination .
but he 's ruining the soup !
we got to tell someone that he 's ...
coming down the line 
set .
oi , chef .
one filet mignon , three lamb , two duck .
oh , god .
tonight , i 'd like to present the foie gras .
hmm .
come on !
oui , chef .
what are you waiting for ?
is this going to become a regular thing with you ?
you know how to fix it .
this is your chance .
where is the soup ?
how dar you cook in my kitchen ?
where do you get the gall to even attempt something so monumentally idiotic ?
i should have you drawn and quartered !
i 'll do it .
larusse , draw and quarter this mn after yu put him in the duck press to squeeze the fat out of his head .
what are you blathering about ?
the soup !
soup ?
no !
waiter .
linguini !
f-i-r-e-d !
what did the customer say ?
it was not a customer .
ego ?
solène leclaire .
she likes the soup .
wait .
smeone is asking about your soup .
what ar you playing at ?
am i still fired ?
you ca n't fire him .
what ?
if she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook responsible ...
he s a garbage boy .
how can we claim to represent the name of gusteau if we do n't uphold his most cherished belief ?
he has taken a bold risk and we should reward that , as chef gusteau would have .
oh , yeah .
you will mak the soup agan , and this time , i 'll be paying attention .
very close attention .
they think you might be a cook .
but y know what i think , linguini ?
get the rat .
what should i do now ?
kill it .
no , not in the kitchen .
they 'd close us down .
take it away from here .
kill it .
go !
do n't look at me like that !
they expect me to cook it again !
i mean , i 'm not ambitious .
i was just trying to stay out of trouble .
you 're the one who was getting fancy with the spices !
what did you throw in there ?
oregano ?
i need this job .
i 've lost so many 
did you nod ?
have you been nodding ?
so i 'm not crazy !
wait a second , wait a second .
you can , right ?
look , do n't be so modest .
you 're a rat , for pete 's sake .
whatever you did , they liked it .
do you think you could do it again ?
right ?
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not much , but it 's , you know ...
there 's heat and light and a couch with a tv .
th best kind of dream .
one we can share .
but why here ?
why now ?
morning , little chef .
idiot !
i let a rat into my place and tell him what 's mine is his !
stupid !
he 's stolen food and hit the road !
that 's what i get for trusting a ...
hi .
is that for me ?
look , it 's delicious .
but do n't steal .
i 'll buy some spices , okay ?
and on the first day !
though i , like many other critic ,
had written off gusteau as irrelevant since the great chef 's death ,
the soup was a revelation .
solène leclaire ?
against all odds , gusteau 's has recaptured our attention .
only tim will tll if they deserve it .
well ...
you know .
welcome to hell .
now , recreate the soup .
take as much time as you need .
soup .
you little ...
you son of a ...
something that does n't involve any biting , or nipping , or running up and down my body with your little rat feet .
the biting !
scampering !
no !
no scampering or scurrying .
little chef ?
oh , you 're hungry .
okay .
so let 's think this out .
we need to work out a system so that i do what you want in a way that does n't lok like i 'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef .
would you listen to me ?
i 'm insane !
i 'm insane !
i will never pull this off !
linguini ?
we got ta communicate 
i saw it !
a rat ?
yes , a rat .
what are you doing in here ?
get out .
that was close .
whoa !
how did you do that ?
that 's strangely involuntary !
one look and i knew we had the same crazy idea .
okay .
huh ?
where are you taking me ?
i 'm sorry .
whoa !
mmm-hmm ...
okay .
whoa !
whoa !
à votre santé !
all right .
mmm .
but yu 'll need to know more than soup if you re to survive in my kitchen , boy .
listen , i just want you to know how honored i am to be studying under such ...
no !
how many women do yu see in this kitchen ?
well , i ...
only me .
why do you think tht is ?
because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid old men .
but still i 'm here .
how did this hppen ?
because i am the toughest cook in this kitchen .
got it ?
wow !
gustau makes chinese food
gusteau 's corn puppies .
bite size .
what are corn dogs ?
cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried .
cheap sausages dipped in batter and deep fried .
you know , american .
whip something up .
or as a big ear of corn in doggie make-up .
yes .
well , the will stipulates that if after a period of two years from th date of death no heir appears ,
gusteau 's business interests will pass to his sous chef .
you .
what i want to know is f this ltter ...
if this boy changes anything !
there 's no resemblance at all .
he is not gusteau 's son .
gsteau had no children , and what of the timng of all this ?
highly suspect !
this is gusteau 's ?
yes , yes , yes .
of course .
she claims she never told him , or gusteau , nd asks that i not tell .
why you ?
only a job ?
if he works here , you 'll be able to keep an eye on him while i do a little digging .
find out how much of this is real .
i will need you to collect some dna samples from the boy .
mark my words .
the whole thing is highly suspect .
he knows something .
relax , he 's a garbage boy 
what re you doing ?
i 'm cutting vegetables .
you think cooking is a cute job , like mommy in the kitchen ?
what is this ?
when the meal rush comes , what will happen ?
disaster .
keep your station clear , or i will kill yo !
your sleves look like you threw up on them .
lik this .
see ?
always return to this position .
sharp utensils , hot metal , keep your rms in .
i memorize all his recipe 
follow the recipe .
no , no , no .
how do you tell how good bread is without tsting it ?
listen .
symphony of crackle .
the only way to get the best prodce is to hav first pick of the day and there are only two way to get first pick .
grow it yourself , or bribe a grower .
and then he get fired for messing around with the ringmaster 's daughter .
horst has done time .
what for ?
i robbed the second largest bank in france using only a ballpoint pen .
i created a hole in the ozone over avignon .
which resistance ?
he wo n't say .
apparently , they did n't win .
so you see .
we are artist , pirate .
more than cooks are we .
we ?
you are one of s now , oui ?
oui .
thank you , too .
for what ?
huh ?
the rat !
but he is a ...
i just dropped my keys .
have you dcided this vening ?
but ...
but we order it every time .
what else do you have ?
well , we have a very nice foie gras .
what does the chef have that 's new ?
yes .
well , what did you tell them ?
i told them  would ask !
customers are asking what is nw .
what should i tell them ?
what did you tell them ?
this is simple .
they know about the old stuff .
that 's all we are saying .
were we saying that ?
very well .
if it 's linguini they want tell them chef linguini has prepared something specal for them .
its linguini-ness .
oui , chef .
now s your chance to try something worthy of your talent , linguini .
colette will help you .

hey !
do n't mind me .
apparently , i need this .
i 'll be right ...
i 'm going to pick that up .
i got sme of that spice .
okay .
what are you doing ?
you 're supposed to be preparing th gusteau recipe .
the customer are wating .
i should listen to you !
stop that !
coming !
then what are you doing ?
it 's very hard to explain .
the special ?
whoa , whoa .
do n't you dare .

i just took it to be polite .
of course you do nt .
but you wuld have to be n idiot of elephantine proportions not to appreciate this '61 château latour .
remy !
i ca n't believe it !
you 're alive !
you made it !
i thought i 'd never see you guys again !
we figured you did n't survive the rapids .
i do n't really know .
what ?
no brother of mine eats rejectamenta in my town .
you are stealing ?
you told linguini he culd trust you .
it 's for my brother .
which means i would , too .
it 's under control , okay ?
more wine ?
kay .
train ?
surely you do n't expect me to believe this is your first time coking ?
it 's not .
i knew it !
fifth tim .

do yo like animls ?
what ?
what kind ?

i brought you something to ...
i have got to teach yu about food .
no !

not really .
oh , i 'm detecting nuttiness .
now taste this .
okay .
okay .
it might be the nuttiness .
see ?
could be the tang .
now , imagine every great taste in the world being combind into infinit combinations .
you lost me again .
yeh .
but that was interesting .
hey !
dad does n't know you 're alive yet !
we 've got to go to the colony !
yeah !
what 's more important here ?
well , i ...
it would n't hurt to visit .
have you had a pet rat 
did you work in a lab with rats ?
no .
perhaps you lived in squalor at some point ?
you know something about rats !
you know you do !
yu know who know do whacka-doo .
hey !
what ?
ratatouille .
it 's like a stew , right 
why do they call it that ?
if you 're ging to name a food , you should give it a name that sounds delicious .
rattouille does n't sound delicious .
t sounds like rat and patootie .
rat patootie .
which does not sound delicious .
and finding someone to replace you fr poison checker has been a disaster .
nothing 's been poisoned , thank god , but it has n't been easy .
i am srry , dad .
why is that ?
it 's tough out there in the big world all alone , is n't it ?
sure  but it 's not like i 'm a kid anymore .
hey .
what 's p ?
visit ?
i will .
i promise .
often .
it 's not a big deal , dad .
i just ...
eventually , a bird 's got to leave the nest .
we 're rats .
we make them bgger .
i 'm tired of taking .
i want to make things .
oh , yeah ?
what makes you so sure ?
i 've been able to observe them at a close-sh sort of range .
yeah ?
how close ?
close enough .
and thy 're , yo know , not so bad as you say they are 
come with me .
i got something i want you t see .
you want me to stay and clean ?
is that a problem ?
no .
good boy .
w 're here .
the world we live in belongs to the enemy .
wht ?
no .
can only be more of this ?
you ca n't change nature .
change is nature , dad 
the part that we can influence .
and it starts when we dcide .
where you going ?
with luck , forward .
hey !
yeah .
stop it 
good morning .
that 's big .
that 's big .
what , you ca n't tell me ?
oh !
frgive me fr intruding on your deep , personal relationship with the chef .
oh , i see how it is .
you get me to teach you a few kitchen tricks to dazzle the boss and then you blow past me ?
wake up .
i did n't have to help you !
but ...
i wanted you to succeed .
i liked you .
my mistake .
colette .
wait  wait .
i ca n't do it anymore .
wait , wait !
look , i 'm no good with words .
at least not without your help .
i hate false modsty .
it 's just another way to lie .
you have talent .
no , but i do n't !
it 's nt me .
what d you mean ?
 mean , i would n't have done that .
i would 've followed the rcipe .
i would ve followed your advice to the ends of the erth .
because i love yor advice .
but ...
but i ...
do n't do it .
i have a secret .
what 
you have a rash ?
i have this ...
little ...
a tiny chf ?
yes .
he 's ...
he 's up her .
here we go 
you nspire me .
i 'm gng to risk looking like the biggest idiot psycho you 'v ever seen .
you want to know why i 'm such a fast learner ?
do n't laugh !
no !
no !
wht is it , ambrister ?
gusteau 's .
mre financial trouble ?
no , it 's ...
announced a new line of microwave egg rolls ?
what ?
i said , gusteu has finally found his rightful place in hstory
right alongside another equally famous chef ,
touché .
that was my last word .
the last word .
then tell me , ambrister , how could it be popular ?
the dna matches , the timing works , everything checks out .
this ca n't just happen !
the whole thing is a setup !
the boy knows !
look at him out there , pretending to be an idiot .
string ?
playing dumb .
taunting me wth tht rat .
deliberately trying to make me think it 's important .
the rat .
exactly !
is the rat important ?
of course not !
he just wants me to think that it is .
and now he wants me to see it everywhere .
ooh !
n , it is nt , it 's here !
am i seeing things , am i crazy ?
is thre a phantom rat or is there not ?
but , oh , no !
i refuse to be sucked into his little game of ...
about yu ?
i ca n't fre him .
he 's getting attention .
if i fire him now , everyone will wonder why .
is n't it good to have the press ?
is n't it good to have gusteau 's name getting headlines 
not if thy 're over his face !
gsteau 's already has a face , and it 's fat and lovable and familiar .
and it sells burritos !
millions and millions of burritos !
no , no , no .
well , because you ...
rat !
disgusting lttle creatures .
how the world really saw me .
and it just kept getting better .
remy !
remy !
hey , hey , hey , little brother !
you told them ?
emile , that 's exactly what i said not to do !
but you know these guys .
they 're my friends .
 did n't think you meant them .
look , i 'm sorry .
do n't tell m you 'r sorry , tell them you 're sorry .
it s locked ?
hmm ...
okay .
emile shows up with ...
i told him ...
he goes and blabs to ...
yeah , it 's a disaster .
anyway , they 're hungry , the food sfe is locked and i need the key .
thy want you to steal food ?
yes .
no !
no !
it 's complicated .
they do n't have your ideals .
ideals ?
or , tooth , i say , tooth pick ' n chicken ?
bout as french as a corn dog !
coming soon !
we 're inventing new ways to sell out over here .
cn you guys shut up ?
word 's getting out .
hey .
mind f i ...
linguini ?
why would linguini be filed with your will ?
this used to be my office .
he 's your son ?
i have a son ?
i am a fgment of your imagination 
you did not know , how could i ?
well , your son is the rightful owner of this restaurant !
sorry , chef .
the rat !
it 's stolen my documents !
it 's gtting away !
chef !
you !
he 's not in your office .
you are in his .
bottoms up , linguini !
cheers , ja .
chef !
chef !
what is the secret to your genius ?
secrt ?
 am gusteau 's son .
but you were n't ware of that fact until very recently .
and it reslted in your taking ownership of this rstaurant .
how did you find out ?
the gusteau part ?
inspiration has many names .
mine is named colette .
something 's stuck in my teeth .
health inspector .
i wish to report a rat infestation .
first opening is three months .
it 's a gourmet restaurant !
monsieur , i have the information .
if someone cancels , i 'll slot you in .
but the rat !
you must ...
t 's past opening time .
he should have finshed an hour ago .
bonjour , ma chérie .
join us .
we were just talking about my inspiration .
yes , he calls it his tiny chef .
not that , dearest .
i meant you .
it 's him .
ego ?
anton ego !
is that ego ?
you are monsieur linguini ?
hllo .
pardon me for intrrupting your premture celebration , but i thught it only fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game .
game ?
yes .
and you 've been playng without an opponent .
which is , as you may have guessed , against the rules .
you 're anton ego .
if i do n't love it , i do n't swllow .
listen , we hate to be rude , but we 're french , and it 's dinnertime .
do n't give me that look .
you were distracting me in front of the press .
how am i supposed to concentrte with you yanking on my hair all the time ?
your opinion is n't the only one that matters here .
all right , that 's it !
you take a break , little chef .
i 'm not your puppet , and you 're not my puppet-controlling guy 
you cool off and get your mind rght , little chef .
ego is coming , nd i need to focus !
you stupid ...
i have never seen that before .
you know what ?
i 've been selfish .
are yo kidding ?
we 'll go after closing time .
in fact ...
yeah .
this is great , son .
an inside job .
oof !
hey , little chef .
then when you were nt there , i do n't know ...
it did n't seem right to leave things the way that we did , so ...
look , i do n't wnt to fight .
i 've been under a lot of , you know , pressure .
i 'm suddenly a gusteau .
and i got to be a gustau r , you know , people will be disappointed .
i have n't been fair t you .
you 've never failed me , and i should never forget that .
you 've been a good frend .
the most honorable friend a guy could ever ask ...
what 's going n ?
hey ...
you 're ...
you 're stealing food ?
 thought you were my friend !
i trsted you !
get out !
you and all your rat buddies !
we are what we are , and we 're rats .
steal all you want .
i 've lost my appetite .
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
come in !
you are the bss .
attention , everyone .
tonight is a big night 
i mean , ego .
the critic .
and he 's going to order something .
just ca n't leave it alone , can you ?
it 's not safe .
i 'm hungry !
observe .
no , wait !
oh , no !
no , no !
you might think you are a chef but you are still only a rat .
sure he took away a star last time he reviewed this place .
sure it prbably killed ...
dad .
this is very bad juju right here .
ego is here .
ego ?
he is here ?
anton ego is jst another customer .
let 's cook !
yeah !
okay .
au revoir , rat !
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
yes , i think i do .
after rading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook , yo know what i 'm craving ?
a little perspective .
can you suggest a good wine to go with that ?
very well .
you provide the food , i 'll provid the perspective .
which would go nicely with a bottle of cheval blanc 1947 .
i 'm afraid i ...
tell him to hit me with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 've given up .
as you ar .
oh , please .
i pretend yo exist so i have smeone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here !
what the ...
dad !
where are you going ?
they 'll fail without me .
why do you care ?
because i 'm a cok !
it 's your recipe .
i did n't write it down .
it just came to me .
because we ca n't serve this !
where 's my order ?
ca n't we srve something else ?
something i did n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we just opened .
i have another idea .
what if we serve them what they order !
we will make it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the customers something .
then tell them ...
tell them ...
remy .
we 're not talking about me .
we re talking about what to do right ...
remy !
get my knife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ...
well , the truth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it s not the truth .
and the truth is , i have no talent at all .
but this rat , he 's the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding nder my toque .
he 's been controllng my actions .
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's excting everyone .
i know it 's a hard thing to believe .
we can be the greatest restaurant in paris , and this rt , this brilliant little chef , can lead us there .
what do you say ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ca n't chose between two halves of myself .
i 'm nt talking about cooking .
we 're nt cooks , but we are family .
you tell us what to do , and we 'll get it done .
stop that health inspector !
delta team , go , go , go , go !
the rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be handling fish .
team four , roasted items .
tem six , sauces .
get to your stations .
those handling food will walk on two legs .
i 'm sorry for any dely , but we 're a little short tonight .
please , take all of the time you need .
make sure that steak is nice and tenderized .
easy with that sole meunière .
only use the mimolette cheese .
compose the salad like you were painting a picture .
do n't let that beurre blanc separat .
gently poach the scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
just tell m what the rat wants to cook .
it 's a peasnt dish .
i am making ratatouille .
they must be joking .
mmm .
no , it ca n't be 
 demand to know !
i asked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight .
then who do i thank for the meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait until all the other customer have gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react beyond asking an ccasional question .
and when the story is done , ego stands , thanks us for the meal ...
we risk very little , yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which s fun to write and to read .
the world is often unkind to new talent , new creations 
the new needs friends .
last night , i experienced something new , an extraordnary meal from a singularly unexpected source .
but i realize only now do i truly understand what he meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a great artist can come from anywhere .
it is difficult to magine more hmble origins than those of the genus now cooking at gusteau 's , who is  in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the finest chef in france .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it ws a great night .
well , we had to let skinner and the health inspector loose  and of course they ratted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n't feel too bad for him .
he seems vry happy .
hw do you know ?
got to go .
do n't you always ?
which one would you like ?
the city of townsville is in some serious serious , serious trouble !

we met lots of kids .
-and we learned things .
-and we played tg !
we need to talk about something .
-yep , what 's up , daddy-o ?
well , it 's your super powers .
i 'm not sure how to say this but i do n't think you should use them in public anymore 
why ?
nd unfortunately , people often get scared or angry when they do n't understand something special or unique .
that 's silly .
i think so too , but nonethless , take it easy with the powers tomorrow .
things will be fine .
s i ll be waiting here to pick you p when school gets out , okay ?

why , it 's not kosher !
you guys , my kids .
i ca n't just leave them there alone .
he 's not coming .
he totally hates us .
no , he probably just got held up , or maybe the car broke or maybe he forgot or maybe he hates s .
the devastation ?
devastating .
it should be illegal .
used to be a time when you could buy an honest pickle .
they were lighting up the sky .
the kind that you can only find at a pickle cart .
-well  it seems that --
-hatred is running rampant for --
those mutant , bug-eyed -
-pickle-cart killing --
they are little freaks , are nt they ?
with more on ths subject is --
get them out .
we do n't need them .
we do n't need thm .
we interrupt this program for a news flash .
my girls , they need me .
well , it 's official .
i hve n idea where we are .
but it probably could n't gt much worse .
hey , it 's okay .
maybe thre 's a box we can get in around back .

monsters are evil .
you 're just trying to make me feel better .
but my pain is not for yo to understand .
besides , how could you ?
for you are pure and innocent and , most certainly , loved .
how could you know what it 's like for people to far and despise you for the very things that make you special because you do n't fit in , bcause you are a freak ?
-no , they 're terrible .
-i bet everyone hates them .
-yes .
this brain is full of brilliant ideas .
no .
jjo , do n't be sad .

who was also hated by everybody .
but he had this great idea .
-that way the town would accept us .
-we did something to help .
and his ideas .
-city of townsville ...
i 'd like to take this moment ...
-you 're gon na be so proud 
... to thank the little people ...
... who helped to make this day a smashing success .
we did really go --
blossom , bubbles and buttercup , i could n't have done it without you .

for too long , apes and monkeys have been under the thumb of man .
well , the time has cme to oppose that thumb and take hold of what is rightfully ours :
the world !
-liars .
yu 've doomed us all .

that can be your bed over there .
maybe if someone had n't pushed bubbles into the school ... .
look , she speaks .
we were n't llowed to use our powers , and you know it !
and using our super powers to make a help-the-town-and- make-ita-better-place machine was following rules ?
you stupid !
no , because  know -- never mind .
well , prepare yourself for a long silence , girl bcaus we 're gon na spend the rest of our lives here , thanks to you .
blossom ?

who cares ?
-what do we do ?

-professor !
professor !
bubbles  wait !
-good job , but we 've got ta save --
-the baby !
holy ... .
wait !

oh , man !
now stay !
this is hopeless !
i know .
there 's too many monkeys .
what can we do ?
and the dog .
he could n't -- oh , man !
-i am ?
yeah .
the one way to stop the monkeys , save the town and find the professor is to use our powers to --
better yet , watch !
-that was amaz-
gross !
cut it out .
good one , bubbles .
-girls --
-shut up !
i was afraid of this .
come .
you will make a good power-proof vest .
-none of those monkeys had professor !
-where cold he be ?
come on , girls !
look at the little heroes here to save their daddy !
no , girls !
-sorry , professr !
-we can take this chump chimp down !
that 's better .
t 's good you little freaks know when you 're beaten .
i have to seize control of an area and force its inhabitants to follow my way of thinking !
even f it means taking extreme measures !
-you would n't !
now i am more mojo than before !
now , as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted i , mojo jojo , have succeeded in my first , greatest and most brilliant plan ever 
and i , mojo jojo shall be king !
now let 's get out of this town !
-it s no use .
well , now it 's time for everyone to understand .
surrender now , and we 'll go easy on you !
down here !
you 're actually trying to stop me ?
that 's so cute !
-we will stop you !
who are you calling cute ?
okay , lt 's play !
buttercup !
-that mor mojo is no more !
somebody 's mad .
look out !
i have an idea .
-do you think he 's finished ?
-no , but you are !
fools !
you dare to challenge me ?
try to destroy m ?
i , who saved you from certain death ?
after all i 've done for you , you betray me ?
and why ?
the ones wh hatd you ... .
none of them will ever understand you as i can .
for we are kindred spirits , whse powers spring from the same source .
so , girls , do not make me destroy you .
we are invincible !
we have the power !
all we have to do is work together .
girls , join me .
we d never join you , and it 's because we are stronger .
-because we are invincible .
we hav to protect them from you !
you are evil !
and you are it !
girls , you wer right !
we should stp mojo , and i know how !
i whippd up an antidote to chemical x !
we love you too !
-and we 'r really sorry .
-we messed up really bad .
-but we 're ready , professor .
if it was n't for them , none of this would have happened .
and maybe everyone would like us more if we were just normal little girls .
no !
girls , i think what the mayor is trying t say is we re sorry , and thank you .
yes , that was super , just super !
-amazing !
-stupendous !
you rock !
thank you .
can we , professr ?
okay , but only if it 's before your bedtime .
help !
sugar , spic nd everything nice .
these were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl .
but professor utonim accidentally added an extra ingredient to the mix :
chemical x .
using ther ultra super powers , they 've dedicated their lives to fighting crime and the forces of evil .
the powerpuff girls !
hey , that 's a good name for them .
powerpuff girls , yeah !
i like that .
powerpuff girls !
it ll began when the silence of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound 
t was a sound like one never heard before in this part f the jungle .
it was a man cub !
i wuld 've obeyed my first impulse and walked away .
then it occurred to me .
oh , i knew there 'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal instinct , but ...
ten times the rains had come and gone .
he was a favourite f all the young wolf cubs of the pack .
no man cub was ever happier .
and yet , i knew that someday ... he would have to go back to his own kind .
shere khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him .
now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy 's father .
rama .
uh , come over here , please .
the man cub can no longer stay with the pck .
leave ?
there is no other way .
but-
but , rama , even the strength of the pack is n match for the tiger .
perhaps i can be of help .
you , bagheera ?
how ?
i know of a man village where he 'll be safe .
mowgli and i have taken many walks into the jungle together , so i 'm sure he 'll go with me .
so be it .
now there 's no tme to lose .
should n't we start back home ?
mowgli , this time we 're not going back .
i 'm taking you to a man village .
because shere khan has returned to this part of the jungle .
nd he has sworn to kill you .
kill me ?
he hates man .
well , maybe so .
we ll spend the night here .
things will look better in the morning .
man cub !
now come on , up this tree .
up you go .
tht limb way up there ?
that 's right .
i-
oh-
it 's too big around .
and besides , i do n't have any claws .
we 've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow .
i wan na stay in the jungl .
huh ?
you would n't last one day .
say now , what have we here ?
it 's a man cb .
a delicious man cub .
oh  go away and leave me alone .

i think that i better have a seat becase this is gong to be a very long story .
where i can make a demo like a pro , so i can put it in some big willie 's hnds and it 'll be ka-ching , ka-ching , bling bling bling ..
i thought it was bling bling .

mom , monique twig , electra breeze all talent show winners , all platinum .

i guess mr tycoon flew her to pars for dinner .

it 's ok cos who could ...
hey , toto , do you like that one ?

all right , he thinks it 's a hit .
go cheetahs , go toto .
yeah , let 's get through the tryouts first , a'ight ?
it do n't matter what no one says
cos down in my heart i got the power t make it all happen ...
hey , chanel , how did that test go ?
chuchie , you ca n't drop your grades now .
it 's ok .
i 'll walk you through the history of her story and you can walk me through your closet .
cheetah .
crikey , mackerel .
we 've spotted the wild cheetah girls doin ' their secret girl handshake .
what would they do if they were , say , the elephant girls ?
basta pasta , derek .
i 'm trying to keep it lite fm with you , derek .
or are you throwing in the towel cos you know yo 're gon na lose ?
see , that 's what i need to talk to you about .
we 're at 3:30 .
we use real instruments .
and help you 
i do n't think so .
i have to meet with mrs almanac about my history test .
i 'm not very comfortable with change .
but how 's everybody else ?
it 's cutting a little tight for me , but ...
ok , hambone .

keep believin ' , freshman .
i respect that .
but yo know you 're stll my boo .
he 's trying so hard not to lke you 
and i think now would be the proper time to point out that he is extra-specially cheetahlicious .
every time he bats those long eyelashes of his , it 's just a way to bring down the hammer on our success 
he even makes really embarrassing things look really , really cute .
ready , girls ?
let 's do this .
ok , here we go .
ok .
be quiet .
and sh 'd read me a story
it always was bout a princess in distress
and how a guy would sav her
and end up with the glory
i 'd lie in bed and think about
sittin ' in a dark .
cold .
dusty cellar
to come and set me free
h .
i will survive i knw somebody 's on my side
do n't wan na be no .
i 'd rather rescue myself
i can slay my own dragons
my knight in shining armour
is me
so i 'm gon na set me free
i do n't wan na be like cinderella
cold .
dusty cellar
for a handsome prince to come and save me
oh .
i will survive i know somebdy 's on my side
sittin ' in a dark .
cold 
dusty cellar
waitin ' for somebody
i do n't wan na be like someone waiting
for a handsome prince to come and save me
oh .
do n't wan na be no 
no one else
drinka ?
drinka , you still there ?
drinka ?
tell them .
i 'm all right .
i will srvive .
it 's just that ... when i see you girls , i see myself .
sing it , girl .
you 're the only one i ben dreamin ' of ...
you got ta slow down the disco fever , drinka .
when i see you girls , i see , like , little drinka clones .
galleria , when i look at you ,
i see a biracial , hip-hoppin ' version of me .
i see a hot , latin  spicy versin of me .
nd aqua , when i look at you ,
i see myself as if i was from the sassy south .
if you were what ?
everyone else does .
dorinda 's like me if i was shrimpy and white .
oh , yes , honey .
you are in .
but , drinka , like , do we actually have a chance of winning ?
yes .
well , hw you doin ' ?
i see that talent show banner outside , and i wan na be back walking ' these halls .
i still keep my hand in the community .
the jackal keeps it real .
and i have n't seen this much talent on tht stag since my graduation .
and now i 'd like to talk to you ladies about the next step in your career .
you see ,
and i think that thing mght just have spots .
let 's get down there .
we have spots .
cheetah girls ' manager , kid salsa .
pucci !
chanel , get your brother out of here .
hello , jackal johnsn .
i 'm galleria garibaldi .
i lso wrote cndrella , which i hope to record fr you in the near future .
excellent .
excllent .
so let 's set something up .
schedule .
you se , singing is just some , like , fun side thing for our girls .
they 're not prfessionals .
mom 
he 's one of the biggest record producers of my time , mother .
i read .
jackal johnson .

just in case , there 's my card .
your mom 's no joke .

bye , mr johnson .
thanks for droppin ' me off .
i live rght here .
oh , good .
ok .
dorinda seems like a real nice girl 
the only thing we know is she has a little sister .
d n't spoil ths day because you did n't get all you wanted .
at this rate , you 're headed straight to your room .
you 'll be just as talented after college .
50 times over .
then you would not have the tme to study , you would n't have the grades to get in , and tht , my dear , is what you call a paradox .
some colleges do n't even lok at grades .
some people do n't even go to college .
franco ?
papa , tell her i 'm not a knucklehead .
tell her i 'm not a pazza .
but you know what ?
you have to listen to your mother 's advice .
silly people do silly things , mom .
i get good grades .
strong bones and teeth .
ma , it 's not fair that we do n't get to talk to jackal .
honey , i think dorothea 's instincts are right on this one , k ?
i mean , you do n't need to be working with this jackal .
all that platinum and those heavy chains .
i mean , luc ...
oh !
he is always on ...
ma , can you not talk abot luc for ne second ?
i 'm really upset here .
really .
and i know what 's gon na cheer you up .
you gon na talk to madrina and tell her to change her mind ?
nope .
shopping .
ok .
yes .
what ?
what do you think about paris ?
mm-hm .
what ?
hold on , bubbles .
oh , i 'll think about it , all right .
oh , my god , bubbles , thank goodness it 's you .
my life is over .
she wo n't even let me call jackal .
well , you know what ?
ok ?
do n't they know that our futures are right hre ?
bella .
you bat those long eyelashs , and i say yes every time .
no , franco , she 's too young .
i have made so many mistakes in my life , and i 'm determined not to hve our daughter make the same mistakes i did .
she 's not going to mak the same mistakes .
but what if her dreams fall apart ?
cara .
no one is ever ready for their dreams to fall apart .
but when she 's older , we 're nt going to be there to help her put them back together .
it 's sick .
she dangled a shopping trip in my face , and then lowered the boom .
well , you know wht ?
wait a second 
hold on .
your mother and i ...
girl , hold on .
hold on .
thank you .
thank you so much .
but there are conditions .
first , i will be going to the meeting with you .
wow 
oh , today has been just so cheetah-crazy .
you were definitely a little loco tonight .
you were all i wrote the song cinderella ' and i 'm the founder of the cheetah girls .
yadda , yadda , yadda .
you know i did n't mean it that way .
i was just tryin ' to get in there before my mom does .
thank you very much .
have a wonderful day .
cheetah power .
it 's all over the school about your 15 minutes of jackal fame .
well , you know , we 're very fortunte .

my man handed marsalis a sugar pcket .
he is just so fine .
huh ?
you know what ?
lrk , momma .
wait , wait , wait .
yeah , cheetah .
hey !
now that we 're stars , we need to start acting like it .
well , stars do n't tlk with their mouth full .
read the label .
stars that know good food do .
i have to take a little bit of southern with me everywhere i go .
well , aqua , i have a problem with your table manners .
she took my ... she ...
but she took my hot sauce .
you guys , she 's right .
i got something on my face ?

closed on saturday ?
how am i supposed to pay for my lessons ?

hands up if yu know that you 're a star
girl power .
i 'm ready for jackal .
may i help you ?
yo , what time is it ?
a quarter past time to be on time .
you know , if dorinda is sitting there in the same cloths she wears every day ,
i think i 'm gon na scream .
do you want to walk ?
always wear comfortable shoes and put the heels in a bag .
thr they are .
my cheetah girls .
hi .
galleria s running a little late , mr johnson .
number one
mr johnson 's my father 
please do n't mama to death .
please .
sweetheart ...
let me give you one more piece of advice .
make the meeting .
soak your feet later .
girls , what do you say we take a tour of your new home , while we wait for the other divette to make her entrance ?
that 's a bad first impression for jackal .
it 's business , darling .
i know it 's business , mom .
excuse me , sir .
spend every summer on my grandfather 's place in dallas .
do n't mess with texas .
jackal johnson , i am so sorry that i 'm late .
you should 've seen the traffic .
yes .
i m sure this can wait .
this is jackal johnson .
i 'm sure he 's a very busy man .
it 's ok now  bubbles .
he 's never gon na work with us now .
but i got to pull it together .
when it boils down , that s what being a leader is all about .
thanks for having my back , chuchie .
you 're the one .
yeah , i 'm fine .
well , the deal 's done .
nothing .
well , i brought a cd of our song , and i just want you to listen to it .
my dog toto says it 's a hit .
really ?
nd i 've got some contracts here for th mama cheetah .
standard agreement .
standard revisions .
mom .
sorry .
okey-dokey .
well , here 's my checklist .
number one rcord a bumping demo .
number two have the record people fall in love with it .
and three make millions .
so , who 's down with that ?
and how long will it take to make this bumping demo ?
we do n't wan na pull the girls out of school , right ?
so , uh ...
schedule .
ok , here 's what i 'm thinking .
learn the song tuesdy .
run it wednesday , thursday , friday night 
mama , no , we do nt .
they have to tweak it ...
mom , no .
well , you 've got to grab each voice , and then digitise it in real time .
it 's a lot to do .
this is just one teensy-weensy little demo .
it 's not a soundtrack album .
all i need is one clean take , and then the bells and whistles happen right here .
so ...
we 'll be here .
that 's what i like to hear .
bam !
off the cheetah-meter .
yeah , and now the talent show 's down the drain .
drinka will understand .
if jackal says we 're rady , then we must be ready .
my day , your day a snake is still a snake .
where she gettin ' them glasses from ?
this week has been crazy , julia .
we trust you ll get our story right , but i will need photo sign-off .
you undrstand .
and i promise you will be short-listed as soon s the movie deal comes along .
movie ?
that 's what he said .
he just cracked me up .
it 's so annoying .
sit back down .
sit back down .
and the caller id beeped , and guess who it was ?
it was jackal !
come back .
i was telling you ...
it 's galleria 's .
and it 's written all over the walls .

yeah , save it for your book , chanel .
we liv here , and w go to school her .
look , all i 'm saying is someone needs to talk to her .
... and then i was like dude , relax .
and he 's all ...
anyway , uh , and before i go , i just want to say my mother ...

kids wan na party .
galleria stays a cheetah now and forever .
dorinda is a sweet panda .
come on , take it .
and chanel is a snow leopard from the frigid north .
ha ha .
our engineering department wants to create whole new identities .
glbal getdown is a worldwide marketing miracle .
well , hw does it look ?
well , you 'll b miked inside .
and the music 's on tape , anyway .
oh , i 'm sorry .

all around the world we go all around the world
nobody knows we do n't care where we go

i loved it .
it was great .
but that 's not what we sold the record company .

and this is what they 're paying for .

let 's , uh ...
let 's give these girls a chance to think about that world tour .
hm ?
all right .
why did n't you guys back me up ?
you mean rubber-stamp you .

they 're puppets .
i mean , now at least we could be down for the talent show .
and if we win , we can still have our demo .
do n't front , bubbles .
now you 're all gung ho for the talent show ?
maybe we need to do it this way first , so we can get our shot .
he knows the business .
it 's a job singing , dancing , and making people happy .
what 's wrong with that ?
it 's not your song , so you wan na walk .
you 're just mad because he wo n't do your material , right ?
our material , not that all around the world nonsense he was playing .
we make our decisions together .
yu 're just one person , and you 're not the boss of everything .
to mak ur dreams come true .
i wish i could believe in you , galleria , i relly do , but lately you 've been all about you 
i ca n't ...
we ca n't trust you ny more .
oh .
problem solved .
i 'm taking myself out of the equation .
oh , come on , galleria .
will you squash the drama ?
no .
really , do .
so you guys ar on your own , and you take the deal .
did we lose a chetah ?
afraid so .

ma , i 'm sorry .
lok , i 'll give it all back .

i trusted you .
i trusted you .
i trusted you to pay attention , ma .

it semed like they did n't matter .
calm down , calm down , calm down .
i 'll tell you later .
i just wanted to thank you for always keeping me in your dreams .
no matter where they tak us .
the cheetah grls are over .
oh , baby , no , no , n .
i worked on our look .
i bckled everything down .
i thought that we were all on the same page .
i am sure you did what was right .
but what 's right for you may not be right for someone else .
and it 's not worth losing a friendship over .
i mean , they want fame .
and then there are ways .
and i want fme the cheetah girls way .
the cheetah girls way or your way ?
oh , sweethart .
i tried so hard to protect you from getting your dreams crushed .
and let the people you love make their own chices .
and you 've got ta learn with your friends .
what difference does it make ?
and i said no .
i was ...
someone 's alwys
there behind
to catch us if we fall
but i 'm not ...
no , keep going .
it was n't entirely all that bad .
you likd it ?
yeah .
you had sombody writ you a cheetah jam ?
no .
i wrote t .
and all by myself .

i called earlir and officially withdrew my application .
i 'm taking th summer off .
and if you ever need  recommendatin as a babysitter , feel free to use my name .
i think i should probably retire .
i 'll send them over to everyone .

what 's this ?
just me being spontaneos .
yeah , i 'll see you soon .
no need to hold back , not me , no more
my heart ca n't say no
no stopping 'caus it feels right , feels rght
no stopping 'cause it feels right feels right
i 'm living on the ...
k !
stick to your role !
what was all that nonsense ?
just testing what eetu 's got in him
he 's in top frm .
no need to test him
these are the tactics for sndy :
everyone will b bunched up on the first few circuits
after 100 km or so , the pace should pick up
the steep climb at the end makes the race really tricky
and you with your famous sprint , break away on the last stretch
you 'll handle the kylmälä climb , huh ?
what kind f an answer is that ?
i did n't ask you
this is yor big break
what if i had a chance too ?
just think , if we quit , we could concentrate on training
more or less
jons !
delivery to the cable factory !
looks like i 'll soon be pedaling the streets myself my guys re already working like hell
k signing in !
very good ...
i promise .
bye
o.k .
let 's make up a job for you
you have twnty seconds , full blast
through kaisaniemi st to simo st and so on ...
then up the hill , past the post office
the one next to the sas hotel ?
yup , the ugly one
absolutely
vamos said tori amos
good looking , eh ?
student charm .
what 's wrong with student charm ?
summer crop , but when fall comes ...
nothing .
i 'll go !
you 're on
tough sport
and you ?
15 thousand a year
i do n't know
the new address is ...
hi
have you worked out the tactics for sunday ?
yup .
and i will
unlss your chain breaks , like last time
k !
the pool will close soon .
what are you talking about ?
your mania for statistics
you 've got to keep notes s you can tim yourself right
is n't that what coaches are for ?
yu have to prove your skills if you want to succeed
fucking hell , i 've had enough of this
while others are training down soth , w 're stuck in the backwoods
we 've got to get on the national team , this season
jesus , is that your attitude ?
if i 'm assisting you , i want to be sure yo 're serious
of course i am .
of course not .
the 0pen division district championships are about to start
these young riders will race 175 km on a 25 km circuit .. just when i fell asleep , they started at the fire station
it must have been the fifth time the sirens went off ...
... th final climb on the rout is a real killer
eetu !
did you ask her to come ?
of cours
we have a rough job ahead of us .
you know what she said abot you ?
what ?
let 's concentrate while we 're all charged up
we 'll se how the chain mates with their fresh team will ...
running out of drink
i 'll get you some son
want to win or not ?
we ca n't give in
coach will go berserk if we let them get way
k !
wait !
0nly 100 meters to the finish , we have mattson still in the lead
naakka pulls past in the nick of time 
to everyne 's surprise
the third man in is valve from kffen
congratulatons .
nineteen
you sem like a serious racer .
more serios than those clowns
i m setting up the national team for under twenty-ones in the fall
you might fit in the team .
sounds good
see you at th nationals
who would have ever gessed ?
but you dropped out .
eetu , there 's no excuse for screwing up
shut up , princess , or you 're canned
shit , what a loser !
give it a break .
it 's 50 km to home
you forgot your trophy
congratulations .
just a district championship .
in honor of your first victry
that 'll do
your rsting pulse is 42 .
how can it be so low ?
but your stress pulse is just about as high as it can get
it should n't go over 210 .
slow dwn a bit .
nce work !
sorry about losing it after the race 
forget it .
i quit
i ve had enough bullshit from mr .
ski
you ca n't quit now .
we can go some other time
fr two years i 've been helping you
now it 's my chance , and you quit the team
you 've still got mika and jani .
stuck in the peloton forever
no !
i 'm going fr a spin tonight anyhow .
i expect you 're coming too
why would you want to ride with  loser like me ?
eetu searching for k !
k receiving
k. i 'll come for a spin
but i wo n't have nything to do with mr .
ski
why are you here ?
eetu asked me to com .
yup .
i can leave , if you nsist
we ll just have to take it easy
no need to hold back because of me
k !
let 's get chargd .
a good idea
she 'll either come or she wo n't
did yu notice , last fall i was in the same shape as you 're in now
 knew i was in top form
yet i 'd build up the lactics way too easily
especially when climbing
started working on my ability to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics wer boiling
sounds extremely rogh
it was , for months
then suddenly a week ago- a breakthrugh !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i won the race
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's th only chance our team has
ok .
on three cnditions :
neither of you blows the other 's chances .
some program he 's been on all spring !
if i 'd sed the same method , i 'd lready be on the national team
you do n't mind that your best friend kept such a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat him once more- he would have killed himself .
t can be a good thing .
taking things seriously
eetu !
coach agreed we could train together for the nationals
i 've qut .
maybe it wold be a halthy change
no one asked you !
would we use your method ?
lf you want
in that case , count me in
off to bed early !
heavy session tomorrow
oona !
is he a ttal moron ?
this is similar to the 25 route the nationals will be raced on this year
i thought we were using your method
o.k .
each round i 'll join you on the climb
drive me as hard as you can .
like it 's the nationals
redy for a road kill ?
you 're minute behind on this round
how 's it going ?
not bad
i 'd prefr eetu alive tonight
so you came to play nurse .
have a problem with cyclng women ?
my first childhood memory is watching my mom win the nationals
i 've seen cycling women before
nice sannino .
hey , i do n't need a coach
but your body is perfect for cycling
i mean it .
is that just a professional remark ?
last year in vaasa , remember ?
i was a zombie afterwards
i see
yeah , but oona and i had planned to g kayakng tonight
looks like  'm too weak to hld a paddle
yup .
if he goes on with your methd , he 'll soon be good for nothing
it 's only temporary .
he 'll soon be back on the bll
it 's jst that i booked us a kayak .
i could fill in
i 'll be fine on my own .
no , no .
i can come
well .
why not .
where and what time ?
i 'll be there
got the entrance exam in july
it 's just hard to find time for reading
i am
at the beginning focus on pacing
the strength comes years later
yeah , yeah
same as in cycling , keep your body relaxed
now you 're telling me how to cycle , as well ?
arms stretched out
you lost it again .
concentrate .
are all cyclists that stiff ?
for god 's sakes , shut up !
god .
i 've figured it out
kind of far for a beginner
you think i 'm not fit enough ?
no , but ... shit , no !
where ?
directly behind us !
wher to ?
shit !
my trat .
hi .
two beers

sch a beautiful night .
sweet dreams .
yup .
how 's coaching coming alng ?
very wll .
eetu 's really getting there
oh , are they going steady ?
she 's ... a human being
what if i sewed all three of you some nice cycling shirts ?
silk nd elegance .
why not , if you feel like it .
and breasts ?
they 're there
but what size ?
it s important with a cycling shirt
have n't measured them !
an average girl with average breast sounds promising
hey , cut t out !
man and ape descend frm the same ancestors
man easily adjusts to hot climates
causes of death vary greatly cell which often stays inactive throughot its life cycle muscles start at the radius ...
listen , here comes a sre bet
seemingly lacking  will , yet able to react to- somatic and psycholgical changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
k calling eetu !
eetu receiving
are you exhausted ?
on the contrary , i feel great !
so what 's next ?
if it 's up to me , we cold even tighten up
remember when the team from järvnpää went training in the mines ?
oona receiving .
what mines ?
look out for the boat !
should w check it out ?
we need headlamps or something .
everyone shut up , or you 're dead !
k calling oona !
by the bay
can you stop by the tennis courts ?
sixty secnds .

stop saying ver .
check them out .
the biological background of man
they can both b classified as tropical diurnal animals
but in the cold he needs facilities sch as clothes to survive
hey !
last wrning .
the next to speak gets fired
k there 's a job for you at the national theater .. through the back , second window on the right .
no buzzer , of course
i 'm in for the nationals next week .
it may be good that you came
there 's an odd murmr in your heart
the heart is a strange organ , though .
making excessve exertion on the heart impossible .
i just read it
and rshed over to tell me ?
and that 's what we 'll do
i 'll test you at the same time
ca n't it wait until after the rce ?
until you 'v ben scanned , training s banned
yes !
one for oona , one for eetu , and one for k
prfect fit .
dense but not too tight
n space for air in between .
exactly
so when 's your next race ?
thank you 
you 're welcome
i thought i 'd wait until the nationals
but i 'm getting itchy feet .
no way .
no races until mr .
ski has tested you .
you ned to be in top form then
if k has worked out a plan for you , why not follw it ?
we 'll dive 3 km down to 350 meters
they come from caves far away
i came to train here last spring .
ok .
a small front gear and a 29- teethed in the rear
it 'll put all your muscle sets to use
i 'll shout when my heart rate goes over 200
we 'll change into light gear and keep pedaling through recovery
we 'll keep at it all week long
switch to light !
switch to heavy !
recovery !
a helluva hill !
is n't it ?
do i ?
yes .
and no wonder .
you were up all night
i 'll take it easy on the next round .

i 'll skp the next rund
eetu , let 's roll on
he recorded my txtbook

on saturday there 's the alleycat contest and a party afterwards
we could think of something then
after you 'v found 7 plant names n latin , head back downtown
the winner gets a paid day off and a kilo of rssian chocolate
dd you oversleep 
yeah , my muscles are totally jammed
what the hell jewel ?
who cares .
let 's find it and split the week between us
looks like a piece of cake .
ready ... go !
sometimes small change can make a big dfference
a lousy deal 
two weks into the job , and you already got five days off
now i can study for th exam .
exactly
who won ?
you always have an excuse
what 's the big dal ?
it 's just  game
if you do the same at the nationals , you 'll be the laughing stock
what the hell ?
i 'm fed up with his bitching
what do yu mean ?
what 's bugging him ?
ca n't deal with disappointments and takes it out on others
fel like dancing ?
sure
it 's raining cats and dgs
nothing bats swimming in the rain .
oh yes ,  lov it
i know the best place in town for a nght swim .
where is it ?
wan na go ?
yes !
i 'm leaving
yeah , right .
but i 'm leaving now
how about tomorrow ?
forget it .
forget the whole summer
nothing
listen .
sounds a bit like gears humming
the two of you will jst have to talk things thrugh
i 'll call him in the morning .
i can call him as well
no , i 'll talk to him first
i 'm so happy .
so am i
eetu called at 3 am .
great laps you 're doing !
i 've been wracking my brain over the tactics for the race
i had planned that eetu would help k to win
you can both race for first place
it would be great if one of you gets lucky
let 's go for a swim after work .
mr .
ski is totally mind-boggled .
he thought you were history
you called on saturday .
for a while i suspected you were hitting on ona behind my back
but i knew you would never do a thng lke that to me
especally at a time like this
that 's what i thought
if you see him ...
then wht ?
you need eetu 's help
and he needs mine just the same .
he called me
apologized for his behavior .
and ?
about us ?
about us of course
why wold i lie to him .
i feel stupid enough as it is
h 'll make me pay for this
sure  if you did n't have the guts to tell him
and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta
your heart has to be operated on
is it a major operation ?
yes , and difficult
if you were on the ntional team , maybe ...
 have the nationals on sunday .
and i forbid you to take part
consequently , the ventrcles contract
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
am i bothering you ?
looks like my exam went really well 
thanks again for the tapes .
why not
should we go some place ?
i have to finish this
do n't wrry
are you mad at me ?
i did n't mean it exactly that way .
i am what i am
here they are , 40 hungry racers , ready to give their best shot ...
a few names stand out as promising
how 's it going ?
and you 
busy as hell .
is the national team all settled ?
one man missing .
my guys will settle it on the road
keep an eye on this promisng rder , only 19 years old
oona !
cme on chain mates !
we 're dong great time
any drink left ?
lf i had , i would n't give you any
thanks
they 're coming !
k !
just go !
will you be all right ?
i 'm glad to see you ating again .
why am i packaged up like this ?
that 's why you 've got to keep still
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a god chance of recovery
you can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spinal shock , as the doctors believe- you should be moving yur legs in a month 's time
but you 'll never becme a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a relief
i told them  'd ask you first
we 're in  hurry
hi !
never seen parallel bars this long
i asked the staff to set them up
i left it to the very last moment , but i came anyway
with the under twenty-three national team
congratulations
i would n't have made it without you .
just thank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages
i 'm glad yo made it
i think oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can manage on my own .
certainly not
hey , why do n't you leave
will you just get lost !
it 's coming along
but they wo n't let me cycle for a year
strange how distances take twice as long as they used to
i passed the exam .
by the skin of my teeth .
congratulations
it must have been the sure bt
do nt you remember ?
seemngly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly ...
unexxc ... unexpctedly .
unexpectedly
i want to apologize
i really did n't treat you right
that was then
just about to do it
a socket shock
and suddenly socked him into a real cerebral high
growing his mind into the kind
and a smile upon his face
a guy that crazd and amazed and otherwise dazed
totally together computer in tennis shs
a guy that crazd and amazed and otherwise dazed
that turned-on , uptight , flat out-of-sight

dean higgins , today , a cmputer can hardly b considered a luxury .
oh , very well 
now , unfortunately ,
medfield has quite a long list of necessities , and a computer just does nt have a very high priority n that list .
now , it 's not that i 'm old-fashined .
yo all know tht i have an open ear for progrss , and we do all that we can .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we went to the expense of live frogs .
we 're not dragging our feet , quigley .
why , i just put an order in today for two garbage disposals and an electric dishwasher
anything yet , bradley ?
how 's he doing ?
yeah , that figures .
thanks .
you just do n't understand the problem .
do you know what the telephone bill alone is here every month ?
i do n't wnt to hear about state .
yeah , but do you realize that they give an entire course in computer technology ?
now , i do n't like to draw comprisons , gentlemen , but if we want to keep abreast of th times and raise our cademic average ,
we have got to modernize .
modernization is n't everything .
yes , uh , regent deeds .
thank you vry much .
gentlemen , i , uh ,  wuld n't like this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are down to the nitty-gritty on our budget .
why , we raffled off everything on the campus but the women 's gym .
it 's tough , tough , tough .
unrest .
oh , uh , that prt about the unrest , that 's , uh , that 's off the record , mrs. winifred .
so , quigley , i 'm sorry , but i 'm certan that you understand our problem .
that 's it .
now , for the next itm on the agenda ...
us .
well-put , dean .
leonard ...
the not-so-gifted students ' needs are just as great as those of the gifted ones .
now , um , quigley , we do have certain ne'er-d-wells that must be seen to .
probation is no substitute for catching the interest of the student , for firing his imagination .
come on , quig .
thattaboy .
john colligan , roger demney ,
henry fathinger ,
... myles harris ,
adam jervins ,
keith richards , dexter reilly ...
dexter , it 's not funny .
... robert ross ,
sliver roth .
he went through all the s 's .
hey , that 's right .
oh , yes , of course .
richard schuyler .
he 's sick .
you know , quig really cares , but the guy ca n't even reson with him .
wll , swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive higgns right over the edge .
you guys must be dreaming .
the guy who 's selling it wants 10 grand .
a.j .
arno .
i mean , i think if we went down there and talked to him , we could get him to donate it to the college .
well , i do n't know about that .
dexter , you jst cleaned up at night .
arno would n't even remember you .
kind of .
you know , that 's not too bad an idea .
no trouble at all , wexler .
i mean , i love that school .
well , bliev me , if i did n't give them all that money ,
no .
maybe i can work something out .
look , just give me a little time , huh ?
you know , i like you kids .
i like the idea of a student delegation coming to se me .
makes me fel good ...
thanks .
goodbye .
goodbye , boys .
thanks a lot for giving us your time , mr. arno .
well , a.j .
arno never forgets an old employee .
um , it 's ... it 's dexter .
ah , yes , dexter .
yeah , just about , sir .
all right .
hey , they did pretty good with the horses .
750 is n't bad .
that crap table figure okay ?
looks lik a real good day for applejack 
yeah , real good .
incidentally , do n't send that 20 grand to medfield .
do n't you think ...
do n't worry about it .
146 , right .
easy through the door , you guys .
easy .
right in there .
number 125 .
tke it easy .
what a slave driver .
yeah , if he 'd been in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they d have made it .
you know , it 's a great idea doing somethng for the school , but next time let 's d something easy , like hijacking a cubn airliner 
yeah .
professor , can we just take a few seconds off ?
h , sure .
take as much time as you want .
uh , dexter , there 's a box of tools in the back of my car .
wold yu get that for me , please ?
sure .
right away , professr .
good morning , dean .
good morning , dean .
hi  deano .
oh , hello , there , dean higgins .
of course , we 're not really set up here yet , but very son .
well , that 's wonderful .
i see .
and you will understand
we must withhold our yearly cash contribution .
yours in the interest of higher ducation  a.j 
arno.
you can say that again .
and i 'm gon n tell you ths much , quigley ... in the future , i 'm gon na be watching them 
but you ca n't blame the boys , sir .
oh , good faith , bad faith , who cares ?
they 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
we still have the computer .
you know , i do n't like to brag , but if it had n't been for the fact that i used to work there ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmetic and logic , and output .
and , uh , even though it 's an imtation , in mny ways , the machine we 've developed can oprate mor efficiently than we can ourselves .
now , in the past couple of weeks ,
i 've been , uh , working on a small expriment , uh , which is intended to show how we can be replaced by a computr .
hy ... this may be a way of getting rid of dan higgins .
we live in hope , dexter .
now , let 's suppose that your parents are going away for the weknd , and they leave you the following instructions ...
all right ?
and being the conscientious and reliabl young people
i know you to be , you promptly forget to do it .
now , this is a ran gauge , and it 's , uh , sitting on  roof of a building .
the memory bank , in turn , activates the electronic circuits , the window closes , the door opens ... hopefully the cat comes in ... and the automatic telephone goes into action , right ?
the rain ... falls .
computerized male voice :
this is s recording .
hmm .
that 's enough of that .
thank you .
now , another very important feture is its infallible memory .
and they were kind enough to send us this magnetic tap , which will call forth from the computer solutions to a series of problems that would occur on a simulated flight to the planet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center panel  please .
hey , quig .
hey .
well , it seems like our flight to saturn will be a little delayed .
this is dean higgns .
now , as many of you know , we came in 36th last year .
i do n't know .
what happened , professor ?
it , uh , should be replaced , but  ca n't get over to capital electronics today .
oh , that 's okay .
i 've got nothing to do .
oh , yeah , but i know all that stuff .
cars and buses going from place to plac .
one guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes .
i got it all , prof .
yes , i 'm sur you do have it all , dexter , but if i were you , i would look it over again this afternoon .
aw  honest , professor .
it wuld n't do any god .
i 'm up to here with it .
let me go to mrshfield .
believe me , the drive nd fresh air will do me good .
it cold n't be a .
the answer to the last two questions was a .
would never hav three a 's in a row .
it 's got ta be b or c .
i have n't seen a c for a long time .
got to be c .
that 's three a 's in a row .
that 's impossible .
3 at 8-02-30 .
applejack pompey palace ,
dexter ?
dexter , are you okay ?
nah , yu were beeping .
burping ?
no , beeping .
w ... nothing .
well , there must be a short in it somewhere .
i had to call in these computer people .
well , move along , boys 
now , ladies and gentlemen , this is a speed test .
and that means if you have trouble with any question , skip it and move on to the next on because you 'll be graded on the total number of questions you answer correctly .
you may begin .
dexter , come on .
funny guy .
i tell you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a doctor .
that 's ridiculous .
he did n't cheat , dean higgins .
now , we usually allow an hour and a half for that test .
dexter finished it in 41/2 mnutes , and he did n't make a mistake .
man 
yes .
listen , at this rate , you 're gon n faint in front of all those people .
dexter , it is n't that easy .
things are n't the same .
you have  rsponsibility now .
yeah .
yah .
do n't worry about it , man .
there re going to be 37 million viewers , quigley .
no question .
oh , mayor collins .
nice to see you , mayor .
ha !
it 's the mayor .
i tell you , quigley ,
ha !
mayor collins and there 's councilman coper over there and supervisor straight and there 's , h , oh , he 's not anything .
hello , dean !
what 's h doing here ?
well , i do n't like it .
every time i see him , i have to hear about his building prgram .
it 's enough to make you sick .
hello .
i 've been harng great things .
well , you know , at medfield  the scholastic ...
nice to see you .
i would hve gotten over here sooner , but i 've been tied up planning our new science building .
you know , quigley , sometimes i think i should have taken up contracting instead of education .
no .
i- mean , he 's all booked up .
uh-huh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies and gentlemen .
oh , i 'd better take my seat .
i 've been invited to sit in the control room .
in the control rom .
i tell you , he 's trying to steal that boy away from us .
i 'm sure of it .
you do n't understand him , quigley .
the man is greedy .
he s up to his throat in stte money , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each of our learned guests will be allowed 3 questions .
our first questions will be from dr. rufus schmidt , head of the department of higher mathematics at purdue university .
dr. schmidt .
well , i ...
i , uh , i guess  am .
i see .
mr. reilly , using the fundamental theorem of advanced calculus , and applying the formula that the squre of a distance from the origin to p
is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared .
yo see ?
he 's getting his confidence .
your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th powr would be 10,604,499,373 .
the square rot of that product would be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct .
hey .
man :
i must say , that was really something .
yes , i suppose it was , bt would n't it speed things up a bit if we could save the applause till the end ?
yes , uh , i 'm sure the audience would be glad to comply .
good .
your third question , dr. schmidt .
gentlemen , plase .
i hope you 're aware that i 'm perfectly equipped to go into other fields .
of curse .
uh , perhaps now w could hear from , uh , dr. seigel , professor of foreign languages at lansing university .
getting his confidence is one thing , but this is ridiculous .
i liked him better the way he was .
we 're awating the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
we 're awaiting th arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
it promises to be exciting , so stay with us as our cameras follow dexter reilly on his journey through gotham .
there 's been s buzz of excitement around the big city this past week , ladies and gentlemen .
everywhere you go , you hear the same question ... is dexter reilly for real ?
should be any second now .
and there he is !
well ...
uh , mr. reilly 's being greeted by two young lades who came all the wy from yonkers just to greet him .
this is priscilla cummings ...
queen of the yonkers botanical society ,
i always knew if he had any brains , he 'd be dangerous .
look , i know dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind of understandable .
look at that crowd , quigley .
what a boon for the college .
why could n't the boy have been carrying a medfield pennant ?
do n't you think that would have been pushing it a little  sir ?
yes ?
from universal encyclopedias .
oh , tell him we already have a set .
he 's no salesman , sir .
he 's the president of universal encyclopedia .
the president ?
sure .
the quiz program where they ask the questions from the encyclopedia , and they give away $ 100,000 ?
it s a real pleasure .
thank you .
who are yo ?
who m ...
that 's good 
i like that .
who am i ?
and i like that set of encyclopedias of yours .
displaying again his remarkable intellectual prowess ,
dexter reilly was able to converse with each delegate to the u.n. in his own tongue .
they 're wating for him in the security council .
earler today  dr. suzuki of the international school of languages stated that with s computer-type brain such as dexter reilly has , he 'll soon be able to master every languag the world has ever known .
i think he 's given s good indication of that today .
professor mertins , we need that boy .
he can wrap up that college knowledge program for us .
of course , but we ca n't take any chances .
parsons ?
uhh , just a minute , quigley .
tremendous .
well , t-ths is rather important , sir .
it 's about the college knowledge program .
dexter will chew up those encyclopedias .
it seems that mr. van dyke is explaining the operation to the boy wonder .
only maybe we do n't have dexter .
what ?
find out when his plane arrives !
quigley , how could you let this happen ?
the first operation of cuttng the diamond in two exact halves is the most important .
i beg you ...
wh-iii-pppp !
yeah , mr. arno , but i 'm kind of busy right now .
well , i hated to interrupt you , but i 've got some good news .
oh ?
to what i 'm gon na do .
i tell you what , i 'll pck you up at the airport .
how 's that ?
that sounds fine .
pardon us , boys .
come on , you guys .
how are you ?
let me get this .
now , if you can stop by the school , i 'm sure that we could take care of that .
well , you see , dean , there is a problem .
a problem ?
well , do n't get me wrong .
i like it .
i like the guys and the teachers and i even like you .
excuse me .
is n't that wonderful ?
dexter !

market doodle ?

oh , dexter , can i have a word with you ?
i think this will be an ideal tme to discuss it .
i 'm sorry , dean , but i 'm afraid we 'll have to talk about t some other time , okay ?
well , i really think we should talk about it tonight .
sorry .
impossible .
not yet .
not yet ?
is n't this professor stanley 's house ?
it 's a rid !
all the exits are guarded .
we urge everybody to remain calm .
it is my duty to inform you of your constitutional rights .
you have the right to have an attorney present before and during all questioning .
for those of you ...
buster ?
my name is not buster .
this is just what i thought it was 
ha !
how i ever let you lead me into such a mess !
lad you ?
i can remember the time you stole breakaway jones from me .
hey , come on .
do n't be depressed , will you ?
spending the night in jail ai n't so bad .
look at me .
it 's not the alumni that 's trying to steal dexter .
man :
you know , i do n't understand you .
 never once met a guy who could pick eight races in a row , never .
dexter , yo and me could have the world at our feet here .
collingsgood :
you just want him for that college knowledge program , and yu know it .
you know ... everyone 's just out for himself 
oh , yu men those guys ?
who are you thinking of , mr. walski ?
oh , com on , will you , kid ?
do n't you think everybody thinks about themself ?
there , you see ?
just the boy .
oh , u-uh , dexter , tell the boss , uh , not to forget i 'm in here , huh ?
uh , dexter , do you suppose that you could , uh ...
dean higgins , i do n't know what i 'm gon na d .
will you all shut up for just one minute ?
you owe $ 2.50 more .
wait  minute .
wait a minute !
now , if you 'll all promise to get ut of here ,
 'll pay the $ 2.50 myself .
what 's happening ?
the jailbird .
thanks for bailing me out , guys .
yeah  sure .
yeah , i ...
but i guess the worst thing i did was to forget who my friends really were .
aw , come on .
what are frends for ?
i 'd just like to say tht i 'm sorry .
come on .
what are friends for , man ?
annie ...
that 's okay .
come on , let 's go .
that 's fantastic .
you did the s 's in ...
8 minuts and 18 seconds .
that beat the r 's by 91/2 seconds .
and there were 1,200 pages in the s 's and only 1,000 in the r 's .
i picked up 22.68 % 
i 'll get it 
is dexter here ?
yeah , he 's just boning up
for the college knowledge program .
time .
page 4 , paragraph 16 , line 398 , word 4,001 .
hi , professor .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't mean to interrupt anything .
yes .
well , it 's just , uh , a little thing , dexter .
it , uh , seems that we need , uh , three more members for the panel .
i see .
well , you know me , quigley , i 'm not a proud man .
if , uh , dexter does n't like my suggestions , then he can have anybody he wants .
who dos he want ?
hmm .
schuyler , henry , and myls .
schuyler , henry , and myles ?
and i m afraid that if we tried t force anyone else on him , he might ..
y
i mean , we want to keep that boy happy .
but schuyler , henry , and myles .
but the answer to part one is the battle of thermopylae ,
well , lockhurst has answered two parts out of three correctly .
okay , schuyler , you answer this one .
what ?
it does n't look good if i answer all the questions .
phidias , who did a statue of athena , and praxiteles , who specialized in human figures , then ther was myron , who sculpted the figure of a discus-thrower , kind of like the best thing he ever done .
okay .
you got it ?
gentlemen , you have 20 seconds .
i think  misunderstood the question , sir .
w
who 's that guy , mrlin ?
not merlin , myron .
gentlemen , your time is almost up .
i think i misunderstood the answer , sir .
you did ?
that 's the last time i 'll do that .
w have time for one more question dircted t our medfield panel .
gentlemen , these are the works of th famous marcel duchamp as found in the collection of the philadelphia museum of art .
thank you , miss ackerman .
number one is called portrait of chess players.
it was painted in 1911 .
and number three is called
tht 's right on the button .
very god .
that answer is absolutly correct .
so ntil then , good night to you from universal encyclopedia , your passport to knowledge .
you guys were great .
we 're gon na win .
a nude descending a staircase.
boy , that 'd never make playboy .
oh , dean collingsgood , nice to see you .
you 're scouting , i imagine 
and i would like to say right at the beginning ,
if you had an ounce on integrity , you 'd withdraw him .
withdraw whom ?
it 's unfair .
he 's an intellctual freak !
unfortunately , this year , medfield has the horses .
are those the horses ?
for 10 points each , could you give us the highest and lowest pints in south america ?
the highest point is mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feet .
that is absolutely correct .
hey , i did n't try to get him arrsted , yo knw .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon na be  raid ?
i want t hear this .
some f that consumption was in the liquid form .
can you give the phrase in slang for the central unfrozen portion in a container of frozen cider ?
that 's absolutely right .
applejack .
hey , boss , i had nothin ' to do with this .
i swear .
what was i talking about ?
mr. arno , if yu could please relax for just a little ...
out , out .
but ...
this is applejack .
 do n't want a trace of that operation left 
shut down ?
why ?
what 's the matter ?
whatever you say .
we got ta put that kid on ice .
look , we need time to figure this out .
hello ?
i want the pompey palace on franklin road in charlottesville .
yeah .
you know , if that kid hd nt been stopped , he 'd have mentioned every joint i own in this state .
take him out to the hancock place .
right .
no , i do n't know the area code 
hello , dexter .
go ahead .
start the car .
you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happened , lieutenant .
he was supposed t be at my house about 8:30 last night , and he never showed up .
and nobody s seen him since .
well , we 've checked all over .
he has n't been in an accident nor has he been arrested .
lieutenant , i wonder if he could hav had an attack of amnesia .
could be miles away by now .
mm-hmm .
i 've alerted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his car .
and if they do n't pick him up pretty soon , then i 'm afraid we 'll have to suspect foul play .
foul play , huh 
well , that 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean collingsgood over at state ?
oh , do nt you see it , quigley ?
i mean , f dexter is n't back tomorrow for that college knowledge program , then springfield state will get the $ 100,000 grant .
uh , wait a minute .
wait a minute .
the dean of a college , a kidnapper ?
well , you do n't know him .
you do n't know him at all .
the man is rthless .
he gets all that taxpayrs ' money and still he 's ruthless .
y
yeah .
i see .
i guess that 'll b all for now 
pete ..
i just do n't think
animls 740 , tables 600 , amusements 500 .
applejack , charlie ...
gee , ll those places and always applejack.
he did n't have the foggest idea what they were .
maybe it does n't mean anything .
then all of a sudden , he mentions applejack , and wham !
just like that , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses through a book on an oriental language , and then speaks it fluently , remembering every accent .
how com he dos n't remember this ?
pete , it does n't make sense .
unless ... nless he 'd never read it or seen it or heard it before .
it was in the computer .
and now he blurts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missng .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
appljack .
... for something , something he does n't want anybody to know about .
hi .
i do n't care who believes it , just s long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell them if they look up these places , they 're gon na fnd out what applejack is up to .
and the reason why we know applejack is rno is 'caus it came from the computer into dxter 's head .
and that 's why dexter does n't remember it .
come on .
that 's why pet remembered that applejack was arno .
arno ?
yeah , becus it was the only thing he could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered .
because he could n't ?
exactly .
well , uh , thank you , mr. schuyler .
sure .
oh .
i 'll be sure to notify you .
ever seen anything lke that before ?
let 's hit this tape .
w
what do we do now , pete ?
well , if ther 's any drty work to be done ,
let 's follow his stooge .
i hope you 're right .
licorice skull .
$ 50 on licorice skull in the 5th .
yah , that 's it .
sure .
hey , how 'd yu ever get the kid to pick the horses ?
i just got the word ...
oh , gee .
i was just gettin ' a good strek goin ' .
the boss sys he can not lve , not with that memory of his .
hey , how 'bout navajo lake 
we weight the kid down , throw him in .
he goes down and down and down .
nobody 'd ever find him .
maybe we could get some fishing in afterwards , hh ?
the season do n't open for a couple weeks yet .
we ll take a chance .
good .
beautiful .
but let me get a couple more winners .
what about dxter ?
we got ta realize that this could be dangerous .

one second .
oh , they got there .

you mean they really are painters ?
i guess it 's okay .
they check out .
this could be murder !
not if we do n't panic .
just keep on painting the house like we know what we 're ding , and keep your eyes on those windows and be ready , oky ?
he could be in one of those rooms without us knowing it .

the cast of so random !
sticks together throgh thick and thin .
why are we dressed like this ?
because we 're on a mission .
stop shocking me .
i have n't yet mastered my powers .
my hair itches .
ow !
what was that for ?
gilroy , why do n't you ever sk questions like ,
or what 's your favorite dog combination ?
labradoodle .
chocopoo , which is a combination
it 's the ice cream that licks itself .
yeah , back to the dirt .
in the latest issue of tv weekly with this handsome fell on the cover ,
tawni hart is a drama queen prone to throwing diva fits .
what 
i did n't say that .
i know .
i just made that up .
are you thinking about it ?
oh my gosh , she 's actually thinking about it .
you 're actually thinking about it .
actually , it 's a bald cap ,
i did shave my head .
f i do n't have the best hair ,
stop thinking about it .
i did n't say anything .
but yo were thinking .
what were you thinking about ?
tawni and i were like this .
and the pretty one !
let 's think of this studio as a school .
you 've got all these great ideas and you 're full of nthusiasm .
well , knock it off !
i ca n't believe you stabbed me .
you stabbed yourself .
you just stood there and watched , which is just like stabbing ,
so it 's really yor fault .
here , you need to rinse it off .
'cause the way i read it was more like ,
that is the worst tawni impression  've ever heard .
so that face you made .
i know that face .
no no no .
i mean , we went to the movies once 
but it was just as friends .
it 's just ...
do you need a tissue ?
i 'm good .
nico .
i love grady , but grady needs a really classy girl .
he has really refined tastes .
i guess we know what the pan 's used for .
he made me an omelet yesterday .
because i heard he mde quite an impression on sonny .
he did ?
how long is this show ?
okay .
chad dylan cooper .
i did n't give you any --
chad dylan cooper just stole my yogurt 
oh , my gosh , chad dylan cooper just stole my yogurt !
but , gilroy , if you really wan na know ,
the truth is ...
chad is in a very exclusive relationshp
with somebody very special to him .
oh my gosh , what happened to you ?
i 'm --
yo , baby !
let 's get back to celebrating me , all right ?
hey , guys , i hired you .
at least there 's still one chad standing .
huh ?
there 's gon na be a weigh-in ?
if i had known that , i would n't have eaten all the cookie dough .
we re not gon na dish out each other .
and she 's -- she 's --
please give it up for chad dylan cooper !
what 's up , y'all ?
what are you doing here ?
i 'm hre promoting my book .
you wrote a book ?
so i could get your reaction to this .
lt 's rll the clip .
do they really ?
and even the best of intentions .
just because you wish for something
does n't make it so .
whoa !
did n't know you wer being filmed , huh ?
apparently , someone at mackenzie falls
does nt like sonny very much .
if i were to wait for things to be in context 
still , it seems the two of you
have a little something something going on .
care to comment ?
yep , right after this commercil break .
well , we are .
let 's go .
you 're leaving me here by myself ?
yes .
i also have other talents .

rubber pencil !
i ca n't believe gilroy tried to do that to us .
he 's a jerk .
i ca n't believe i read that book for nothing .
you know , tawni and i made a pact earlier
i think that we should probably do the same thing .
okay , fine .
i did n't read the book 
do we ?
i learned this move .
 did n't win little miss flexible for nothing .
okay .
... 'cause we are gon na stop talking about you

so random !
chad dylan cooper , dancing , nine-year-old girl .
s who wants to boogie ?
yes .
yes , we still do it .
we paint everything ... the jaguar , the fish .
only aftr five days ... .
first we put paint ... then charcoal .
about fur or five days old .
yes , i did .
i do n't remember , it was too long ago .
kbern was kind of a sad boy , but a good person .
one was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had families .
it leads to suffering , pain , danger and death !
we do n't have ... any written education ... we get ur knowledge from our parents and families .
they teach us about our destiny , about being an indian ... being a human being , and bout life .
if we do n't respect our eldrs .. we 'll be lost .
during the republic they tried ... to change us into whites ovrnight .
we were confused ... not knowng how to live in this new situation ... and after the years ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defnd ourselves .
but how ?
we 'll se if we will have to operate .
we teach our children to read .
we want t learn only the good things from the whites .
that 's why we teach our chldren , so that wo n't happen .
yes 
i liked it very much , i was very happy 
i have missed him a lt since i lost him .
and nw , when i saw him ...
i was very happy indeed .
i 'v been feeling so sad ... and this was great for me .
it was great to se him alve .
when i saw him moving ...
he was steering the canoe .
the water was very low .
whn the canoe passed over a crocodile ... it went crazy and attacked my father ... right at his neck .
in this village ... a lot of things have changed since your last visit .
but for me the saddest thing is that i 'v lost my husbnd .
i miss the safety he gave me 
i remember long ago , one night he came into my hut ... and the next morning we were husband and wife .
he was a very good persn , vry kind and hard workng .

holy smurf , look at these berries .
god !
hey there , lazy !
hey !

oh , i had no clue .
no one tells me anything .
there we go .
smurfy hollow ?
the very ntion of a headless horsemn ...
the other smurfs do n't know how to think these things through .
just one more bucket , then i m going home !
what was that ?
must have been a dead tree branch .
it 's quite common in windy conditions .
just relax , brainy .
no !
i m the headless horseman !
it ca n't be !
it worked !
it 's a berry bonanza !
whose medal will be clanking ' now ?
that 's right , little smurfberry !
brainy ?
oh , do n't you wrry , he 'll be fine .
my glasses !
it dfinitely smurfed m to safety .
all right , smurfs !
lazy , how many smurfberries did you get ?
and what did you get , vanity ?
even handsomr ...
hey !
you again !
stop it !
not my cornucopia .
and you , greedy ?
brainy !
you 've outdone yourself ths year !
think again , papa .
gutsy ?
how do you like them smurfberries ?
well , this is unexpected .
consmurfulations , gutsy !
this is unbelievable .
and hw about a victory dance ?
gutsy !
thank you !
like what ?
where 's brainy ?
that 's very strange indeed .
do you think he got lost ?
wht if he fell in a ditch ?
maybe a legless wasel got him .
you know what , i think i might have spotted briny in the woods arlier .
see you .
oh , for smurf 's sak , why did he have to run away like that ?
come on , brainy !
hey , wht are you doing here , lass ?
i thought i 'd help you look for brainy .
where 'd you see him , exctly ?
by smurfy rock ?
more ...
stop grilling me , woman !
i ca n't take it anymore !
it was jst a wee little prank , that 's ll 
it may have involved a fake headless horseman ..
what ?
i never should have gotten out of bed this morning ...
oh , my smurf , briny !
well  i 'm trapped 30 feet in the air in a sinister gargamelian cage .
yes , come on , come on .
let 's get him down from there and get out of this creepy forst .
yes , a classic gargamel tactic is to set additional traps around ...
we do n't have time to overthink this !
gutsy !
not in smurfy hollow .
i hate to further complicate things , guys , but the headless horseman is out there .
searching .
without senses .
i know it defies all rational xplanations .
gutsy ?
okay , fine .
it 's not all my fault !
oh , boy .
what are we gong to d ?
i have an idea .
but it 's gon na take guts and brains .
do you think you two could work together ?
two drops would be bad .
three drops ...
ca n't you see that i 'm working ?
get off of me , you frenzied feline !
what did you say ?
how many ?
three !
i do nt know where they are .
gutsy , do you have enough momentum ?
aye , smurfette !
i 'm giving it all she s got .
yes !
gutsy , it 's crucial that you shift your weight at exactly t minus zero .
it 's also making me sick !
brace yourselves !
oh , n , smurfette is still up there !
it 's okay .
we still have tim before gargamel shows up 
azrael !
hello , smurfs !
wait .
you know , there 's this magical new device called a toothbrush !
hey , gargasmell !
now 's your chance !
stp !
i 'm horribly ticklish !
what do we do ?
i think we might be done here 
goodbye !
it was an honor smurfing with you .
what ?
headless !
crikey !
he really does exist !
wizards and chldren first !
we 're doomd !
since when do you believe in legends ?
since they started chasing me with flaming pumpkins ...
so you 're saying ...
lf we can get to the bridge , we 're safe !
brilliant !
you 're a genius !
ys , we will !
but we need better transportton !
climb aboard the red-eye !
we did it !
azrael , look at that !
he ca n't exit the hollow !
azrael !
get off of me !
let go , you foul furball !
what is a water-ball ?
azrael , are you dead ?
that 's nice and all but i think briny should have it .
i just want to say i 'm sorry .
for scaring you like that and all .
i tried so hard every year , nd you always won .
i 'm sorry , too .
seems to me , laddy , that we let winning a medal get in the way of what 's really important here .
that 's true .
see , you guys , when the two of you help each other , well , that 's what family is all about .
negative , i have not exactly been playing fair .
n , come on now , lad !
no , you won .
you should have it .
you take it !
no , it has to be you !
no , it has to be you !
just take it !
lazy ?
 win !
exhausting !
i love this wee little lad !
too much momentum !
very nice .
good job getting them home sfe .
i guess i should chnge yu back now .
you must be hungry .
okay , let 's go find vanity 's hat .
so the headless horseman was a goat ?
just to set the record straight ,
really ?
not even one little ...
hold me !
it 's just  bat , hefty .
give a guy a break .

except for the actvity up in the hayloft , the farm was pretty quiet that morning .
they could sleep through anything .
but  lot of the other animals were awakened by all that scurrying overhead .
some of them just accepted it .
some were pretty annoyed .
but the mood was very different up in the hayloft .
she was determined to be a good mother and never yell at her kittens .
but that approach would not last very long , because milo  one of her kittens , was trobl from the very beginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that 's not a good idea !
com back here , milo !
you 're a strange-looking cat , milo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , all right , a dog .
but , um , really , deep down insde , we 're all cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barked .
the kittens were now big enough to leave the hayloft and see the wrld beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was the first to start calling out for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to mlo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down there is the river .
everyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
milo asked .
is this ?
oh !
ah !
milo , get back here , his mother demanded .
but milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo mowed .
i think so , mlo said .
all right , be careful , his mother ordered , nd began swimming .
all right .
i 'm not going to yell , his mother said .
now dry yourself off , like this :
and follow me back home 
that was fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
get over here !
the months passed , and the farm was humming with the sounds of summer .
milo had some new hiding places he could n't wait to try out .
otis sniffed around the yard for a while .
you 're in the pipe , milo .
try again .
cat 's in the can !
and milo slipped off t another hiding place .
it was n't easy fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tried a hardr spt .
but otis found him there too .
now milo needed a brilliant idea .
aha .
he thought of a place where otis could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but milo wonderd if it was really worth the trouble .
milo and otis went to see what all the commotion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rang ot :
and all the hens left in a clucking flurry because that was gloria talking , a young chicken who had scratched and pecked her way to the tp rung of the henhouse .
gloria had a good reason for wantng to be alone .
there it is , fellas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it finally happened .
is she staying at hme with it or s she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kick it back to you , otis ?
milo asked .
otis said .
i kicked it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how long do we have to stick around this henhouse ?
until gloria comes back .
maybe you do n't realize it , milo , but this is a major day for me because ...
well , maybe you do n't realize that this is the day i ve become a watchdog .
some strange noises brought milo out of the henhose .
what was all this abut ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
come here  otis , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , come on .
t that moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved t , the frog croaked .
and outside , milo and otis suddenly rmembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis growled .
just try somethng .
prbably rotten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird nimal .
the noise attracted a group of local snoops looking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're having a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your mommy 's a chicken .
the thr animals tld otis he 'd better take the chick to gloria , and quickly , which he did .
but the chick kpt coming back to otis .
now go bck to gloria .
do you understand ?
woof , th chick peeped .
woof , woof , mmmy .
okay , you want to be a dg ?
otis barked .
you 've got to be a rough , tough , mean , fighting dog , like this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it  try .
mmmy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss him .
come on , said milo .
phew .
wow , look at this thing , otis , milo said 
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle the score with that --
that , h , thing .
ha , ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terrific time , but otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridg up ahead .
maybe he could jump off the brdge into the box f he hurried 
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work either .
otis jst could n't swim fast enugh and the river tok milo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost sight of otis .
suddenly he heard something moving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in the box so the ber would n't see him .
but the box was drifting right towards the hungry animal .
bt unfortunately much too soon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the riverbank , leding the bear away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he ws getting a little concerned because the river was beginning to move faster ... and faster .
h 'd lost track of otis now , and he was drifting farther and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the forest .
and he heard mysterious hoots and growls and cries in the night .
he began to wish he 'd never jumped nto this box nd he began to wish he was home .
it seemed to be trembling as much as he was in the chilly , misty night .
he drifted on through the darkness , hoping to find the morning waitng just around the bend .
when daylight came ,
milo saw a farm on the riverbank .
for one happy moment , he thought he was home and cried out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't knw when he would ever see it again .
here comes the dog your lif he -- ♪♪
the deadwood swamp .
a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves or branches , and where no creature could live , except for the dreaded deadwood birds .
and one of them was perching on a familiar woden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
thre 's the box .
poor cat .
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
lok in the box .
otis prepared himslf and peeked in the box and sw only a solitary black feather .
in fact , milo was nowhere near th deadwood swamp 
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as quickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
the ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran untl he came to an open meadw whre he saw a kind of animal he 'd never seen before .
feeling pretty hungry , he immediately wondered ,
is that somthing you can eat ?
heh .
hello , someon there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful , milo thought .
and above all , i must keep absoltely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch where he figured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah , here , my precious muskrat .
you should be safe there till dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fox run over the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on a big , tasty muskrat lunch .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through the wetlands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered there was one magic word everyne understood and that was please .
so he marched up to a clam hole and said ,
aww .
the cluds were getting darkr and darker and a chilly wind was whipping across the countryside .
milo was several miles from th beach caght in the same storm .
he got a little wet and he felt awfully lonesome without otis , but at last he was safe .
the tide came in so fast that the rock otis had been sitting on was completely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd never be able to swim to shore .
and the water was growng higher .
now the water was up to his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he took a deep breath , but just when h was ready to dve in ...
oh , not again , the sea turtle gurgled .
every time the tide comes in sme fool gets stuck out here .
otis was n't sure what this turtle wanted .
well , now you know .
now , just stay on the shore , where yo belong , the turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
next time the tide comes in , i 'll have to rescue somebody else .
you savd mine .
no , said otis , i did n't know that .
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otis called out , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
i have n't got time , otis said , sensing this fox was n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis was outrged .
ha !
he marveled at this rad made of wood and iron and decided to follow the road and see where it would take him .
it could 've run right over me .
but milo was determined .
now milo was plenty tred .
you look tired and thirsty , a der whispered .
i 'm not sure cats know how to bound , milo said .
bound and leap , like a zephyr set free .
bound and , of course , leap .
it just does n't look right when i do it .
frolic with me , friend .
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frolickng .
i 'm frolickng .
you see ?
ahem .
you can stop frolicking now , the deer cooed .
i think i 'm  little tuckered out , milo said .
yes , it is possible to ovr-frolic , the deer murmured .
and the deer tok milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trailed milo from the deadwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if h just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the friend he missed so much .
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling .
as evening was falling ,
milo decided the safest place to spend the night would be in a tree .
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest belong to you ?
yes , and it 's not just any nest , i 'll have you know .
i 'm the night bird , and that is a dreaming nest .
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear cat  anyone sleeping there will have his sleep flooded with dreams , the bird said .
but it 's a safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... we 'd think of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
whoo !
all right .

how about my karate ?
fozzie , you were very , very funny .
go home !
go home !
how often have you sen that statement at the beginning of a picture ?
well , there 's nothing unique in that .
we all have moods .
in fact , a modern writer has said ... that inside every fat man ... a thin man is struggling to get out .
well , in a literal and terrifying sense .. inside this demure young woman ... two very vivid and different personalities ... were battling fr the mastery of her character .
now , their account of the case was delivered ... to the merican psychiatric association in 1953 ... and it 's already a classic of psychiatric literature .
the date is august 20 , 1951 .
you all right ?
come in .
mrs. white ?
sit here , wll you ?
thank you .
thank you .
how long have you known him ?
he 's the doctor we go to .
he 's a very able man , very able .
what kind of spell ?
why , i do n't knw 
i 'm not exactly sure .
well , what happens when you have one ?
is it what they say , amnesia ?
well , amnesia means loss of memory .
is that what happens to you ?
how often does this happen ?
same thing .
yes , sir .
first i get this terrible headach ... and then i get ths spell .
no , sir .
it 's more like ...
i was playin ' out in the backyard with bonnie .. and all of a sudden i got this splitting ' headach ... nd then the next thing i knew ...
i mean , the next thing i was conscious of , it was the next mornin ' .
that 's my little girl .
how old is she ?
she 's four and a half .
your only child ?
i see .
yes ?
i guess not ... nothing yo could say was really different .
narrator :
for severl weeks , mrs. white was greatly hlped by the psychiatric treatment .
she had no more blackout spells ... at least none that she was aware of ... but not quite a yar lter , sevral things happened ... that showd her to be in urgent need of help .
this one hurts .
where 'd you get these ?
they 're mommy 's .
mommy !
mommy !
well , did n't you by 'em ?
i thought it was sweet  but i ...
you know i would n't buy anything like that , ralph .
that 's what i mean , that costs that much .
where 'd they get your name ?
i do n't know .
i thought you did it .
well , i 'll say it 's too much .
well , i 'll call 'em .
woman :
is this miss effe ?
who is this ?
ths s ralph white , miss effie .
i thought you and evie would be on your way to hollywood by now .
hollywood ?
with all those pretty things evie bught .
you ought to be mighty proud of her ... the way she looks in those dresses , specially that lilac on .
i said to mr. gilmore ...
come on in , honey , and wash your hands .
tell her i 'll call hr .
never mind , honey .
i 'll call you when we re ready .
come here .
will you come here ?
what did they say ?
i do n't know what yu 're talkin ' about .
will yo stop that lying ?
nothing ?
she did n't say nothing else .
i do n't see how she could 'cause i did n't .
you men to tell me you did n't go into the beehive and try on those dresses for miss effie ?
they gon na tak 'em back ?
you 're not kidding they 'll take them back .
no , i 'll do it .
you better let me .
yo heard me .
i said  'd do it !
i 'm hungry , mommy !
i got you .
it 's all right , honey .
you 'll be all right .
t 's all right .
i did n't do it , i tell you .
how abut you lved her so much ... you wold n't come home from atlanta last month ?
will you let me talk to her alone for a few minutes ?
we 'll just be a fw minutes .
that 's not true , what he said .
what s not true ?
i have n't been to tlanta in nearly a year .
well , that 's what i mean .
why do you think he says things like that if they 're not true ?
i thought of one .
you mean , by divorce ?
but yo 're not positive ?
well , i could n't be positive of anything this quickly ... but the fact you may be having spells of amnesia ... does n't mean that you re , what you call , losing your mind .
does n't mean that at all .
it 's no use ... 'cause i am .
you do n't wan na tell me , but i know it now .
because now i 'm hearing voices to .
what kind of voices ?
just one voice , but that 's what that means , does n't it ?
for months .
wht does this voice say to you ?
a woman 's voice ?
can you recognize it in ny way ?
it sounds familiar somtimes ... but i do n't really rcognize it .
to do thngs lik ... leave ralph ... take bonnie and run away .
that is what it means , is n't it ?
you 've been frightened by this voice .. because you recognize it as a symptom of illness .
does n't mak any difference .
you jst do n't wan na tell me , but it does .
feelng better now ?
i did n't have no headache .
she had one , but i did n't .
she ?
i think she 's a real dope , do n't you ?
these hose !
if you like .
i think you better turn around , though .
you 're kind of cute , but i do n't think  know you that well .
maybe sometime , though  huh ?
hey , you like to go dancin ' ?
would you like to go dancin ' with me ?
so , you 're not eve white ?
you mean that was your maiden name .
that 's still my name .
not while i 'm in my right mind she is n't .
hey !
we could get out of her without him seeing us .
will you excuse me for a moment ?
i 'll be right back .
it 's up too high .
excuse me .
i 'll b right bck .
is that her ?
but i can tell you this ...
whom do you suspect ?
mrs. white .
mrs. eve white .
evrything all right ?
hi !
this is miss eve black , doctor .
how do you do , miss black ?
how do you d ?
oh , no .
the more there are , the better i like 'em .
and you say you are not mrs white now 
i 'm not mrs. white .
then how does it happen that you remember meeting me ?
she just tells herself she does 'cause she thinks sh ought to .
take the kid if she wants her and beat it .
i ai n't gon na go through the rest of my life with that creep .
and you say that bonnie 's not your child .
you mean , ralph never made love to you ?
do n't you have any fans in this offce ?
t 's ht in here .
i do  indeed .
i 'm gon na come out , and i 'm gon na stay out .
where ?
the big apple .
you ever been there ?
every time i go in there , they ask me to stand up and sing .
what kind of mood ?
i have to have a couple snrts first .
can you come out , as you call it , whenever you want to ?
sometimes i can , but sometims i ca n't .
sre .
you know what i done one night ?
you know what i done the next morning ?
she 's faking .
listen , mrs. white ..
i regret to have to say this ... but i ...
hello , doctor .
mrs. whte ?
every momnt lightly shaken ...
ran itself in golden sands .
that , trembling , passed in music out of sight .
that 's beautiful .
i just like to read it anyway .
would you like to red this one ?
dear beauteous death ...
morning 
good morning , doctor .
hw 's it going ?
yes , she really does .
thank you .
what about bonnie ?
would you say that your marriage , spaking of it as a whole ... has been a happy one ?
no , sir .
well , some of it , but not as a whole .
i do n't know .
i guess i jst have n't been able to make him happy .
have you ever had the feeling that somewhere .. deep down insde you ... ther might be somebody you could n't quite reach ... but that you nevertheless knew ws there ?
no , sir .
good night , doctor .
good night , madge .
hey .
got a cigarette ?
you know the rules .
come on .
no .
yes ?
it 's about mrs. white .
yes ?
can you control your emergence ?
says which ?
i 'm tired of this place .
it 's a nuthouse , i n't it ?
you do n't see any bars or anything like that  do you ?
is she crazy ?
i do n't know wht i have to d with it .
i 'm a doctor .
you re cute , you know that ?
listen , eve ...
hey , look , why do n't you and i go out and have some fun ?
i can slip on somethn ' .
d you wan na be shut up in one of these places for life ... one with bars ?
what do yo mean ?
i mean simply this ...
if you try anything like that , if yu get into any trouble at all ... it 'll be mrs. whte that 'll be adjudged crazy ... but both of you 'll be locked up .
you 're not gon na be subdivided by any court or board i 've heard of yet .
an asylum , with lockd doors and bars and straitjackets !
i guess so .
even if i do n't come out , wht do you figure to do about it ?
nobody knows too much about this ... because there hav n't ben too many such cses ... but for a starter ..
i think i 'd like to tell eve white about you .
do you object ?
i 'd say the first lgical step to take in that direction ... would be to introduce them to each other , would n't you ?
introduce 'em ?
i do n't have to put on much .
let 's go on out and have a little fun .
i do n't underst ...
a little one .
narrator :
good morning , sir .
much better now .
that 's what i wanted to talk to you about .
yes , sir .
have you ever heard of that ?
no , sir .
well , what actually happens is this ...
in effect , she 's now two different women ... entirely different in character 
to be more specific bout it ... the girl you married , bonnie 's mother ... sweet , quiet girl you fell in love with , that 's one f the women .
the other is the one that scared bonnie , the one who bought ll the clothes ... the one that had that row with you in atlanta .
you know those headaches and blackout spells ?
yes , sir .
out of where ?
well , how do you like that ?
she ca n't help it .
i think you better come with me .
yes , sir .

and if i was gon na hav one , it would n't be no lead bottom like ralph white there .
bonnie is n't your child ?
i got a good mind to slap your face !

well , she 's okay .
your folks will take care f her all right .
yeah , but if i do n't get well , i might never see her again .
of course yu 're gon na see her again ... 'cause you are gon na get well .

he said there was n't a thing in the world the matter with yu ... except this multiplied personality ... and that ai n't anywhere near crazy .

you wanted hr to go with you , dd n't you ?
you are my wife .
that 's not what you said a few minutes go .
maybe , only not tonight , i ca n't .
why not tonight ?
'cause i have n't got anything to wear to jacksonville .
it 's gettin ' kind of old .
maybe , if you buy me a pretty one .
will you go now ?
the stores ai n't opn now .
do n't you trust me ?
sure .
i just want the dress first .
does that mean you 're gon na buy me something ?
i told you i would , did nt i ?
okay , but just a little one .
hey !

hey .

do n't take too long , though .
wo n't you even sit close to me ?
shut that door .
all i was doin ' ws just dancn ' .
we 're losing .
no , it 's more than that .
i do nt believe the divorce actually affected her seriously .
a victory for either would be disastrous ... no solution whatever .
an empty , almost abnormally normal history .
yes 
miss eve black .
miss eve black in person .
you gon na protect him against me ?
well , say , you look pretty sharp yourself , you know that ?
she 's your patient , doctor .
he 's pretty cute sometimes , do n't ya think 
he 's a living doll .

you think so ?
somthing 's wrong somewhere .
with a razor blade .
because if somebody did n't stop her , i 'd be gone too , you know what i mean ?
go on 
she made one slash , and then i got out , and i made her drp the blade ... and i got it and threw it away .
do you think she meant it ?
i know she meant it .
if it 'd been me , i would n't have mant it .
i understand .
but she was really leveling .
she really was gon na kill herself if i had n't stopped her .
now i 'm having blackout spells too .

that was in the fall of 1953 .
on september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. white : dear dr. luther ...
narrtor :
in winter , endless darkness is brightened by the frisky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar bear familis .
one hundred and fifty thousand years ago some brown bears moved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're bult for the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywhere else .
polar bears have always hunted from floting platforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctic s warming twice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percent more ocean than it does now .
if the current trend continues the arctic ocean could be free of sea ice each summer by the year 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slow it down .
most arctic glaciers are melting faster than ver before 
the distance btween ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in search of sea ice often has further to go .
some cbs do survive especially if the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do the inuit people like simon qamanirq .
simon :
polar bears surpris us in camp .
but now the ancient weather patterns have changd .
our grandfathers fed their families well .
my family has lways depended on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
my friend adam ravetch has been coming up here fr 20 years to photograph the animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years nto raising their young .
walrus moms spend even longer .
they dive down from rafts of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of their favorite treat .
mothers teach their young survval skills such as scaring off intruders .
one morn snt me a very clear message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
this water is literally as cold as ice .
the salt keps it from freezing .
down here , there 's only one exit and it 's pretty scary thinking you could be trapped .
each spring in alaska large herds of caribou set out on a long journey .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to se what the caribou mothers go through and to see this migratin from their perspective .
leanne :
these newlyweds will follw the caribou all the way to their birthing grounds 
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calves are just a week or two old  and they 're easy pickings for bears and wolves .
this is the place where the calves have their best chance to survive .
these bugs are potntially deadly to these caribou .
to get away .
caribou mothers are having a tough time as the arctic warms .
but polar bear mothers face an even greater struggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of this ship 
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world and mst of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when you 're only 3 months old .
next year we 're coming back with stronger cases .
narrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to impossible .
then the tem got lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
because the sun never sets in the summer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males prefer seals but in a pinch , they have always gone after defenseless cubs .
the mother seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't know why sh was agitated 
we finally spotted a male quite a ways off zeroing in on the mother and her cubs .
now that seals ar so hard to ctch , starving males might be targeting cubs more often .
but next time things could be much diffrent .
playful cubs can really work up an appetite .
bjorne :
when you want to grab a bite to eat up here tming s everything .
the cubs finish everything on thr plate but the scent of fresh seal meat attracts attention .
but the male picks up the family 's scent again .
we watch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on the family .
then the mother turns to fce him .. .. slowing him down just long enough for hr frightened cubs to escape .
at the moment of truth , the mother sent a very clear message :
you can get to my cbs if you want bt you 'll have to kill me first .
narrator :
but she 's powerless to save the habitat they need to survive .
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster than it has for thousands of years and losing its dazzling crown of ce .
the mothers here nurture their young so lvingly .
perhaps they can inspire us to protect their home with that same cre .

if we get back .
they have to come ashore .. sometime .
i 'm just studying it .
you really think you can find that treasure way down there in florida ?
i keep thinking what wold happen to ant effie and aunt lou .
your aunt effi and aunt lou 'd sure be surprised if you was to find it .
i still would n't tell em where the treasure is .
i liked ben .
we 'll never tell .
no matter what they do .
quick , thad !

it was right beside the baby card .
do n't be afraid to bet .
lf you do n't speculate , you ca n't accumulate .
i do n't take bets from paupers , strippers or grandmothers .
unless , of course , captain , you have some regulations against it .
of course not .
lt 's just that we rarely have the ladies visit us here on the texas deck .
it 's called three-card monte .
this is not a trick or a humbug .
oh , that does look like fun .
how much would you like to bet ?
make it easy on yourself , lady .
how much would you like to bet ?

it 's just simpl logic , is n't it ?
sir , if i understand the game , you owe me 500 dollars .
now , why d n't we show these gentlemen the baby card ?
no , no , no .

even if you find that trasure , spangler will take it away from you and he 'll kill you ll into the bargain .
there 's no law down in those swamps , you knw .
to hear davie talk , you cold part these waters and we could go the rest of the way by carriage .
not that for a moment i 'd even consider it , it 's just i 'm curios why you did n't ask me to go along to ... this ...

robert 
your punishment was well-earned .
he has business across the western sea .
too strong , prhaps , for even him .
tie him up !
your cutlass !
she stayed behind in monteria .
are you certain he 's gone ?
i say , my lady , it may be prudent to remain under wraps .
step aside , willory .
perhaps you 're right .
then there 's only one thing to do .
my lady ?
his own creation .
i 'd say this qualifies .
alexander has been taken .
please bring back ...
what do we need ?
the army !
the navy !
for king and country , now we fight
have you seen the show before ?
no , too expensive .
he works here .
family night , right ?
right .
is he in the show ?
wait .
our boyfriends are friends !
is that bad ?
it 's spanish gold for all tonight
our flag unfurled with black and white
it 's spanish gold for all tonight !
i 'm the queen , you 're the king .
hey !
but you 're going to keep at it so you do n't end up back in your parents ' basement .
right .
i like your toy .
she 's elliot 's girlfriend .
sweetie , how bout having your little car fetch me some barbecue sauce ?
it 's in the back room .
well , how about you fetch me sme barbecue sauce ?
out of range .
sedgewick !
hi , elliot .
elliot , would you run to the back room and get some barbecue sauce for my new friend , ellen ?
you know i would , brnadette , but , it 's just that the back room is real , real dark .
his list of things he 's afraid of .
it 's extensive .
we 'll have george get it .
what took so long ?
it 's great .
i liked it when he swung on the rope .
they 're both pretty taken with sir frederick 
yeah !
right .
hey , after the show 's over , yo want me to take you down n the pirate ship ?
yeah , dad , but mom says if we come back on friday
you 're no match for me !
cool !
did you see sir frederick ?
he 's a hero !
hey , cabin boy !
coming .
i ca n't believe my own kids are coming back to get a tour from sir frederick .
yeah , after your audition .
look at george here .
this guy knows every line in that show .
so , why did n't he try out ?
why do n't you ?
i 'm just not the type .
there you go .
excuse me , sir .
the day s show is over .
the call s cming .
take heed , o friends .
the stage is set for the heroes at hand 
do n't yo see ?
the stage is set for the heroes at hand .
listen to me .
get it ?
if we all audition , we 're going to be stars .
and my kids would think i 'm a hero .
i got my own set of pirate costumes in my locker .
let 's give it a shot !
okay , let 's get this over with .
ready when you are , mr. hibbing !
andy , cue the music and the lights .
you came from the sea and to the sea you shall return .
okay .
i go aloft  captain .
the height will afford me a keener view .
i ca n't believe he fired us just for failing an audition .
it 's back t my parents ' basement and goodbye ellen .
i needed that job .
sure , we can get sme ice cream .
hello , mr. lewis .
i guess that maks you the pirates who do n't do anything .
well , tough luck .
wants to hang out with us .
his dad 's a loser .
i do n't know what went wrong .
the old man ...
i should be at home right now , watching tv as a happily employd cabin boy .
i guess guys like us will never be more than cabin boys .
see what i mean ?
free garbage .
well , what is it ?
well , it could be something valuable , like a russin satellite .
or maybe a bomb .
i told you it was a bomb .
chuck it in the river .
i think it 's a bomb .
it 's a bomb !
you did what ?
there 's somthng you do n't see every day .
so , we lost our jobs , but we got a rowboat .
and i 'm living in my parents ' basement again .
the good news is , i got a rowboat .
it 's so old .
give a man a rowboat and he 'll ...
i 'm thinking we should avoid pushing any more buttons !
you got us ...
i do n't know how .
row ?
we got to even out the weight a little .
can i be the rudder ?
you 're not rowing tgether .
no , you 're going the wrong way .
it 's not a metaphor .
it 's a girl .
well , it 's kind of funny .
quickly , cme up .
it 's splendid to meet you .
i 'm eloise  princess of monteria , and this is my butler , willory .
we have n't much time .
well , you 'r the heroes .
any questions ?
i mean no disrespect , but these men hardly seem the heroic type .
she thinks we 're , uh ...
heroes .
perhaps they plucked it from the ocean or stol it from the rel heroes .
i mean , look how they 're dressed .
by go-carts ?
no , be heroes .
they do n't know that .
she called us heroes .
oh , come on , how hard could it be ?
it 's knd of nice to be called a hero .
well , gentlemen , are you ready for adventure 
point the way !
oh , you 're not pirates , are you ?
we sure are n't cabin boys .
we 're friendly pirates , sort of .
oh .
oh , no , we do n't do any of that stuff .
that 's rght .
how comforting .
well , then , there 's no time to spare .
gret .
how do you start this thing ?
what a kidder .
elliot , let me take the wheel .
you scramble up to the yard and unfurl the topsail .
certainly .
wher are my manners ?
it 's the recording thing with the tv thing in the future .
tea would be lovely .
real pointy ones .
thes treacherous waters shelter many a desperate pirate .
a sklled captain able to sail this maze will find , at its center , the inn f jolly joe , a popular pirate hant .
we can not turn back .
captain , are you up to the task 
why , exactly , do we need to go there ?
to find out more about this .
you cn cut a can with it and still slice a tomato .
if we find out who the owner is , we 'll be closer to finding alexander .
we must do whatevr it takes to rescue my brother , willory .
does anyone know where the bathroom is ?
oh .
do n't worry about a thing , willory .
looking good , captain .
oh , no !
what ?
quickly , my lady , you must hide .
we should drop our sails .
psition three !
this be one-eyed louie , terror of the seven seas .
they 're bowlin knots 
break the back !
back f what ?
four ...
looking for the bthroom
oh !
how quaint .
the princess has a powder room !
locked .
all right , where s the key ?
two ..
i 'm not getting it .
on a big ring , just lik at the gas station .
come on .
what cunning !
what bravery !
i told you they were heres .
welcome t my kingdm , prince .
you ca n't hide , robert .
my father will send hlp .
oh , i would enjoy tht .
watch your step .
my father will be very pleased that his helpseeker found you all .
you love your dad a lot , huh ?
do you have children ?
george jr .
great kids .
you are a princess , and this inn is full of treacherous pirates !
yes , thank you , willory .
even princesss can do what 's right .
right .
argh , argh , argh , argh , rgh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
grab your root beer , hold it high !
whack your shipmate in the eye !
watch your back , it 's jolly joe 's !
grab your root beer , hold it high !
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
keep it up , lads !
spin around and do-si-do
watch your step , it 's jolly joe 's
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
watch your backs , scalawagons !
and when we 've pillged all our foes
grab a keg of ginger ale hop up on a wooden pail
there ai n't no place like jolly joe 's !
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh
argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh , argh  argh , argh
argh , great !
argh !
that deck 's got to be swabbed .
i was wondering if you could , if you could tell me ...
what 's the matter there ?
let me try .
argh !
not a bit !
were you cruel and unusual ?
grab a chair , and join the game !
come on in .
serv them up , pour them up , pull them up .
ahem !
is that a yes or a no ?
aye , ld .
the cutlass belongs to robert .
robert the terrible .
you have his cutlass , but you 're not he .
the othrs were fooled , bt i know better .
you know where we could find this fellow ?
but i 've heard tll of an island , past the rocks of malabar .
not that i 'd go looking for it 
and why should n't they ?
they do n't call him robert the terrible fr nothing .
he 's the king 's own brther , but he 's as bad as the king is good .
and , for his treachery , was banished from monteria .
so he 's a little nasty .
a little ?
story says he 's waiting for the king to step away , just long enough to grab his beloved children and take the throne for his wn .
for robert to claim the throne , they must be gone !
on vactin ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enogh adventure for this gourd .
clearing tables is really kind of fun when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
where are you going ?
somewhre else .
the helpseeker brought you here , and only the helpseeker can send you back .
just get me back to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're our heroes !
brave as lions and cunning as foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not th lion .
who are you ?
i do n't know .
i 'm like a sleepy little panda .
there 's no sland anywhere .
i 'll leave the interpretation up to you .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work will be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to it .
great plan , george .
raise the mast on the stedfast !
we play the haddock for a hat trick
we got the hammocks on the main deck
we got the butler doing the henpeck
screaming so
we do n't knw
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a relic from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're on the bd mood swing
we have n't done one thing
not even the minimum daily requirement
but if you 're feeling a little seasick
and you want to get off the guilt trip
what are you gon na show him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taking up the slack
go , hero
standing in th gp taking up the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheel kep an even keel
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's t .
the island may still lie ahead .
what is that ?
el remolino , the great whirlpool !
 thought it was pirate legend , bt there it is .
captain george 's death cruise ,
brought to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thought you were on our side .
thank you , george .
might be a giant whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huh .
how about that ?
water droplets in the air reflecting the sky so perfectly they block the island from view .
right on time .
and look who they left behind .
d you think there are snakes on this island ?
'cause snakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
and spiders and bears .
i do n't follow you .
sail to the rocks , do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here with captan weather channel on my way to be sliced and diced by edward scissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i were a cave , whre would i b ?
we ca n't sneak up on them in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i d n't know .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailor were to look for me ,
the east s where he 'd start .
he 'd reach the isle of walking rocks
and the clapping pass would part .
then gaze with pride upon my keep ,
not found on any chart ,
tll he would spy my steely eye
ooh .
copyrght robert the terrible .
oh , yeah .
so , what do we got ?
we head east to ...
hly mackerel !
what ?
pieces of eight ?
spanish gold ?
even better .
cheese curls !
i 'm not going back to the boat .
what do you mean you 're not going back to the boat ?
the way i see it , i have two choices .
but , the princess , she thinks we 're heroes .
we are n't any of those things .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
where do i start ?
how about you , my little friend ?
what ?
she 's sailing away .
mayb she did n't need thm after all .
are you beeping ?
the ball .
what ?
it means our work is done 
where 's the rowboat ?
we can go home .
hold on a sec .
how lng has that been here ?
it 's one of robert 's boats .
it 's blinking !
something ai n't right .
they 've got the princess !
we got to help her !
come n !
listen , when the ball blinks , our work is done and we can go home .
do n't yo want to go home ?
bt i also want them to wnt to see me .
you know , maybe the reason thy do nt look up to me is bcause i have nt given them something worth loking p to .
it was wrong about that .
it could be wrong about this , too .
if you want to go home , you can go hme .
but eloise needs me .
let 's g save a princess !
help is on the way !
what kind of a crazy b mvie am i in ?
let 's be reasonable .
i was n't really going to eat you , but you were impersonating a snack food !
 think you 're rght .
then we 'll just have to follw the clues .
head east to the island of walking rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like rachs !
i bet george knew bout thse little things from the weather channel , too .
it is n't worth it .
eaten by his own favorite snack food .
at lest that on day , from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'd want me to come back 
what ?
sorry , boys !
gourd is off the menu !
what do you want , robert ?
indeed .
he took monteria 's wealth , our wealth , my wealth , and squandered it on strangers .
when the crown is mine , i can once agin enjoy the benefits of royalty .
yo 're not strong enough to take the crown from my father 's head .
of course , i ca n't just leave them in the harbr waiting , or i 'll blow up my own ships .
he did n't say .
alexander !
srely you must know when your father is returning !
if you can mange to remember ,
you have two hours to think it over .
put them in their cell .
oh , papa 's got a pork chop , nellie ,
do n't you like it ?
after the 32nd verse , it grates .
but there 's supposed to be a pass .
right 
you think that 's th island of walking rocks ?
it 's got rocks , but they do n't appear to be going anywhere .
look at us , we 're walking rocks
la-la-la-la-la
george ?
george !
hey  elliot !
the rocks !
huh ?
there 's another one !
are y kdding 
i think we woke up dad .
it was nic knowing you , elliot !
thanks fr the adventre .
hey !
i 've been lookng for you .
company ?
oh , no .
i hate thes guys !
i think they like it .
oh , sure , yeah .
i 'll just keep running all day .
oh , it had to be me .
it 's not ...
would you ..
somebody eat them .
would you ?
that was a good idea , swimming over here with thos ...
why ?
hang on .
now , this is the guy who wants to crush us like coconuts , right ?
uh-huh .
yep .
and you 're in on this , too ?
mmm .
okay .
we go to row through befre it closes .
i do n't think that 's possible , and that 's coming from a guy who just swm 92 natical miles without arms or legs .
well , you got a better idea ?
yeah .
we need to get through .
trust him ?
trust the rock , he says .
guys ?
guys ?
guys !
found it .
we should be fine .
there you g .
too easy .
it 's not guarded or anything .
hey , guys ?
there 's bubbles .
what ?
guys ?
oh , dear .
like sand through the hourglass , so are the last few minutes of our lives .
i 'm hping this will lead up to the dungeon level , and that s where we 'll find the prince and princess .
their dungeon has a swimming pool .
oh , no .
a what ?
hey !
so , what are we going to d when we get to the dungeon ?
huh ?
oh , i have n't figured that part out yet .
i was thinking we had a plan .
hey , i think we 're there .
it 's locked .
yep , this is the dungeon , all right .
and look !
who is it ?
it 's ...
that is one neat toy .
it 's a labor-saving devce .
come on !
huh ?
huh ?
it 's not magic .
it 's radioshack !
we got to go 
but this way is ...
time 's up .
what 's this ?
someone wanted to spoil my fun ?
surly not you ?
oh , no , sir .
then you three ?
the king 's heroes ?
he did n't mention it to us .
it did n't come p .
surely the king 's heros would know of his plans !
tell me when the king will return , or say goodbye to the princess .
let her go !
it was all a misunderstanding .
we 're no heroes .
we work in a restaurant .
we clear dishes .
we clean up .
that 's right .
he 's so lazy , he ca nt even climb a ladder without giving up .
and george there , he 's such a wimp , even his own son thinks h 's a loser .
when all hope is gone , help will come from above in the shap of a donkey .
donkeys .
we 're not donkeys .
we 're cabin boys .
bt even cabin boys can do what 's right !
follow me !
th ball !
everybody , lean !
the drain .
we 're gettng out of here !
i m feeling flushed !
you 've got to be kidding !
what a ride !
we 've got company !
row !
can i ask where we 're rowing t ?
the pass is closed !
keep rowing !
unless that pass opens up , we 're dmed .
we ca n't get much further .
it 's not blinking .
they 're in range now , boys .
finish them .
father !
it ca n't be !
you know what to do , men .
where are you going ?
return fir !
against the king 's men ?
on my word , brother , i 'm not finishd !
for amazing tenacity , unwillingness to give up .
but the ball , it does n't work right .
we 're no heroes .
we 're cabin boys .
the helpseker picked exctly whom i intended .
the donkey from above .
the adventure i call you to may not be easy , but you 'll never journey alone .
my help is always there .
that was a test , which you passed with flying colors .
sometimes , a test helps us decide what matters most .
the hero is the one who , no matter how hard , does what he knows is right .
monteria !
are you sure you do n't want to stay ?
i want to see my kids .
and my ellen !
fare thee well , friends .
sure enough .
hang on .
you know , i liked them from the very beginning .

yeah !
one , two , three .
puttin ' all the people to shame
show me your way
my hope is you
do n't ever give a sermon like that in my church again .
i was trying to show how we 're all connected to each other .
i will not allow you to express alternative points of view regarding the church .
when my riches lie in ruin
on the landscpe of my past
will they uncover that i was pursung
where
your treasure is
the things you love are a part of you

it 's not abut healing .
you 're not seeing what happned here tonight .

i can se .
i can see .
on the wings of a snow-white dove
he sends his pure sweet love
on the wings of a snow-white dove
he sends his pur swet love
a sign from above
a sign from above
a sign from above
it 's a miracle .
a miracle .
a mircle .
a miracle .
i thought someone should tell you .
father tardone .
father pat , before you start espousing yet another miracl , i advise you to take a breath .
he is with us here in auburn .
the people frm the revival of angels meeting are all talking about it .
another miracle .
a revival tent ?
i warned you about this joshua .
hey , i 'm not the only one .
everyone says it 's a miracle .
i have kept my eyes open and my vision clear , like you advised me to 
corrupted ?
as soon as this joshua completes the statue , i want you to end your association with him .
he 's my friend .
good morning .
good morning , bishop .
thank you for seeing me .
i ll get right to the point .
he seemed simple enough , but he 's shown  powerful influence over a great many people .
the protestant clergy and i would like ..
and the purpose of this meeting would be to investigate these miracles ?
we all have bettr things to do with or time .
that i 'm glad to hear .
that i 'm glad to hear .
my own father hayes follows hm around like a lost puppy .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
father tardone , hello .
how re you ?
it 's the artist you have  problem with .
i 'm surprised you found time to finish your work , considering all your other chores .
i suppose i do n't think of them as chores .
you know , father , we could use your help down at the baptist church .
join you ?
it 's the others whose eyes ar not open .
to what ?
a miracle workr ?
i have never made that claim .
a miracle worker ?
and i think it 's time for everyone else to find out .
it looks very nce .
yes , they 've definitely mde progress .
i know most of you .
what joshua has persuaded you to do with this church is wonderful .
but i want you all to lok ...
does anyone d something for nothing ?
does a complete stranger offer to help without wanting something in return ?
preaching ?
i do n't think you know what this is .
it 's a lov letter .
a love letter ?
what about sin and god 's law ?
how dare you assme the role of the clergy ?
wait a minute .
what joshua has done is a miracle .
living next to each other did n't make us neighbors .
make us care about one another , did it ?
but by working together here with joshua --
led by him .
come on .
see the good in this man --
if you can look at this church and hw everybody here hs changed for the better ...
and say , this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no , no .
whatever it is you stand for , father tardone , i do n't want to be a part of .
i ca n't .
i wo n't wear this anymore .
i wo n't take it .
may gd have mercy on you .
he 's just afraid .
no .
about this .
i am part of the clergy in this town , and , uh ,
i 'm too-
so i might as well ...
it 's not true , pat .
what do you know about being a priest , joshua ?
what do yu know about the responsibility i feel ?
you 're just  guy .
you 're just a guy .
it just needs to be understood , and --
you 're wrong , pat .
hi , maggie .
mad it just in time .
now , tho , since you 're th first one who came to help , you should be the one to put the bell on the steeple .
tak it easy , now .
that thing is big .
theo , can you hear me ?
you 're gon na wake up .
your work 's not done .
okay , now , come on .
come on , now .
come on , now .
wake up .
that 's it .
that 's it .
what happened ?
you fell off the roof .
come on .
you all right ?
thank you .
what just happened here ?
what just happened here ?
i mean , it's-it 's possible he survived the 40-foot fall ...
a certifiably ded person and you brought him back to life .
bless me , fathr , for  have sinned .
i turned my back on my vocation .
but i have overcome my crisis of faith .
i am not resigning .
i promise you , father pat , the vatcan shall know of this , nd when they do , this mircle worker will vanish .
he will simply run way .
you 're wrong about him , father tardone .
joshua ?
i 've never seen anything so beautiful .
what ?
this is n't a letter .
from who ?
i do n't know if i 'll be vsiting the pope , but thanks for the etiquette tip .
hmm .
you know , joshua was invited to the vatican .
you know , joshua was nvited to the vatcan .
thy wo n't let you in .
i advise you to make the most of your sermon , father pt .
hi .
maggie , hi .
um , i just wanted to make sure i said good-bye .
oh , yeh , your new job .
good luck with that .
in rome .
actually , i 'm being a little nosey .
um , i kind of wanted to see where you lived .
yeah ?
well , here it is .
wow , joshua .
thanks .
it 's yours .
come here .
look at that .
oh , it s beatiful .
is n't that something in the moonlight ?
then why are you leaving ?
why are you ?
i --
i-i apologize .
i feel like an idiot .
i jst ...
miss my husband , and , um --
this is so cnfusing .
i -- my life is a mess .
this is so confusing .
yur life is beautiful .
my life was beautiful .
it was great .

that is my life  and it ca n't be fixed .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
for he 's a jolly good fllow
which nobody can deny
thank you , everyone .
that is a classic rendition of that song .
but  uh , i have to get up really early to catch a plane tomorrow , s i 'm gon na say good night .

from what i hear , you 've been doing some extraordinary things in auburn .
i came to auburn and saw there was work to be dne .
you could say that .
i started to build and people came to join me .
you built a church , as i understand t .
for what reason ?
so you do n't consider yourself a --
a spiritual leader ?
you do n't seem dangerous or evil .
do n't let him fool you , cardinal .
i beg a formal condemnation of him by the vatican .
who 's come to auburn t mislead people , then i accept your condemnation .
then i accept yor condemnation .
but is that truly what you see in me ?
that 's not what you 're afraid of , is it ?
you fear what 's inside of you .
i 'm so sorry .
cardinal riccardo sw what i saw .
i look forward to it .
hmm .
the cardinal saw the chnge in you .
here .
is that so ?
i think --
i think i 'm happier for father pat .
i brought you a gift .
these are som tools that  wrk with .
ah , yes .
we hav much work to be done 
i wanted to thank you for the pledge you made as a child .
my pledge ?
then the next morning she was well .
you went to the top of a hill and you pledged your life to god .
who are you ?
the world has become such a frightening place .
it 's so overwhelming .
what should i do ?
remind them tht i love them --
and that if they open their hearts to it , i will fill tht emptiness , and they will be able to love one another .
that 's the message .
tell them , peter .
thank you , reverend .
giving honor and praise to god , for without his love and mercy , surely i would not be standing before yu all today .

a hired girl 's got a right to her own sleeping place .
in the wagon , you let me talk make a fool of myself , talking about you and me .

there 's trees waiting to be felled land waiting to be plowed and fenced , stock to b fed .

she wants a drink of water .

once is all it takes f it 's the right one .
i had such dreams about all of them living around .
dozens of children , visitng back and forth at christmas and birthdys .
if benjamin gos , then another will go .
if you could just get a look at yourselves ...
f yu 're sweet on them , why do n't you do something about it ?
they were in the same fix you 're in .
they was opning up new terrtory , and women were scarce , like here .
course , this being oregon and god-fearing territory you 'd have to capture a parson .
they the ones i heard about settled north of here ?
n , this was in olden days 
i read about it in milly 's book .
a book !
why , this is history .
this really happened .
tell you about thm sobbing ' women who lived in the roman days
so they took them all back home to dry
seems they cried and kissed and kssd and cried
all over that roman countryside
so do n't forget that
when you 're taking a brde

gather round , i 'll tell you .
they never did return their plunder
to rotundas small but cute
them women was sobbin ' , sobbing ' , sobbin '

while the romans was out hobnobbin ' , starting up fights
is that so ?
they kept occupied by sewing lots of little old togs for them tots and saying '  someday womenfolks will have rights
-while the romans had fights
lsten to this .
when the menfolk went to fetch them
the women would not be fetched
now , let this be because it 's true
a lsson to the likes of you
or else they 'll think you 're tetched

what would i see if i rode on a beam of light ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
what ?
it is my great ambition to demonstrate that natur is a closed system ;
the people ...
lavoisier .
why ascribe to an object a vague and immeasurable force like vis viva ?
it is a return to the old ways !
are yo capable of discovering something of your own ?
there s no right time for the truth .

its author was a youthful albert einsten .
it 's the most famous equation in the world :
all aboard !
but while we 'v all heard of einstein 's big idea , very few of us know what it means .
we 've only got sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but first ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughing at einstein .
he 'd united in one stunning insight th work of many who had com before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't think in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature would begin to change ll that .
young michael faraday hated his job .
he was uneducated , the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder 's apprentice .
but faraday craved one thing .
all of his free time and his meager wages were poured into his self-edcation .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of course , of course ...
pass , pass .
this way to a better life .
in the early 1800s , science was the pursuit of gentlemen , something fraday was clearly not .
he had a rudmentary education , he 'd read widely , he 'd gone to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets to hear sr humphry davy  the most prominent chmist of the age .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pp stars of their day .
their lectures were hugely poplar .
tickets were hard to come by , and davy reveled in his status .
they 're waiting .
metals ... unknown , that is , until i isolated ptassium from molten potash and sodium , as i showed you last time , from cmmon salt .
help me be part of the great circle that is your work and love .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trad , which i find vicis and selfish , and to become a servnt of science , which , i imagine , makes its pursuers amiable and liberal .
really ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of a few years to set you rght on that score .
look , i have n't anything at the moment .
faraday was determined to break free from his dily toil .
newman ... met mr. michael faraday .
perhaps with god and faraday in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe in our place of work .
just stick to your job and do s you 're told and you 'll be fine , faraday .
faraday became the laboratory assistant , eagerly absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy degned to impart .
the big excitement of the day was electricity .
another charge , newman .
but no one really understood what this strange force f electricity was .
the academic establishment at the time thought that electricity was , you know , like a fluid flwing through a pipe , pushing its way along .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showed that when you pss an electric current through a wire and place a compss ner it , t deflected the needle at right angles .
faraday , come look at this .
perhaps you can work it out .
oerstd 's reported an amazing finding .
now , that is remarkable .
but if the elctrical force is flowing through the wire , why does the nedle not move in the sam direction , parallel to the wire ?
again , newman .
what ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanting outwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you that at the university of cambridge , electricity flows through a wire , not sideways t it .
that may be what they teach at cmbridge , but it does n't explain what 's happening before our eyes .
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fascination inspired by his religion .
for him , the problem was a way to understand god 's hidden mysteries .
there is a small , almost persecuted group in lndon called the sandemanians .
they were a religious ...
faraday was  member of that group .
that if you opened up one little part of it , you could see how everything was connected .
faraday was different from anybody else .
by methodically placng a compass all around an electrified wire ,
faraday started to notice a pattern .
and then he imagined that a magnet had simlar lines emerging frm it and that those lines would get cught up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking .
yes .
this is the expriment of the century .
scale up the magnets and the wires , make them really big , attach heavy weights to them and they 'll be dragged along .
lthough he did n't realize it at the time ,
the chemicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in the wire , which had combined with the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these various forces there was a common energy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 's written to me and assures me that he 's taken no offense , and he acknowledges that what i published was entirely my own work .
in fct , he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
and what do you think ?
faraday , my dear boy , you have my vote .
it 's the science that counts .
so , tell me , how does this wire of yours spin rund its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i see a swirling array of lines of force spinning out of the electrified wire like a spiraling web .
but invisible lines of force ...
it 's all a bit vague , is n't it 
faraday , might i have a word in private ?
listen , farady , let 's stop this nonsense .
 want you to tak down your ballot papr from the notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i will not take it down .
my father and uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing electric light to the streets of germany .
from an early age , i loved to look at machines  understand how things work .
he 's ging to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle when my father showed me a compass .
there had to be something behind objects that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whichever way they run , herr professor .
einstein s teachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shown , that energy could be converted from one form into another .
they also believed that all forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein was going to prove them wrong .
deep in th heart of matter .
a hundred years befor einstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolution was just arund the corner .
and they felt that one of the first tsks that lay ahead of them was to rtionalz and t classify every single kind of matter so they could see how it all interacted together .
antoine lavoisier , a wealthy , aristocratic yong man , decided to take up this task , to see if there was some basic connection betwen all the stuff of everyday life :
all the different substances in the world .
his meticulous , even obsessive attention to detail ...
was also to be his downfall .
your precise observations commend you as a lady of scentific curiosity ,
mst unusual .
for the last five weeks , i have taken nothing but milk .
i would rather die than fst on milk for five weks !
monsieur  with the greatest of respect to a member of the royal academy of sciences , your gut must think your throat has been slit !
how dare you insult the count ?
do n't forget what the count offers .. not just marriage , but think f how you will be introduced to all the salons .
you will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to marry d'amerval ?
then i must contrive to save you .
lavoisier was n't a scientist by profession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes on the simple things in life ...
did not endear him to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidious young man did still allow himself the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married mrie anne paulze , the daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thus he saved her , as he had promised , from n arranged marriage to a count 40 years her elder .
allow me to show you somthing 
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or iron and leave it outside in the rain for months on end ,
madam lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metals ...
is this a verbal examination prior to an examination proper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let me press you further .
hmm ?
every last citizen in france of sensible age knows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lighter and eventually disppears .
ah , but ...
i have not finishd .
contain yourself , sir .
there is more .
in a recntly published pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier demonstrates that the iron combines with the air .
it  in fact , becomes heavier .
she learned english so that she could translate contemporary scientific works .
monsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheeky man .
messieurs ... it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system , that in any transformation , no amount of matter , no mass is ever lost and none is gained .
ver here , please .
from this end we cool the steam but , interestingly , we collct less water than we started with .
so clearly we lose a certan amount of water .
now , when we combine these two increases ...
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have collected ...
they are exactly equal to the weight of the lost watr .
so what he had done is get the oxygen to stick to the nside of  red-hot iron rifle barrel .
now , that left the hydrogen , what he called combustible air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
in the next few mnths i hope to demonstrate that i can recombine this combustible air with vtal air and transform them both back into water .
i will re-create exactly the same amount of water that was lost here in this process .
it is my hope to complete the cycle ...
but to prove this , he had to perform thousands of experiments , and he had to do the measurements with incredible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth from being a tax collector came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the academy asked yo to assess his designs .
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to peddle .
monsieur .
i have invented a device which projects an image of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device renders the substance of fire visible .
have you collcted it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monsieur .
no , no .
if you will you excuse me .
i am extremely busy today .
thank you .
so that is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not conform to the vrsion of the truth as laid down by the academy .
lavoisier .
he talks about fcts , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my friend .
they are all the same , the royal academes ...
they insult the liberty of the mind .
they think they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core ...
do n't worry .
in my next pamphlet i will expose this persecutor of yours .
the crowning glory of this opus was their remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to the french revolutionaries of 1790 ,
he was denouncd by a failed scientist turned rdical journalist ,
lavoiser !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it befre .
a century later , all of nature had been classified into two great domains .
there was energy ... the forces that animated objects ;
and there was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mighty pillars .
the laws that governed one did nt apply to the other 
but young , newly enrolled physics student albert einstein did n't like lws .
extremely well , herr einstein .
all the better for seeing you have escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that 's about all you ver do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein mric .
would you care to take a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell you what you have missed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just incredible determnation .
we know from his letters that enstein , even from th age of 16 , was literally obsessed with the nature of light .
everyone he could speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on ths beam of light ?
the method is not importnt .
let us just imagine we two are young ..
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to understand .
what would we see , do you think ...
with light he would reinvent the universe and find a hidden pathway that would unite energy and mass .
it stands for celeritas ..
long before th 19th century , scientists had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what light actually was .
invisible lines that can emanate from electricity in a wire , from a magnet or .. even from the sun .
for it is my contention that light itself is just one form of these vibrating lines of electromagnetism .
maxwell and the aging faraday became close frinds .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that magnetic charge moves , it creates a little piece of electricity .
electricity .
electricity and magnetism are interwoven , like a ... a never-ending braid .
so it is always pulsing forwrd .
michael .
670 million miles per hour .
that is the speed of light !
well , that means you were right ll along .
maxwell had proven faraday right .
we have lectures in half an hour .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwell and think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they said you could never catch up to a beam of light .
even if yo were traveling at 670 million miles an hour , you would still see light squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an hor .
yes .
yu see how fr her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveling at the same speed .
but relative to her , it just sits there .
so s light like that ?
common sense would say that if you caught up to a light beam , there would be a wave of light just sitting there .
maybe it would be shimmering , a bit of electricity and a bit of mgnetism .
so if she was traveling alongside the light wave , it would n't be moving .
it would be static .
but maxwell says you ca n't have static light .
maybe maxwell is wrong .
the light travels from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
that does n't make sens .
einstein was about to enter a surreal universe where energy , mass and the speed f light intermingled in a way n one had ever sspected .
long before the french revolution , scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtelet 's translation s still the standard text in france today .
muse , my memory causes ...
for what offence the queen of heaven began
to persecute so brave , so just a man !
only the other night ,
i fear , however , that my wit is only a curiosity to others .
if only my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and the world will fall at your feet .
no ...
in one sense  she is a woman utterly out of her true time nd place .
du châtelet married a general in the french army at age 19 and had three chldren .
she ran a busy household , all the while prsuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mathematics .
she enthusiastically took lessons from one f the greatest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expert on newton , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they had a brif affair .
a fierce critic of the king and the catholic church ,
voltare had been in prison twice and exiled to england , where he became enthralled by the ideas of newton .
du châtelet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of jail .
and it is also true that émilie du châtelet did have several affairs of a fleeting natre .
bravo !
she created an institution to rival that of france 's royal academies of sciences .
ah , monsieur ...
you are young 
i hope that soon you will judge m for my own merts , or lack of them , but do not look upon me as an appendage to this great general or that renowned scholar .
i am n my own right a whole person , responsible to myself alone for all that i am , ll that i say ... all that  do .
du châtelet learned from the brilliant men around her , but she quickly developed ideas of her own .
much to the horror of her mentors  she evn dared to suspect tht there was a flaw in the great sir isaac newton 's thinking .
newton stated that the energy of an bject , the force with which it cllided with another object , could very simply be accounted for by its mass times its velocity .
he proposed that moving objects had a knd of inner spirit .
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four slabs along one edge and four along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplicatin , this building up by squares , is something yu find in nature all the time .
it is a return to the old ways !
it is the occult !
so all leibniz is asking is , where does all this force come from ?
you 're infuriating !
criticize this , denounce that .
 discovered you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been dropping lead balls into a pan of clay .
so , messieurs , care for a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
messieurs ,
i feel mr. newton 's reputation dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis !
well ... the ball travels fo times further .
it 's th best way to express the enrgy of a moving object .
if you drive a car at 20 miles an hour , it takes a certn distance to stop if you slam on the brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do be careful , madame .
do you think the academy is ready for such an opinion ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor is it your husband 's .
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du châtelet knew that in the 18th century for a woman to become pregnant at the age of 43 was really very dangerous , and all th while she was pregnant she had terrible premonitions about what was going to happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a young soldier that led to her demise .
six days after giving birth to her furth child , she suffered an embolism and died .
einstein pursued light right through university and beyond 
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors that no one would write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the young family struggled .
but , listen ...
about your promotion .
i 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very charming , but kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in arund him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't bother him .
i 'll tell you what is truly mysterious :
the mathemtics are fine , if a little unconventional , but this only works for big systems .
i disagree .
here w go ...
what would happen if one applied thse formulae to electromagnetic radiation ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bit of physics and apply it without proper regard to a completely different area .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linkages , the big theories , but would n't things be better all round if yo just got going in some small area ?
spoken like a true bourgeois .
they had cornered the question of light from every possible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it would take light to reach them from clocks at different distances ,
thank you .
what einstein did was completely turn the problem on its head .
that light wold always move away from you at 670 million miles an hor , even if you , too , were traveling really fast 
his extraordinary insght is that time ... as you approach the speed of light , time itself will slow down .
it 's a monumental shift in how we see the world .
yo see  before then people had assumed that time was lik a wristwatch on god 's hand , that it bat at a steady rate throughout the universe , no matter were you were .
that th tck , tick , tick of this wristwatch was actually the click , click , click
of electricity turning into magnetism turning into elctricity .
it starts with hs publication of a paper on how to work out the true size of atoms .
two months later is the publication of his paper on the nature of light ...
that 's what will earn him the nobl prze .
in it einstein sets out his theory f light , time and space .
it was the theory of specil relativity .
in einstein 's new world , the one true constant was not time or even space , but light .
in one last gret 1905 paper , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from our point f vew , the train actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even einstein is amazd by it .
i think i have found a connection between energy and mass .
if i m right , thn energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he simply stated that energy and mass were connected by the square of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year journey into light .
there is a deep unity betwen energy , matter and light .
you multiply tht by itself and you get 90 quadrillion 
prbably the most miraculous year in science ends n silenc .
the articles are published to resounding .
i think the gods are laghing at me .
for four yers insten swered each inqury dutifully  trying to explin his difficult , complex deas to a confsed physics community .
her are these univers-changing papers circling around , and the world is ... struggling to come to terms with them .
luckily it happened to be the most important living physicist .
he has sent his assistant .
after four yers of waiting , he is appointed professor of physics at zurich university .
from there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and married his cousin 
his fame led to numrous affairs .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of scinc .
it held out the promis of vast reserves of energy locked deep inside the atom .
but he had n't banked on the second world war and the genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-year-old ustrian lise meitner was painfully shy .
despite her anxiety , the young doctor of physics arrived in berlin detrmined to pursue a career in the exciting new field of radioactivity .
german universities did not employ female grduates .
otto hahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i think i could really help with the physical analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mthmatics .
studying radioactive atoms has become so much a collaboration betwen emistry and physics these dys 
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
at this time , not a lot was known about the atom .
but then ... in what are called radioactive metals , things like radium and uranium ...
the nucleus itself seemed to be unstable , laking out energy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus turning into energy .
he was given a laboratory .
she was forcd to work in a wood shop .
i see you have n't set your hair on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
god dy .
yes , where would we chemists be without the steadying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
yes  well , i have , um ... asked her to mrry me , and she has accepted .
oh ..
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was warm-hearted by nature .
she had many friends and she may have wanted to have a closer relationship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear research .
meitner and hahn were leading the race to se if even bigger nuclei could be created by adding more neutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty familiar :
the nucleus , made up of protons ... and neutrons .
now , the largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers our institute .
he was hunded out of germany in 1933 
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
what is it ?
what 's happend ?
i , um ...
we 're speaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finsh up .
hahn , who was known for his anti-nazi views , did his best to protect her , at least initially .
not now , i 'm too busy .
we hav to protect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbidden to lave germany .
lse ...
hrlein demands that you leave .
you ca n't throw her out .
horlein says you should not come into the institute anymore .
well , i have to write up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to cme in .
you 've given up .
when it became clear that meitner would be dismissed and probably arrested , physicists all around europe wrote letters inviting her to conferences , giving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague traveled to berlin and illegally took lise back wth him on a train to holland .
she had lost everything ...
her home , her position , her books , her salary , her pension , even her native language .
she had been cut off from her work just at the time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
no matter wht privations she suffered ,
unt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hhn was getting strange results .
he found no evidence to suggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size .
from afar , she was starting to suspect that something very different was hppening in their experiment .
hahn and strassman re getting some strnge results with the uranium work .
really ?
a couple of months ago , hahn told me that they were finding radium amongst the uranium products .
and now he writes to me and tells me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that 's even smaller 
it is at least possibl that barium is being produced .
so hahn stll neds you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be thre , can  ?
he has n't done what you told him t .
it turns out tht a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now for four years , meitner and hahn and ll other physicists had thought that if you pump more neutrons into this nucleus , it 'll just get bigger nd heavier .
realized this nucleus mght just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so big that it has trouble staying together , then could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but something has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no , no ... you 've split the atom .
of course , in the laboratory we 're talking about tiny amounts of uranium and correspondingly tny amonts of nergy .
but the point is that the amount of energy released was relatively large and that came frm the mass of the uranium itself .
meitner and frisch published the dscovery of what they called nuclear fission
to great acclaim .
bt betrayal awated them .
hahn maintained it was he and not meitner who had discovered nuclear fission .
shall my scientific past also be taken from me ?
and why s it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enough .
in 1942 , an intense effort to build an atom bomb was begun .
all over america , secrt installations sprang up under the code name the manhattan project .
she refused to have anything to do with the atmic bomb .
but robert frisch was different .
vast amounts of energy , in the form of electromagnetic radation , were released from a few pounds of uranium and plutonium .
today , young physicists carry on einstein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been usd to delve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest question of all ...
in the first moments of creation , the universe was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atoms nd it eventually formed the first stars 
it comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creates life itself .
eventually , a massive star dies , the debris floats around , clusters tgether , gets pulled into the rbits of another star and bcomes a planet .
building n the work of scientists through the ages , new generations are searching for answs .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyful .
it is as old as human curiosity itself and never , ever ends .

ｄａｄｄｙ， ｈａｖｅ ｙｏｕ ｅｖｅｒ seen a dragon ?
are dragons scary ?
they 're scary .
but they 're kind gods .
do n't eat things like fireflies .
they 've come .
what ?
but i wan na go too !
no !
you can give it to him .
does n't this carp look delicious ?
you 'll be able to catch something like this in no time .
you reckon ?
yeah .
something feels weird tonight .
i apologize sincerely for keeping you so late .
i stayed too long .
do n't say such things .
no !
but you 'll nevr know when they 'll suspect you ... the superiors are so bothersome these days .
indeed .
i dd n't mean to scare yo !
please excuse me .
i wo n't take much of your time .
about what 
according to there 's a plan to reclaim the ryuujin swamp and turn it into a paddy field .
tht plan ..
ths is beyond a meek monster like yorself .
p-please forgive my rdeness !
you !
kappa ... were n't you ?
but you were talking and looking pleased ...
stop lying !
you 're going to tell is n't that right ?
what are you talking about ?
stop pretending that you did n't hear !
forgive us !
forgive us !
forgive us !
do n't come here !
this !
give this and—
forget t and go back !
so please do n't get angry with us !
please forgiv daddy 
be quiet !
n-no !
just us !
daddy 
m i the only one without a holiday plan ?
this is serious .
it 's already july .
yo 're not planning to visit them 
where 's bali island ?
what 's there ?
i 'll find out once i get there .
damn you !
lame kikuchi !
hey !
i 'm heading off !
that hurt ...
a fossil of a tortoise ?
uehra-kun !
can you climb p ?
are you alright ?
you are n't hurt ?
wha—
it 's troublesome enough that the laundry 's not drying properly at th moment .
do n't increase the amount of laundry !
understood ?
mmm ...
do n't mmm me .
now go get changed .
yes ...
huh ?
what 're you doing ?
kouichi ?
what 'r you doing ?
umm ...
open this door !
'cos this kept getting in my way .
what ?
what is it ?
hey !
no !
no !
anywhere !
what ?
quickly !
is n't this a kappa ?
so in this kind of situation you come home early ?
dunno .
you 're early !
amazing !
it really looks like a kappa !
where did you find it ?
at kurome river .
yeah ... but it got bigger as i soaked it in water .
coo !
so i thought i 'd nme it coo .
no way !
you said the same thing when you picked up th dog on the street .
i do sometimes .
really !
it 's surprisingly cut !
please .
geez !
do n't ... kill me .
save ... me ...
sure 
so you could talk ?
did you feed it anything ?
i heard kppas are usually assocated so i gave it a few 
you know .
you hav to feed it with something that will give it more energy !
like what ?
let 's see ...
hey !
eh ?
what shall we do ?
let 's keep for the time being .
what ?
are we keeping it ?
your brother wants to keep it .
why do n't we help it ?
she 's really nnoying .
get lost .
geez !
thank you very much .
n-no problem .
is it close to kurume river ?
what ?
coo was born in the edo period ?
they wore their a top-knot .
what re you doing ?
what about samurai ?
swish !
slash !
something 's wrong with it !
is it the samurai ?
are you scared of samurai ?
i see .
my condolences .
there was an erthquake 
so you have been buried till now ?
why ?
that 's becuse ... and the era of the samurai ended more than a hundred years ago already .
i 'm greatly indebted to you .
thank you so much .
i shall return to ryuujin swamp .
but the outside world 's changed  lot since you last lived in it .

coo 's swimming is super awesom !
any kappa can swim like that .
kappas are amazing !
are they ?
it 's a river where you 'd expect kappas to be around .. so let 's visit thm tomorrow .
kay ...
this is a magari-ya .
found in heavy snow filled reas in northern japan .
it 's impressive ...
th kids from tokyo sure are different .
seriously !
t 's really a countryside .
they 'll bring fortune .
do you knw what a zashiki-warashi is ?
 do n't want you to b scared f it .
so what 's bent bout this magari-ya ?
on your own ?
kids frm tokyo are so independent !
and he eats well too .
h does .
a kappa ?
you must be the zashikiwarashi-sama .
that 's right .
but i ca n't find them .
i have n't seen any kappas in the last hundred years .
or have they all died ?
the wind blew .
go to sleep .
~ and it always will ; tomorrow will always come .
yeah ?
but yo do n't know if what the zashiki-warashi said is true or not .
i know .
let 's go hme .
we 're getting the bullet-train that departs in the afternoon .

they must be really salty fish !
let 's look for kappas elsewhere .

east kurume station
i 'd lik to hear your story about your kappa .
just for a bit !
take a photo !
i did n't do anything !
coo ?

coo 's swimming is super awesome !
that 's exactly why i 'm asking you not to !
co ?

you took it without our consent .
a dlphin 's a mammal

i 'm sorry but ...
about wht ?
come on .

is it true that kappa has a psychic power t break cameras ?
it 's probably false information .
but afterwards our cmeraman had a fever .
excuse me .
hold on a second !
they 're scary ... this matter 's become huge .
it 'd be really col if you did hve some superntural power !
what are you going to do about work today ?
the camera used to photograph the kappa was destroyed by some kind of powr .
we are nt .
damn it !
that 's the house !
i relly have to go ...
mom and dad got to go on tv .
it 's not as if i went on tv because i wanted to .
it 's my fault !

we 'd lke to take a closer look at the mysteries surrounding kappas .
shimizu-san is someone who has long believed in the existence of kappas and researched .. what s wrong ?
coo-chan .
sure 
what could that be ?
i just could n't think of kappas as just being imaginary monsters .
would you be able to show it to us ?
i want to see it .
that arm ..
because i can !
but ...
what to do ?
your ncestor killed my daddy !
my daddy was n't a mischievous kappa !
he was an expert kind and ...
an admirable kappa !
your ancstor suddenly drew out his sword and killd daddy !
the daddy who i really loved !
coo ...
coochan has th ability to see the past ?
do n't cry .
what 's going on in the studio ?
what 's happening ?
the commercials started .
calm down ...
damn it 
do nt be scared ...
we w n't do anything ...
get on !
wait !
hold on !
a kappa and a dog ?
okay !
what is this place ?
an arm ?
wait up !

coochan !
coo-chan !
no way !
is that coo-chan ?
coo-chan !
ossan !
are you alright ?
what ?

so please !
d n't run !
hold on tight .
here .
he did what we could n't do .
the kappa 's a dangeros monster !
get rid of it !
but the demands for a proper investigation into the powers that coo-chan holds has become stronger .
like this ?
i see .
one more time !
this is perfect .
it 's nothing .
hitomi !
yes .
what 're you two doing ?
brother 's the only one who 's being left out !
kouichi ?
not really .
shut up !

wait there !
brother says ... your dad said ... give that to me !
there 's no point we 'll be visiting a place with a clan river .
yay !
it 's not being decided yet .
we are .
right now everyone they 'll get used to him .
and then you 'll be able to live like yu used to .
why do n't you ask coo-chan ?
i did ask if he that his dad did 
coo-chan and his father ...
huh ?
i guess so ... kou-chan ?
no !
the gloomy miss-unlucky and the kappa brother !
watching that scene freaked me out !
it ca n't be helped 
did you check their dna ?

wishing coo all the best ... why do nt you stop him ?
why re you letting him leave so easily ?
do you remember telling me how lively coo was in the river at toono ?
i do ...
where we live and hw we live .
we were supposed to go ther !
coo sed t live daily in that kind of hbitt .
it 's not natural to him .
i used to think that humans were those sorts of monsters ... we probably are ...
then why do n't you just stay here ?
i 'll have to live like a human .
mommy and all my ancestors are waiting .
how could i face them if i 'd forgotten th way of the kappa when i get there ?
that 's why i 'm going .

it 's glop .
i 'm a handi wipe with hair .
that s right !
dig !

honey , honey .
come on .
george , shoot !
i gt it !
shoot !
yeah , i did it !
he just looked so small out there .
so lacking in bigness .
we have to give him room to grow .
i let him slice his own banana .
no ther mother does that .
with george walking beside him every step of the way .
a bit more than you 're giving him now .
maybe mum was right .
i guess it 's my fault .
that 's okay .
yo won the game .
no .
bogeys , 12:00 !
would n't it be cool if i actually flew this ?
yeah .
there 's only one problem .
mum .
hello , mrs. little .
he 's with stuart .
hi , will .
you want to take a break for a while ?
i brought my ps2 .
 want to play with will for a whil .
sonds like a lawnmower .
 'm not doing anything !
get the book !
it says , on takeoff , pull back on the throttle .
snowbell , get out of the way !
please , d n't hrt me !
what 's going on ?
stuart 's just flying in the house .
flying in the house ?
hit the dirt !
duck !
everything 's fine .
stuart , you destroyd it .
i 'm sure we can fix it with some glue .
no , we ca n't .
it 's much too dangerous .
thanks , stuart .
why do n't you take the boys home ?
come on , boys .
she treats me like a baby .
i 'll fix you both some lunch .
she just loves you so much .
but every cloud has a silver lining .
no , it 's an expression  stuart .
the thing about being a little is that you can look at any situation no matter how bleak , how hopeless and still see the bright side .
so you could find a new friend , too .
mentime , keep your chin up yur back straight and your heart open .
then what ?
and canada is separate from the united states becuse canadians like to be alone 
and please take your leftover lunches with you .
tony , would you like to come over to my house this fternoon ?

you can put me down now .
my legs are fine .
there used to be bandages in here .

must have happened when that falcon smashed into me .
it was part of our nest when i was a baby .

yeah .
how 's that ?
so tell me , stuart little , do you actually live here ?
oh , yeah .
the mddle little .

i 'd better go before it gets dark .
you ca n't go out there .

those flies rally come back on you .
i try to eat right and yet i still feel blated .
hi there .
sorry .

major hairball .
and yet we contine to lick ourselves .
unbelievable .
hey , snowbell .
she 'll be staying with us for a while .
staying ?
you ca n't just drag stray birds in here .
do you think this is a halfway house ?
she could have germs .
get rid of her .
we 're home .
little hi , little low .
that 's just how we greet each ther .
mother lttle hates when animals walk in here off the street .
from a falcon .
a falcon ?
they ar fierce creatures .
write a letter .
on the other hand , we have a hero here .
it 's a guy thing .
is n't it nice that stuart has a friend ?
i do n't think sturt thinks of her as a friend .
i mean he 's smitten .
he 's infatuated .
he 's bedazzled .
frederick , did you have many crushes ?
i 'm still having one .
stuart , i 'm full .
full ?
you eat like a bird .
come on , stuart , time for school .
i 'm not going to schol .
i 'm staying home to take care of margalo 
mothers ...
you know .
well , i do n't really know .
i wsh i had some adventures .
just walking out that door is an adventur .
go for it , kid .
the adventure begins .
the yankees won .
there we go .
can you say , walk with mummy ?
walk ?
nothing .
martha and i are going out for a bit .
say , bye-bye .
say , byebye , birdie .
fresh air .
you scared me .
what can i say ?
any valuables ?
chill me .
they ai n't got much .
the mum 's got a ring , but it 's only two carats .
i mean , they mostly just hav each other .
a moment while i vomit .
and maybe you like them .
who ?
you did .
i did .
when i 'm on a job , i never play around !
i guess when the weather gets too cold , you 'll just fly south for the winter ?
well , to tell you the truth , i 've never flown south .
yeah .
i mean , you know ...
i just ...
want some more popcorn ?
my pin .
just ...
oh , scottie .
good as new .
no , stuart , it 's not .
did yo really think i would n't find out ?
what are you talking about ?
big mistake !
never make a friend i can eat .
now , get me that ring !
that way , i do n't have to change the baby .
i 'll just ...
frederick !
what ?
my ring .
t 's gone .
what do you mean ?
unless ...
i 'll call the plumber !
what s going on ?
mum 's ring went down the drain .
i ca n't reach it .
what about me ?
i do n't know .
and smelly .
and cold .
but it 's mum 's ring .
now , if it gets too cold , or too scary you just tell us .
do n't worry , dad .
i can handle t .
will do .
there 's a lot of slimy stuff all over the walls .
what does it look like ?
can you see the bottom yet ?
is that a new top ?
you know , you have such taste .
simple elegance is what i call t .
well , now , do n't get excited , but someone that you and i love has volunteered to go down the drain to gt your ring .
stuart ?
good guess , mum .
you let our son go down th kitchen drain 
now , eleanor , do n't be upset .
it 's been well thought out .
now you can be upset .
are you okay ?
can you her me ?
i 'm slipping .
there is no more .
what else can we use ?
spaghetti ?
that 's too short .
we can tie it together with ...
hurry !
marglo , what are you doing ?
stuart , i 'm coming !
grab on !
are you all right ?
margalo , you 're the best friend i ever had .
i would not have let that happen .
you let him go down the drain .
irrational ?
what were you going to say ?
i know i 'm overprotective , it 's just i ca n't stand the idea of stuart getting hurt .
i 'm sorry , stuart .
you find the ring ?
everything but .
i ca n't find her anywhere .
maybe she just went for a wlk or a little flight around the neighburhood .
but why 'd she leave me her pin ?
withot even saying goodbye ?
yeah ?
i 'm going to find her .
and do n't try to talk me out of it .
 've made up my mind .
you c n't go out there .
then let me come with you .
cover for you 
and when you 're friends with stuart little , you 're friends for life .
well , if you wo n't let me come , at last get somebody to go with yo .
snow !
i should 've been more spcific .
i meant imprtant to me .
 'm going to look for her .
i ca n't forget her .
she 's in terrible trouble and i have to help her .

you do n't want to find him .
falcons are vicious .

snowbell  are you all right ?
stu , listen .

listen carefully .
not many people go up there .
salmon , catfish , tuna .
why do they taunt me ?
stay on track , will you ?
i 'm nervous .

i 'm sure they already know we 're gone and plan to replace me with a hamster .

maybe this means i 'm not really a little .
there is no silver lining !
oh , no .
my plane !
the silver linng !
ths is it !
all right , george , where is he ?
it 's wrong to promise your brother you 'll lie to yr parents .
but if he was in danger , that would matter more to me than the promise .
how would we all feel f anything happened to stuart ?
mum , dad , i 'm really sorry .
or , he could be fine .
we do n't have to assume the worst .
yes , you 're right .
mum .
i do n't think he 's puttering home .

you 'll never see me again !
there 's a place n south carolina where they do the best pecan pie .
instinct should take over .
all my life .
only ...
are you scared ?
somebody once told me , you 're as big as you feel .
just spread your wings and sar .
i 'll miss you , stuart .
i 'm not going t cry .
what 's the silver lining this time ?
bye-bye , birdie .

when she can fall from a tree and land on her fet , then i 'll be impressed .
ss-titres :
filou ; )
although your diplomas are equally specific , remember :
i now proudly present this year 's woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs graduating class .
bye .
we love you .
you have to write .
oh , i ca n't believe it 's been five years since grandma told me that i was a princess .
shut up .
lilly 's remained the same , as she continues to cause turmoil , but now as a graduate student at berkeley .
which she calls berserkeley.
how 's michael ?
look out the window , and welcome back to genovia .
of corse , i 'm completely excited to be gong back , but i 'm also a bit nervous .
grandma clarisse will step down by the end of this year as queen , and i 'll be taking over , since i 'm now 21 .
i know i studied diplomacy and political science at school , but ... there is no course in queen , or how to run a country 101 .
but grandma 's going to help m , and i 'll take over when she thinks i 'm ready .
in the meantime , i 'm going to live in a beautiful palace like in a fairy tale , and eventually sit on a throne and rule the people of genovia .
well , maybe fat louie can give me some help .
her royal highness princess amelia mignonette thermopolis renaldi has arrivd .
and her royal pussycat , sir fat louie .
the one downer in my fairy tale is i 've never been in love .
here she coms .
the eagle is flying .
she 's in the foyer .
beautiful .
but you 're late , your majesty .
greetings , good frends .
ah , good .

he 'll be okay .
by saturday , he 'll be actng like  different chimp .
i just ca n't understand it .
understand what ?
why he 'd give me tickets to tak you to the ball game .
he gave you tickets to take me to the game .
yeah , but i still think there 's some motive behind that 
and he 's honest .
nobody can say he 's not honest .
and as far as being trustworthy ,
i do n't know anyone i would trust more than steve .
jen , will you forget it ?
it 'll revolutionize this whole ndustry .
we can put ubc right on top .
will you see to it that i am not disturbed unless absolutely necessary ?

this story about a chimp selecting our tv shows .
what about it ?
well , do you believe it ?
i knew it all the time .
what do you think of the rumor of a chimp slecting our tv shows ?
ridiculous .
well , you know how those rumors get started .
maybe a chimp is behind this mess .
oh , no .
you 're all in on it .
 am so sick and tired of liking a show and having it pulled off the air or put in another time .
it drives you crazy .
i 'm getting to the point , i 'd like to take the tv and throw it out the window .
the last show i liked , they took off the air .
the minute i got to lke it , off the air .
how do i know what happened ?
i do nt know what happened to john .
that 's good .
gentlemen , television has had problems bfor .
i have ...
mr. crampton .
we 've had a tacit understanding to share technological advances .
we hav not .
just a minute 
i must speak for the justice department .
then there is a chimp ?
gentlemen , please .
admittedly , there is a chimp .
and it seems he does prefer the top-rated shows .
gntlemen !
i have a simple solution to the whole problem .
yes ?
oh , no , no .
we c n't do that .
oh , no 
we could n't ...
why , we 'd have those societies for the prevention of things all over our backs .
i hope it 's better than the bananas .
it 's practical and hmane .
that 's the problem .
that 's the one .
every man 's got his prce .
forget this whole rt race .
i ca n't be bought .
that 's a ..
well , of course it 's a lot of money .
your future is on the line .
now you listen to this .

this will be our final offer .
take it or leave it 
one millon dollars .

you do n't trust each other .
it 's jst that we 're getting together to have a little , uh , outing .

how do yo do ?
hello .
just out for a moonlight ride on my land .
who was with you ?

we 'll get to the bottom of this .
one of my men is dead .
there 's gon na be a murder trial .
i ought to have a doctor .
not enough 
the sheriff s charming .
sounds good enugh .
you do n't have any idea how big .
i 've only ben out here for a short time .
but i 'm putting together an organization bigger than anything the west has seen :
land , mining , cattle , freighting , speculation .
that does sound big .
and it sounds like it 'll take a lot of doing .
you 'll find i 'm pretty well-connected here .
i can show you a shrtcut to the whole proposition .
he got her first .
th pecos river runs throgh the middle of his land .
so ?
that 's a chessboard .
and if another man makes the right moves ... there might just be a new king of the pecos .
sheriff brady , jess evans , this is alex mcsween .
howdy .
what does he do ?
i prefer storekeepers .
i d n't intend to .
neither did riker .

first it was neemo , then riker .
what do we do ?
have some wanted posters printed up .
on who ?
he is ?

$ 100 , or ...
why get in a frazzle over chisum ?
you turn me loose on him ... there 'll be a sudden funeral right here in lincoln .

you just leave him alone .
i 'll take care of him .
that ai n't gon na be easy .
what 's the trouble , juan ?
we ca n't pay what they ask .
maybe they will .
about those prices , mr. murphy .
sign of a healthy economy .
why not ?
just in the spirit of healthy competition , of course .
de nada .
billy 
i hit where i aim .
nothing else  colonel .
we brught enough beef for white buffalo 's people to get by .
i 'll deliver the rest at the weekend , if it 's all right with you and white buffalo .
chisum 's word .
i am not interested in your opinion of mr. chisum 's word .
would you mind explaining ?
 do n't propose to dwell on them here and now .
when i heard what happened to your cattle ...
you do n't have to put it in triplicate .
i get the idea .
sgt .
braddock will escort you back to the reservation .
sergeant .
straightaway .
all right , follow me .
straightaway .
just a minute , sergeant .
he 's a prince of the comanche nation .

so long , bonney .
yes , ma'am .
it may be a chess game to murphy ... but i do n't like his methds , and i ca n't go along with him .
if i were you , i 'd cut off the water to his property .
new mexico could use another good man and woman

i 'd say you 're running with the best of 'em now .
chisum and tunstall are god company .

what 's that got to do with gettng married ?
the smell .
death .
buffalo hunters smell like old guts all the time .

that 's not the way .
murphy was in town durng the raid with 100 witnesses .
he 's surrounded by the law and by gunmen like evans .
axtell ?
he 's a gutless wonder .
but he 'll act under pressure .
do n't do anything to make it harder for him .
right wll prevail .
yes , henry , right will prevail , one way or another .
giv me that scattergun .

pouring in and out like they 're giving away fre whiskey .
yeah , i can see .
you know what i think ?
you go back and play solitaire .
i finished it , billy .
thinks he 's some kind of a war hero , or something like davy crockett .
what 'd you say ?
nothing ?
it 's a sign your saddles are starting to slip when a man starts talking to hmself .
i ai n't deaf .
well , mr .
good .
he s awake now .
thank you .
how 's the patient , sallie ?
a little impatient , i 'm afraid .
a little buzzing in my head , but other than that ...
i stopped by to sy goodbye .
goodbye ?
mr. chisum go along with that ?
he does .
you 've made a fresh start here , and you 've got a good futur .
i want you to promise me that you wo nt do anything to jeopardize it .
you 're gon na make me swear on the bible ?
no , lad .
your word 's always been good enough for me .
i thought perhaps you 'd like to practice your reading some more while i 'm gone .
well , thanks .
i would .
i 'll see yu soon , laddie .
yeah ?
i promise .
to william bonney .
j. henry tunstall .
good trip , mr. tunstall .
according to yo , everybody 's worthwhile .
no , a young chap i never even talked to .
and i watched that young man wlk to the gallows .
and i saw him hanged .
t will .
and sometime or sooner , it 's gon na happen .
t 's just gn na be you and murphy , head to head , and horn to horn .
and one hell of a fight .
but on of yo has got to lose .
there 's your prof , sheriff .
no-good cow thief putting his brand on my cattle .
yeah , i expect we ought to .
he 's leaving town .
hold tunstall in jail until i get back .
santa fe .
i 've got to see a friend .
say , tunstall , you 're a hard man to track down .
thought you could get away ?
we 're deputy sherffs , you know ?
my congratulations .
but what 's that got to do with me ?
got to do with your rustling mr. murphy 's cattle .
in the second place ...
in th second place , do n't give us that fancy foreign talk , mr. fancy-pants .
look here , i 'm going to roswell .
he did n't even have a gn .
he had a gun ... and he tried to use it .
'blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
'blessed are they that mourn , for they shall be comforted .
'blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness ...
'blessd are the pure in heart , for they shall see god .
'blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called the children of the lord .
'blessed ar the persecuted for righteousness ' sake ...
'for your reward in heaven is great . '
blessed be the name of the lord .
how 'd it happen ?
judge , my name is alex mcswen .
sheriff , i 'm gon na ask you just once more .
valverde , i think .
i 'm issung warrants for the arrests of both of those men .
john  i 'm empowering you and your men to bring back thse two ...
what are their names ?
deputies morton and baker ... dead or alive .
i 'm afraid of what he might do 
whatever he does , it 'll be legal .
jess evans rode up right fter the shooting .
it 's hard to believe about henry tunstall .
yes , nd t 's hard to believe he carried a gun .
resisted arrst .
that 's too bad .
it 's just too bad .
would you excuse us , jess 
all right , lawrence .
howdy .
have n't seen two men that look like they 'd rode just as far ... a day or two head of us , have you ?
fed up their horses here yesterday .
where d they go ?
hold it up .
you 're gon na shoot us , ai n't you ?
i thought about it .
saw hm hang .
said it was ghastly .
and that 's the word :
ghastly .
you two are gon na hang .
pat , take 'em on in to lincoln 
let 's go .
hello , pat , charlie , tom .
you should n't be up and around , billy .
they wo n't be for long .
and you believe that ?
john chisum does .
we 'll see .
pat , i never did thank you for hauling me out of that river .
what promise ?
so long , charlie , tom !
it was the kid .
all right , cut 'em loose .
i 'm forming a posse .
damn .
the governor is not to be disturbed .
but , sir ...
wake up , sam .
good god !
get rid of that damn fool , wll you ?
what ?
him !
it 's all right , george .
now , what in heaven 's name happened ?
believe me , you 're in the firing line .
you better do something ... before president hayes decides you ca n't handle this territory .
what do you suggest that i do ?
first , justice wilson is chisum 's friend .
you 've got plenty of grounds .
what els ?
governor axtell has appointed  new sheriff :
and i 'm adding a further reward .. of $ 1,000 , dead or alive .
have you got anything you want to add to that , sheriff ?
john , since governor axtell hung me out to dry ... there s nothing i can hlp you with .
i 'll head back to mesilla in the morning .
all right , j.b .
i 'm writing president hays a letter asking for an mpartial investigation ...
by that time , murphy 'll have his name on evrything between arizona and texas .
mr. murphy ... just how much of lincoln county are you after ?
you have anything to say to that , mr. chism ?
you 're not just getting started .
the line 's been drawn .
but if ne of your men cross my land , or even touch one of my cows ... or do anything to that store ..
i 'm coming to see you .
mr. chisum , that sounds like a threat .
wrong word :
fact .
billy , why did you come back ?
all of lincoln county 's looking for you .
they ai n't gon na find me .
i 'm gon na get anybody who had anything to do with it .
they 'll try .
maybe he wants the reward .
you know pat garrett better than that .
look , pat , you saved my life ... and i 'm sorry i had to clout you .
put it down , pat .
you two walk away .
billy , all you 've done is bollix things up .
the governor 's ppointed another murphy man sheriff .
so ?
but you 're affecting the lves of a lot of othr people .
maybe it funnels down to her , to .
there was a girl once ... back in texs .
i knew that the best thing for me to do was to turn my back 
let her marry a man that 'd make her happy .
i 'll ride .
i did n't intend that you should hear that .
helps me understand a lot of things .
your father was a good man .
yes , he was 
i knw you did what you thought was right for all of you ... and that 's what you 're doing now .
maybe you should have let mother make her own choice .
she did .
so will i .
knock a lot of horseshoes loose in them rocks ... and all for nthing .
that nodeen .
i shold 've killed him when i had the chance down in guadalupe .
let 's get started .
first off , we 're gon na hit murphy 's bank and take his money .
he 's got a safe as big as a barn .
we 'll blow it opn .
we 'll need dynmite .
we 'll need some more men .
about half a dozen .
there 's brown , scurlock .
middleton 's all right .
and while you 're visiting the bank ...
i 'll be visiting mr. murphy .
i want you and some of the boys to deliver 'em to tucson .
no .
i 'm gon na fnd him , and i 'm gon na see him dead .
hell , you know we 're gong in the saloon with you .
whose move ?
wind 's from the north .
comanches call it tahnimara .
you know , pat ... there have been a lot of stories about john chisum .
about how wild he was .
those were wild times .
uncle john , billy bonney .
do n't you ?
not in the important things .
like what ?
mr. chisum 's changed with the times .
about the indians and the territory 
he 's independent ... and he likes to do things his own way , but he cares .
but you heard him , all he cares about is getting those men .
in a way , does n't it amount to the same thing ?
billy wants reveng .
and there s a big difference between love and infatuation .
johnny !
who is it ?
who 's dwn there ?
billy ?
no , sir .
we jst ned the loan of a little dynamit .
dynamite ?
d n't you think you 've done enough ?
bonney .
billy , listen to me .
i 've written a letter to the president .
this whole thing is a travesty .
i do n't know what travesty means , but i made a promise , too .
evans .
what d you want ?
alex , is evrything all right ?
billy .
honey , everything is all right .
it 's okay , ma'am .
we just need some supplies .

i 'll get a bullet in the back trying to escape !
billy , we 've got to get sue out of here .
sheriff , this is mcsween .
i 'm here .
i give you my word , there 'll be no tricks .
it 'll look better this way , sheriff 
we do n't want any women getting killed .
no , alex .
all right , she 's coming out !
lawrence ?
i 'm trying to help you .. to keep you alive .
the army has no jurisdiction here .
sheriff ...
i 'm unarmed , and i 'm coming out alone !
no , you ai n't !
not alone .
them 's my terms .
mr. murphy ..
i 'm not cming out , nodeen .

mr. mcsween , it 's your wife .
she 's going for chisum !
exctly , we 'll fight him on our wn ground .
get sme men by the river in case they come in that way ... and throw a barricade across that street .
mr. mcsween .
all right .
dmn it !
where are you going ?
going to warn the noon stage .
that 's wht we 'r doing .

we 're ready for him now .
it 's to keep somebody out .
we 'll be slaughtered .
i 'm going out there nd talk to murphy .

sheriff , murphy ... hold your fire !
do n't , mr. mcsween !
you heard my terms !
get some torches !
i 'll burn th son of a bitch out .
we could go around and come in from behind .
we 'd have to cross that river .
we 'd be sitting ducks .
we do exactly what we started out to do , mr. pepper .
yu wanted him on your own ground .
you got him .
billy .
ai n't like old times ..
billy .
can you make it ?
yu were the primer , billy .. but i guess , sooner or later , the lid had to blow off .
sheriff left town .
he wo n't be hard t follow .
let it go , billy .
be seeing you , big casino .
general lew wllace takes oath as new governor of territory .
do that mean the war is over ?
i would n't be too sure .

and this is our national pastime , the game of baseball as played by the pittsburgh pirates .
i did n't know a thing about baseball .
the sports edtor wanted the woman 's angle .
all i knew was that pittsburgh was losing .
he 's out !
maybe even angry .
what 's the matter with you ?
he was safe by that much !
all right .
... on ne base was too many .
you 're out !
great , that 's the first time you three guys have been together all season .
the score at the end of th game was cincinnati 21 pittsburgh 2 .
you through , jenny ?
you hit them on a bad day 
yeah ?
yeh , they had a good one back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should talk to mcgovern .
everybody should talk to mcgovrn once .
how do i get down there ?
yo see that second tunnel there ?
yah .
the door on the right is the prate clubhouse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates ' exhibition this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the national league .
by the way , i 'll not be with you for the balance of the season .
steps hve been taken and briefly , your announcer has been canned .
i 'll still have my regular tuesday-night bradcast and wednesday television and i shall continue to call the plays as i see them .
this is fred bayles saying , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
no , no , ldy .
press .
gangway .
he 's unhappy .
i think it was a waste of tme to send me .
i do n't know the game and i have n't any story .
but i can tell you what 's wrong with th pirates that mcgovern person .
and all those nice , clean-cut young men and the way he bullies them .
no wonder they mak mistakes , anybody would .
if you ask me , the pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him .
hey , write it .
but he 'd sue us .
do your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anybody die out there ?
what a depressing job .
mr. kirney must have liked the story .
by jnnifer paige , 'household hints ' editor .
every morning about 1 1:00 , he left for the field .
this is the only hack in pittsburgh ?
you know the law , sonny 
you 're supposed to stay with your cab .
the bums do n't start until 1:30 .
his afternoons were spent like this .
the only place he was seen in public , outside the ballprk was john 's steak house .
i 'm going over and talk to him .
oh  stop .
well , there he is , cornered .
waiter ?
i 'm jennifer paige .
i wrote that story about you this morning , in the messenger .
well , i began this way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evil-tongued orator of the baseball field , is a surly , unbred goat whose mouth should be washed out with a strong detergent .
you 're not md ?
i do household hints on the ladies ' page .
but i have a few facts and figures about your --
a few statistics that might be interesting .
for instance , last season , minelli had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prov something ?
i ll have to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's average is way down to , 93 ponts .
he 's the obituary editor .
what do you hear from want ads ?
well ,  realize figures can be misleadng but whn an entire team goes as sour as the pirats well , i look around for a reason , and i look right at you .
how are things in seventh place ?
catch me tonight , i m on n an hour .
i 'm gon na run you out of this town , maybe right out of organized baseball .
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in here a minute , huh ?
before  say good night ,  would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unbiased observer who hs the best interest of baseball at heart .
there is nothing personal in my feud with guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final score :
the pirtes had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all by yourself .
did you think that was second base ?
you re gon na catch a fly ball some of these days and knock your front teeth .
you fellas may not believe this but saul once pitched a two-hitter in a world series 
but he 's still in there pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do nt you thnk yo 're old for this pastime ?
we used to have a guy like that n the three-i league .
put gunpowder in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern always been like this ?
sixteen years ago .
where 's my good-luck piece ?
well , where is it ?
of all the empty-headed , buck-brained trainers .
close your fat muth .
i wan na talk to you .
an angel .
how 's that ?
i 'll mke him an angel .
where do yu sit ?
sure , sure , gabriel .
trumpet player .
none of your lip , or i 'll bot you over the wall .
now you 're getting warm .
kep talking .
somone down there has been sending up prayers on your behalf .
one punch !
before he answrs those prayers he 'd like to clean you up .
there 's certain rules .
i 'll give them to you fast .
quit making life miserable for everybody around you .
why ca n't i see you for one moment ?
stay where you ar .
stand still and listen or i 'll blast you with a bolt of lighting .
now , do n't rile me , boy .
just behav yourself and we 'll get along fine .
lay off swearing and fighting , and i 'll win you some ball games .
yu 'd like to win a pennant again , would n't you ?
how about that ?
all right , aloysius , you trusting soul .
what kind of a miracle ?
wait a --
you 're out 
safe .
out .
i was about to suggest that possibly you erred on that decision .
yes , sir .
on the road , they won 10 games straight .
the team was sixth when they played the brves in boston .
a hrd-fought game .
boys  boys , please , take it easy .
now , i 'll handle this .
let me --
ten straght games , and you had to go and blow it .
now , look , i -
take off your hat .
i herd what you said .
do n't repeat it .
now , look , the guy called me an ape .
certainly .
i 'll be tongue-tied .
shakespare was n't .
okay .
i keep my trap shut , i win all my games ?
yes , it would .
but when you need us , we ll be in there pitching .
who 's we ?
me and my boys , the heavenly choir nine .
in heaven ?
there 's plnty of ball players in heaven .
what d you know 
but very few managers .
how do your boys help ?
who 's on your squad , the heavenly choir 
not bad .
we might have run into each other .
on what base ?
come on  a guy 's got a right to know his own angel .
your broken-down ball club is winning ball games .
i 'll see you around 
listen 
goodbye , and keep your nose out f things that do n't concern you .
all right , all right .
do n't go away sore  huh ?
sorry , mr. mcgovrn .
sit down , son .
well , i told minell i 'd have dinner with him .
i do n't know 
a left-hander ?
i do n't know , just call it a hunch .
he 's reading shkespeare .
the tempest , i had it in english iii .
he asked me to sit down with him .
yeah , this morning he said hello .
he has n't changed ...
waiter ?
you do what i said ?
this is all right ?
thanks , but i 'd like to digest my dinner .
you did all right in the ld days .
remember how we used to tear around ?
i do n't wan na think bout you .
do yu mind ?
your steak all right , sir ?
stay in there and keep it high .
if he feeds t to modbury low , he 'll put it in our laps .
oh , dear .

thu hast eyes but seest not !
you hard him , he said fair .
now , let 's get it , come on .
attaboy , joe .
it was the sixth inning 
things were looking bad for the pirates .
then suddenly it happened .

how do you feel , dear ?
there they are again !
the kid is seeing angels .
ai n't nothing to what i 've seen sometims .
but i see them , sister , big as life .
in the outfield , in the infield --
and there 's one sittng on the scoreboard .
do you want to leave again and not come back ?
no , sister .
it was gettng t be a habt .
i had my story for the day .
yes ?
i 'd lke to see a little girl 
that would be third grade , my class .
would you wait just a moment , please ?
h 's looking for a little grl .
i think you should talk to some of the others too .
oh , mr. mcgovern .
well , how do you do ?
i came abot the story in the paper .
yes , i read it .
is she the little girl who saw the angels ?
well ,  just want to ask her a couple of questions .
bridget , wait in my office .
yes , sister .
thank you .
yes .
federal case .
yeah .
g on .
would it do any harm just to talk to her ?
i do n't want the child excited .
yes ?
well , that 's just it .
why , it would be completely unexpected .
rothberg 's fast .
he 'd have made home easily .
yeh , well , rothberg happens to have a bad ankle .
oh , i 'll light a candl for him .
it says yesterday you sw angels 
are you sure ?
with wings ?
sort of like unforms .
what color socks ?
i could n't see .
thir robes were too long .
how many were there ?
was ther one behind me ?
is he there now ?
figures .
now , about these sort of like uniforms was there any writing across the chest like new york maybe , or cardinals or dodgers ?
heavenly choir .
well , why was that , do you suppose ?
you must have been praying pretty hard , huh ?
thanks .
well , you needed help , did n't you ?
we sure did .
keep them coming , huh ?
no , no , no , you ca n't see her .
i 'm sorry .
now , please go away .
the whol story is ridiculous .

do n't you dare .
do n't you print that picture , young man .
evening post , sister .
it 's a beauty .
oh , boy , there 's guffy .
no comment .
no comment .
maybe he believes in them .
what are you doing here ?
where 's your harp ?
if you want to know about angels , ask her .
she wrote the story .
look out , now  i 'm getting out of here .
now what did i d ?
what can i do for you ?
honestly , i had no idea that story would raise such a fuss .
if i had , i never would have -- oh , what a mess this place is .
i nevr would have writtn it .
goat , monkey , i 'm used t it .
if i were you , i 'd protect myself , mcgovern .
make a statement .
to you ?
why not ?
miss paige , you 're ruining my carpet .
stuff them with newspapers , turn on the oven and put them underneath .
yes .
did yu teach it ?
what else does he say ?
joe , say godbye to the lady .
goodbye .
that 's wonderful .
but does n't he ever -- ?
miss paige , a man only swears when he 's annoyed .
well , frankly , i do n't see how you can be in a shambles like this .
there might b an idea in that .
even when yo were little ?
you had a boyhood , of course .
sounds like a nice little town .
did yo play ball there ?
they had one of the saloons .
and one day thy gave you a ball and a bat , nd that 's how you got started .
not exactly .
any more down-mmory-lane stuff you 'd lk ?
n 
of all the stupid , asinine --
and how do i get to the cab ?
i weigh 110 pounds .
when the cleaning woman comes , tell her to brn the old papers .
put an air wick in to get rid of that cigar smell --
scour the ashtrays with ammonia .
what chair ?
burgundy .
she can call me at the office , extension 1173 .
there .
i could be a big help to you .
just what i always neded , a girl with turned-up shoes , 110 .
yeah .
if i took her to the ball game and we sat in the grandstand ot of the sun she would n't see any angels .
i 'd write the story just that way , and that 'd be the end of it .
can i ?
all right  run along .
comb your hair , put on a hat .
bridget and i got pretty chmmy during the game , exchanging girlish confidences .
vanilla okay ?
mac , i think that 's enough .
oh , jenny , how about dinner after the game ?
well , have fun .
that must be nice .
i mean , instead of havng a lot of kids around all the time .
it depends .
i always say , why not live alone if you can lve alone ?
take like if you have somene around the house all the time you could n't even come to the ball game when you wantd .
not unless i brought her with me .
what 's the matter ?
who ?
there they come , out on the field .
there 's no one .
you could n't possibly see anything there , do you hear me ?
they 're going .
jenny .
jenny , wait a minute .
honey .
honey , did you see any angels ?
how many were there , bridget ?
take this .
thank you .
what did you do to her ?
nothing .
why 'd you want to drag her out there ?
i did n't drag her  she was dying to g .
fine help .
mcgovern 's angels strike again .
what you trying to do  laugh me out of baseball ?
were they by angels or girl angels ?
sore , huh ?
they were n't groundkepers ?
or they were peanut vendors ?
mr. mcgovern nd miss paige , they 'd like to see bridget .
oh , please .
organically , she 's fine .
he can do no harm  he 's an excellent man .
you understand , do n't you ?
sure .
you want to find out if i 'm wcky .
doctor , i 'm sure it 's not necessary .
how 're you feeling ?
much better  thank you .
i brought you  present .
yu should n't have .
oh , it 's nthng .
it 's beautiful .
imagine .
it 's just a kid 's kangaroo .
i 'll take it back ...
oh , no , please .
i love it .
miss paige too ?
me too .
now , i think you better get some sleep .
this story became a nationl issue .
everyone was talking about angels .
if mcgovern needs any xtra angels , we 'd be glad to give him a couple of ours .
ty cobb , one of baseball 's all-time grats .
well , all i can say is that this game of basebll has certainly changed .
songwriter harry ruby , composer of thre little words america 's number one baseball fan .
you know , i think this angel stuff 's pretty sound .
thanks .
now , if you 'll just go back to your seats so everybody can see .
just turn this knob , see ?
now watch .
the monster is trying to put on a legcrusher .
vry educational .
yeah .
when the pirates climbed int third place , the newspapers laid off mcgovern .
wait , let him hit away .

thattagirl .

yeah , brignole smells great .
mrs. harkrider oates of rawson avenue .
is that so ?
well , we won again today , did n't we ?
yeah , we did .
i 've heard some talk .
just a few weeks ago we were last .
wonder how it happened .
angels .
right there .
me ?
sure  the pirates are playing as a tam .
because you 're not losing your temper , nd yelling your head off and swinging on people .
you should turn the other cheek .
there 's two schools of thought on that .
my schol recommends getting in the first punch .
well , what do you know , a baseball .
jennifer sent it into the clubhuse and all the pirates signed it .
see ?
all except mr. hellman .
it 's just what i wanted .
what about grace ?
grace who ?
you lad off .
oh , lord , make us truly thankful for these thy gifts which we are bout to receive .
amen .
no , no , it 's delicious .
oh , no do n't .
keeps men at home , does it ?
could it have been rancid ?
hw long have you had it ?
in the bottle in the cupboard .
i rub it in my glove .
keeps the leather soft .
 got ta put it someplace .
well , it certinly does n't do anything for veal .
the peas re fine .
i should have looked at the bottle .
now , wait , wait .
do n't lose your head .
how 's that , all right ?
yeah , yeah , keep moving .
i do n't like to intrude , but may i have your autograph , mr. mcgovern , on a check ?
repairing bridgework , $ 180 .
just send me the bill , first of the month .
look at my --
will you stop 
i thught you 'd like to see what you 're paying for .
look , blow , huh ?
please .
oh , sure , sure .
do n't worry .
what ?
no .
grat shape .

nobody 's bothering you tonight .
nobody will .
if any party tries to bother me , i 'll hook him in the mouth .
now , wait a minute --

you ll have to carry her .
up we go .
thank you .
oh , n , no , i just --
right up t bed now , dear .
good night .
that 's a sweet kid , that one there .
nicest time i ever had .
well , thanks .
they all seem to want tiny babies now .
i 'd be afraid .
well , it would present certain problems .
there 's no law against it , of course .
thanks .
well , like a father .
oh , well , i do n't have to tell you , but that 's all over , believe me .
it 's a thing of the pst .
no langage , not even one fight .
good night , sister .
god night , mcgovern 
she 's rally a sweet child .
have you evr thought of adopting her ?
who , me ?
well , this is where i live .
what kind of problems ?
problems .
bet that 's the first black eye you 've had in years .
you 'd better go home and fix it .
lok , you make a move , i 'll make a move , huh ?
there was a girl in saint paul , the nicest girl i ever knew .
i can imagine .
good night .
sister ?
in september , the pirates met the giants in the final series .
stay there , boy .
make him pitch to you .
two and two , boy .
make him pitch to you .
how do you feel ?
it 's nothing .
did it again , did n't i ?
why did i have to go and wave at you ?
where am i having dinner ?
you 're not going anyplace except home .
hi , guffy .
nice catch .
you okay ?
 've been ht in the head 20 times .
i feel fine .
you speak to angels ?
where they running ?
is n't it wonderful ?
his latest peccadillo  an admission to the press that he converses with angels ... .
y could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he now commands .
i would like to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us your name , please ?
i 'm a groundskeeper at braves fild , up in boston .
will you please tell us what yo saw in braves field about seven weeks ag ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern .
after the game .
sitting on second base .
and what was he dong ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
there ws n't anybody there .
and when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who was n't there , whre was he looking ?
up .
but one thing he said was ,  have a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable man to hang around second base at night and talk to angels ?
mch as i hesitate to say this i think that mr. mcgovern should take a long , long perhaps permanent rest .
what 's eating yo ?
so we won a ball game , so hooray .
i tell yo , it 's mking me jumpy 
every time i go after a ball , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over something .
for two cents , i 'd quit right now .
shut up .
you watch mcgovern looking over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trying to be a right guy .
your job is to got out nd play ball .
keep your mouth shut , understand ?
wtch it , here he comes .
and here 's a flash that was just hnded to me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh tonight .
with the pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afrid the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out ther this afternoon .
with this hanging over their heads , there 's no telling what they 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
they 're getting nervous .
not that i blame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't worry much about it .
it 's only natural at a time like this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , that s ?
you know  i used four this afternoon .
who do i start tomorrow ?
yeah .
well , i would n't worry about it .
even i could n't make him look good .
they wan na send him to the minrs .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around next season .
yeh .
at least , we used to be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen ,  have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidence , i have nothng t say .
... tomorrow for the pennant .
i 'm aware of tht .
think this is the proper time for the nvestigation ?
my dear lady , any time 's the proper time when the situation warrants it .
baseball is for the people who support it .
from new york  sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to them ?
originally , man worshipped th sun , the moon , stones , trees .
nvented ?
just as a hurt child will rn to its parent so will a man turn for comfort to a belief in angels .
nd when this belief takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustace dnforth , trinity church .
rabbi allen hahn , temple israel .
how do yo do ?
fther o'holihan , church of our lady , queen of the angels .
gentlemen , just make yourslves comfortable .
mr. commissioner ?
well , what do you think ?
do you suppose there might be angels ?
right to lft .
to deny the existence of angels is to deny the wrd of the holy bible which is specifc on the subject .
from the ancient hebrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sons of god .
thank you , rabbi .
it was an angel who guided th children of israel to the promised land .
the angel of the lord encampeth round about thm that fear him and delivereth them .
seeing as how there are coveys of angels flitting through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how i can get out of saying i believe in them .
i imagine the commissioner does too .
oh , please , just lave me out of this .
mr. commissoner ?
is it likely one of your angels or a group of angels would lend supprt to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is it possible that angels would aid and comfort such a man ?
thank you , gentlemen 
if dr. blane would cre to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
however --
mr. commissoner .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?
mr. mcgovern , what are you afraid of ?
all right .
bridget whte , 8 years old .
st. gabriel 's home for orphan girls .
does n't everyone ?
no .
thy were helping the pirates .
you 're quite sure about that ?
you wuld n't just make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certainly , certainly , certainly .
no .
because mr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angl would be proud to talk to a nice man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , please .
what are you talking about ?
i will decide what is evidence here .
suppose i did ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nothing definite .
i d n't know if the court will let me hve her .
it 's touching .
come on , stop tht .
stop that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think , in view of the facts all things considred this case is dismissed .
hey , fellas , what 's with guffy ?
sure , sure .
he was kay all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , you heard what the fell said .
just stick to your driving , will you ?
i only hit him once or twice .
because whn you busted that bridgework , you also busted our agreement .
from now on , you 're on your own .
it 's no joke .
you c n't walk out on me now .
i need you .
do n't worry , you 've been on your own a lot the last eight weeks .
i do n't like t be on my own .
you used to be .
you 've learned something , guffy .
we 're a little prod of y .
sorry , ca n't make it .
tell that cab driver to slow down .
so long , guffy .
come back here a minute , will yo ?
the boys in the press box are asking .
they wan na know who 's gon na pitch .
let 's do it , boy .
for new york , barbrry catching , toley pitching .
hellman ?
take care of the bullpen , will you , boy 
yeah , sure .
and it 's over the leftfield wall for a home rn .
safe .
there 's another ht .
see any angels yet ?
new york 1 , pittsburgh nothing .
come on , vince boy , let 's go t work .
get a hit , boy .
you 're out .
all right , only one away .
lay into it  tony boy .
lay into it .
knock it out of the park .
mandekic pulls up safe at second .
two away and rube ronson coming up .
all rght , rube .
all right , let 's get out .
let 's go .
here we are at th top of the ninth , the final frame with a score still pittsbrgh 2 , new york 1 .
one away .
seems to be giving him some trouble .
either it 's pain or those giant averages .
and he takes his base .
hit by a pitched ball .
well , hellman seems to be losing control in there .
leaping high in the air and spearing the ball .
he 'll never make it .
ball one .
take him out !
get him out of there !
the fans are yelling to take hellman out 
get him out of there !
get him out of there !
and those pirate fans are really mad now .
get him out of there !
take him out !
yank him !
what do you think , saul ?
i 'm tired , but i 'd sure lik to try .
it 's your ball game .
h 's leaving hellman in .
cming up to the plate now is dobbie roscalla who leads the league in rns batted in .
if he bats one now , mr. mcgovern had better leave town .
strike !
oh , if he ever conncted with that one ... .
he 's a very tired pitcher right now .
for what ?
pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
and of course , a pennant for th pirates .
well , somebody must have helped me , not only on the ball field either .
i wonder who they were .
walter johnson , john mcgraw , christy mathewson eddie collins , lou gehrig , babe ruth 
play ball .
â™ªâ™ª
wll , i think i 'm actually finished .

yeah .

but yu know how i feel .
i 'm always soccer mom fr you .
yes , honey .

up , up and away !
i did n't really see too much of it , actually .

we 'll see who 's the best shooter 
well , at least you 've got a career in field goal kicking .

she definitely hates me .
i wish you would n't do that .
relax .
i zip around at nearly the speed of light .
nobdy 's gn na see me .

i 'll just fry a couple of brain cells , baby .
and can you do me a favor ?
keep it a little low-key around your brother
why ?
i mean , he 's gn na be getting his powers
any day now , right ?
it does n't look likely .
but i did n't start to get my powers
until a couple of weeks before my big 1-4 .
you man ...
scott might b ...
normal ?
yeah .
what were you thinking , malcolm ?
you could have destroyed everything .
besides , there 's nthing left to destroy , ok ?
your stupid program did n't ven work .
i mean , after you 're done running all yur tests ,
how are we supposed to get one of these to every kid in the country ?
i do n't know .
i had n't ..
i had n't thought that far .

... once again proved that crime does not pay .
they successfully apprehended three robbery suspects ...
i mean , no guns , no note , nothing .
i hope we 're not dealing with some new criminal mastermind .
can i take hm out , please ?
if you melt the patio furniture again , young lady ,
you 're in a lot of trouble .
hey , dad .
that 's pretty impressive in my book .
yeah , but i missed that goal .
maybe you were a little off
because you got a little super strength coming on ?
well , at least you 're the king .
ok .
i 'm not gon na be a superhero , am i ?
i mean , you still have three whole days left .
you know , there 's tons of superheros
that dd n't get their powers until the day before .
flame guy , rockt man , jello girl .
uh , yeah .
definitely .
and no spinach ice cream for you tonight , young lady .
mom !
it 's not far !
i 'm gon na be th best superhero ever .
are you in yet ?
there .
access granted .
unfortuntely , now we have a herd of rabid superheros
out looking for us .
what ?
yo did n't even get any money .
i mean , we are so close to really helping the planet 
do n't worry , nina .
of course , it would be easier f we knew where they were .
i 'm sure they have some fabulous , high-tech secret lair somewhere .
what do you mean , you told him there 's still time 
we all do .
he 'll be humiliated .
and then we can cancel the party .
you 're just disappointed because you ca n't brag to yor buddies .
honey , you want him t be a superhero just as much as i do .
i just always thought sctt would go into the famly business .
honey , all he really needs is a glimpse of some power
if he could morph like his grandmother , i 'd be happy .
oh , dad , can i just take that , please ?
why ?
do n't you think i can handle it ?
no .
like they were lincoln logs
i lifted up the cadillac the other day
hey , grandpa !
what did i tell you ?
ne more day .
when your father went through this phase ,
we had to put a new foundation on the house .
that is so cool , scott !
i want to see you do something .
he can show off after dinner .
have some more spinach , honey .
you have your super strength to maintain .
oh , we had spiderman and mry jane over for dinner last night .
they come right up .
this is some good spinach casserole .
i think we might be in for a major crime wave .
uh-uh .
did you try to fly ?
maybe a little .
did not .
molly !
scott , that 's fantastic .
i ca n't even fly .
considering who his father is ?
since you were born .
man , i am so jealous .
yeah .
yeah !
fly ?
i 'll just say it was a fluke .
i 'm not fooling anyone .
because i 've got muscles of steel .
and then that clark crl in the middle of his forehead knt cmes along ,
and starts calling himself , the man of steel .
what does that make me ,
oh , he hit the tree !
where is he ?
he 's flying .
yo know how difficult those can be .
before there 's an altercation with  low-flying plane .
ok .
ok , honey .
up !
up !
look out !
congratultions !
scott , are you ok ?
oh , honey , we are so proud of you .
we 're gon na celebrate .
let 's go downtown and have some ice cream .
whatever .
molly , molly .
i 'm gon na give him a few pointers .
thanks .
yeah .
like i said , they cme and go .
kind of like the door this afternoon , huh ?
with all those screws loose ?
pretty shoddy workmanship , huh ?
scott ..
do they ?
and they could n't be more excited for you .
grandpa , please do n't say anything , ok ?
i know , but i had to .
they were gon n end up canceling the party .
lok , the party is in honor of you becoming a superhero .
ok .
ok .
thnks , grandpa .
i love you .
hey , son .
oh , hey , dad .
yeah .
with all the excitement last night ,
i kinda forgot to do my homework .
welcome to earth protctors .
listen very carefully to the following instructions .
scott !
oh , that was quick .
hope all the assignments are this easy .
i just need to change , ok ?
mesmerized ...
good morning , adam 
hey , dd .
the guys from the bank robbery escaped .
all th cells opened automatically .
i bet they 're clling it a computer malfunctin .
yah .
a hunch .
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
at first i thought the criminals used some srt
it could 've been generated within the computer itself .
silver charg , tak a look .
i 'm on it .
very good work .
it really works !
every single one of them !
recycling ?
looks like we can make em do anything we want .
what are you doing ?
really weird , 'cause it 'll men you got a bckbone transplant .
hy .
blue .
you 're all wearing blue .
i did n't even notice .
hey , randy , think fast !
hey , scott , think fast !
why 'd you do that ?
now she 's gon na think i ca n't catch .
yeah .
now that you have these powers ,
yo 'r gon na have to be a lot more careful .
aluminum foil is the one thing
that screws up our molecular structure .
too much of it can kill us !
yo 're right thugh .
i mean , how 're w gon na expand this thing ?
i mean , we owe it to the planet
we 'll meet up with you later .
cool .
bye 
actually , i added a little pizazz t today 's lesson .
snack time .
buy anything  want 'em to buy ,
watch anything i want 'em to watch .
you see , nina 's problem is , she wants to do too much .
i mean , she 's not gon na be happy
and made meat-eating illegal .
me , i have much simpler desires .
ten or twenty billion dollars would make me incredibly happy .
so we 're here to warn yo
that thre 's a new criminal mastermind in our midst .
to brainwash .
malcolm , what are we gon na do ?
you were right .
not if we stop them first .
we 're currently working with authorities .
that will disable and dstroy their brainwshing software .
whatever evdence there was is completely fried .
thank you .
yes ?
speaking of fried ,
is that your chicken i smell ?
ok , chin up , chin up , chin up .
sholders back just a little bit more .
shoulders back .
'cause nobody respects a superhero that slouches .
that 's why they kicked him out .
that 's right .
other than watching out for the trees --
and fences !
... is that you have to go fast enough
so nobody can see you .
see ya .
sctt , scott .
but you can practice flying at nytime .
see ya guys later .
keep your eyes open .
c'mon , son .
letting you get used to how it feels , son .
i 'm flying !
i 'm really flying !
dad !
no !
help me !
you know , this is so unlike jm .
i 've got to get this gme on the go .
ah  because if you missed ,
i 'd automatically be captain
mess up .
either you were practcing loop-the-loops ,
i 've never seen powers come and go like that .
maybe he 's having trouble concentrating
everything 's redy .
excellent .
look , achieving greatness involvs a certain amount of risk .
if today goes wll , the superheros can provde the muscle .
that 's gon na be able to stop us .
i 'm glad you could make it .
wontn ?
judy s an excellent cook .
dad is so --
do n't underestimate your father .
powers or no powers .
thanks , grandpa .
can i have everybody 's attention , please ?
the newest superhero --
warrior woman and i have decided
agree to only use your power for good ,
to fight for peace and fredom ,
and to uphold the superhero credo
of truth , justice , and integrity ?
look , nina .
me ?
why me ?
and if we ca n't find his hideout ,
is that what you want ?
thanks , nina .
she 's not getting out that wy .
this is what we criminal masterminds call a win-win situation .

oh , and one more thing ...
i do n't compete unless i plan to win ,
so tomorrow we 'll meet on the track .
3:30 sharp .
if you 're gon na be late , do n't bother to come at all .

yeah , girl .

well , you know what ?
why do n't you pack up your attitude and get lost .
why do n't you back off before i make you back off .
hey !
excuse me !
thank you .
mr. zavala 's looking for them .
i hear a lot of schools do that 
either way , we 're toast .

i do n't hate it , esmeralda .
is that how it seems ?
what ?
well , me and the other girls were talking ,

after all our hard work !
i turned them down .

we 're a team .
ms. bartlett :

yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,
nd i 'll check her calculations .
then you can talk to her math teachr ,
see if he 'll raise her grade to a d .
that could work .
but yo have to get her to take it very seriously .
if yolanda does n't deliver an accurate tabulation ,
she 's off the danc team .
i like your optimism 
thanks .
boy :
enjoy .
hey !

and being your best .
aiming to be the bst is --
it 's fruitless .
it 's a matter of opinion 
you have done this 50 times in rehersal .
and do you know there is more value
and that 's mre contagious
than having a thousand trophies .
and forget about lynell elliot 
forget evrything ...

ribbit .
i think i have an idea where we can go .
buffrog !
star butterfly !
oh , queen moon .
gretings .
of course .
star , can i speak with you ?
well , it seems we have no other choice .
uh , welcome to my ... home .
boop .
it 's rainy season .
ah , so good for the skin .
oh , h , no shoes in house .
buffrog , wonderful home .
oh , thank you .
is a bit of a mess right now .
please take a seat .
oh !
i thought everyone knew that .
yo , buffrog , where them babies at ?
babies , say hello to queen butterfly .
star , i have been so worried about you .
why ?
i 'm good .
well , when ludo took your castle ,
toffee is dead .
toffee not dead .
toffee inside ludo .
papa !
we have to go save him .
he is your husband !
star , i 've made my decision .
we stay here .
excuse me .
yes .
thank you .
 'm sorry .
yeah , we all are .
of course .
you hve plan ?
i have plan .
okay .
dstract me from what ?
bad choices in past .
uh , we could smash bgs .
great dea , bffrog .
your daughter is very strange .
we have many option of board game .
mmm , interesting .
okay , the rles of puddle defender are , uh ...
um ... the rules are ...
yes ?
the evil bloodthrsty mewman  tht 's you , must try and sneak past watchful monster parent  that s me .
that is horrible !
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
you are filthy mewman .
for better eating f monster babies .
is this fun ?
did you hear something ?
i hear nothing .
can you name a time when monsters have ever done such a thing ?
that idea had to come from somwhere .
because it was in a children 's board game ?
i just think that monsters would have less of a reputation if they did n't act so bloodthirsty all the time .
monsters only act that way to protect their babies from mewmns .
you may not understand , but mnsters will do anything for our children .
d n't talk to me about what i 'm willng to do .
to protect star from toffe !
bt i have to keep my child safe at all costs !
you insult me , queen moon .
my buffbabies , they are my lfe .
i should have realized .
you 're a parent , too 
i ca n't believe you 're taking her side .
kids .
what 's their plan , huh ?
just avoid your problems to death .
great plan .
it 's a terribl plan .
i 've got big plans .
but no , they stuck me in here .
i 'm thinking 
i have n't told my dad yet .
there 's something else i have n't told him .
all clear .
wow .
so what 's the big plan ?
the plan fr beating toffee ?
i kinda just go for it .
h , my precious little ribbit babies .
do nt yu worry .
i 'm very worried .
i 'll see you after i destroy toffee .
this is my castle .
i do nt want to see a sngl butterfly face .
what am i looking t here ?
no butterflies .
get that out of here .
is that the last of it ?
and with that , everything in my kingdom is in order .
no , no , nt again !
okay , a few kinks to work out , but overall , the citizens of mewni love me .
those especially .
here ,  'll show you .
greetings , young man .
no , my lord , they just do n't like you .
oh , honey , look at all that great stuff 
wow  we should load up .
finally , someone with taste .
this will look great in our foyer .
it 's not for sale .
that s it .
now , how about  nce king ludo coffee mug ,
yeah , we do n't like you ;
nobody likes you , dude .
see what i 'm dealing with here ?
what do you want ?
i 'm not going anywhere wth you .
that 's too bad .
it 's urgent royal business .
why would i do that ?
i do n't even like you 
say good-bye to your freedom .
ha ha !
ho ho .
ludo .
dude , ludo 's gone completely nuts 
you 're telling me .
oh , i can ... almost taste it .
ha ha !
ha ha 
nic work , marco .
butter yourself up , and i 'll see if i can figure a way out of here .
the dungeon has air conditioning ?
it 's a dungeon , not a torture chamber .
nice .
how are those shackles coming ?
i do n't think this is going to work .
river , did you eat the butter , river ?
this is n't your fight .
sh .
ruberiot ?
quiet , dude .
whoo , how 'd  evr live without a solid gold toilet ?
what the heck is going on here ?
she was miming that we slep in his royal bed .
those villagers are so ungrateful .
i 've got that whole levitatoing king river to do .
i 'm gon na have to stop yu right there .
a heavy burden , yes , but that 's what it means to be an artiste .
and you 're a buffoon .
the buffoon is merely the facade for my pointed social commentary .
that s what maks me  true artist .
not as much of n artist as the mime .
i 'm not a soldier either , but there 's a time when you have to gt off the sidelines and get involved .
if the four of us work together , we can save the true king of mewni .
now , see , i would n't use that hand gesture .
it 's just been done to death 
you all make me sick 
what ?
who 's here ?
who 's in my royal bedroom ?
you wrot a sng about me ?
uh , shone his grace upon us all
i did do that , did n't i ?
to protect us
great king ludo is great
he 's so great , great , great  great , great , great , great
and mewni has never been better
oh , great king ludo is great
wht ?
i 'm the buffoon ?
you 're the buffoon .

yeah , well , yours are hack .
oh , god one .
you 're all hacks , except for the mime .
she 's a genius .

hey , king , we 're busting you outta here .
time 's up .
so , m ... ready to ...
where 's my key 
i must 've dropped my key right in front of you , and you did n't even notice .
spider !

she 's a princess winning battles
through the break of dawn
oh , there goes a shining star

the cure fr cancer has been discovered .
the cure for virtually every form of chronic disease was discovered even earlier , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
although his discoveries were adhered to by hitler and the nazi party 
dr. gerson 's family paid the ultimate price .
dr. gerson 's seven siblings perishd in the holocaust .
dr. gerson 's unprecedented gift of heling the hopeless lives on .
narrated by dr. a.f .
these scenes befor your eyes would be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air moves north and airborne transport of dioxins eventually reaches the once pristine arctic .
arctic peoples are showing major health problems , from bioaccumulation of dioxins .
and from ther , the pisons travel up the food chain to polar bears , seals and whales , and then to people 
one thousandth of one millionth of a gram of dioxin can case harm to the body .
trees , the very living organisms that clean the air and produce the oxygen we breathe , are sliced off at the ground with the most careless abandon if ther is a limteless supply .
at one point , it had been said that a tree squirrel cld jump from tree to tree following the hardwood with coniferous forest belts from the east coast to the west coast .
they do not develop special functions .
as a boy in germany , in the lat 1800 's ,
day by day , he gained insight in th relationships between plants and the nutrients they gained from the sol .
under a microscope , ctively cells known as chloroplasts , busily undertake the process of manufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculous process of photosynthesis begins .
these live cells nd enzymes in vegetation are the nucleus of what we need to ingest to heal a sick body or maintain  healthy one .
max gerson suffered from severe and repeated migraine headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days .
after three years of experimenting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved , but a skin tubrculosis als disappeared .
446 of the 450 patients recovered .
dr. gerson and his wife gretchen hd three daughters :
joanna , gertrude and the youngest , charlotte .
of all the children , charlotte took a special interest in her father 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had spread throughut europe .
when dr. schweitzer was 75 years old , he came to dr gerson with diabetes and was also cured .
lighting up the switchboards at abc non-stop .
out of control !
unbelievable !
and the pepper neely anticancer bill of 1946 , document no .
now married , she had a son , hward , and a daughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her father to publish his first book in 1958 :
at the time of his death , in 1959 ,
the files have been preserved by his daughter charlotte who s now in her ighties .
charlott carries on the work of her father through the establishment of th
we have some letters here from albert schweitzer ... and they had a very active correspondence  my father , dr. gerson and albert schweitzer , and his family were patints .
and he also expressed , in this lettr , he expressed hs admiration of the specific cancer research that dr. gerson did .
of course , all the letters are n german and i 'm trying to translat some .
as well as th remarkable results that he saw , not only with cancer patients , but with his wife , who had tuberculosis , and their daughter , who had a very undecipherable skin diseas .
laws in virtually all the united states prohibit any other tretment for cancer other than radiation , chemotherapy and surgery .
on this particulr day , two medical doctors from czechoslovakia , consult with anita wilson , who is executive director , bout the possibilities of opening a hospital in czechoslovakia .
... you boost the immune system , you rid the body of those years and years of accumulated toxins from the way we live ...
not a day goes by that w do n't hear something from a patient or a physician , or a group of people perhaps interested in starting a clinic or a support group 
in high school i was in one of thos dieters anorexic and blmic ... bulimia when it was n't really written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fight for that .
a year later , that same tumor , the one that they thought could be a metastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 years old , my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
after being on the therapy for about a year , i noticed one day when i was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bone in the right side of my nose for the first time .
another staff member , susan brant , charlotte gerson 's niece , at one time , was dignosed with an inoperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 years ago , nd so ,
i can sit her and say that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and the biopsy 
they determined i had three sections of cancer , malignant cancer in the prostate and they wanted to take the prostate out the next day .
i talked with gerson institute and with the hospital in mexico , and talked with the doctors and the patients .
after three months , i found that i was loosing weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me was the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the doctor thought i was great , he said i had a better psa than he did .
i am not an easy one to get along with , because i 'm a maverick ...
a particular type juicing method must be utilized , however , implemnting a grind nd press device .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstram almost as fast as alcohol .
this juicer was originally designed in the 1930 's by a scientific researcher , named dr. norman walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be captured in a glass of juice in minutes and in  few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the patient .
as you cn see , an entire day with the juces is equivalent to n enormous amount of food , which wights in a little over 20 pounds a dy .
but just eating different is not enough to heal a sriously ill patient .
nutrition is nly half of the eqation .
resolving the accumulated toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentless .
realizing this , charlotte gerson included a chapter about it in a book about the gerson therapy , that underlines , in layman 's terms , the principles of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily toxic ingestion or precursor hit be when you get in your automobile prior of even starting the ngine , you have already ingested dioxins
) given off from the dashboard to the fancy ?
suppose you contine yur journey and stop at a motel for the evening .
once inside  from the power switch activating electromagnetic fields , to the microwave radiation leaking from the oven , as it prepares your plastic wrapped , heavily salted and preserved nutritionless instant dinner , to the carcinogenic chemicals in the sap on the bathtub brim .
you are inundated with hits .
the soap and shampoo are just the start , however , f what will be absorbed through your skin once you turn on the bath tube faucet , which will prvide chlorinated and fluoridated water to help you get clean .
chlorn and fluorine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toilet seat has ben sanitizd for your protection .
but what des that mean ?
the toilet pper will also smear chemicals from solvents to dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroom sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply manufactured plastic cup  that allows serious toxins from the plastic itself into the water .
the artificial sugar and the artificial cream as a nice touch to the mix .
) that was the cell phone repeated , lengthy uses have shown to interfere with and challnge th neurotransmitters of the brain .
as we finally turn off the light to sleep , electromagnetic fields from the clock next to your head will almost imperceptibly influence the slumber and dreams one hopes to have .
even the film to make this movie uses extremely poisonous chemicals in its manufactre and processing .
as ridiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one mre hit for your body to fight .
the good news is that mst of these toxins can be removed with strict adherence to the gerson thrapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comes into play .
unless it gets some help .
when coffee enemas are utilizd in conjuction with juice drinking it is detoxification at its finest .
three tablespoons of dip ground coffee re drpped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is turned down .
once the coffee is dne , it is strained into a masuring cup .
additional water may be added to make up for water lost in steam in making the coffee .
onc th coffee cools to body temperature it is poured into the enema bucket .
that time , the plastic stopper at the end of the hose is slit back to release the air in the end f the tube .
simultaneosly , the liver in turn excretes poisns into the colon for expulsion .
hundreds of holistic physicians , in the u.s. and around the world , have been trained by charlotte in the gerson institute .
unbelievably , it is illegal n the united states to treat and cure a diseased patient in a hospital with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides in southern california , it s easy to her for drive regularly t advise and encourage the endless numbers of patients that arrive at th hospital in tijuana , mexico .
under the care of a staff of physicians nd nutritionists , most patients who came in with inoperable cancers and with no hope of recovery , leave within 1 to 4 weeks to continue the treatment at home .
after only 2 weeks on the therapy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer now .
do you have children ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer 
i was in alaska , where i am from and i was diagnosed with a ...
you wer diagnsed how , did you had a biopsy ?
he ordered the biopsy and the pathology came back with a carcinma .
and you had ascites swelling ?
i had 10 pounds of asctes swelling in my abdmen 
but the chemotherapy could also dry it up .
now several doctors have tld me that .
how much ?
one course .
after i was finished with my chemo and it did n't work .
then you came here .
wow !
and then it 's been abut 2 cm a day .
ever since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typical and normal one .
always seeking new ways to cher up , empower and restore hope to the supposed hopeless ,
within the pages of each booklet are personl biographies and the medical records of recovries .
healing lung cancer respiratorydiseases
my dad had told me about th gerson therapy .
my daddy told me about this , and during the research , i fond out that the best way to cre yourself is to do it the healthy wy .
not put more poisons into your body that would kill you .
and that what chemo did ... it kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
when i go down to ucla , i too did all my blood work and my mris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ca n't believe you 're one of my cancer patints.
that just really made me feel good every time i went in there .
i did not look like a normal cancer patient .
to me , i have charltte and th gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heart , just do n't think i 'd be here .
when i was diagnosd with cancer ,
i knew of three ther ladies that had the same cancer i had .
i was 12 years old when my mom was diagnosed with cancer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'm steve , debbie 's husband .
when i first came into debbi 's life , it was several years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ..
there is for charlotte the reluctance to get emotionally attached to any sngle case , since ther have been thousands , but occasionally , a phone call would leave her effervescent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seen only in children .
it was discovered that the lng was too ridden wth cancer .
and more horrifying stll was the revelaton that the cancer had made it all the way to the right chamber of her heart .
the surgeon than opened her strnum and started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from there , he moved to her heart and an open-heart surgery removed the tumor from the right heart chamber .
again and again , with a vengeance .
now , even her liver was invaded by cncer .
) the doctor said , ( ?
) children told us that sh is not gon na be able to ahm ... the cancer is back and she is not gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or something , w were down , at the gerson , and ahm ... and we were doing the diet there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think 
) i had come down there sick myself .. ?
i had regular disinfections all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and we 've been doing the treatment for two years , bout .
from that point on , hope returned , and life began to change for the entire family 
even the dog was happy again .
but the pisons are now being excrtd and her body is building itself back up with powerful enzymes and the nutrient forces .
but where stephanie 's orthodox medcal doctors had only given her 6 months to live two years ago , she has now astounded them , and of course , confoundd them .
i feel very healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
charlotte observed that they run around playing and enjoying life , as though the scourge of cancer had never visited this resilient child .
there are also non-toxic  non-pharmaceutical supplements called biologicals , that are utilized in a greater or lesser measure , depending upon the patient 's conditon .
one of the most important of these is a natural potassium  mix of potassium gluconate , acetate , phosphate in equal amounts , that dr. gerson put together after doing nearly 300 experiments .
ths is extremely beneficial to restoring the potassium in the body 's clls systems that was lost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sodium , such as found in table salt and hidden within everything , from processed foods to toothpaste .
table salt is a poison .
the use of inorganic sodium causes displacement of potassum found naturally in human cells , leaving them vulnerable to attack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's potassium supplment is dissolved in a quarter of distiled water and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , essentially the leftovers , are used for fertlizer and animal food .
a true miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good wrk tht max gerson did in the past , really understood the value of flx oil .
that was n't anything that ...
actually , they educated us more than we could even educate thm on the value and the benefits of how flax oil rally helped the modalities .
the use of these natural , holistic supplements on the gerson therapy is part of customization to the specific dgenerativ conditions of th patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but they can sometimes frtify gerson s therapies effectiveness .
when it comes to helping the body recover , whether from a common cold or cancer , today  over half the medical visits in the u.s. and canada are to altrnative therapies , despite the efficacy .
and in the u.s. especially , it is stimated that our understanding and acceptance of holistic medcine s still 75 years behind the rest of the world .
medically , we trail many third world countries 
it is imperative that patients have accss to such food choices .
the organic food market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , mainly as the result of the economic law of supply and demand .
mass-produced commrcially grown fruits and vegetables prodced with chemicals and sprays are fertilized with only three minerals :
but the plant , like the human body  really needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertilization process of commercially gown crops , the plants wer sick and must be kept on life support with more toxic chemicals until mrket .
this process is now repeated in the consumer  in simplified terms .
i know that in the past people had different prospectives of what was truly organic , and we would have some growers come in and say well , their grows are organic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a st of rules and regulations such that anybody who did want to become organic would truly be in the same playing field and would have to abide by the same sets of rules .
we have found that the attributes of truly doing a certified organic s beneficial not only for the people , but also for the ground , etc .
so  that 's something that we truly look forward to expand upon and to provide fr th local community , and also for the peopl throughout the united stats and world wide .
by popular demand , undoubtedly based largely on the discvery of the incomparable better flavor of fresh organic produce , organic farmers frequently start popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their produce for their neighbors benefit , before shipping their product to an ever increasing world market .
charlotte grson follows the gerson therapy herself as a life style of preventin .
she as no one as millions of others have discovered that the prnciples of the gerson therapy raise the bar for getting the most of life .
now , in her eighties ,
using the gerson therapy , one need never again worry by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesity is almost always nothing but hunger .
and people re very hungry because , even though they are full , thy are not truly nourished .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , where the dead food lies in state .
for many , it also grants them a higher vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life .
dayto-day life experiences are fraught with perplexties that can be addressed to a ngative or a positive way .
for example , cocaine and heroine addicts destroy their cravings for drgs n usually less than 72 hours on the therapy .
the only obstacle that arrests or commences to subtract those books is long trm lack of nutrients and environmental toxicity .
when the brain detoxifies , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional fog lift .
the body is a mirculous in its design and flexibility .
these chemicals are found in virtually all municipal drinking water and inflicts severe damage in the body 's endocrine system , particularly the thyroid gland .
but thre are other semi hidden dangers in ingestion of daily poisons that can be avoided .
well , the dental amalgam is now coming more nd more into the floor , even while dentists used to dispute it .
but in your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clearly demonstrated that lot of children have seizures and all kinds of mental disturbances from the dntal amalgam .
the danger of the illegal street drugs in public and private schools is heavily publicized .
the trouble with ritalin is sometimes ... frst of all , it 's never been tested on children under 6 .
and they 're gving it now to childrn in preschool and kindergarden .
and the american services like the army , navy nd the air force , will not accept any person into the service who is evr been n ritalin , because they 're uncontrollable .
during sleep , not only is the nervous systm replenished like a storage battery being charged , but the body rids itslf of poisons , in a way that only slep can accomplish .
and with the bombardment in daily life of hits to their systems in modern society , repeated lack of it can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a chld 's brain development .
the developing brain of a child at this time in human history , must clear a number of hurdles in a bid for genetic normalcy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabilities is xposur to lead  especially lead from older homes , where leaded paint was used pirated in the 1970 's .
remodeling and sanding of older homes produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
these airborne heavy metals , along with numerous other chemcals in the food and water , are now unintentionally passed on to the next generation .
but the removal , known as chelation , of such toxins , even heavy metals , such as lead , is possible with close adherence to the gerson therapy .
even the body itself can overproduce a substance tht becomes poison in excss , in stressful situations , if the liver is unhealthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called adrenaline .
in an occupation that demands split secnd life or dath decisions  the adrenaline flows in excess , and if not neutralized , can poison the body into llness .
the potency of this substance s profound .
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands , which are located on little caps on top of each kidney , it enters th blodstream and is diluted instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the purpose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and protect oneself in threatening situatins .
the largest gland of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able to neutralize the secretions .
many people have liver disease and do n't evn know it .
for the detection of a liver problem via illness requires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity before symptoms becme detectable .
like many others who do nt have degenerative disease ,
becuse many of the animals are carnivores , in the wildlife cnter , their health and reproduct ability must be maintained at highest levels .
eventually , they were unable to reproduce successfully .
clearly , all carnivore nimals sch as these were designed to hnt nd kill and survive on prey composd of flesh .
their teeth , stomach acids and short digestive tract bear this out .
but th dissimilarities between wild mat eaters and humans do not end there .
invariably , some of them does n't pass through at all , but instead get snagged inside tiny pockets in the colon putrefying not for hours , but days , months and even years .
the pancreas was never designed to break down animal protein or meat .
when meat must be digested , the pancreas is diverted from its important protective purpose .
if we only eliminated the animal products from our diet , the odds of getting cancer , diabetes or heart disease and the pandora 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american diet , referred to as sad for short , has totally flipped that scientifically verifiable statistic upside down .
looking under a microscope , it is easy to se red blood cells floating around free .
surprisingly , some foods , like legumes , soybeans nd soy products re either deficient in nutrients , or cause health degeneration , by blocking absorption of nutrients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespread .
it 's cused by milk drnking .
and the doctors give it for supposedly curing osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the body has to maintain homeostasis , it has to mintain a very exct levl of alkalinity versus acidity .
where is it ging to take calcium ?
it is not absorbable from milk , because in the milk with pasteurization nd all , the enzymes are missing .
and the body ca n't use it .
so , on the contrary , that adds to the problem .
i had canceled my health insuranc when i was 34 years old .
and the reason was not that i was very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not nterested in a kind of hospital or medical treatment that might be covered by insurance because it 's toxic , it 's drugs , it 's chemicals , nd  have , you know ,
and over the years , i 've saved an average of us $ 2,000  year .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .
even now , his application of this therapy is unrelenting .
today , gerson 's name and therapy is known and honored world wide by holistic physicians , nutritionists and chiropractors .
he also authors features stories for the bi-monthly
thank you very much , my pleasure .
nice meetng yu .
charlotte 's daughter peggy , along with husband giuliano and daughter etha  who live in italy , also fllow the gersn protocol .

this film would not be complete without a representative recovery frm one of the most deadly cancer of all .
meet pat annie from british columbia , in canada .
she remains extremely busy .
pat radiates good health and has a deep conviction about certain priorities in her life .
ironically , he developed cancer after pat had recovered on the gerson therapy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas cancer , which is spread to my liver , gallbladder and spleen .
my husband just wuld n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 days , the bleeding had stopped , the pain had stopped , i came home , get the therapy for 2 years ..
after three months , my doctors here wondered why i was still living .
he asked me if i would have a cat scan , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't want to know what you 're doing , just keep doing it 
i hope they appreciate me .
at the time i was fighting the pancreas cancer , we got a call from michael landon , you may remember him , he was on little house on the prairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
he would n't go down to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his family .
he went on to the tonight show and he looked wonderful  and he said he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after he did this tratment
and said he knew that was the end , that he should have stayed with the gerson .
and there s no doubt in my mind that he would be alive today if he had stayed with the gerson .
it is a medieval castle .
finally , after 75 years and tens of thousands of healed pople , the wrld at last is embracing this answer to cancer .
and in recordd human history there 's also triumph and hope over seemingly insurmountable societal , individual and environmental illness .

your wealth , fame and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance .
your grudges , resentments , frustrations and jealousies will finally disappear .
so  too , your hopes , ambitons , plans and to do list will expire .
it wo n't matter where you came from , nor on what side of the tracks you lived at the end .
even your gender and skin colr will be rrelevant .
so , what will matter ?
how will the value of your days be measured ?
what will matter is every act of integrity , compassion , courage or sacrifice that enriched , empowered and encouraged others to emulate yor example .
what will matter is not your competence , but your character .
on nursing himself bck to health , he found the manuscript missing .
it took dr. gerson a full year to reconstruct the manuscript for his towering classic cancr therpy , results of 50 cases.

this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for the governement but mostly ...
mostly for a ... a hollywood studio .
this what at the time of the 'good neighbor ' policy ... and it was my task to make a large technical documentary on the subjct of the carnival .
samba orchestra .
voodoo ceremonies , particularly in shango which are practiced ... up in the favelas , those strange , native settlements on the ... mountains , which are right in the midst of rio .
he came to my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort f thing happens not only in south american governments , but also in film stdios .
and the witch doctor assured me that this .. was deeply offensive and ...
and , i said i was most sorry about it myself and ...
i did want to finish the film and i did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the time ...
h ... already agreed on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finish , since so much effort had gone into it and i was pleading my cause for som time .
praying that we would be able to .
and , i came back to the office and found that th doctor had gone ...
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
this was the mark of the voodoo .

and brazil s dicttor  getúlio vargas , had nazi sympathizers in his govrnement .
so , the state department appointed wells , special ambassador to brazil .
we , the people of these united nations of america , now stand together .
we ought to know each other better than we do .
it was more of a cultural interchange .
i was told that it was my patriotic duty ... to go and spend a million dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
he had to get to rio in time to film the carnival .
so , he was forced to shoot the magnificent ambersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoining soundstages .
he dd n't even have time to change his costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , the frst part of the new latin american verson of 'it 's all tru ' , was temprarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he finished shooting both films in time to leave for rio , but it was a real cliffhanger .
i went to the projection room at about two in the morning , no , four in the morning , and then gone on the plne and off t rio .
ask me again ... in six months .
the lights failed to arrive  so h filmed carnival ' with anti-aircraft lights borrowed from the brazilian army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to capture  hurricane .
people get tired , they fall asleep , they re going to lean against a house , that 's it .
as it turned out i became fascinated with samba .
what was intresting were the samba clubs , and all of that which would have organized and told to people , explained what it was , socially and all th rest of that .
welles had discovered what the true subject of his film would be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it 
no , indeed , if rio 's backyard is n't exactly gala it 's even gayer than rio 's front lawn .
it 's set to musc , but the music 's all its own .
rich ...
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vargas had demolishd praça onze to build a new boulevard .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicolor cameras to commemorate th carnival of the streets now passing into history .
welles joined the people in ther protst .
at the same time he began filming the story of another protest which would be the third story of it 's all tre  .
a cry of outrage from the poorest of th poor that electrifed all of brazil .
he first read abot it in time magazine .
four poor fishermen risked their lves sailing  tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demand that brazil 's president give their people , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazlian workers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the northeast , an ncredibl 1650 miles , without the aid of a compass , stopping along the way to find food nd water .
jacaré was the leader of th expedition but jerônimo , a man wh could neither read nor write , was the pilot .
their jungda was carried in triumph through the strets .
three months had passed since their voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangderos were still national heroes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' the jangederos story would complete his latin america trilogy ... but jacaré 's political activities had made him a cause of concern for the vargas governement .
i think that the vargas governement began to recognize the fact that this was not going to b a film that would bring torists to brazil .
i remember the night we tried to photograph one of the tenement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us and after a siege of beer bottles , empties of course , stones , bricks , and i hate to think what else ...
w retreatd to a more photogenc district .
and , t occurs to me that snce man and the world have to live with one another and get along somehow ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , and the reacton is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and down .
they did n't even har the samba music because it had n't been synched up .
and all i kept getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it might have been welles ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... the picture itself destroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a sunny , beautiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was full of sailboats , putting up sail , getting ready to renact the jangderos ... triumphant entry into rio harbor .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we were devastatd .
h must have made the decision t that point that he would make this film no matter what .
i 'm sure ... was haunted ... by the feeling ... that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice presidnt was sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and send everybody home .
when we were recalled from brazil there was till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i took that nd went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and we made the 'jangader ' documentary .
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , following their voyage and all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not get ... what they ... went for .
it kept thm poor , no matter how hard they worked .
it was to ... remind him of his promises .
welles devised a little love story .
to get extreme low angles  he would put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performances from people who had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a wartime flight to the states .
once back , he learned that rko was not going to lt him finish 'it 's all true  .
so , i was fired from rko .
and ... they ... made a great publicity of point of the fact that i had gone to south america without a script and thrown all this money away .
that ...
i never recovred from that ... frm that attack .
he hired himself out fr the first time as a movie star to option the footage from rko .
for four years he desperately sought financing to finish it .
i tried everything .
i was near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many years of my life .
if i turned my back like they did on it , i would hav been much better but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i went and had one of the cans printed up and found out that yes , there was some things of 'bonito , and there was some things of 'carnival ' .
it was orson welles .
ladis and gentlemen , here comes the samba now .
of course , we all live with our past but i try not to ... encourage it to misbhave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unpronounceable .
surdo ?
correct !
ladies and gentlemen , the ... tamburine is not a ... tambourine !
it 's just a rough frame with some kind of ( ?
cat skin !
pandeiro ?
-yes , something wrong , senor welles ?
oh , no ...
it 's all right now .
ladies and gentlemen , this instrument oddly enogh , is exactly like our tambourine !
well , that 's the way things are .
i ...
why ?
why ?
-well , because of the sound it 's making .
that 's a ...
yeah .
ganzá .
the gentleman here handles it with all the flare of a bartender shaking a cocktail shaker .
now .. we hear the cuica !
what 's that , carmen ?
cuica !
the cuica .
-cuica .
however , as you notice , it is n't beating like a drum .
one end is open .
when you yank it back and forth the ... that 's what you hear .
there you have it !
the rhythm of the samba .
brazilian babies can beat out samba rhythm before they can talk !
radio :
we 've spotted what appears to be a spacecraft just outside the surfline .
alert rescu nd advise to remain on station for 45 minutes .
and we 'll squat 7700 for a radar fix .
radio :
roger .
effect pickup and recovery .
base radar will vector .
com on !
let 's go !
ha !
ha !
yes , sir !
all right , open her up .
open it up !
welcome , gentlemen , to the united sta --
did you call the zoo ?
yes , sir , we 're in luck .
the apes will be hidden from the public .
they 'll be quarantined .
they need medical attention , it 's avilable rght on the spot .
they are dressing up !
suitcase ?
uh ...
why did he do that ?
here you are , old fella .
have a banana .
zira !
i 'm yors .
i think they 're trying to be kind .
this cage stinks of gorilla .
cornelius , where are w ?
what 's happened ?
i know where we are .
i know what has happened .
in some fashion -- and i lack the intellect to know precisly how -- we have traveled from earth 's future to earth 's past .
but we saw the earth destroyed .
only since seeing it , we have passed thrugh a backward disturbance in time .
did you notice the date meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship ?
we have returned to earth nearly 2,000 years before its destruction .
apes , at this instant in time , can not yet talk .
oh  th driver gave me ths reprt from the air base .
yeah , it 's th usual mitative behavior .
mimicking salutes , handshaking , sitting on chairs , eating offplates with knives .
there was sort of
hi , dr. dixon .
the femle 's a bit uppity , sir .
oh ?
i see you 've prepared the wisconsin multiphasic .
we 'll begin with that .
all right , we 'll take the female first .
arthur  would you set up a ch --
not a bite .
just as you ordered .
we 'll offr the banana .
well , why does n't she take it ?
because i loathe bananas !
arthur , i think dr. branton needs some air .
zira , are you mad ?
i did not call her mad .
i hate deceit !
and how in the name ofgod are we to know that unless we communicate ?
and we can listen !
and we can watch .
primitive ?
could n't test the intelligence of a newt !
i am calm !
zira !
zira !
we 'll need a fll autopsy .
let us know when the report comes in 
we wll not hurt you .
poor dr. milo .
doctor .
you killed him !
no , i did nt .
he did .
one of your own kind .
he 's a gorilla !
well , look , there 's nthing to be afraid of .
do you understand that ?
humans ?
i 'm a psychiatrist .
my name is cornelius .
lewis dixon .
nobody 's going to believe this .
believe what ?
that primitive apes can talk .
primitive ?
uh ... well , i mean that in our , um ... primitive , um , civilization , apes jst do n't talk .
may i say something ... personal ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm aware that what i have to tell you may conceivably create
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was one of two that have been missing in space for ovr 2 years now .
have they identified the bodies  mr. president ?
zoo ?
what would astronauts be doing in a zoo , mr. president ?
reporters :
general !
no comment .
reporters :
i have n't the time nw .
a little later , please .
reporter :
later .
and if the questions become less simpl ?
and i am the animal psychiatrist who has been in chrge of these 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoolgist , i know and respect your work , but if you think you 're going to turn a presidential inquiry into a ventriloquist 's act , i hve to inform you -
and i have to inform you , sir , that these two apes have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sr , bt i repeat that they have the power ofspeech .
well , may we be told which is the female of the species ?
have you a name ?
certainly she can articulate , which , in itself , is extraordinary !
what is your name ?
zi-ra !
mechnical mimicry .
unique in an ape vocally , withut a doubt , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
mr. chairman .
we 'll take that up later , your eminence .
cornelius , do you and your lawfully wedded spose speak any language other than english ?
what is english ?
i speak the language taught to me by my father and mother , who were taught by their
it has been the language ofour ancestors for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins  who can be sur ?
nonsense !
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkered , pseudoscientific geese !
i 'v examined thousands of them .
and until now , i 've only discoverd 2 who could talk in my life .
god knows who taught them .
where we come from , apes talk .
humans are dumb .
i 'm nt sure .
when the spacecraft first landed on our seaboard , t was dr. milo who salvged it .
he studied it and halfnderstood it .
half ?
enough for dr. milo to b murdered in your zoo .
enough for my wife and i to be here now .
from whre , cornelius 
of course the female knows !
that does n't make any sense .
cornlius , you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpanzees are pacifists .
in a spaceship .
gentlemen , do you have -
no comment .
no comment .
as head f this commission , it will be our duty to sit through the facts of this bizarre affair and pass our conclusions onto the president of the united states for implementaton .
what a load ofhogger mogger .
dr. hasslein 
no cmment , please .
no cmment .
no , gentlemen , no comment ... yet .
doctor .
you wer marvelous .
they lovd you .
but only to lewis and stevie .
oh , zira .
well , you see ... we did know colonel taylor .
i mean , as a scientist ,  sympathize , but  agree that that 's a revelation the masses would not tak kindly to .
i think you did the right thing in denying knowledge of colonel taylor .
what ?
they would have asked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
becaus from the windows of the spaceship ... we saw the earth ... destryed .
i repeat , talked to the presidntial commission of lnquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the male ape where he was from  the female replied  from your future .
would you believe that ?
i thnk it is the only explanation .
but still something is missing -- and that something is still his real self painting the second picture .
so he regresses further and paints a third .
he would perceiv , mr. bonds , that time is like a freway with an infinite number oflanes , all leading from the past into the future , howver , not unto the same future .
thank yo very much , dr. hasslein .
it 's certainly th most incredible story this reporter has ever covered .
they will , however , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be given an extended tour of the city .
this is bill bonds reporting for eyewitness news .
good night .
your lggage  ma'am ?
address , please .
the zoo .
madam zira , i represent furand feather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is yor favrit fruit ?
ha ha ha .
and later , she 'll accompany dr. hasslein to the museum of natural history .
now , for a look at the weather .
sunny california will not be exactly that tomorrow .
the downtown --
tired ?
how is that ?
we have heads as well as hands .
i call upon men to let us use them !
beastly .
and dimas which means body frame .
its scientific name is a compound of the greek kampto , which means flexible or bent ,
its generic name , therefore , is flexble lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i insist .
now , is there anythng i can get you , zira ?
well , i have a strange craving .
grape juice plus ?
lewis said only a sip .
especally in cases ofpregnancy , you know .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorillas ' war .
we stayed behind .
we never saw the enmy .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
thn ther was a trnado in the sky .
i feel magnificently sleepy .
the date meter on the spaceship .
and before -- before the white light and the tornado ?
before the white light and the tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr. president , that one day , talking apes will dominate this earth and eventually destroy it by 3950 something .
and according to the nasa experts , who are still subjecting the spaceship to microscopic scrutiny , the precise year ofwhat yo merely nferred to be earth 's destructon is rcorded on the flight synthesizer s 3955 a.d. , presumably .
alter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of them is pregnant 
mr. president , herod lacked our facilities .
he also became very unpoplar , historically unpopular .
and we do n't want that to happen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 visitors seem to be charming , peaceful people -- or rather creatures -- and that the vters love them .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the world , mr. president ?
well , not at the next election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes one day will acquire the power of intelligent spech .
by zira 's testmony , we know that she is pregnant with child .
by my own testimony we know that it 's genetically possible for this child -- providd , of course , always that we permit its birth -- t bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb one in  present-dayjungle or a present-day zo .
yes , mr. president , i do .
i do n't knw .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assssin would say the latter .
well , mr. president , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because he was evil .
we have no proof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mr. president , there re very strong indcations .
are you suggesting that they were improperly interrgated ?
let us say unprofessionlly .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convened in secret session at the request of the president , the commission makes the following interim recommendations --
the public should be informed
that the apes  after their arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arising from its intended publicity ,
there is justifiable cause fr suspecting
to the installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of the earth melt 
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me .
but ifsomebody had asked ...
only the gorillas and the orangutans .
what 's the difference ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do not use the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys man .
ll we want to find out s how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , this was intolerable .
so humans took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alert t the concept ofslavery , and , as their numbers grew , to slavery 's antidote , which , of course , is unity .
they learned the art of corporate and militant action .
he articulted .
he spoke a word which had been spoken to hm over tim without number by humans .
no .
so that 's how it all started .
cornelius :
where we come from , apes talk .
you recognize your husband 's words to the commission ?
yes .
so humans were dumb .
zira :
zira :
i 've examined --
i ca n't remember .
complete the word !
call for dr. dixon , plese .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothl .
1/2 gram lv .
you have the commission 's authority .
and that of the president .
zira , i 've been asked to give you an injection --
-killing ?
will it harm my baby ?
lewis , you ca n't use that on zira !
really .
no , you must n't !
zira !
zira !
you do n't have to tell me !
now count backward frm 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this .
hmm ...
not so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an -
anta --
whose anatmies did you compare ?
apes and humans ?
ye - yes ... when they died a natural death .
available ?
gorillas hunted them for sport in nts and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the various reflexes 
of the living .
you ca n't make a dead man 's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you were advanced nough to perform experimental bran srgery on living humans ?
of course not .
when you left , was colonel taylor alive ?
we loved taylor .
we did all we could to help him --
cornelius and i .
she needs a nap .
we must get this to the commission .
if you 'll be seated , we 'll get down to business .
by either ape towards the human race as it is presently constituted in this year , 1 973 .
the male 's attitude is that
of  deeply nterested academician
with the true objectivity of a god historian .
the female 's case is different ,
will have become dumb brutes
with the intelligence of animals ?
it 's been nted that what apes will do to humans
to dr. hasslein 's convicton that these apes ' progeny
this s a risk we dare not ignore 
therefore ...
the commission unanimously rcommends
that the birth of the female 's unborn child
i now declare this commission dissolved .
they are savages !
jabbing needles into my pregnant wife .
i 've done that too , dear , and worse .
they made me tell them everyt hing , cornelius .
brutes .
shll i tell you something ?
we ca n't live with lies .
how long ?
a week .
they treated you like dirt .
ma'am , sir .
chow tim .
i 'm not hungry .
well , maybe somebody else is who ca n't talk yet .
oh , come on , ma'am .
it 's pure vitamin c .
grr !
nobody makes a fool out ofmy wife .
you 've got to come help me .
i 'll come right away .
itjust seems so cruel and horrible and-
i 'll see you 
unbelievably .
so do i .
but dead .
yu 'd prefer the parents dead too .
gate four.just a minute , sir .
the lieutenant has n't checked in yet .
gate four .
well , i 'm sorry , sir .
good night , charlie .
okay , sir .
i 'll be ff duty , but the relief comes on at 0430 hours .
yes , sir .
i ...
oh , my dear .
it 's urgent .
the apes killed their orderly .
on the run .
for that , they must be killed .
it has to be done befre we start a stone rolling that 'll gather enough poison moss to kill us all !
i 'll find lewis and get help .
i just lost my temper with the boy .
science regards these apes as unique .
i want them taken , yes , but taken alive .
is that clear ?
quite clear , mr. president .
oh , it 's you , dr. branton .
the monkeys have killed
what ?
i do n't believe it .
drive carefully .
i did n't mean to kill him .
i hit him with a tray .
where 's zira ?
stevie ... she 's in labor .
get in .
stevie , you wo n't take us back to the camp ?
now , wait a second .
let m get this straight 
you are asking me to risk imprisnmnt for the sake of two fugitive apes ?
i do it for you and for stevi and for your two distinguished friends .
uh , notorious now .
the hell with notoriety .
stand by and see his wife insulted ?
lewis !
saint francis would have
nevr .
the first chimp ver born in a circus .
los angeles is n't a circus .
lewis , i was not responsible for the death --
look at heloise .
mama .
mama .
zira , do n't waste your breath .
you knw the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak .
mama .
mam --
that 's good .
him ?
milo ?
milo .
congratulations .
but , sir --
evidently , we wre wrong because you hve n't found them !
if that 's close , she ca n't have gone far .
where do apes go ?
captain , i want you to start n immediate search ofevery menagerie , zoo , and circus 
i 'll augment your force with the city police , and i want to be kept informd about all rslts .
you might have lived happily ever af ter .
but now ...
i did it because i hte those who try to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him be dominated by you .
all i can now do to help you is give yu this for the baby .
yes .
we 'll hang it around the baby 's neck for protction , huh ?
yes .
and now , my der , dear friends , before the police come nd the audience gathers , you and your pretty baby must go .
lewis is on his way .
armand .
i should like to say good-bye to heloise first .
this is as far as we dare to take you .
the police have roadblocks on every main exit .
here are your supplies .
can you read a map ?
we 're at the city limits at the southern edge of this oil field .
over this hill , you 'll pass through more oil wells , an abandoned refinery , and you 'll be looking down at a harbor .
it 's a graveyard for old ships .
you can hide there for a week .
a week ?
then you can travel with them to florida , found a colny in the everglades , and live happily ever after .
it 's time that you were moving on .
lewis .
you 're the secnd human i 've kissed .
and you are the first .
she 's been with the circus seven years now .
the baby 's birth was registered 1 6 days ago .
ha ha ha !
we 'll catch them sooner or later .
later we 'll do something about pollution .
later we 'll do something about nuclear war .
we think we 've got all the time in the world !
like stars in space .
is n't it beautiful ?
yes , it is ... from here .
hmm ...
why do n't we get moving ?
we 've called in for helicopters 
how long till they gt here ?
what 's the matter ?
they fund zira 's suitcase .
oh , no , no , no .
you do n't like them very much , do you ?
who ?
mama .
give it to me .
cornelius !
get them down there !
move !
go !
down to the end !
let 's go !
stevie .
zira .
i want that baby .
my god !
stop him !
ah !
come on !
oh , my god .
all hands on the guy lines .
i want evry hand on the menagerie tent .

man out rustling up business for himself , looks like .
seems lk we have us a lot of time to waste before we see anybody much .
you want to go to that hanging .
'fraid i ca n't .
your mama said to keep an eye on you .
do n't worry , i wo n't tell mama .
who knows what 's in a man 's hert 
hangmn 's a yankee .
i 'll see it all .
my goodness .
chaney would get his due before such a judge .
is that the man ?
if yu would like to kiss him , it will be all right .
no .
i 'm mattie ross of near dardanelle in yell conty , and this is my friend , yarnell poindexter , he works on our place .
yes , ma'am .
state your business .
well , we do know this much : his name 's chambers , he 's now in indian territory , we think he was with lucky ned pepper robbing a mail hack
tuesday down on the poteau river , he 's a medium-height man with a black mark on his cheek .
that 's a description of tom chaney , there 's no chambers to it .
he got that black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under the skn .
why are n't you out looking for him ?
i have no authority in the indin nation .
i 'd have to say l.t .
where would i find this rooster ?
he 'll be t the federal court this afternoon .
your father 's gn , you 'll want to take it home , i expect .
i wo n't rest until tom chany 's barking in hell .
yarnell you stay with papa .
when you get him home , you put him in a better coffin , and you bury him in mason 's apron .
your mama ai n't gon na like you not coming home with me .
mama knows  can take care of myself .
people will take it wrong that i leave this to you , yarnell , but i got papa 's business to attend to .
now , you tell mama that  'm staying at the monarch boardng house and i 'm gon na stop over and see if tom chaney 's one of the prisoners .
all right , get outta the way !
move along !
are those the prisoners from the indian territory ?
cogburn a n't turned in his list yet .
the big fella with the eye ptch .
come on !
all right , take it away !
you come back here !
mr. cogburn !
mr. cogburn !
i said you come back here !
if mr cogburn thinks i 'm gon na be put off by a locked door , he does not know me !
 will be here when it opens .
best time for you to nail roostr would be tomorrow 
he 's due to testify before judge parker in the wharton case .
i appreciate your kindness .
at the rate of 25 cents per meal , i might just as well .
i was hoping you were enjoying the dumplings .
i ca n't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease .
the french is la boeuf ,
i call it la beef .
a right fancy rig , sir .
watch out for the chicken and dumplings .
they 'll hurt your eyes .
they 'll hurt your eyes looking for the chickn 
you squirrel-headed bastard !
i 'd lke to go to bed now .
but first i 'd like to see my father 's traps .
i 'll take a guess and say your name is mattie ross .
how do you suppose he guessed my name ?
we 're short of rooms on account of the hanging .
now , do n't you worry about grandma turner , she 's used to doubling up .
this s your father 's traps .
the watch and the knife are inside .
what is your opinion of a federal marshal called rooster cogburn ?
rooster cogburn !
he loves to pull a cork , i know that !
all rise !
yeah .
he 's a tough customer .
there 's no appeal from his court except to the president of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 're still sworn .
defence will cross-examine .
now , in order to refresh our memories , allow me to summarise what yu said .
according to your story c. c. wharton grabbed a shotgun and killed marshal potter .
then you say the father swung his axe , and you shot hm , too .
just winged him  or he would n't be here t pay up .
how long have you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot since you became a marshal , mr cogburn ?
that was not the question .
how many ?
twelve to fifteen ?
so many that you can not keep a specific count .
 have examined th records , mr. cogburn .
a much more accurate figur is avilable .
come now , how many ?
conting them two whartons , 23 .
how much more dangerous for those arrested by you ?
was this revolver loaded and cocked ?
just answer my questions , if you please .
yes , sir .
i always go backward when  'm backing away 
aaron wharton was standing by a pot when you arrived ?
he was stirring the fire under the scalding pot .
how far did you back awy ?
something like that .
mr. gody , do you have anymore qestions for mr. cogburn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogburn .
call the next witness !
rais your right hand .
mr. rooster cogburn 
it 's pretty loose because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .
well , who 's he ?
well , who are you ?
my family has 480 acres of good bottomland near dardanelle in yell county .
my mother 's home loking after my baby sister and my brother , little frank .
well then , why do n't you go home and leave me alone ?
mr. cogburn !
you can get a fugitiv warrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile for each of you , and i 'll give you $ 50 reward .
well , yo 've looked into this right smart .
i men business .
it belonged to my father .
well this 'll sure get the job done , if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim !
i 've got some horse-trading to do , i 'll have it by tomorrow .
well , i think tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medicine .
i 'd like to meet your family .
you want more , missy ?
i 've never seen chopsticks work before .
chopsticks save yur fingers .
give me your cup .
i do n't drink coffee , thank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lemonade , neither .
yes , sir .
sonds like a mghty easy way to make $ 50 to me .
do n't crwd me 
do n't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective business all at the same time .
and $ 50 in advance .
yo 're trying to take advntage of me .
it is n't going to be easy smoking ld ned out .
well  i hope you do n't think i 'm ging to keep you in whiskey .
no , thank you .
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , sis , my price s $ 100 .
i will think about your proposition and talk to you again 
now , i wan na go t the monarch boarding house .
you better walk me ovr there .
you can never tell what 's in a chinaman 's mind .
that 's the way he bests you at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i hav a writ here says you 're to stop eating chen lee 's cornmeal forthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first place .
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , baby sister .
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rats .
give them rats  fair show , they say .
well , what knd of a fair show dd they give old man potter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i had a big horse pistol like that ,
i 'm not scared of no boogerman .
cream ?
i 've been waiting to have some private words with you .
i find a sweet distraction , as i suppose most men do .
i saw your mother yesterdy .
what business did you have with her ?
it 's a likeness of tom chaney .
i 'm looking for him and i hear you 're looking for him , too .
i only take ne step at a time .
i 've been on his trail the best part of four months now .
i 'm a sergeant in the texas rangers .
chelmsford or chaney as you call hm , h shot and killed the snator 's bird dog .
bibbs threatened to whip him , and chaney shot the old gentleman while he was sitting in a porch swing .
well , you ned not worry about chaney anymore .
the sheriff informed me that you were looking for a man to go after chaney in the ndian territory .
i 've already found one for the job .
his name is rooster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the federal court , toughest one they have .
you 'll have to talk that over with rooster cogburn .
it 's at least a two-man job to tke him alive .
we 're taking him to fort smith and hang .
well , more so to me .
nw , wuld n't a hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom chney to pay for killing my father , not for some texas bird dog .
it w n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt .
one would be as unpleasant as the other .
lay a hand on me and you 'll answer for it .
the children of texans are brought up to show a little more respect for their elders .
you 'll push tht saucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no rgard for you , but i 'm sure you have enough fr yourself to go around .
they are all for sale except those four scrubby ones .
the heirs of the late frank ross .
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that is out of th question .
that hardly concerns me .
your father boght four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it while it was in your care .
you have no case .
you are mpudent .
and he will make money , and i will make money , and your lawyer will make money .
and you , mr .
licensed auctioneer , you will foot the bill .
lawyer daggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have dne business with the g.a.v .
g. , yes .
all right .
sit down .
the ponies have no part in this .
i would n't pay that for a winged pegasus .
now , listen very carefully , as i will not bargain further .
my lawyr would not wish me to consider anything under $ 300 .
for that , you get everything except the saddle .
i would like to have that in writing , for what it is worth .
when i hav it in my hand , i 'll remit the extortion money .
yu 'll fnd it in order .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
it seems such a shame to rendr such spirited horseflesh into soap .
good morning .
sleep late .
you ai n't such an early bird yorself , baby sister .
i just about give up on you .
i figured you 'd gone home .
yeah .
wll , trouble is , there 's no slats in it at all .
how much is there ?
you still game ?
ne understanding , that we leave for the territory this afternoon to get tom chaney .
well , you 're not going .
i 'm not a baby .
i 've slept out at night before .
papa took me con hunting last summer .
first night out , you 'd be calling , mama !
mama !
i 've left off crying .
i 'll find somebody who is .
now , i know you can drink whiskey and i saw you kill a rat .
but all the rest has been talk .
i 'm nt paying for talk .
i do n't know how you propose to do that from the hog wallow you 're sunk into .
if i smelled as bad as you , i would n't live near people .
i 'll be more than ready .
there 's an old saw that says , one white foot , buy them two white feet , try them 
i thought perhaps it was you .
no , it was not i .
nothing .
i will call him little blackie .
what is your offer ?
i will pay the market price .
tell me this do you entertain plans of ever laving this city ?
yes .
i 'm off arly tomorrow morning for the indian nation .
how did you light on that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with grit 
well , i suppose he has that .
i would n't trust him too much .
it may prove to be a long , hard journey .
a good christian does not flinch from these difficultis .
neithr does he rashly cort them .
the good chrstian is not wilful or presumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong ?
i think you are wrong-headed .
i 'm having a little conversatin with the marshal .
he 's gone behind my back .
well , a fellow tht carries a bigbore sharps carbine might come in handy , if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something .
we do n't need him .
got everything ready 
ll but the grub .
there s no hurrahing in it .
how much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
five hundred dollars ?
yep .
bibbs was a little senator .
well , i guess i 'll just stick with sis .
the bibbs family 's put up another $ 1,500 for chany .
have they now .
what are the terms ?
well , you can tell him to his face , you can spit in his eye , you can make him eat sand out of the road , you can shoot him in the foot , and i 'll hold him for yu .
she ai n't going , anyhow .
she 'll make nothing but trouble .
maybe i 'll catch this chaney by myself and take all the money .
how d you go about that ?
i 'd dispte your claim , i 'd muddy up the water .
i ai n't nver seen nobody from texas i could n't shade .
la boeuf , you get crossways of me , and you 'll think a thousand f brick have fell on you .
that reward money 's just a pig in the poke .
look at hm grin , h 'll cheat you .
we 'll get your man , that s th main thing .
you srry piece of trash .
i 'll send it to you .
that 's a big story .
you 've not heard the last of mattie ross .
you may well hear from my lawyer , daggett .
lawyer daggett ?
who 's lawyer daggett ?
red .
the river looks kind of high .
yeah .
well now , red  if i was to tell you that , you might tell him .
i would say , tom chaney , look out .
ca n't you get anything through your head ?
you 're not getting on this ferry .
i have paid my 10 cents for horse and rider .
red , take this girl into town to the sheriff .
there 's also a $ 50 reward .
ask the marshal .
oh , she 's a runaway , all right .
lawyer daggett again .
she draws him like a gun .
i will do no such thing .
right .
they 're loaded down with fat men and iron .
i 'm going to raise welts on you like worms .
drop that switch , la boeuf .
you 're enjoying it too much .
you ll find that i go ahead with what i start .
just leave her alon .
get on your horse .
it 's not dinnertime by now ?
presbyterian , huh ?
southern or cumberland ?
southern .
my flks are cumberland .
i was raised in an episcopal church myself .
figured you for some kind of kneler .
well , ned was sighted at mcalester 's store about three days ago .
shrtest way to mcalester 's .
how far is it ?
around 60 miles .
do n't be looking around for me , i 'll be right here .
you look like a hog on ice .
i 'm stronger than i look .
what did you bring for us to eat ?
salt red pepper taffy .
what are those things ?
how many you got in there ?
you 're lucky to be where water 's so handy .
how long you boys down there been mounted on shep ?
go ahead and have your little joke , but i 'll tell you one thing , that little fellow there will still be running when that big american stud of yours is winded and collapsed .
sheep .
yeah .
hey , listen .
now , one of you 'll have to play the caller ,
i 'll tell you what to say and i 'll play all the other parts .
let t go .
that , baby sister , is no trade .
least little blackie likes the corn dodgers .
it 's the salt in them .
we wo n't get to mcalester 's by dark , so we better head for a dugout i know .
it 's empty , and we can shelter in it .
what do you want ?
well , there 's no room fr you here .
try that on the chimny .
speak up .
who 's in there ?
we do n't know any emmett quincy !
emmett , this is rooster .
one more minute , and you 're going to drink it .
well , now , do n't you bet your life on it .
what kind of papers you got on me ?
you better move .
tell those others to be careful with their guns .
we 're coming ot .
hit the dirt .
belly down .
spread-eagle .
put the horses in the lean-to .
cuff them .
get down there !
well , not by name , but i got a few john does .
i do n't remember any ned pepper .
got a messed-up lower lip .
a funny lip ?
was n't always like that .
in the lower lp ?
his upper lip .
ned 's got a new boy running with him with a black powder mark n his face .
that do n't bring nobody to mind either .
you do n't know anything i want to know , do you ?
how about you ?
i always like to help the law as long as it do nt harm my friends .
pretty good idea , 'cause otherwise i 'll turn you in back at fort smith .
and then if you live , i 'll get you three or four years
they 'll get that ball out of your lg , and i 'll give you two , three days to get out of the territory .
do n't go flapping your mouth , mon .
i 'll do the talking .
do n't let him spook you !
right good mounts to me .
cut that up for frying 
what are you looking at 
she 's after the man that killed her father .
his name is tom chaney .
led to killing in the end .
now  if you 'll just answer the marshal 's questions , he 'll help you .
i do n't like the way you look .
yes .
i do n't like the way you lok .
i hope you g to jail .
my lawyer will not help you .
it 's a shame , a kid like moon losing his leg .
too young to be hopping around on a log peg .
we seen ned and ace two days ago at mcalester 's .
i 'm played out , quincy .
i got to have a doctor !
i 'll tll what i know .
do n't leave me laying here .
i 'll see you get buried .
they 're going to rob the katy flyer .
did you see  fellow with them with a powder burn on his face ?
no .
george grrett 
methodist circuit rider out of austin , texas .
when 's pepper due here ?
send that money to my brother .
i 'll meet him later , walking the streets of glory .
quincy ?
let me have a cool drink of water .
look .
it 's one of papa 's gold pieces .
are yu sure ?
yes .
worth a little over $ 36 .
grandpa sperling gave papa two of these when he married mama .
at least we 're on ned 's .
now , go saddle the horses .
straighten up the place .
now , what we want to do is get them in that dugout .
i 'll shoot the last man through the door and we 'll have them over a barrel .
and so does the governor of txas .
all i know is there s a lot of them and only two of us .
why do n't i try to nick chaney bfore he gets inside ?
but if they break ,  'll nick chaney .
yes .
remember the turkey ?
what does ned look like 
so i wo n't shoot my foot off .
what for ?
well , i do n't want any .
what did you do before you became a peace officer ?
what did you do after the wr ?
you never told me yo had a wife .
my friends was a pack of river rats .
she did n't crave their society , so she upped and left me nd went back to her first husbnd who was clerking in a hardware store in paducah .
goodby , reuben , she says ,
well , i told her , i said , goodbye , nola , and i hope that nail-selling bastard makes you happy this tim .
did you have any children ?
why , i did n't consider it stealing .
i never robbed no citizen or taken a man 's watch .
i had to flee for my life .
no horse could run him into the ground .
when that posse thnned out , i turned old bo around , and taking them reins in my teeth , i charged them boys firing two navy sixes .
they must 've all been married men that loved their families 'cause they scttered and run for home 
you do n't have any family , do you ?
general price do n't belong to me .
looks like moon was telling the truth .
you see chaney ?
that 's him hollering .
there 's a younger ne , but he ai n't a patch to this one .
mon !
quincy !
i 'm hit !
they do n't call him lucky ned pepper for nothing 
yeah .
well ...
well , wht 's your story ?
i was on the move to a better place .
i heard the first shot , and i thought you 'd opened up .
more likely asleep .
you know who they are 
the one on the sand spit is old hayes .
the boy i do n't know .
he 's not much older than i am .
why do n't yu go make us some coffee 
let it go and go on inside .
why are you being so foolish ?
well , la boeuf , you 're qte a horse shooter .
i was trying for ned pepper .
well , next tme , try for the horse and maybe you ll hit pepper .
what are we waiting for ?
and  say no .
you ca n't tak men by watching them run away .
we 'll take the horses and the dead in to mcalester .
some , for now .
do n't think about you at all .
i was told in fort smith that you rode with quantrill and that border trash .
but a bunch of murdering thieves .
i heard they murdered women and children in the lawrence raid .
freeport , with kirby smith .
i served with general kirby smith .
i do n't have to hang my head when i say it , either .
go ahead and make another joke about it .
and i do n't like your conversation about captain quantrill .
otherwse , leave it alone .
you know , i 've ben thinking about lucky ned pepper .
maybe he planned on murdering those two stock thieves so they would n't inform against him .
ned does n't go around killing people for no reason .
sre , marshl .
yeah , about half the load i was looking for .
why do n't you go in and meet mrs. mcalester ?
maybe mrs. mcalester cn fix that poor little hand of yours .
rooster  what are you doing here ?
go ahead .
that 's what texas calls a peace officer .
i have a pretty good idea where ned 's holed up .
if he is where i think he is , it will take 100 mrshals to smoke him out .
his name 's tom chaney .
i want you to bury them for me .
what about la beuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 're of no good use when you 're handicappd .
why ?
go wash , gaspargo .
that 's moon .
i know this boy , billy walsh .
he comes from a good family down by the south canadian .
sell the horses and get what you can for their cots , guns , and saddles .
his brother s a preacher named george garrett .
bots , send this man $ 10 , and tell him his brother got caught and is buried here .
i 'll do that .
so this s the man who shot ned pepper 's horse from under him .
yeah , ths is the famous horse killer from el paso .
fewer horses , fewer horse thieves .
both rifle and hand are ready to shoot again .
you stay here with the mcalesters .
that 's far enough .
you think i 'm gon na quit when we 'r so close ?
there s something in what she 's saying , cogburn .
i 've said my piece .
there 'll be no more talk about
who won whose spurs 
i 'm going .
now , we 'll have no more talk abut it .
what are you doing ?
you could n't see t if you saw it .
he put his foot wrong .
he 's tired .
i 've freighted iron stoves up harder grades than this .
i was a pretty fair hand with a jerkline when  was freighting in colorado .
worked for a fellow that was always dwn with something .
he was carrying around a 21-foot tapeworm , along wth his business responsibilities .
that aged him .
lord god , how they hate to pay up .
what about the $ 25 i pad you ?
i will not bandy words with a drunkard .
we have come near about 50 miles from mcalester .
tomorrow we 'll take him .
if we 're as close to ned pepper as you say ,
i do n't think too much of making that fire .
where are you going with that canteen ?
we got no water to spare for foolishness .
take a drink and let t go at that .
 'd say there 's a stream down below there .
shuld n't one of us go down with her ?
might not be safe .
well  safr for her than whatever she meets , man or beast .
well ...
i know you , little mttie , the bookkeeper .
there 's no money for yu to squeeze around here .
i came to fetch water .
and i think i will not go .
now , how do you like that ?
how many officers ?
i 'd say right arund 50 , and thy men business 
so you just walk right in front of me , p that hill .
i think i 'll oblige those officers to come after me .
if you refuse to go with me , i 'll have to shoot you .
you better cock your piece .
all th way back until it locks .
now , you mean to say that you wo n't go with me on your own free will ?
now you will follow me .
sis !
i 'm down here !
i just did n't think you 'd do it 
one of my short ribs is broke .
you 're just a piece of trash !
you little bsybody !
i 'll teach you a lesson you 'll never forget !
sis !
sis !
hurry up !
down here !
take her and go !
up the hill with the horses , and do n't stop .
who all 's out there ?
they 're all armed and they mean business .
who 's ut thre ?
rooster , can you hear me ?
you better answer , rooster , r i ll kill this girl !
you want me to kill her ?
she 's nothing to me .
nothing but a runaway .
i wo n't gve you any more .
i wo n't trust yu .
all right , we 're moving , but we 'll need more than five minutes .
i 'm mattie ross of dardanelle in yell county .
where are your wounds ?
bob , you and harold stay here , keep a watch out below .
keep this turkey cock quiet , or we 'll have him for supper .
is tht man simpleminded ?
all the parmalees is touched , but harold 's the worst .
but they 're all good shots .
get there !
farrell , lend him a hand .
they better show .
tom chaney shot my father to death in fort smith .
i hired him to go after the murderer .
if i 'd killed him , i would not be in this fix .
my revolver misfired .
if i did , i 'd have one that worked .
i 'll give him a little more time .
was that rooster and th ranger waylaid us last night ?
did thy take quincy and mon ?
t was a terrible thing to see .
do you need a good lawyer ?
i need a good judge .
that man called hayes , he 's ded , too , and the boy that saved your life .
goes for your good frend rooster .
rooster cogburn is no good friend of mine .
he led us right into your hands .
yo lost the horse .
when we get out , i 'll send somebody back to fetch you with a frsh mount .
he wo n't harm you .
you understand that ?
yo d n't get paid .
let me ride up with you , farrell .
no .
harold ?
we ll see you tonight at ma 's .
a little smut wo n't hurt you .
that 's true , or else you and your chums would surely be dead .
he is your boss , you must do as he tells you .
i tell you i can do better than that .
put your hands up .
yo gt ver there .
verything 's against me !
you hurt , mattie ?
it was this girl who done it !
he 's found a place where we can watch .
where 's little blackie ?
rooster 's got hm .
i ca n't answer for her now .
where is she 
rooster !
make a run for it !
chaney , too !
well , rooster , will you give us the road ?
i have businss lsewhere .
i got no interest in you today .
stnd clear and yu wo n't get hurt .
you think one on four 's a dogfall ?
i mean to kill you in one minute , ned , or see you hanged in fort smith at the judge parker 's convenience .
which will it be ?
i call tht bold talk for a one-yed fat man .
fill your hand , yu son of a bitch !
rooster cogburn , not much .
well , rooster i 'm shot to pieces .
hooray for the man from texas !
some bully shot .
help me !
i warrant there 'll be another one before long , a little spindly one .
how do you like t ?
are you down there , sis ?
yes !
hurry !
hold on .
i 'm caught , and my arm is broken .
hang on right here .
damn that texan !
i ai n't dead yet , you bushwhacker .
hang on .
are you sure you do n't want the snake ?
no , but i do want that other gold piece .
forget the gold piece .
but it 's mine , and i want it .
onc after he was dead .
we 're going to hve to d something about this snakebite in a hrry .
we ca n't leave him like this .
if i do n't get you a doctor , you 're going to be deader than he is .
hold it !
boots !
you 're addressing him , chn lee , and general sterling pric .
i 'll be damned .
yo 're a little ...
you 're shrunk .
i 'll tell you frankly , sir ,
i fully intended to have you jailed , and i 'm just the man who could do it , but when mattie told me the straight of the matter ,
you have my thanks and , with certain reservations , my respect .
how nice .
well , how is sis ?
she commissioned me to pay you the balance of the $ 75 due in the matter of tom chaney .
lawyer j. noble daggett , are you a betting man ?
on occasion .
oh , no .
i stll d n't see why you did nt look up la boeuf 's girl when you were in waco .
i took the boy home to be buried in his ranger suit .
i do n't believe ther was one .
well , i was just a little busy .
them texicans forgot hw much money they offered for a reward .
i had to help them remember .
papa 's marker was nt what was ordered .
i think it s only rght that you have papa 's gun .
well , i 'm not so sure about that .
almost got you killed when it misfired once .
wll , then i suppose i ought to get you to show me how .
trust you to rde another tall horse .
you 're too old and too fat to be jumping horses .
well , come to see a fat old man smetim .
