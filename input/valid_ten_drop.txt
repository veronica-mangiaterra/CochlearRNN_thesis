bu t s kind of lie a geeky thing is probably the wa pinbl  perceived by the outsiers .
how do you perceive pinball ?
we are from tokyo  japn .
e are pinball lovers .
and the now it sem lmost ie a definition of a ner or a werd and marginl rson t be cught plyin pinbal 
but maye there 's someting attractive aot that .
i m the im morriso of piball .
i tink it 's reat for pinall .

i 'm defintl misundersto  you know .
but i tended to back away and said it s n rally man aint machine .
if  ca snse he rhythm of that game  th tempo of tt game , i wan na be working in andem ith it 
i  not fighting it .
i 'm orking ith it .
i guarantee you it 's chemically simila to that f atlets .
when athlets ge in the zone , they eel as thogh the 'r watcing themselves run the ball dn the field .
pinbal reminds me of like dreaing .
because lik when i 'm paying the game it s lke e .
i 'm not really ith like reality .
but yet you 're wachin wht you 're doing nd tyng to concentrat .
 really is  unque feeling to become on wh the mchne .
it 's sor of a zn wher yu 're sot f editating an tat 's all you 're cocenrated on is the pinball .
you frget everythn else .
you ca 't lose the ball out the mile 
and yu stretch it ot and you emllish it and you let l the pepe atching kn tha lk at ths person , this peson s just done  ver difficult thing .
when u get t u you initias on i 's li  there i am .
i own tis game .
i pt a lot f play time in on ths mcine 
 try to den t .
tat 's my home territory .
i was just simply head of the machine .
i was accumulating so many fre games .
and eentually afte ab thre o four hours i  o go .
so in a sens tere is a possibilty ou have the illusion hat you 've wo .
her is somethng ievabe bot losing a piball .
bcuse there is a feelig ften when ou 're aying pnbal that th machine decides when you ned to go he .
he obect of play in pinball is a hh score 
when you see a ruly sklled pinball playe  you realise it is a game of skill , not a gam f chance .
it 's ure adrenline .
no what you have are playes wh control t temp of the game .
i se i with my ss , in all hosty .
tere are times when i stand bck and marv at the fact that tey have the abii that hey have .
i look at  game , i try to find  weakness and exploit that weaknes for my own game .
this is a srt .
o stand and stay fcused for tat long , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm soe n my les 
i 'm sore in my shoulds .

was lay pinball bu , ge , my mom told me tht i should et a career .
bcase i have pinall as my own wrld .
a diaod in the rough that i have prsonall shined .
pinball 's somehing tha s one someting fr me that i had to discover for myself 
tt was aready there in a wold hat gives us all kinds o input about suff tht w do nt even wnt to her other peopl 's input about .
and i knew that a hat input was mitaken 
nbll i a world of special rule and uniqu opprunties .
i would even go a fr  say i m spial beause of pinbll .
i 've aays laed inball .
you ' choke , you would n' do well , and you 'd hv to wat a year to try again .
bu py no mind to t .
there 's a strg enl omponent to remain cam and in control 
he best payers never do soething that affects th ball uess tey do it for a urpose .
and all control does n't mean always cathing the ball , it means putting th ba were you nt i so you kow where it 's going to be next , o just where t is right nw .

i proram pinball machins .
i wor ith desiners ad bsically make the gae do all of wha it os .
i was in coege  it was around 1986 .
it was about five years afer that that i started competing .
the eaiest tin is to hi th flippes indidually .
i do nt knw ...
you know , when hey frt play .
multiball ere .
going o try and et o of the bals over the other fliper to make a shot .
soe soe poits .
nd i watched ths prsn methodiall o a passing sot ovr , ma the shot , ick don , o up , passing ho , ove .
o i bounce the ball over to the other flipe , now it 's under cnrol .
i nev thought of playing pinbll tha way .
you sa a pinball ?
ly inall ?
hre e are .
world pinall champinsips .
and withi one week thee was a hurricane named iva that cam up the east coast and th little creek in font f here overfowed its banks .
and thee was notg to e done .
everythig w had jst finshed was washe away .
i was us frstrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up o i culd decide if i wnted to try gan .
it did prove posble to le up nd ebui .
you can have a grea game .
there are a couple f eope who a ig-quality pers .
ver focsed when they play , toug to beat .
on sip and t ball goes .
and that 's it .
it crainly pesntd an entertainmnt pion tha was awfully compelling 
in 1980 you could not pssibly bild enogh ideo gaes to saurate he maret .
and all of a sudden o income doubled and triped overnght .
it just blew me away .
and then the pinball sat thee almost forlorn-looking .
you ca n't see anyting xcept the screen .
when you play pinball you 're plaing a piec of equipment that you can moe around and ontrl 
pinball mchins you a n't d that .
it 's a pinball machine .
there 's  bginnng but t 's endless 
i finised it .
he real backbreaker cae when home video finaly hit the marketplae .
of eite myself playing at home o me and y uddy playing at home .
but it really spld the ed of crtiy he pinball ra .
it was widly beleved at h tie tha video games ad usurpd pinball and there a  log a need fo pnbal atsoever .
pinall was back  te map again .
after a dcad f declne , flipper ar faping .
bumpers are umping .
pinbal is oucig back .
i had a lot of life tied  in i .
i wa rall a presence and just the daily iteraction o th old tat  had at my dorstp h i knew i as never gon n hav again 
it wa a lifeefini moment that saddens m and still sadens me actually .
 go out no nd i see some of my old fiends and i py piball and tha ' nice .
that 's jut eve gn n happen or me aai .
so if you ook at the downide of it all , pinbal deserves a beter ate than what it curtly hs .
in truth it is n't a big pt of our cultre an ore 
u i 'm not ure that anyne wll ae i 10 to 15 years .
were piball not to urvive , t wrld would continue bu a little bi of the fabric of life would b gone .
i tink that there is a fleetin ese  one 's naiveé d inocence that games brig out 
and a we get older , for may o us , we step away from doin thse things that gav u joy when we were younger .
and i thin that that oss of innocence is tough .
and everybod should try i at some point in time .
you have a universe in a box .
