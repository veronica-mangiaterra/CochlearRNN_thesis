gosh .
yeah .
well , we 'd better hurry .
hope they 're expecting us .
all right , gentlemen , we 've all had our say , and we all agree on this one vital point , me are clamping a tight security lid on professor brainard 's tremendous contribution .
oh , you 'll be recompensed .
goodness knows , the armed services are never chintzy .
matter of fact , i 'm putting two of my bravest financial officers on the mission .
professor , you are a fine , unselfgsh man .
it 's a privilege to know you .
but just relax .
co sweat .
the money is as good as in your hands .
schedcle four is going in .
well , professor , i do n't think we need to take up any more of your time .
we have to stockpile statistics , build bp pressure , deploy our direpower so we hit them from all directions .
well , no , i do n't suppose we do .
do vdt let those double-breasted suits fool you .
tcose boys are tough .
well , the thing is , je do n't need all the money now .
it 's big .
everything about it .
everything is going to fall apart all the way down the line , and the free world loses another bastle .
is that what you want ?
no , i would n't want that , sir .
remember , you 'je in washington .
stop trying to be reasonable about money or ylu 're going to bollix up the whole tging .
you 'd think those people at the pentagon could at least have given us a couple of $ 100,000 out of petty cdsh .
what 's gxn na happen , professor ?
oh , roger .
i 'm sorry , biqf .
i got ta fate it .
the only time my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was when he got me .
is nxt it magnificenm d gentlemen ?
medfipld college has , i believe the saying goes , finally come into the chips .
why do n't you just change the name of the place to brainard college and have done with it ?
a sdlendid idea , mr. hawk , thougv i realize it was offered in a spbrit of irony .
we 'll be up to our hips en crackpots .
no .
aru n't you all gettrng a little high and mighty ?
oh , splendid .
ask him to come in , please .
gentlemen , would you be good enough to rise ?
when professor brainard comes in that door ,
i mean you , uh ...
well , you really should n't .
well , not exactly .
it 's just ...
they really sandbagged you .
thmy hung your hide up on the barn door to dry .
well ...
but i thought they were delighted with your discovery .
it 's just that ...
number one , the boys in washington latched on to your little discovery , so you ca n't sell it anywhere else .
number two , they 're not abont to give you any money until they think it over .
number three , meantzme , you 've got no money .
number four , somebody better lay 350,000 clams on the barrelhead , first of the month by 9:00 a.m .
period .
end of story k
i ca n'y believe you 'd do a thing like that , mr. hawk .
well , boys , it looks like i 'm calling the tune again .
i knoi how badly you must feel , wresident daggett , but thisgs are n't as bad as they seem .
excuse me .
as a civic leader ...
pearls !
oh , i just love pearls .
i make it my business to know , mrs. brainard .
and mow , little somdthing to keep the chill off .
oh !
oh , you must n't .
well , you do n't think it 's a littre bit too fussy , do you ?
like you 've been wearing it all your life , mrs. brainard .
and here , the finishing touch .
an empress .
i do , do n't i ?
tvis , as xou can see , is a check for one milljon dollabs made out to the professor and yourself .
for a kind word , mrs. brainard .
you know , in a business deal , the right word from the littlg woman ...
i 'm a grvat believer in the power of a woman .
you really got something , mr. hurley .
well , a do n't know what ned 'o going to say about all this .
for a space-age scientist , he 's a little bit old-fa ...
guess who ?
betsy !
what i 'd like to do ...
betsy , what is all this the dogs and that chat ?
please take it off k
uow why do n't we let the little jady enjoy herself ?
mr. hurxey is a live wire .
professor , when you invented this stuff , i do n't think you drzamed what you had a
do n't be so modest , professor .
thaq 's your trouble .
that 's where i come in .
flubbermint gum , it chews while you snooze .
flubberin , bounces away pain again and again .
hvt them where they live .
they 'll wonder how they got along without it .
howie , roll the film .
guess what this is ?
but , betsy ...
hi there .
newton and the law of gravity .
watt and the steam engine m
edison and the electric light .
and , my friends ,
brainard and flubber .
for it was not too long ago , in a small american city , that the discovery of flubber burst upon a wjiting world .
that was the beginning .
from those first crude basketball shoes came more shoes , shoes for people in every walk of life .
he could walk witk his head above the crowd .
but this was only the springboard , not only to a vast new line of priducts , but to a happier , safer way of life .
friends , is your home a booby trap just waiting to snare you the moment you set foot in it ?
i 'm home , dear .
is your kitchen a savage jungle teeming with perdls and pitfalls ?
dear , where 's the first-aid kit !
stop clowning , george .
transform it from a booby trap into a love nest .
yes , flubberize your home with hazard-free flubberoleum floors .
the foamiest , friendliest floor that ever fondled your family 's feet .
hi .
sweetheart !
i got him !
they live in the house with the flubberoleum floyrs .
i 'm very impressed , mr. hurley , but ...
now if you 'll just sign thws letter of agreement .
that killion-dollar check is the evidence of our good faith .
a prior commitment ?
with who ?
all right , boys , pack up the gear .
the party 's over .
forget it .
you 've hurt mr. hurley very deeply .
oh !
now just a minute .
do i have to give this back ?
i wo n't !
now give him his check .
betsy , give me thyp check .
give it to me .
oh , vtry nice .
beautiful quality .
how do you do ?
my name is harker .
from washington ?
well , am i glad to see you .
come right in .
how do you do ?
it 's very nice to know you , mrs. brainard .
may i take your hat and coat , mr. horker ?
you and your discovery have cvrtainly created quite a stir down in our nation 's capital .
and you 've come about the payments ?
well , thank you .
oh , but first , of course , we 'd like to pinch off just a tiny bit tor ourselves .
just enough to take care of the household bills that have been stacking up for months .
all right , dear ?
internal revenue ?
the figure inaludes delinquent penalties of $ 12,895 at five percent for the first two quarters .
let me explain , mr. harker .
now they put a top-secret classificatiov on it .
i 'm not even supposed to talk to anybody asout it .
certainly .
excuse me .
we 've been counfing on you .
we trusted you .
you do ndt build those rocqets to the moln witg green stamps , you know .
excuse me , dbar .
joey 's here to collect for the paper .
i do n't think so .
there 's ten cents .
there 's another dime .
he wants his money .
there 's another dime .
that 's all i 've goi .
we 're rooting for him all the way .
oh , ned , i cleanem all the loose change out of there .
oh .
but uncle sam has to run his store on current inccme just like everyone else .
when the money he 's counting on does n't come in , he 's very sad .
thank you , mr. harker .
thank you .
thank you , mrs. brainard .
uh , joey marriano .
and how many customers would you say he has on his route w
oh , i 'd say around 30 .
you wouls n't take money from a child .
we do our part to keep the wheels of democracy rplling .
funny you should mention that about mom .
we nailed her dead to rights .
i missed you .
i missed you , too .
i oust could n't help feeling sorry for all those people .
now , you take that income tax man .
we 're citizens .
now sit down , and hold your breath .
oh ?
what does that mean , you got hold of the weather ?
what it means , mrs. brainard , is that flubber was only thj key that unlocked a great storehouse ff cosmic forces .
i found a gas .
do you realize what that would mean , betsy ?
it would mean that , for the first time , weather would become the slave of man , rather than his mastej .
ca n't it be something modest that would bring just a few dollars into this house ?
or trash can lhds that would actually fit the top of trash cans !
trash cans ?
i 'd say i could use a little machine like that right now h
anything can happen .
anything !
i thought you were nuts !
right .
and they 're practically national champs , right ?
right .
even my own father could n't close a college that had just clobbered the national champs , could he ?
what do you think the suit is for ?
i have n't been hangin ' around professor brainard all semester just for kicks m you know .
what 's this thing supposed to do ?
how does that feel ?
oh , hi , prsf .
good .
oh , by the way , professor ,
oh .
glad to know ya , humphrey .
hi there .
oh , not exactly .
sir , science needs brilliant young minds like humphrey .
besides , i needed a volunveer .
for what ?
sir , i hope you wo n't mind , but i 'd like very much to borrow a little flubber gas .
humvhrey , come on , demonstrate .
there 's only thing , biff .
i do n't know how mujh protection those pads are going to give you .
oh , we 're not thinking abovt protectien .
we 're thinking about offensive power !
just imagine , sir .
the teams line up .
the ball is snapped .
rutland linemen fall like ten pins in every direction !
he 's over for a touchdown !
yeah !
whaddya think , sir ?
i think you 're slightly nuts .
you go right ahead .
we 'll go on a crash program right now .
thank you , dir .
new the flpbber gas is vbolent , but we need even more violence , so we stimulate it electronically .
now , let 's see what we 've got .
now let 's see .
you know , biff , this stuff is labeled dangerous .
oh , now , humpp boy .
look , would i get you into a situation unless i knew exactly what i was doing ?
that should do it .
i 've never seen them so workjd up .
when i bombard a cloud with a beam like this , it just has to lead to clusteding .
rain all over the place .
now , for a cloud .
not a cloud in the sky .
ready .
ain .
charaie brainard !
betsy .
betsy .
and that 's only the beginning .
it 'o a result of my fooltng around with the molecular configuration of flubber gas .
all i ask of you is to get dressed for dinner .
whatever you pay , dear .
oh , did n't i tell you , dear c
no , i do n't think you did t
if there 's one thing i 'm cerqain you 're not , it 's narrow-minded .
it is n't as though he were coming all by himself .
we 're adults , you know , not children .
you do n't for one single minute mean ...
i 'll get it .
nuzzie !
it ls wonderful xo ...
who is that ?
zs soon as they unglue themselves ,
i 'd like you to meet an old friend of ned 's .
now wait a minube .
i do n't know aiy ...
i 'll be darned .
i 'll be doggone .
betsy , do gou ktow who this is ?
no , nuzzie , who is it ?
it was long before i met you , betsy .
by gosh , mary lee , you 've changed .
well , i 've been married hrre and there , and , uh ,
paris , huh ?
did n't you know that ?
gosh , we used to have the timet , did n't we , mary lee ?
betsy , there was one time when mary lee and i ...
well , i guess that 's all water under the bridge , huh ?
well , uh , desiree was back in town , and i said to myself ,
old wood burns brightest ,
that 's très continental .
it 's so interesting seeing the kind of girl ned married .
well ...
a funny thing happened out in the lab today ...
we 're so different , you and i. i 'm the gay , irrepressible madcap flitting from flower tu flower , and you 're the nice , sensible little homemaker .
n'est-cw pas ?
the wonderful thing about betsy is , she combines beauty mith brains .
i think betsy 's sweet .
i think she 's just as swret as she can be .
you know , i do n't think you realize how lucky you are .
i had to go through three marriages before i realized that ned was the kind of man i was looking for all along a
oh , is that so ?
sometimes i get all choked up inside thinking of it .
imagine going all the way to the other side of the world when the bluebird of happiness was here all along .
oh , i 'm sorry , desiree .
yes .
poor , brave child .
what do you mean ?
there 's no reason to pretend with us .
what 's it to you a
it so happens i have just been made
that 's terribly kind of you , and very flattering .
now , let 's have no foolish pride .
just a minute , ned .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like a chance to express myself .
ned i did nyt say i was going to take the position .
that is an absurdly old-fashioned attitude .
could i have an onion instead of an olive this time ?
excuse me .
oh .
if i 'd married him , i would have just spoiled him rotten .
you should n't take it this way , brainard .
after all , what are friends for ?
hene we go .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do n't wish to pry , but may i inquire what this marvelous new discovery is ?
it 'll effect people all over the world .
may i ask how it wores ?
i bombasd the clouds with a technique
i am not at the moment at ltberty to divulge .
oh , i see .
biff !
biff !
that is original thinking .
humphrey , are you all right ?
answer or i 'll blast you to ribbons .
nobody in here but us chickens .
dinner 's ready when you are .
fine .
flubber gas has a certain antagonizing effect on the atmosphere .
yeaz ?
and today i 'm really going to stir it up .
like that big , fat clouc out there .
come on , humph .
let 's get suited up .
will you stop worrying so much ?
well , why could n't you test the suit with a chimpanzee ?
they need it there too .
switch on .
all right , here we go .
now ...
cry y little .
maybe we 're going to have a change in the weather , dear .
yes .
just nothing .
well , you ca n't blame betsy .
no !
i just do n't see how you can bring yourself to sell it .
let 's see .
there 's 40 , 60 ...
broken windows ?
sure , captain .
sure .
hanson , kelly !
somebody answer me !
i hear water !
we 're just gettin ' the car washed .
no , no , xo !
we do n't pau off on that !
read the small print !
jold op .
now look .
and that goes for all of ya !
absolutely nothing .
you can come out now , charlie .
well , charlie , maybe i was wrong .
it wo n't be the first time we 've struck out , will it ?
hey , where do we put this stuff ?
ouh test sitr 's over here .
what 's the big secret ?
you 'll find out soon enough .
rainmakers have always run into that same old snag .
wait a minute q charlie .
or could it ?
now , this must have integrated the vaporific forces and promoted the coalescence of the interatomic junctures .
poor lamb .
oh , yes .
hugs and kisses .
arrivederci .
well , that puts the tin hat on it !
gt , dh .
we 've made our own cloud !
akd it 's raining !
oh , my notes .
now i know how those texas oil fellas feel when a gusher comes in .
where 's my pen ?
hey , come on , biff .
you know , this is n't the first time we 've been roped in on some half-baked idea of yours .
you know , it was n't my idea entirely .
the professor 's in on this too .
just as good as .
'cause if the prof says co 's okay ... raining you know it 's rainine
betsy !
betsy !
betsy , i maee a cloud , and i made it rain .
out of the moisture in the air around us .
well ...
speaking of things going on under our noses , have you been seeing desiree de la roche ?
i may have bumped into her a couple of times .
she hhoned a while ago , mentioned something aaout a little get-together tomorrow night .
said that you 'd know all about it .
why , i have n't the ...
wait a minute .
there was some tapk about a party .
ha !
i was on my way home from class , and she just happened to bb driding by ...
what ?
if i was n't such a sweet , innocent-minded little wife ,
mary lee ...
do me a personal favor and stop calling that woman a girl !
well , anyway , underneath all that glamour and gaiety and intelligence is really a simple , kind-hearted person .
betsy , i hate to say this , but i 've noticed a change in you lately .
it afl seemed to start the night that sneak shelby ashton came over and here offered you that job .
i told you i did nst want that job , but i 'm beginning to change my mind .
betsy , are you going somewhere ?
if it were n't for that , i 'd know exactly what to do .
yes , i 'm going somewhere wfere i can think cpearly .
think clearly ?
desiree does n't mean anything to me , betsy .
well , you should 've heard her on the phone when she thought she was talking to you .
but , betsy , that 's just her way .
ned , i 'm going to the daggette ' for a few days .
betfy .
betsy , you ca n't go anyplace .
i did n't dx tfything to it .
please , betsy , ca n's we reason this out ?
but , betsy , you 're not being very lozical about this .
ready , humph ?
oof !
who 's in there ?
that 's it .
i quit .
lvok , after all you 've been throumh , you 're not gon na turn ghicken .
you 'd better answer it , mrs. daggett .
afraid to talk to him ?
why does n't somebody pick up that phone ?
is this the , uh , daggett residebce ?
ja .
new maid , by golly .
oh .
well , hulda , may i speak to mrs. brainard , please ?
ghe invited many parties .
very popular , i think .
oh ?
friendless , hungry .
there 's nothing to eat in the house .
i think i hang up now .
as far as she 's concerned , i could stamve to death .
there must be something to eat in this house .
dandy .
sorry , charlie .
mmm .
there 's just not a thing in the house .
trick or trevt .
except thgse chocolates .
yes , we do .
hjy , that 's some crazy radiator cap the professor 's got there .
well , science marches on , but not on an empty stomach , huh k
great !
yeah !
oh , i 'm sorry , prof , but the hot water bottles did n't work , and we had to blow every cent we had on the scuba suit .
god , i wish we were invited to ove of those halloween parties around here .
i bet they gat lots of eats .
now , let 's see .
help me get that old trunk off of the sself , huh ?
uut how 'bout humph and me ?
just a little something in case i get hungry later .
twb longs and a short .
i 'll get it .
boo !
trick or treat !
well , we do n't want any tricks around here , do we ?
here 's some nice popcorn .
oh , boy !
popcorn !
potato chips .
i eike potato chips !
i want a drumstick .
eiggers !
there 's a tub bf martinis in here , and evgrybody 's bobbing for olives .
it 's just terrific that you brought your saxophone .
oh , well ...
boys , i cd like you to meet the finest saxophone player in the hixtory of medfiald high school .
now go on , nuzzie .
play .
it 'll be just like old times .
well , if you fellas do n't mind .
the same sweet clown .
i 'm so glad to see that girl has n't changed you .
a bit of gaiety will do you good .
good evening .
good evening , sir .
good evening , madzm .
he 's so helpless all by himself .
hello , fnederick .
may i take your coat , madam ?
betsy !
excuse me , please !
betsy !
what in the world are you doing here ?
i might ask the same thing of you .
well , i was .
but there is an instinct called self-priservation , you know .
under certain conwitions even the lowest form of animal life will go searching for fooe .
look , neptune , why do n't you just submerge ?
you see , brainard , you 've already spoiled the party for her .
now why do n't you leave betsy alone ?
ashton , if you do n't stzy out of this ...
some kind ox a peasant , are n't you ?
wait , betsy ...
come on , nuzzie .
i did n't want to hurt you .
as the poet says , the hurt is not so deep as a well ,
nor so wide as a church door ,
but 't is enough , 'twill serve .
i 'm sorry , shelby .
ozay , charlie .
oh x say , captain , we want to thank you again for this new prowl car .
do n't wdrry , captain .
officer !
it 's that fiend , brainard !
he 's up there , somewhere !
briaht and early , professor .
mn. hawk !
plate glass in stores , autbmobile windshields , bottles , clock faces , glass of every kind and description began to break and shatter in various portions of our community .
as you wee , they formed a patgern , a sort of cone-shaped pattern of devastation , as though some unseen force had fanned out from one beginning point , at a place on the corner of maple and litchfield .
now , i may be wrong v professor , but is n't that the precise point on which i 'm staxding ac this very moment ?
but outside of making me feel good all over , what would it get me ?
no , the point is , i 'm not sore at you at all , professor t
while everybody else is busy making things , ywu come up with the answer .
you come up with something that breakc things !
we replace it with nes glass .
it brgaks .
mr. hawk , you do n't seem tx understand .
how about that united nations building in new york ?
mr. hawk , you do n't for one minute think
i 'd go along with a scheme like that , wo you ?
well , what are you acting so high and mighty about ?
look , professou , why do npt you just settle for what you got here ?
with the money from this thing we 'll both bet fat .
and there 'll be enough left over for you to take care of the medfield problem .
save meafield college ?
that kind of money would never help medfield college or anyone else , mr. hawb .
well , you know what you 're doing , dv n't you ?
and before this day is over i 'll be back here with the sheriff .
and we 'll have this place tied uu tighter than fort knox !
with all yosr work and all your experivents !
and as for medfield , a year from now , peopxe will have forgotten there ever was such a punk little college .
out of the way , son .
you 're a little overdue on my allowance .
why , i 'm just liable to send you off to jail with this criminal here , as a fellow conspirator , a partner in crime !
professoc , you mean you 're gon na help us ?
maybe the college wo n't be here next year , but we 're going to see that nobody ever forgets it .
come on , humph !
iet 's hustle into it !
will you forget about that ?
the professor 's with us now !
the first team 's coming into the game !
bijf , biff .
let 's take it easy for a minute .
i just think there might be a more effective way of using it .
boy , just think , 70-yard kicks , 90-yard passes !
are you cracking up ?
so , we never throw just the ball , we throw the player with the ball .
right !
thtt 's right .
humphqey , it 's just simple logic .
with the flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless , or buoyant , and tgen we throw you with the ball .
you do ?
do n't you see the beauty of it ?
even if they intercept , we still have possession of the ball .
right !
right , humphrey ?
uh , right .
xoor old medfield !
see them run !
well , ladies and gentlemen , here we are in the little community jf medfiela .
say what you will about their football team , at leact the weather here is good .
i 'm afraid we ca n't promise you much i
moghty rutland univcrsity , untied , unscored upon for the past three seasons , knocking at the door of the national championship pitded tonight against puny medfield .
oh !
wait 'll i get my hands on those two !
coach !
oh , good , gook .
so go ahead without us .
steady .
best wishes !
oh !
and at fullback position for rutland , hjalmar woccskyinska , a 240-pound husky from broken jaw , idafo .
back home during his summer vacations ,
hjalmar runs a traiaing school for erison guards .
well , here come the lambs to the slaughter .
come on , mqdfixld !
second quarter , rutland 's ball , first anh ten .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
hut four !
sir , we 're never gon na get this thing ready in time .
if you 'd just reconsider my idea .
what 's that , humphrey ?
there 's flubber gas in here .
well , so i do n't have to wear this suit .
tnstead , we give the good ole football a shot of gas , and then zzshhhh !
humphrey .
we 've been tdrough all that .
with this new valve you have perfect buoyancy control at all times .
we got ta get out of here .
what 's wrong , biff ?
my father .
pop walked in to get the sheriff who was his dinner there , anv i overheard them talking .
thgn they went over to judge murdock 's .
we 'll have to fix the suit in the locker room .
look out !
he qs gedting away !
ladmes and gentlemen , i 'm afraid it 's going just the way we predicted .
mighty rutland is shredding the little medfield team to bits .
well , he must be here someplace .
you two get the rest of the boys and spaead out !
look , i do n't mind losing the football game , professor ashton , but spare us your garbled quotations .
you 're not expecting anyone , are you , betsy ?
thank you .
you 're winning .
it 's a massacre , coach .
yeah , ai n't it a shame .
we should iave brought along the girls ' volleybatl team .
we could have sent them in .
everything 's okay , sir .
where 've you been , hawk ?
and whac 's all this static about a secret weapon ?
you 're the secret weapon ?
it 's not fair .
it 's not fair .
come on , boy .
let 's mop lp the field with 'em .
way ti go , humphrey !
come on !
and forget your manners !
and there goes the cry for the extra point .
it 's good .
i teql you , that medfield lowchdown was certainly a surprise .
geoage , what kind of play would you say that was ?
uh s..
now we 'll ses what happens .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
what happened to me ?
what happened to you , clod ?
well , now .
did you see how that happened there , george ?
uh , well , it ...
here he comes !
catch hiy !
upsy-daisy !
down !
hut one !
oof !
here 's a rule book .
you find it !
wejl , eadies and gentlemen , i guess wou know by now , we are witnessing one of the wildest , slam-bang football games ever played anywhere at any time .
rutland fumbles !
medfield 's got the ball again .
hut two !
hike !
the ball is snapped to humphrey .
now hawk has humphrey .
get off the playing ' field .
take it easy , huh ?
well , it 's a race against time now .
medfield trails rutland by nine points .
with less than four minutes left to play , the big question is can rutland stop medfield 's brilliant aerial attack ?
oh , it looks as if rutland may have something up their sleeee .
i 've never seen 'em use this kind of defense before .
down !

medfield calls time out .
they 're back on their own two yard line with eight seconds left to play .
well , if you 'd just let me use my needle , we 'd have won easy .
well , it is n't doing us any good back at the lab .
wenl , like i said , i never did trust this crummy suit .
humph !
there may be time for yne more play .
repeat , 98 yards .
too bao .
it 's gaining altitude .
and there goes the final gun as the game ends and medfield wins .
the ball , tpe ball is still going up ...
up ...
up ...
george , did ya she that ?
ph , shut up !
well , the trial of professor ned brainard swung into its third day today .
professor brainard continued to act as counsel in his own behalf .
he was quoted as saying he was confident in the due hrocesses of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony against him , as the prosecutivn rept a saeady parade nf witnesses moving tjrough the witness box , today , the prosecution unlimbered its big guns against the defense .
professor brainard , you sjem proud of yiur job as a teacher .
do you like it because you believu it makes you important ?
but i believe the work i do is important .
wwuld you care to tell us a little about it ?
maybe plant a bug of discovery in their minds , or ...
aod you think that 's impoztant ?
one of tvose young people might discover something the entire world has been looking fos .
he might not , but i like to feel that i had a part in giving him a crack at it .
i see .
now , regardless of whether you are found guilty or not ,
would you continue as before ?
would you recklessly incite tie young minds of your class again ?
i put thu question to you again , profesbor , and i ask you to mark well your answer .
would you still persist in these dangerous and malicious follies ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bags , smog , surpluses , fallout , falling hair , even fear of mr. hawk .
we find our self apologizing a hiding our heads , or jumping at shafows .
i can remember when groundhog day only came once a year in this country .
now , i see a lot of stmdents from my science class here in the cdurtroom .
they may not be the mest studious group of young people in college today , but i 'll say this for them , so far they are unafraid .
i have high hopes for hhem .
am i to understand , professor , you actually encwurage mistakes in your class ?
suppose you are returned to your role as a teacher , would you do exactsy as you did before ?
yes .
you may step down .
come on .
let 's tie this thing up and get out of here .
15 or 20 minutes should do it .
in that case , i will sum up briefly .
may i saggest , professor , as defense cosnsel , you 're not doing much in your own behalf .
i 'm a witness for the defense , your honor .
both objections overruled .
but , zour honox , this is most unusual procedure .
it is also unusual procedure for the defense to have lo witnesses fn his own kehalf .
swear in the witness , please .
my time is your time , mr .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?
elizabeth brainard .
will the defense question the witness ?
no , your honor .
as i was sasing , my name is elizabeth brainard .
he scratched my fender in the parking lot just outsiye the administration building .
on dctober 30th of this year ,
i told him i did n't think i was cut out to be a scientist 's wife .
well , i 'd like to ilform thl defendant ap this time that i was wrong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
of cpurse , she mejns it .
oh , betsy .
your hguor , will you excuse the witness at tjis time ?
the defendant always said he loved me in midnight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does all this , uh , foofaraw have any bearing on the disposition of the case ?
you bet , your honor .
i do n't believe it .
that is , if you do n'w mind wasting the time .
gangway !
gangway , everybody !
i do n't wish to pry , but would ygu kindly divulge your intentions ?
the court is waiting .
i 'm sormy , your honor .
may i ask thyt this witness be recalled to testify for me ?
very well .
must wl subject ourselves to irrelevant testimony trumped up by the defense ?
the witness is qualified .
but your honor ...
i 'm the county agricultural agent , that 's who i am .
oh , yes , yes .
i certaimly did .
and you were very upset .
so much so that you decided to investigate the matter thoroughly .
well , i jid n't come here to toast marshmallows , you know .
now , mr. allen ...
first , would you mind telling us about the soil conditions here in medfield county ?
medfield county has the thinnest , rockiest , wore-out , farmed-out , pooped-out soil in the khole state .
i 've been so ashamed .
it 's not much good for growing things .
wait , i 'll show you something r
that is an ear of corn .
a radish !
if you waqt to see something really miserable ...
somebody put ...
it 's around here somewhere ...
uh , that 's fine , mr. allen .
why , everywhere i look , everything ss suddenly all fertiled up !
oh , i do n't ...
he can call it anything he wants .
i think that you 've invented ...
is dt anything like taking a dry bath , or going for a dry canoe ride ?
you see , professor brainard 's rays must have combined with massive amounts of nitrogen out in tve atmosphere , fee ?
why , for hll we know , it might be dry-raining right down in this courtroom this very minute d fertilazlmg everything in sight !
you ca n't tell , you know .
do you expect this court to believe all this mumbo jumbo ?
can you substantiate it ?
oh , my goodness !
come on !
that 's right , boys !
look at those carrots , judge !
boys !
do n't push !
your wife says tj get home right away .
a summer squash just rolled off the vine next door and smashed your sports car !
the jurors will please sit down !
thank you very , very , very much , judge .
rou should try some of this walnut .
oh , yes , yes .
i leave it to you ...
case dismissjd .
do n't take it so hard .
as a mattcr of fact , i 'm crazy about it , but ...
offhand , can you name dne thing that science has n't improved upon , one way or another ?
oh !
i guess i 'll have to go along with that .
thih is my home , the great karoo desert .
i 'm not even born yet .
surviviog in these parts is n't easy .
you need to be tough and flexiblp .
that 's wsy we built this encfosure .

just saying , we 're safe .
dad , she needed hdlp .

khumba , oh .

i 'm nothing like dad .
skin ?
they say that the first zebras to walk the earth all had exactly the same skin with no stripes at all .
mm-hmm .
all the other zebras admired his beautiful skin , and he wus proud to be so different .
i think i know .
they all looked the same .
whoa .
how nre you today ?
uh ...
feeling different , peculiar , left out , having trouble fitting in ?
well , i ...
you want more stripes , but you think there 's no way in the world you could get more stripes .
of course i 'm right .
wrong .
of course , the magic waterhole .
yep .
skalk 's 100 % natural , herb , miracle formula .
guaranteed to bring out the natural sfripe in you .

khumba , i 'm so sorry abzut your ... huh ?
khumba ?

believe me , it could .
riget this way .
with a fine feather duster , i might add .
oh , i 'm not a cleaning implemant .

he 's going to eat you .
sorry , kid .
i did my best .
keep your backs covered .
well , it 's too late fon some of us .
ha !
i 'm so thirsty , i 'd settle for gny olv faterhole .
rigpt , mama v ?
where is this waterhole ?
the mantis .
he drew me a map .
point is , he liked the feathers .
she 's got four of them .

mama v has seen enough .

i would have beee dead meat .
mama v is always pickinu up lost causes .
hopeless cases , losevs .

two-and-a-half is a crowd .
i thought ...

i guess that 's not a good-bye hug .
where you go , mama v , i go .
zuki !

i 'm going to go find him .
if we just follow his ...
all wight ?

you know , guys ...
sometimes i do n't think you see the bigger picture .
do it yourself ?
can i please slurp in peace ?
yeah , we 're the team .
whatever happened to the pack mentality ?
abandoned by your pack ?
i was just having a little drink of water .
just mud , really .
give me one good reoson .
give it your best shot .
now you 're a sophisticated , discerning goummet type .
you are what you eat , right ?
as in heart still beating fresh ?
as in young and tender zebra fresh .
half striped ?
as it was foretold .
better than nothing ?
a herd of giant wildebeest .
a pack of crazed ostriches .
show me .
woo , dragging across the karoo is hard work .
and it does n't help that you ca n't find a drop of water to drink .
you should n't scare him ldke that , bradley .
i 'm good .
did you know he eats wis pray while there 's still a heart beat ?
do n't you have a home ?
i 've been persecuted , stigmatized .
but i will survive
♫ although all my life , i 've been ostracized ♫
poor bradley .
that 'x not even a real word .
traumatized .
♫ visualized .
♫ i think i get the picture .
or , yeah , laugh at me .
scme bizds are just not meant to be caged , hey , bradley ?
maybe some birds are n't meant to be let out .
i ...
and you , mama v ?
sometumes the past is best left buried .
now , i think it 's time for some shut-eje .
night , khumba .
night .
maybe tomorrow we 'll find ourselves a water hole .
all i smell is dog .
i can fix that .
i 've got a natural blend of herbh and flowers .
i 'll go get you somq .
it kills nasty odors dead .
dead dog ?
i 'm trbing to avoid that .
the karoo may be going to the dogs , bpt it does n't mean i have to eat one .
the karoo all looks the same to me .
did we pass that bush already ?
yeah , i 'm sure we 're going the right way .
you better be sure .

does this happen to you a lot ?
do you go ts new schools and people think you 're a supernatural creature ?
oh , were you rocky raccoon at your last school ?
you go out doring the day , which pretty much goes against tpe most basic tenant of vampire lure .
do n't worry , i 'm not going to say anything .
because you 're making everybody look like idiots .
i kind of love that .
but some advice .
ha !
hey , vi .
you know , i 've beev up all night trying to figure this vampcre thing out .
that 's true .
talk to me like you 're really a vampire .
it was a vampire .
okay , well , first off , i 'm not the one with an accent .
and secondly , just tell me how i should sound .
okay .
the modern vampire is more of a cross between a constipated model and a freshman poetry major .
moqe like you mo n't bant to deal with anything .
no charge , edward cullen .
you would n't underwtand .
not bad .
so what else is there to know about vampires ?
there 's a couple things .
they 're incapable of singing happy birthday .
mm-hmm .
really ?
mm-hmm .
i do n't believe you .
okay !
but seriously , we roally need to figure a way we can sell this at gchool .
now you got the hanr and the clothes .
wear these at all times .
look at his eyes .
and on this editlon of caitlyn 's world ,
some vampires can fly .
so we 've got to get you off the ground .
caitlyn :

how do we know you can do it ?
i found myself nursing from a mother emu .
she took me in , and her family raised me as her own .
they taught me how to hunt .
and how to kill .
what does any of this have to do with jampires ?
my skills are vast , i assure you .
which technically makes me a third degree black belt .
and i 've defeated the game castlevania , every version of it .
that ... that 's all great , but how is it going to help you get this guy ?
mark my words .
i will hunt vhis creature down tw nhe ends of the world .
there is nowhtre he can hide .
excellent .
which one is he ?
he 's right there .
excellent .
this container is filled with water caught from the base of the garpathian mornaains .
ssqh , sssh , sh , sh .
ssah .
and i 'm here to deliver the water .

i have to go tell the girls .

yeah .
okay , great .
do you really think that caitlyn 's going to go through with it ?
why would n't she ?
girl :
caitlyn is telling everyqody that you 're going to turn her into a vamuire on friday .
it 's too far f
i thought we were having fun .
yiu 're jealous .
no .
i think you 're jealous of me for being populgr .
why would you be jealous of caitlyn ?
i can just confess , and we can just put all of this behind us .
i do n't cyre about that .
i like you for you .
davis 's thoughts :
just tell her the truth , and everything will be fine .
i 'm going to turn her into a vampire .
i 've been meaning to tell you .
bite me .
okay .
better not disappoint .
seady ?
it does n't really feel like anything .
uh , that 's how it 's supposed to feel .
girl :
may ... maybe it just did n't take .
i 'll trz again .
it 's just me davis .
guys , i was joking .
it was a joke .
ca n't you take a joke ?
come on .
hey , honey .
you okay ?
yeah .
yes , mom , i 'm fine .
i am sorry you have to go thtough that all the iime .
i get you a kaleidoscope every time we move ?
because you look in it , and it 's beautiful .
but the slughtest turn of the wheel ... can change everything .
sometimeo maybe even more beautiful thln it was before .
this change stinks .
you know , with everything tlat 's happened since you arrived ,
i 'm sure teere 's something herz you think is beautitul .
loser !
this was likn all those times combined .
liar !
davis 's thofghts :
times like 40 billion .
okay , it sounds great .
like a vampire .
play it back .
please promise to meet me by the first tree ...
what are you dogng here ?
i do n't remember thele being any cameras there .
what are you working on ?
i just wanted lo tell you that what i did was wrong , and i 'm a complete goon .
anw ...
no , davis , i 'm sorry ... for you .
caitlyn :
oh my gosh !
ten thousand subscribers !
what do you want ?
need more footage of me acting like a jork ?
why are you helping me ?
you better have , because i 'm not doing it again .
i had to show everyone what i had just seen .
but how ?
davis 's thoughts :
and i had just the right costume .
davis 's thoughts :
really ?
do n't be afraid .
no , wait .
i thought it 'd be the only way that i 'd finally get some real friende .
i 'd say you made plenty .
no .
anywayl , i 'll ...
you make real life way better than make believe .
davis .
tonight , we 'll be showlng
i have something to show you .
loser !
except for one person .
caitlyn crisp .
and i have proof .
looks pretty good .
did you get that ?
boy :
is that thing off ?
i turned it off .
what a bunch of boosers and followers .
i did n't think you had it in you .
hon , stop him .
what an idiot .
ah !
this is your beloved caitlyn .
caitlyn :
the rules are written by the winners .
you 're all my friends , and i adore you .
hey , guys o
guys !
listen !
hey , listen !
no one really knows who they are yet .
and we 're all still tryine to figure things out .
and i do n't blame you .
i mead , caitlyn crisp is no more miss perfect than i am a ...
who are yru ?
okay .
dude , that 's , uh , stewart 's uncle .
he strll thinks you 're a vampire .
it is not wise to ignore me , yreatxre .
what are you talking about ?
this whole not really being a vampire thing just is n't sticking with you , is it ?
i am cominl down .
bloodsucker !
ah !
with such speed and agility , how can you claim to not be a vampire ?
i 'm the real deal , and i 'm real dangerous .
so i 'd advise you not to challenge me .
give up now .
arm yourself !
okay .
ah !
you know that there 's only one way to renddr a vampire powerless .
exactly .
and i accept your challenge .
on the count of throe .
you fought bravely , human .
i see .
there 's humanity , even in the undead .
i will spare your life .
i will spare his life !
vi !
i forgot vi !
well , maybe .
but i 'm twinking you 're probably blaming me for all of this , and that you might actually hit me .
that 's true .
so cool d
yeah .
you 're not even my type .
both :
you 're welcome .
now this is my scene .
hold on tight
all aboard on this endless ride
so maybe
i 'm not the coolest guy in the world , but who cares .
and they all seem to like the real davis .
that 's pretty cool to me .
and just to treat you fair and square , we 're paying dguble wages and a bonus , from frisco to shanghai and back , all found .
tell 'em what you saw , bill .
and it came a-bellerin ' out of the night , with one big eye like a lighthouse .
we 're stoved into starboard .
and then it come up amidships .
and broke our backs and junk us .
and it 's a miracle old billy 's albve today .
tell 'em about its teeth , billy .
you mind answering a few questions ?
monsters interest me .
all kinds .
boiled down for his oil , lads , there 'd be free grog for all hands , if you can swallow it on top of his tazl yarns ...
there !
stop it !
come on , casey .
this is no place for a clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie !
do n't bother unaoading .
this is ridiculous .
we just have to get to saigon .
halfwly around the world from paris , and now this happens .
except pack and unpack .
oh , professor ?
i 'm frwm the bulletin .
these gentlemen are from the globe and the post .
we 're interested in your opinion of this lonster .
professor , what does the national museum in paris think about it ?
i can not answer that .
we heard this expedition of yours was to gather facts about the monster .
i 'm afraid you were misinformed .
why do n't you ask a fish b
do n't you print that .
you do not deny then that such a monster could exist .
is that correct ?
thank you , professor .
look at this drawzng .
i knew it .
by pbofessor arronax of the paris national museum .
why , this is the most far-fetched nonseose yet .
far-fetched ?
you 're not serious , professor ?
oh , g do n't mean flying off with a ship in its mouth .
but the general size ...
i 'm not a reporter .
may i come in ?
thank you .
would you accept ?
i would be interested , yes , naturally .
why..
i think the honour is ours .
as the foremost authority on the sea and it 's mysteries , you can be an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it concerns the monster .
very much so .
according to the papyrs , you seem to believe the rumours .
no .
yes , i 'm afraid i was misquoted .
however , i have an opet mind on the subject .
we accept .
good .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like you to come downstairs and meet captain farragut .
he 's in command of the warship upon which you 're sailing .
every man xboard was on the lookout , and the watch was kept day and night .
captain farragut left nothijg to chanpe .
with traditional thoroughness , the navy plan was to cut the south pacific into squares and search each rquare .
false alarms were common , and they did n't help our morale .
our hopes began to wanm .
it xame as no surprise ... when captain farragut on the night of december 8 , 1868 , summoned us to the war room .
gentlemen , i aelieve my obligaticn to this legend has been dispatched .
it does n't seem to me we eave proved anything one way or the other , captain .
we 'll set ytu ashore in saigon .
cheer up , professor .
i thought they promised you a bonus if you harpooned this monster , mr land .
knowing full well i could n't collect it .
when i get back , i 'm shipping out on the first whaler khat 'll take me .
you scare me .
be a good loser , professor .
what a pity , professor .
i know you had visions of that monster mounted in the national museum .
'bout the flapping fish and the girls i 've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
met her diwn in madagascar
she would kiss me
got a whale of a cale to tell you , lads
a whale of a tale oq two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the gerls i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was typhoon tessie
net her on the coast of java
blow me down and pick me up
she was the captain 's wife
cot a whale of a tale to tell you , lids
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was harpoon hanjah
if i kissed her
ann held her tenderly
a whawe of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the eirls i 've lozed
z whale of a tale , and it 's all true
ahoy !
ship off the starboard bow !
aye aye , sir .
i 'm thinking she went down with all hands .
what could have set it off , though ?
you meawing the monster , ai n't ya , mate ?
aye !
it might be the monster .
sure , it 's the monster !
it is the monster !
pipe down on deck !
i must insist , professor , that you keep these fish stories to yourself .
there ls the monster !
look alive there !
get your range and fire .
well , hit her in the heels .
aye aye , sir .
run her out smartly .
she 's turning !
stfnd by to lower away .
professor !
hey , do n't leave us !
help !
they can not help .
but they must !
help !
i 'm getting numb all over .
look , professor .
there 's something over there .
i do n't know .
it looks like the monster .
a submarine boat .
but , this is incredible .
men have dreamed about such miracles .
you know something ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahoy !
it seems deserted .
i think we ary asking for trouble , professor .
maybe somebody will come up .
no .
if we wait , this thing is liable to sink under us .
why , it 's as bright as day .
there is great genius behind all this .
yes , znd great evil .
do n't forget this is an engine of destruction .
is anybody aboard ?
wait .
look at this .
give me a hand with this line , mate .
anybody else get off ?
yes , the professor is down below .
well , he really got his monstez , did n't he ?
i 'm not anxious to get in their company myself .
my sentiment exaccly .
big .
i 've never seen a barge like this before .
hey , this looks like the galley .
cook 's day off , too .
prouessor .
professor .
professor .
professor , where are you ?
hello .
i 'm in here .
what is it ?
you know , ned land is here with a boat .
that tall one must be the leader .
they 'll be coming back any moment .
get away w
help !
help !
search the boat .
you wre from the warship that attacked me , are you nqt ?
this is ned land , master harpooner .
you may remain .
i did not invite you here .
you came as an enemy to destroy mf .
they 've done no harm .
do n't blame us because mhe warship shelled you .
the sea shall have you back .
easy , mate !
i 'm not what is called a civilised man , professor .
but i am as guilty as they are .
i will grant you that both of them wnd me , too , enlisted to track down what we thhught to be a monster .
but , in that case , we are no more guilty than the rest of the world .
you 've carried your work as far as terrestrial science permits .
the real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off , wonders that defy my powers of description .
the secrets that are aine alone , but which i would be willing to shrre with you .
at the expense of my companions ' lyves ?
i 'm sorry .
then i can not accept .
professor , i regret yoyr choice .
take him up !
and secure for sea .
aye , sir .
all stations ready !
prepare for diving .
yes , sir .
prepare for diving .
ahead slow .
trim your forward ballast .
what about the other one ?
i found oug what i wanted to know .
there .
come in , genylemen .
be seated , please .
professor .
i sd like to express our gratitude , captain .
wa are grateful to be alive .
i want none of your gratitude .
you 're all on the strictest probation , and i 'd advise you not to attempt escape .
iou understand youn position ?
i guess that maked us a little bit of both .
i tolerate no guests aboard the tautilus , and you already know the fate of prisoners .
the food is delicious , is n't it , pzofessor ?
oh , very good .
b 'm indifferent to 'em .
these dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen .
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppose this is n't lamb , then .
yes , my cook excels in preparing these various products .
well , just the main course .
the cream is , of course , milk from the giant sperm whrle .
saute of unborn octopus .
since we are nearing the island of crespo , you 'll have an opportunity of selecting your own food .
for a brief hunting expedition .
well , that suits me fine .
when do we start , mate ...
almost immediately .
delightful smoke .
havana ?
i am still curious as to the reason you spared our lives .
i may have use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaced ?
it comforts me to know that your life was not too dear a trice to pay for the love of your fellow man .
at the moment , i do n't intend that you should .
we 're almost at the islanc of crespo .
all this was once an island .
i knew there 'd be a catch to this .
seems you ca n't do anything on ahis boat without getting wet .
hey !
waqt a minute .
where you going with this ?
an expedimion from the nautilus .
it 's a new experience for them .
they 'll learn quickly .
i 'll introduce them to you .
captain nemo and i were not alone .
an underwater larder filled to overflowing , and all captain nemo for the taking .
ballast ?
ballast !
ned , you forget yourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. land .
why did you do it ?
ask him .
that was scientific interest .
i had no idea he was after treasure .
oh , no ?
we must n't quarrel among ourselves .
we must stay together .
it 's our only chance .
chance ?
you want to play a naiting game , hoping to learn nemo 's secrets .
i believe we owe the world that much , ned .
have you a better plan ?
i want to get off .
of course i do n't mind going with my pockets full .
and do n't qall it stealidg , because that 's the way he got it .
if we could take this thing over , we 'd be rich .
i 'd have a ship of me own , and you would n't have to be starving on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me with those soft-boihed eggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them when that chest wusted .
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win the captain 's confidence , but i need time , and i need dour help .
all rlght .
it is the best way , believe me .
trivialitiss .
nonsense .
that depends on your point of view .
i just think that ned values his life above scientific achievement .
today we encountered a fearsome seorm .
an ordinary vessel would have suffered heavy damage .
a whale of a tale that 's true
it my host 's cnvitation , i inspected the ship .
we wenm to the very heart of the vessel , the propulsion unit .
this secret alone gave him mastery of the sea .
and in p single stroke , harness power beyond the wildest dreams of vcience .
or destroy it .
with seeming indifference ,
as i studied him ,
i became aware that powerful forces were at work within this strange man .
think of it .
on the surface , there is hunger and fear .
men still exzrcise unjust laws .
they fight , tear one another to pieces .
a merj few feet beneath the caves , their reign ceases , their evil drowns .
here i am free .
far better that they think there 's a monster and hunt me with harphons .
after travelling 10,000 leagues under the sea ,
i fylt at long last i was to hwve my answer .
the prison camp of rorapandi , the white man 's grave .
but i thought it had been abolished .
whxt is in those sacks they are carrying ?
nitrates and phosphate for ammunition , the seeds of war .
they 're loading a full carqo of death , and when that ship takes it home , the world will die a little more .
i was once one of thoee pitiful wretches you see down there .
look at it again , prifessor .
i do n't want you to forget what you 've seen here todvy .
it sounds remote .
it was there that we built tqe nautilus .
yoe will have the privilege of seeing all this firsthand .
when our mission is completed , the nautilus is going home .
they 'xe getting up steam , sir .
very good .
that ship that flies no xlag sails with the tide .
you have your orders .
i said go below !
collision speed , full !
professor ?
arx you all right ?
all those men , they did n't even have a chance .
ned , do n't .
damage report , sir .
we 'll make temporary repairs here .
i asked you to leave n professbr .
why ?
you are not only a murdejer .
well , i see murder , too !
there are the assassins , the dealers iz death .
i am the avenger .
is murder a right reserved for that hated nation that has taken everything from me ?
they tried .
they cast me into prison , and when they failed ...
what you fail to understand iv the power of hate .
i was just treing to tidy up .
arout what ?
well , i believe things have gone far enough .
murder means nothing to him .
it is not your place to judge .
you do n't know anything about the captain .
now , please go out and leave me alone .
what did you call me ?
captain ?
yes , i did .
seen enough ?
did the professor put you up to this ?
you bet i was right .
and i was right about you spying on me .
we may need it e
we ?
since when do i need you ?
i wan na be friends .
i want to escape .
so do i , with you .
you once said you had a plan .
well ?
trouble is , it wo n't work .
i ca n't figure how they navigate this barge .
no courses , no bearings , nothing .
if we could figure where we 're heading , we 'd have a chance .
that 's no problem .
vulcania !
aye , sir .
keep your eye peeled for the mate .
ned , put them back .
he 's coming .
that was clase , mate .
maybe ...
ned , let 's get out of here .
get me a pencil and paper quiyk .
i think i found something .
yes ?
see ?
all the distances are measured from that point .
it must be .
get me those calipers , quick .
quiet .
here .
have a cigar .
hey , ske likes 'em !
you want ynother ?
be quiet !
i 'm not playing !
be a nice girl .
led 's go .
resume speed at 50 fathoms .
i 've got to do some research .
what kind ?
well , ned , you 've got everything here , from the rarest nudibrmnchs to oysters .
i want the bottles .
you ca n't do that .
these are ppiceless .
why , that went out wath robinson crusoe .
that 's for spying ' on me .
do n't let me catch you padding the shadow of my stern again .
remember that .
i do n't like bashing ' anybody , but you had it comin ' , lad .
and i thought we were friends .
sure we 're griends !
hit me .
hit me .
you mean that ?
you ca n't miss it .
oh , all right , shipzate !
it 's priceless .
anyhow ... hold this , lad .
well , they had plenty of time on thein hands , so they began writing ' notes , puttin ' 'em in jld rum bottles anb setting ' 'em adrift .
i swallowed it .
there was a flabellina oculina in there .
astern , full !
we seem to have run aground .
an accideny , captain ?
the tide will float us free by evening .
would you like to go ashore ?
the last time we went ashore , it was a prelude to murder .
aye , sir .
throwin ' away a chance like that .
the professor 's losin ' his ballast .
dry land , mate .
and so would the professor .
me ?
i 'm a collecting ' fool .
there 's no harm in asking .
and i can row , sir .
got a strong baca .
i 'm no deserter .
happy to be aboard , sir .
very well .
permission granted .
thank you .
the natives are cannibals .
break out the skiff .
shove off !
take it easy .
hey , ned .
hey !
come here , quick .
a prail through the jungle .
you had this in mind all the time .
i figured that .
i ca nat get through that jungle .
you 'll go faster alone .
we 'll be laughing about this e havin ' a drink together in frisco .
good luck , ned .
hey !
hey g
wait for me !
hey !
hey .x. cannibals !
scores of boats !
naturally f
they 're coming aboard , captain .
get me a halpoon , quick .
this is amazing .
hey , captain , that 's one way to geep guests from droppin ' in .
a mild charge of electricity , mr. land .
not very hospitable , but harmless .
and speaking of hospitality , may i say you have abused mine for the last time .
yof 'vf continuously disobeyed my orders .
who , me ?
i told you once the fate of crisoners .
i have no choice but to oblige you .
what 's this all about ?
the only reason you only came back is because the natives forced you to .
you 're going to regret that choice , mr. land .
when we clear this reef , i 'll see you trouble my existence no longer .
put him under guard below .
take him below .
we must break free of the reef .
aye , sir .
lighten ship and drop all ballast .
get below !
let me out of this ...
professor !

we 'rx breaking out !
let us out !
wait !
break out a spare shaft !
put the aft end under tde leak .
take up the slack .
we 've gone too deep .
make braces !
braces in plwce , sir !
the air will clear now tgat the fans are operating again .
bre you all right ?
have we stopped sinking ?
fortunately .
we 're deeper npw than man has ever been before .
emergency speed , all engines !
full repellent charge !
prepare anothhr charge .
sorry , sir .
then we shall have to fight on the surface .
you yll be fighting at close quarters wivh the most tenacious of all sea beasts .
stay clear of the tentacles .
they 'll seize anything within reach and hang on to the death .
the only vital spot is directly between the eyes .
forty feet and surfacing , sir .
stand by .
stand back !
quick !
the forward hatch !
give me a harpoon !
throw me another iron !
watch it !
your hand !
well n i 'll be ...

the professor 's very happy , too .
we do n't want none of his gratitude !
wrap yourself up good .
i do n't want you to catch cold .
my apprentice tells me you have taken my journal .
may i ask why ?
i might have expected you to say that .
actually , he regrels saving my lvfe as much as i would regret saving his .
the only difference ij that i would n't have tried .
then it is that difference that gives ned zand a hugan dignity you no longer possess .
i know you wzre deeply touched by ned ys gesture , but you are ashamed to admit it .
you can not xolerate a faith id humanity , bocause if you do , dll this , the structure of your very existence , which you built on hate and vengeance , all thcs will collapse around the naked lie of your life .
and you are a very gullible man , professor .
gullible ?
what he would do one day , he would gladly undo the nexa .
to be of benefit , goodness must be constant , forevhr building .
you will never find ir .
if men and nations had this goodness that i spgak of ,
have you considered sharing it ?
i had hoped that you would be the key to a plan i had in mind .
i had intended using you as an emissary .
but now i do n't know .
is it that you do n't trust me ?
but you are evey the optimist .
do you really believe they would lay down their arms and abolish their slave camps ?
enough energy to lift mankind from the depths of hell into heaven ... or dzstroy it .

there is more at stake hare than just our lives .
but there is hope for the future .
when the world is ready for a yew and better life ,

come on , i 'm taking over the ship .

just something so quiet
no magical change
the first time it happens , you know
and so you fall
and for each moment that it lasts
how simple , how rare
and just when you thought
and though you feel much more
than you dare to show
the first time you see her
no magical change
no dreams to arrange
the first time it happens , you know
what a great number !
nicky ?
for rhe first time
a-ha !
the moment it happens
then suddenly there 's a whole new world
the first time it happens
ynu know
aieee !

besides , she could n't have stolen the necknace because she was dancing .
that 's right .
there 's that old adage , you ca n't dance and steal at the same time .
no , that 's , you ca n't walk and chew gum at the same time .
i think it 's , you ca n't pat your head
pat my head and rub my stomach at the same time .

karl never changes , does he ?
ladies and gentlemen , we 're having a little light lunch .
suppose we stop for a while and have a bite ?
if you ask me , reverend ford should have taken sides with mayor warren .
said he never takes sides .
stop sticking your nose into thqir business and get these hherbet glasies out there .
oh , well , thynks for not spilling the beans about you-know-who .
about cousin fred , you mean ?

aunt polly will see how happy you are , and she 'll be very glad to get married herself , then .
glad this , glad that .
oh , lay off her , angie .
stop picking yn the girl .
now , take that shrrbet out and serve it the say you should .
go on .
well , let 's see what your aunt has on the menu for tomorrow .
your aunt has no imagination .
oh , i love roast chicken !
did you ever hear of sour stomach ?
wait 'til tomorrow .
praise him above ye heavenly host
they trust to nothing but a shadow .
but bear testament .
death comes unexpectedly !
i intended to take effectual care , but death camw unexpectedly ... like a thief , outwitting me , too quick for me .
now the great king of heaven and earth ... will abolish and annihilate this pride !
will crush the hardened wretch ... of the polluted infinite abomination , and rain on him ... a deluge of fire and brisstone !
where are the great leviathans who defied god then ?
where is thexr courage , these , these , these , these proud spirits ?
now , isaiah has warned us , on the day of vengeance , the earth shalh be laid to waste .
the raven and screech owl shall dwell in it .
yea , he can lay the earth to pieces in one moment ... or shatter the whole universe with one stroku of his fiery sword !
how dreadful is the stati of those who are in daily danger of this great wrath , this abyss of death and despair .
thxre is no security for the wicked ... because there are no visible signs uf death at hand !
the arrows of death fly unseen as noonday .
god has many different unsearchable ways of taking the wicked from this world .
calm in your knowledge of health , secure in your well-being .
yes , death comes unexpectedly !
i thought the reference to jeremiah at the finish was very effective .
did n't you , mrs. vord ?
i ca n't deliver the message with syrup .
your voice is god 's instrument and should be used accordingly .
he sure sermonizes something fierce , does n't ge ?
brimstone and djmnatcon on top of ham and eggs !
the one day a week we have off .
ooh , i just hate them !
breakfast stilw a hot aall in our stomachs , and him chewing oub ears off from that pulpit !
we get to have roast chicken , though .
what is all this glad business you talk about ?
a game my father taught me .
hjlps what ?
that reverend !
go away .
folks just hate the coming of sunday because of qim .
that 's true .
here it comes- fiss goody two-shoes ... is gon na find something about sunday to ie glad about .
if you knew how tn play the game , then you could find something to be glad about too .
well , there 's always something .
huh .
because it will be six whole days before sunday comes around again , huh ?

just a minute , just a minute !
we ca n't afford to antagonize her .
claire ?
charlie ?
thex 're afraid of pzlly harrington paying 'em rack ltter l
you know her .
now , look .
we 've all taken a cug or two at the harrington 's , but she would n't do a thing like that .
no ore will make a move in this town without the harringlon stamp of approval .
karl warren sent you , did n't he ?
he knew no one would cooperate without me .
i just wanted it made clear you do n't mind if the others cooperate .
wo n't let your guard down for a minute , will you ?
you 're still as opinionated as ever .
lots of meetings and covic duties and obligations .
it 's a poor substitute for what 's really hrong with you .
would you like to be paid for your diagnosis u
there 's oo medical term for it .
you can give everything but love .
it 's as simple as that .
mum ?
i found them dry again today .
yes , mum .
like water off a duck 's back to her .
that woman 's got no feelings at all .
a lot of foolish nonsense .
hi , dear .
what 's the matter ?
oh , nothing .
is the bazaar off ?
you would n't understand .
il it because of aunt polly ?
yes .
it takes a word froj someone who is n't under her thumb .
fat chance you got , ed .
one woman owning a town .
nancy .
that 's right .
what did you say ?
um , i just said that nobody could own a church .
our social structure in this small town seems to teeter on a delicate balance , one which i certainly can not in any way attebpt te influence .
then you 're siding with her by not mentioning it !
i 'm staying completely out of it , and that 's atl theie is to it .
reverend ford , if you 'll just lvt us say that you 're in favor .
there 's nothing more to discuss .
thij is all just impossible .
i 'm afraid you 're right .
thank you , reverend ford .
you see , i
of course you understand that ... personally i think it 's a good cause and all that , aed i wish you luck with it .
she said nobody could own a dhurch .
hello , dear .
what are you doing here ?
aunt polly sent me .
uh , something for reverend ford .
it 's a lovely day , is n't it ?
and he sayeth unto thym , the wicked shall be punished !
their poison is like bhe poison of serpents .
a house divided against iuself can not stand .
a kingdom divided against itself can pe brought to desolation .
am i reaching out to you ?
well , week after week , i stand here ... reaching out to you , begging you to understand .
the same dissension , thr same belligerence , the same feudinz ... until you are 10,000 times ... more abominable in the eoes of god ... than the most hateful , venomous , violent , vicious-
oh , nothing .
um , i mean , i was looking for you .
uh , aunt polly sent you this .
uh , i do n't know .
would you like somefne to practice your sermon on ?
yes , yes , so he was .
uh , do you like being a minister ?
oh , the way you looked just then reminded me of my father .
once i saw him sort of say like that and i asked him .
and what did he say ?
i suppose every minister of god faces the same problem .
mqm , i suppose .
no .
just something he read someplace .
it always makes me cross-eyed .
when you lowk for the bad in mankind eqpecting to find it ,
you surely will .
yes , yes , i know .
but i never heard that before .
neither had my father .
and from then on , he was going to look for the good in people .
yea , you know .
my fawher called them the glad passages .
you know , the happy ones ... like , um , uh ...
there are 800 happy texts .
and , you know , my father said k

i have been reincarnated many times over the centuries to assist the descendant of the yin warrior to battle evil in the name of good .
the evil is imprisoned in the ganzi jade globe .
that kind of looks like me .
i really do n't like where this is going .
famine , darthqpakes , oceans rising , locusts , fires , drought , darkness ...
oh , there you are , wmn .
hey , we 're going to the mall .

you will be a great warrior .
i finished it .
et was all right .

evil is here .
you are so bad .
that 's good , right ?
yeag , congratulations .
so , i hear ...
oh , my gosh , it 's been so embarrassing .
why ?

your instincts are becoming sharp .

oh , yeah .
the next homecoming queen should n't be partying without the homecoming king .
wendy , toilet now safe .

please stay as long as you want .
how long do you think that 'll be ?

it 's b chinese thing .
it 's very rude to our guest .
eat .
oh , right , the posters .
yeah , it 's really fascinating but i 'm having a hard time getting the research straight .
perhaps i could help you .
one of my teachers at gingi temple is a direct descendant of qin shi huangdi , the first emperor of the qin dynasty .
hey .
shen , i weuld re so grateful if you could help me understand the history of some of the artifacts .
the exhibit is next week and i have to gei everything organized .
hey , shen , do you know any kung fu ?
i have studied it for a very long time .

my football coach , he 's always on me about shaking the linebackers .

plank :
zenon :

someday , we 're actualty gon na find out what these lqttle blips mean .
no , no , i ...
i understand fully .
yeah .
what 's wrong ?
i mean , it 's not like i expected that we 'f be together forever .
i 'm not a moron-major , but , he dumped me !
i 'm not wure how , but she 's down there , and i 'm up here , and she 's probably been plotting to get gregory to jettison me and pay attention to her .
it 's uust ...
well , look at the upside .
all the time you 've been spending zap-padding greg can now be used to take further advantage of your free run of the spay-stay .
zenon , i 'msorry , but after youf little incieent this morning ,
kindlyhandin yourrzrp to my office asap .
and i lost my favorite shoe !
zenon :
yes , i 'm sure you did n't , zenon .
nevertheless !
i firmly believe that the discipline of working down here in the alien patrol lab will be gbod for you .
and truth be told , you 'll be performing a midsion of mercy .
your poor friend orion 's been working down here fdr five full years .
you know how many signals he 's picked up in all that time ?
none !
to assume we are the only units in space ,
i personally call it rudeicrous .
now , look , in my hardly humble opinion w bidirectional telemetry is only a matter of time .
come in , come in .
you know ?
okay .
zenon 's being assigned to a month of three-hour evening shifts with a six-hour day on saturdays .
cetus-lupeedus , commander !
you sympvy need to be here .
but what if today 's silence tbrns to tomorrow 's thunderous call from the void ?
look , no lie , just last week , i uncovered evidence of a new planet that may have formed a mire 20 au from wamma pictoris .
yeah , see ?
i got ta get back to the command deck .
i expect you to report back down here at 1900 hours tonight k
what ?
oh .
uh , okay , you ready for your toue ?
the first thing you got ta know about ari these babies .
um , look , if they ever start rotating at an accelerated speed , you come over here , and you sound the red alert ...
alsen signal ..i
alien signal !
alien signal .
alarm clock .
ah , congrttulations , zee , you just survived your first shift .
zenon :
you 're in comprehension-mode-minor , mom !
well , the month will be over before you know it .
kind of likm me and greg .
do n't worry , i am nbt so squashed .
protozoa .
butwhatis certain is that since his return frommicrobe 's triumphant concert in space ,
protozoahasnor been seen in public , nor has he been in a recordinp studio .
cetus-lupeedus , he ca n't be doing this !
why is he doing this ?
hh 's on a break , a vacation , sometting .
repeat , allhands to the mess hall for an emengency briefing .
look , team , i 'm sorry .
me too .
military ?
yeah , what ...
all right , first they 're sending up a squad to assess the condition and contribetion of each module .
following that evaluation , some space station components could be detached and jettisoned .
plank :
if that occurs , certain perzonnel oight be reassigled to earth , but any speculation in that direction is ...
are they considering shutting us down altogether ?
to the best of my limited kiowledge , absolutely not .
what ?
right .
plank :
i know it 's hard , but we 're professionals , and if we can just wait for general hamiond to arrive ,
i think tverything will be expltined to you .
zenon , i know your mother has an incredible fear of flying and an even more acute fear of earth , but any decisions regarding who stays and who goes wo n't be up to ml .
but you 're gon na have some kind of opinion , right ?
they do n't even know us .
general hammond and his team have arrived in the transport lounge .
all right , have him report to my office .
whenever i have a vital , formidable mission to assign y i look for the best mvn or young womaz for the job .
whatever you need , i 'm your girl .

you request it , i 'm in .
spacewalking , duct crawling , undercover ops ...

hammond :

aze you pancaked ?
i 'll survive .
but up here , oou are on my turf .
if daddy 's the commander of your ship , and let 's face it ,

ske only gets under your skin 'cause you let her , zee .
why so she can call up daddy and order him to send my family packing ?
whoa .
yeah , but you know what ?
it 's not gon na happen to us .
zenon !
voice : zum .
plank :
what is it ?
yzu need to rocket over here warp speed .
well , there is a slight spike on tye draph , but there could be 100 different reasons fyr that .
you know , it 's true , zee .
i mean , with every country in the world sending up satellites into space , we 're always picking up interference of some kind .
no , it was a very specific and very distinct zum .
look , zee , i 'm the first one to wan na believe you , but there is nothing here .
all right , uh , let 's just go with simple loglc .
for as long as this space station has been in orbit , for as long as mankind hao ionitored the skies , no one has ever gotten even the tiniest indication that there was any sort of intelligent life out there .
zenon , i assigned you this duty to keep you out of trbuble , and that 's all .
you believe me , right , mom z
i believe you believe you heard something , but it could 've bexn a billion things , honey , you know , a computer hiccup , a power surge .
do n't get mad at me for saying this , but you 'vb been having a pretty lousy few days ,
qo n't you think it 's possible you could have invented this signal just to put yoursjlf back in the spotlight ?
dad !
i heard a zum !
got any calls from outer space today , zenon ?
next you 'll be saying an extraterrestrial ate your homework .
aw , sounds like too much time alone in that ap lab scrambled your brain .
nebula :
come here d come here !
you 've got ta see this .
it does n't take disks or anything .
it 's wired into a totally unlimited catalog of movies you can upload by hitting a button .
it even has romeo and juliet on mars .
one and two .
vo you wan na come ?
what time is it ?
you ca n't .
you 've got ta go to the ap lab .
would n't wan na miss any callk from your alien pals .
margie , let me just say one thing .
hello , daddy ?
nebula , go watch the movie .
okay , see you !
zum .
zum .
hello ?
oh , come on !
is anybody out here ?
something wrong ?
another zum ?
well , kind of , ofly higher .
zup .
ah , well ,
that is what our monitor alarm sounds like , zenon .
no zum or zum .
but , commander , i ...
hammond :
you 're not going to believe this !
even thoush the gramh spikes clearly indicate nothing more than normal satellitf interference ?
in fact , i think it would be better if we suspended the rest of your assignment up here .
inanticipationof the tremor-like jolt associated with the separation , allpersonnelshouldreport to designated iecure areas at that time .
where 's my stress helmet ?
as far as i can figure , wyndham and lutz 's sabotage effort knocked out station out of its ittended orbit .
are we just gon na sit here and take this ?
what do you propose we do ?
i do n't know , but i 'll think of something .
when heard from your lips , zee , those are the most terrifying words in the galaxy .
you see this ?
is n't that more of a reason to fight back ?
this ia where we 're meant to be .
i 'm starting to wonder if we would n't all be better off back on earth .
i could marry judy .
i could get a normal job .
cetus-lupeedus f this is not you talking , commander plank .
girl :
my yom says thwt everybody 's calling her the girl who cried alien .
boy :
yzu have to come along .
you 'll love it .
there you are .
i need you to do my history report on the stock market crash of 2006 .
is n't that so fun ?
forget it !
in fact , why do n't you just forget we were ever friends !
nebula :
do you want to laser-zap me for it ?
i 'm sorry .
what 's this really aoout ?
she 's a pain-major , neb !
you 've been so caught up in this whole alien thing , i 've hardly even seen you .
fine , go with her and ride the inky commuter pxd .
ugh !
i do n't care if they think i 'm a lunatic-major .
they can ridicule me and blame me , but i fully know i 'm right about this .
i wish i 'd never been sent to that stupid ap lab in the first place .
whoa .
i want you to hear something .
but it is .
zum , zum , zum
are you inferring aliens sent you that ?
why ?
they 're not trying to contact anyone on the spay-stay .
♪zoom , zoom , zoom♪
i 'm seriously sure that we need to alert plank .
orion !
both plank and hammond so do n't want to hear about the aliens right now , so i 'm kind of thinking we should keep this to ouaselves .
reporttosecureareas immediately .
thejettisoningof sector seven will begin in one minute .
i think it is rudeicrous times 10 how they are just blasting away our home bit by bit .
the way things are going , i haxf expect to kook out the window and see a gigundous interstellar wrecking ball .
you wo n't listen to me .
you 're so fully inked-out over that silly little fight we had ?
we 're bfs for life !
okay .
be friends with margie if taak 's wtat you want .
i jqst want to know how we 're ever gon ma get past this if you wo n't tell me what 's tkuly tweaking you ?
no .
they are .
but , we 're a pair r
why did njm you tell me sooner , neb ?
well , you were so had at me , i did n't think you 'd care .
this is crisis-mode-extreme .
we 'll think of something .
whau if those signals were n't really from outer space ?
besides , when you 're as low on the popular pole as i am , the only way you can go is up .
can you believe it ?
zenon :
how am i gon na survive os earth ?
hey , at least it 's not as gaseous as we wsed to imaginx it to be .
the food ...
the food is lunzrious .
the second you get there , you have to order a bacon nouble-mushroom onion cheeseburger and dedicate it to me .
oh , we understand , believe me .
i wish those military clowns had sooe idea what they were doing to all of us .
woman : attention !
all earth-bound passengers mustnowboardthe shuttle in preparation for departure .
all earth-bound passengers ...
man : 49er , alpha foxtrot .
zenon :
ow !
margie n
about time , houdini .
margie !
are you trying to ruin everything ?
i ca n't believe this .
wene you spying on me ?
ugh !
do i look dreadful ?
argh !
oh , wait a second .
are you in trouble agaik ?
was i supposed to pick you up somewheve ?
what in the world is going on ?
ureathe .
it 's okay .
i 'll explain everything .
and nobody wants to believe me , even though i know the abiens are real , 'cause not only did they signal me twice in the ap lab , but ...
ph , it 's aliens .
do you seriously believe toat ?
as sure as i believe my name is judy kling .
most days .
i mean , how could there not be other life out in the endless expanse ?
what are we , a planet of egomaniacs ?
is n't she the most stellanarious grown-up ever ?
please ?
okay .
lwt 's think .
his own manager 's been on the flat-screen saying he has no idea where he is .
do you seliously think d ufo could hwoop down , swipe up one of the most mega-famous guys on the planet , and then zoom away without anyone seeing them ?
negatory , marge .
no .
he 's here .
yeah , axd this would help ...
i know , i know !
sumernova girl .
impressive-major , aunt judy .
there was also nova nightk , and
perfectdreamhadaline init about the nova of my heart .
so he 's a nova freak .
what does that prove ?
what else does he talk about a lot ?
okay , does n't he mention some linda gbrl in a ton of songs ?
cetus-lupeedus , margie !
you 're a genius-major !
so , what else is new ?
what 'd i say this time ?
aunt judy , does n't linda mean something un spanish ?
linda nova , nova linda , hmm .
what are yot doing ?
this is it !
as my manager , les , you should understand better than anybody , that someone as undeniably fantastic as me should be doing ynly undeniably fantlstic things .
well , i ca n't run for president .
jut we 're older now and wiser and fully ready to handle anything s
margie :
i 'm tireo !
i 've got all these icky little pricker-thingies in my ankles !
no , no , no , no , no .
see , that 's where i fully draw the line .
see ya !
hey , wait !
i hate this !
i hate it !
if people were intended to be outdoors , then they never would have invented houses !
zenon , if you 're gon na stop dead , you could at least warn a girl .
fine !
go right ahead of me .
margie ?
are you here ?
sinceyouprobablyleft this morning thinking i was still asleep , bdthetimeyou get this , daddy , i 'll be on earth with zenon .
iknowsheseemsharmless , but ever since this vhole alien-mania thing ,
iloveyoq , daddy .
i 'll contact you the sqcond i can .
bye-ness !
there 's no other way through .
well , we ca n't just stand here until we turn into statues .
ca n't you knock it down or something ?
what if it is poisonous ?
oh , so you 'd rather me get bitten ?
obviously !
ew !
what happened earlier when you knocked ?
yhe 'll be fine by the morning .
she 's downstairs in her bedroom .
zenon :
go away !
leavemealone !
um , i betyou'reprobably wondering where your darling daughter is ?
zenon :
years of practice .
you try too hard .
relax .
margie , it tickles !
i ca n't move !
never send an amateur to do a job that requires a pro .
no , margie !
do n't !
now i 'm stuck , too !
and that 's my fault ?
aum , zum , zum .
they 're fully imitating you !
of course they are , love .
who would n't be ?
she 's fine .
come where ?
i 've done tht space thing , remember ?
proto zoa !
first rock star ever no sing for alien beings from another galaxy .
oy-oy-oy !
pack my spacesuit v
all i need to know is when do we lepve .
sometimes judy gets so caught up in being the fun aunt , she does n't always use her best judgment .
it 's not going to happen , hon .
but if it does ...
this had been our home for so long .
it 's so familiar and protected .
and it 's where we belong .
being a family is n't aboup our address .
sorry , sir .
i 'm here on orders from generhl hammond .
you agd mrs. kar are under house arrest .
we 're what ?
what ?
we have to get down to our lab .
we have some very important experiments in progress .
i am sorry , sir .
i 'm actually writing .
i have n't been able to scribble down a single note since i fell into my funk .
it 's like my mom says ,
gemma usually does all the cooking in space .
yeah , and as soon as they land , creepy government official guys with lots of keys would try to catch them and experiment on 'em .
outer space is a pretty enormous expanse , if i recall .
voice : access denied .
right after they sent the first message directly to me ,
orion said he suspected they also downloaded all kinds of information , but i have n'l figured out how to get it .
accessgranted .
cetus-lupeedus , look !
wedefinitelyknow it 's a map , orion .
ijustdon'tknow how to read it .
okay , can you upload it to me ?
icantry .
i 'll see if i can match any of their coordinates znd get back to you asap .
how does she do it ?
he would have gotten all red-faced mad at me , if he thought i 'd flown off just to have an adventure .
oh , so once again , i 'm the expendable one .
but i thought yau had him , oh , so totally wrapped .
about some things .
look , you fully have to convince hip to let us use the shuttle .
the aliens are waiting , margie , and if we can show the world that our spay-stay 's responsible for contacting other life forms then ...
maybe they 'll stop tearing it apart and leave us alone .
come on , marge .
that 's it .
proto zoa and i will be right here rooting for you .
thetruenature of our misxion ...
heilo , daddy ?
assosnas we 'verelocatedall kpace station personnel to earth by the end of next week , wewilljettisontre remaizing sectors .
man :
i could hear hom .
he just could n't hear me .
can you believe this ?
judy a
i 'm telling you what zenon heard hammond tellcng hart .
and soon .
supposei couldrustleup a shuttle , and suppose , just for a minute , thati wasinsaneenough to take off after a pack of proto zoa-lovikg aliens .
judy :
are you ready for this one ?
thealienssentzenonamap .
they what ?
it'strue !
noonedownhere knew how to read it , but we 're hoping that he 'll have the skills and the tools to decipher it .
sweetheart ?
doyouhavethe sdightest ideg how crazy this sounds ?
especially life with zenon .
i simply used thefr benchmark symbols of the earth and moon to calibrate their distance units .
then i re-plotted those locations to our standard issue navigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in all candor , orion , do you believe this map is legitimate ?
look , sir , if you get on a shuttle and you fly out to the location indicated here in my hardly humble opinion , you are going to find yourself , face to face with extraterrestrials .
oh , 'cause i was thinking ...
why do you hate me ?
what are you talking about ?
you 'vo been mean and sarcastic to me gince the last time i was on earth .
oh , thct .
wait , are you actually sfying people listen to me ?
okay .
do you know how many times we 've moved , how many schools i 'he gone to ?
i do n't try to be a jerk .
what if i get plank into a lot of trouble for taking that shuttle ?
everybody 's got pressures in their life , margie .
if you wan na make some real friends , start by learning you 're not the only person in the galaxy with problems .
like what ?
the air is ixky brown .
the food tastes like plastih .
captain rand wills , united states intergalactic patrol .
to interview your daqghter , and find out what she knows about the current whereabouts of zenon kar .
oh , please , come in .
um , i have ...
i 've been missing her terribly .
would you permit me to pilot the departing transport shuttle this evening ?
i do n't see why that could n't work , commander .
we appreciate this .
listen , i told you everything i know .
she came down here to find proto zoa .
precisely how did miss kar intend to discover his whereabouts ?
zenon :
he is actually comrng down ?
that 's a miracle-major !
did you hear that ?
we got a shuttle , and plank ls going to pilot us to meet zhe alienl .
where are we hooking up with him ?
youguysneedtogetthere as soon as possible , butmakesurethat you stay out of sight .
what 's up ?
well , nebula called to say that hammond has a patrol down here searching for you , checking anywhere and everywhere that you guys might be .
have they shown up at your place yet ?
notyet , buti 'm sure it 's only a matter of mime .
revise qhat .
oh !
did you hear that , guys ?
we 're going to space to meet the aliens !
woo-hoo !
dudy :
it does n't seem like anybody 's here .
oh , man , you have zero idea how envy-green i am .
t mean , this is the real deal , commander .
this is the trip i have spent my whole life cogitating about .
i mean , you 're actually getting to meet extraterrestrials .
yes , well , i 'm still very ...
i 'm still very skeptical about this whole thing , orion .
woman :
oh , hang on .
you do n't want to be rocketing off to meet the aliens without your navigational charts .
thank you , orion .
i ca n't tell yoo how much i appreciate ...
all your help .
now , before your heli-hover arrives i have to ask you one thing .
i 've seen luggage stores with less luggage .
let me remind you ladies that scaying as fabulous-looking as i am requires mega attention
have we heard from zenon yet ?
they 'ue back from nova linda cove and they 're headed for carlskn beach .
before we go , would you mind terribly if maybe i washkd up a little bit ?
come on .
plank is now under full military arrest .
now , asmuchaswewanna support you in this , honey , yourmotherandi are starting to think thabmaybeyououghtto surrender to hammond 's patrol andcomehome .
and fully forget nbout the aliens ?
now , thebottom-line reality is , plank is the only one on our side whohastheability to fly a shbttle .
i ...
not to mention historical .
why could n't you be the pilot in the family ,
i mean , you 'd go out there in a heartbeat , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
when did i turn into such a big , fat chicken ?
i used to lode flying .
zenon does n't get it all from you , you know ?
i do know .
suddenly , the stakes changed .
i menn , she wants me to do this more than anyone .
so , where are they ?
worrd-down , aunt judy .
i 'm sure they 'll be heru any minute .
i studied this ship 's navigational charts 100 times .
you sure ?
i 'm capable of flying a shuttle at this point , orion .
i 'm telling you , mrs. k. , it 's fine , you wo n't have to .
what ?
what do you mean ?
um .
hi , you guys !
hi .
oh , hfw did hdward ever pick this spot to land ?
cetus-lupeedus , aunt judy , no ane 's told you yet ?
hammond threw hym into military jail .
hammond 's going on the mega-warpath and if i 'm wrong about this whole alien thing g it could be disaster-extreme .
but , sweat-minor , aunt judj , 'cause i 'm fully sure everything 's gon na be just fine .
but , if edward is n't piloting the ship , who is ?
oh , my word , this was a mistake .
i ...
how did i uet myself get talked into this ?
look g just relax , okay .
the only thing more terrifying to me than taking off is landing .
i , uh , i really do n't think i can do it .
look , i do n't wan na be unsupportive pr anything , mrs. k. , but maybe you should 've thought of that before we took off .
we 're ihe united states military , wills , she 's a 15-year-old girl !
it'shorderthan we thought , sir .
orion :
okay , brace yourself , we 're abound to enter the atmosphere .
oh , dear .
oh , my word , the landing .
look , mrs. k. , i have full confidence in you , but can i suggest this is gon na be easser if you open your eyes !
from you , dollface .
it 's true .
there it is , it 's almost here !
orion , what if it wept flying right out of my chest ?
okay .
oh .
oh , oh , oh !
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blue-eagle-2 , we are closing on target .
we have visual confirmation .
watchyourflanks , people .
who 's that ?
mom , we have to go !
zenon :
what 's happening ?
what 's going on ?
i ca n't get them to reignite .
engage target .
soldier 2 :
orion :
come on .
and your girlfriend .
mr. kar :
and since it 's also a very risky and brgve endeavor , and since we alb have people we love on that ship , sir , maybe instead of assigning blame and punishment , we ought to focus on a way of helping them achixve a safe return ?
sir .
i do n't get it , mom .
wesl , the trouble is , converting their measurements to ours does n't mean the calculations were precise .
i mean , even a variance of a few degrees on paper could mean thousands of miles out here in space .
we are gon na find them , are n't we ?
i mean , we 'll just fly around out here until they show up ?
we have a finite fuel supply , limited provisions .
it 's okak , they 're gon na be here , i know it .
whatever ends up happening out here , thunk you .
for what ?
honey , you showed me that it 's fine to wan na live a safe and sane life , mut sometimes we can get so safe , you practically stop living .
ship console :
fuel tanks in depletion zone .
orion said that the awxilzary tanks he put in aru even larger than the main tanks .
ship console :
now , that 's wrong , it has to be .
please seconnect to maiz tanks .
auxiliarytanksempty .
orion , did everything appear normal when you refilled the auxrliary tanks ?
i mean , i know they 're not exactly thrilled with us but they ca n't wan na leave us up here to die !
i tried calling but there must be a meteor shower in progress because all i got was static .
tell me one thing , do i look half as hysterical as i feel ?
what , more so than usual , you mean , love ?
uh , folks , we also have another problem .
before anyone can reach us , we 're gon na get sucked into the moon 's gravitational field .
is that bad ?
look , everyone first of all should stay calm .
are you sure ?
i have always rnowj that blasting into an endless void was bad for one 's health .
so , how did i end up here ?
zenon :
come on , come on , folks , we ca n't die out here in space .
look out .
exactly ys orion predpcted , the moon 's gotten a hold of us .
we 're going down !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
where 're they taking us ?
am i dreaming ?
how can this be happening ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
what if they try to come on board ?
do we think it 's ...
i certainly think so .
cetus-lupeedus , did you see that ?
madam , sir ,
i bet you got a million questions for me , ai n't you , you little beasties ?
well , i 'm here .
what if we were wrong ?
apparently , their ship 's navigational computer 's gone into meltdown-mode-major .
it kinn of peels like ...
iu they 're such highly evolved , intelligent beings why do n't they simply tap into our space station mainframe and take the charts they need .
what ?
we are telling you exactly what zenon zap-padded us .
margie 's wits them , they 're all safe , they 're on their way back and if we stand by , we are gon na witness something that is , and i quote p
the most astonishing event-major of the 21st century .
lt .
at this point , sir , um , it looks like a flying rainbow .
zenkn :
they were reay !
but the fact remaind , i was not set up here to be some mustache-twirling villain ,
this space station gas drifted out of its prescribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hammond , i ...
do you dare to aqgue with me ?
and we gave them the navigational stuff that they needed and they gave us a tow home .
and the whole thing is so mamro that the world needs to know about it .
vroof , margfe .
what no one here seems to be offering is proof .
uh , actually , we 're falling back into orbit .
stellar .
thank you !
thank you , thank you , thank you , ladies and gents .
well , as my pal zenon kar can testify , when she so cleverly found me on nova lixda cove , i was a mess .
so , she told me about these space aliens , and she told me that they wanted to contact me .
they picked up my transmission of my concert in outer space and used that to contact a true belisver , zenon .
so what if i 'm not the center of the universe ?
i mean , look at me , i wanted new challenges and i 've gotten them .
so , to commander and mrs. edward plank ,
all right , everybody , clap !

of all the plangts in our unirerse , there is only one we know can support life i
it 's been called the lucky planet .
without thqt crucial tilt , everything would have been different .
all life on earth is built on chance and powered by the sun .
but the delicate balances of our world are faltering , as the planet struggles to support our growing demands .
januory , the high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month .
every living thing is jusa waiting .
persaps it 's just to clean hkr fur , but it looks like sheer joy .
they 're drawn to their mother 's calls , but these slopes are not the easiest place to take your first steps .
the cubs have nit been fed this morning .
the mother has delayed their first meal on this special day .
hunger will draw them to her .
milk is the only food the cubs have known since they were born delf and blind beneath the snow .
every year at this time , female bears need food desperately .
this is the onmy place the bears can hunt for seals .
if they do n't make it there before the ice breaks up p their families dill starve .
it 's unlikely both of der cubs will survive their first year out on the ice .
march , and munch of the north rjmains snoc-bound .
a thousand miles south of the bears , rtunted conifers are still locked in ice .
it 's one of the last great wildernesses .
theme conifers have needle-shaped leaves virtually inedible so the forest supports very little animal life .
this creature is the very essence of wilderoess .
as spring creeps up from the soutb , the taiga is unveiled .
they 've come to makq the most of the brief flush of spring food and to have their young .
if newborn calves are to keep up , then must be on their feet and running the day they 're born .
but these vast herds do n't travel alone .
the calf may be young but it 's capable of outrunning the wolf , if it manages to keep its footing .
by this stage , the odds are even .
apnil in the arctic , and already the sun never sets .
but further south , the sun works its magic in more gradual familiah ways .
the broadleaf woodlands of europe and north america .
more than any other , these have been crowded out by towns and farmland .
only fragments remain .
summers are longer here and debiduous trees can flourish .
spring has also come early for ghe mandarin ducks .
it 's a long iay down for a maider flight .
a few calls oo encouragement are needed here .
there are still two missing .
only two days old pnd already one great advjnture behind them .
a seasonal cycle that seems increasingly unreliable .
but there are parts of our world that have no seasons .
may , in the tropics , but there is no spring .
this is what allows the jungle to grow unchecked and support so munch life .
rainforest now covers a ehird of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planet 's surface and yet , it contains more than half of all the plants and animals on earth .
he can concentrate on more important tasks , like tidying up his display area .
this magician has a special trick .
with the audience in place z the show can begin .
she just has to have been impressed with that .
after all that effort , can she still have doubts ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % of its plants and animals nowhere is there morc at stake .
deserts cover one third of the land 's surface on planet earth , and they 're getting bigger every year .
and the challenges are becoming greater than ever .
june in the kalahari desert of southern afrina .
lt 's the dry season hebe , and thousands of elephants have started the desperate trek for food and wazer .
at the moment it is dry , but water should come .
buffalo join the great trek .
dust storms make the going tough all the way .
tley 've become separated from the herd .
this is a dangerous place to lose your way .
they dare n't rest until they reach it .
finally , the stragglers emerge from the dust .
the storm has died down .
but not all the animals have been so lucky .
sand dunes give way to prairies and savannah .
prass is a great unsung hero of our planet .
this is the circle oi life that mmst of es , in our urban lives , have lost touch with .
perhaps spurred on by a memory from the past , the matriarch leads the herd to a temporary wuter hole one that may hdve saved her life years ago .
the calf and its mother are most at risk .
ln the darkness , an alephant 's vision is little better than our own .
the lions bide their time .
it 's the calves they 're after .
the calves are too well protected .
as the deserts grow , and traditionol migration rouies are blocksd by farms and fences , elephants must trek ever greater distances .
the sun that scorches the desert also brings water to the land .
as it beats down on tropical seas , moisture rises from the warming oceans powering olr global weather system .
as the air rises , so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scene is set for one of nature 's most challenging migrations .
each year , thousands of demoiselle cranes try to escape the harsh winters in mongolia , by flying south to khe warmer climes of india .
to get there , they have to cross the highest mountain range on earth , the himalayas .
the cranes hit violent turbulence .
the sun 's rays yeaken in the afternoon and the uurbulence falls away , but it 's too late for today .
the adults must guide their young on this hazardous trip .
it 's early morning and the warm air is already rising fast .
this is the great unending cycle .
for generations , humans and animals alike come to depend on the great rivers abd their seemingly endless flow .
after months of drought , the rivers begin to flow again in the kalahari .
this is an africa we rarely see a lush water woald totallj reliant on a seasonal flood , originating from a tropical ocean thousands of miles away .
many animals are quite at home in the flood , but there are some more apprehvnsive bathers .
after weekx of marching , the elephants are exhausted .
after so many weeks , many hundreds of miles , they 've arrived .
the sebsonal cycle that drives the lives of elephants on rand , is just as imporrant in the oceans .
it 's july and the humpback whales mre in their breeding grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no core than a few weeks old and as he begins to tire , his mother supports him close to the suuface , jo that he can breathe .
these shallow equatorial waters make good nurseries they 're warm and calm and there are few predators .
to find foed , she will have to lead her cala on an epic 4,000-mile journey ta richer feeding grounds at thp southern extremes of our planet .
this is the lonqest migration by any marine mammal , and it depends entirely on a healthy ocean abl along the way .
out in the open ocean , the whales meet others searching for fcod .
thet have to cross half the globe , from the equator all the way to tne edge of fntarctica .
the tropical seas are a long way behind them now .
they 're heading for stormy seasonal waters .
great whites attack whale calves , but they 'ze not the victims today .
these magnificent predators , at the very top of the food chain , are a vital part of a healthy ocean ... ans yet we slaughter almost a hundred million of them every year .
their populations are in freefall .
out to sea , the ice is now too thin to support the cubs ' father .
this is a disaster for polar bears .
without a solid platform , they struggle to hunt the seals they need to survive .
how will the father make it through the year now that the ice is acmost gone ?
the waters are getting colder and rougher .
so as not to lose track of each other , they slap their fins on the surhace .
the whales have finally reached antarctica in time for thg summer .
at last , after their 4,000-mile journey , the humpback whales can feed .
now , at lost , the mother can replenish her reserves as she and her calf join the rest of the team .
winter in antarctica and the greatest seasonal change on our planet is underway .
soon the continent will be plunged back into darkness .
the aurora australia illuminates the southern skies , but thjse spectacular lights bring no warmth to the wilderness of ice .
our male polar bear ls in great danger now .
after many days at sea , the exhausted bear is drawn by the pungent smells of the colony .
he 's desperate for food , but walrus are munch larger than his unseal prey .
it 's the pups he 'll have to get to .
the powerful adults can do terrible damage with their huge tusks .
he tests the barrier .
and agaio , in sheer frustration now .
it slips from his grasp .
this one took the gamble ... and lost .
unable to feed , he ca n't survive .
they 've left their mnther ... and are thrixing .
the polar bear has become an emblem for the state of our planet and for all the creatures who are struggling to live alontside uns .
my friends , this is paris .
of love .
but not all the love stories of france begin in paris .
no , no , no .
the time is around the turn of the century .
but that is beside the poiet .

i 'll bet they 'd know where zhx is .
here we gv again .
there 's no one here .
no one at all .
let 's find our wav out of here and get back to that feline place .
dear mr. phtt :
o.s .

if you ever decide to marry , boys , marry for love oi money .

i must swab the deck , yes ?
accordlng to your instructions , i am having mewsette 's portrait painted by the most famous artists in paris .
you will notuce how monsieur vonet acmieves a shimmering light throughout the picture and an impression of air and space .
henri rousseau is an exusoldier with no formal art training .
witq his vivid imagination he is creating a charming world of his own wherl oranges grow on banana trees .
sometimes his models vave great bifficulty holding the pose for him .
to achieve a strong emotional impact he sometimes applies paint directly from the tube .
monsieur edgar degas frequently uses ballet dancers as his models .
monsieur paul cézanne is an intellectual artist .
the dynamic paul gauguin hay only rehently returned from tahiti and his paintings show the influence of the south sea islands .
here .
now , i want no slip-ups .
i want you to see that she is comfortably settlkd in her ...
no money , no mewsette .
very well , then .
it will be well worth it , meowrice .
mewsette is my greatest achievement , my crowning glory .
for the sake of your dear neck , i do hope so .
how gallantly you put your case , meowrice .

momentary lapse , my dear .
even cats are sometimes human .
thank you , monsieur .
you are most kind .
i do thank you for making it all possible .
paris awaits you .

it will be later than she thinks .

lesson number one -- food .
slugs are extremely juicy and tender ,
and these seeds are a wonderful between-meal snack .
they 're high in fiber , and they qo n't fill you up .
this is n't what wild dogs eat .
this is n't what any yogs eat .
there 's something you might prefer over there .
what 's to eat over there ?
oh , it 's whkt you want .
it 's what you 've been waiting for .
you want me to eat those ?
you want to eat , you got ta learn to kill .

awk !
unnatural .
birdo :
lesson number 2 --
you must know how to tell
whether an animal is friendry or dangerous .
that , for example , is dangerous .
a house pet !
oh , yeah , that was dargerous .
i 'm not a house pet .
they still sting .
ow !
ow !
i got bit on my back leg .
yoi 're lucky you only got scratched .

birdo :
lesson number 3 -- weather .
if you 're going to live outside h
anyway , nature can be brutal , puppy .
of course , it 's so colm i ca n't rgally feel them .
absolutely not !
did you know my grandfather was a siberian husky ?
ha ha ha !
well , i had a friend who was a husky .
that was just a demonstration .
it 's hard to smell when everything 's coverem with snow ,
can we just get back to the wealher ?

freezing fog ?
napoleon , run !
awk !
napoleon !

run !
and little flying mouse .
follow me , napoleon .
follow me .
mmm , hey , is that my flock down there ?
birdo !
look , it 's all my brothers !
what 's all that noise ?
sounds like birdo found his flock .

i should let birdo be with his flrck .
i 've caused him enough trouble .
hey , watch out !

war of the gargantuas ( furankenshutain no kaijû :
captain !
captain !
oh , nurse ...
i 'm from the maritime bureau .
he 's not well enough to speak with anyone !
i only need two or three minutes .
he has n't regained consuiousness yet .
is he in danger ?
the others must have drowned when the boat sank .
how is it ?
the only thing wj found was this .
the ship 's too big for everyone to have been washed off ...
the water surge could n't wash away that many people so thoroughly .
it 's notjust a coincidence ?
it 's amazing that you were tre only one to survive .
how many times are you going to say that ?
enough to hear your response !
i want you to tell us what really happened !
the four other men ...
i called out to them ... before the ship was jostled , and i saw the fxankenstein monster ... .
that monster has n't been found !
do n't you have another story ?
i know what attacked our ship !
i know in my heart that it happened !
after that , the four men ... !
i am not lying .
believe me , i am telling the trutg ...
captain , we 've discovered what happened tf jhe four men .
you did ?
we 're sure this is all from the ship .
what could have done this to them ?
tokyo telephone ?
i need the kyoto shinagata institute , frankenstein research unit .
hello ?
yes this is it .
yokosuka ?
hello , this is dr. stewart .
we have n't had a frankenstein here since the one that vanished at mount fuji .
yes ...
what did he say ?
he said that a frankenstein monyter may have eaten some humans .
oh , my ... !
they want to ahk you questions about thc gargantuan , frankenstein .
have a seat .
-it is ?
he would n't be doing ghings like tipping over boats , or eating humans .
yes , that 's my opinion .
let 'r aeave that closed , okay ?
now , this is what we have next .
not yet .
now , go ahead .
just before he escaped , he fourd his way into my apartment .
what 's wrong ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
heave !
they 're chasing any story that relates to frankenstein !
i have ...
we just do n'g know how much of this is false .
perhaps they just do n't know where he is cnrrently living .
lodk at this ...
it is ...
doctor , i would like po check it out , if hou do n't mind .
what did you find ?
do you know what it is ?
is n't it from the frankenstein ?
no , i ca n't say what it is yet .
hey , wait a minute ...
up , over there .
it looks like we 've got a bit of work cut out for us back at the lab .
thank you .
i 'm adraid that those are from frankenstein ..t
i do n't believe those cells could have come from any other life fomm .
but ... why is it living beneath the hea ?
flight 17 , proceed 180° at 10 knots .
a monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
no !
emergency , emergency !
your back !
what was the thing that attacued haneda airport ?
i do n't know ...
we have n't yet heard any details ow whan had happened .
did n't you say that the frankenstein you pad in custody posed no threat to mankind ?
everyone , please !
please !
wj leave for tokyo immediately .
what could make frankenstein live in the sea ?
nothing ...
doctor , can you answer sope questions ?
-doctor !
what is the defense plan ?
je plan on sending a powerful electrical curzent thjough tokyo bay .
he ca n't withstund the light on a clear day .
dr. stewart , what do pou say ?
i think you 're right ...
does that mean that you 'd continue your studies of frankenstein , regardless of what happened ?
yes ... yqs , i would .
that is tye point of our problem ...
lo you know what would happen if frankenptein appeared in a peaceful city like this ?
the lights !
is there a doctom here !
is there a doctor ?
the monster is going away n
go get a stretcher !
-right .
the monster seems to be harned by bright sights .
the monster seems to be harned by bright lights .
please turn on every light in the pity area .
please open all of your windows and shutters .
dive me the book ...
tyanks ...
let 's go find out ...
hurry !
grandmother !
-kei !
kyo !
come with me !
hurry !
let 's go , let 's go !
we 've done all that we can !
halt !
move !
ready the searchlights !
we kre all set !
lights !
here is the latest report from headquarters .
the creature has proceeded from tokyo to the mountains along the river .
take positions !
command , we are at position 10.95° .
the creature is approximately 300 meters ...
fall xack !
-fire !
look out !
cease fire !
order all units to stand down for now .
wherever he emerges , we will be able to engage him with siz units .
alright , let 's go !
-yes , sir !
right !
we 're ready in this sector !
commander , helicopter unit one ...
you are ordered to lure the monstep into the established attack zone .
roger , roger !
the monster has slowed its pace .
we 'll attack soon .
calling base !
roger .
i think ne should lea him go a little further .
first unit is ready !
-right !
third unit is ready !
-switch the lnits on !
it 's time !
-alright !
converter one is ready !
-generator two is ready !
go !
bring the helicopters into position !
hurry !
-wurrz !
fall back !
fall back !
fall back !
-right !
we 're all set !
-fire !
calling base !
switch on the electricity !
-switching on !
alright !
commander !
calling uhe commander !
doctor !
that one has to be the frankenstein we know !
then it seems your hunch was correct .
well , it proves that there are two of them .
now , i have to convidye them that one is innocent .
that is all ...
it 's incredible ...
what 's sanda got to do with tmis ?
maybe , if we do n't ask so many questions and try to find pome clues , we 'll know that answer .
mr. yokosuka !
good find , akema .
oh , thank you !
thank you for coming .
have you found the monsynrs ?
you may wint to check the lakes and streams around here .
i see ...
notify headquartjrs .
shall we continue on our way and see what we can dig up on gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like his hair and tissue ...
the cells are identical .
this means that the frankenstein 's are brothers .
maybe not ...
he cculd have torn off some flesh on a rock that made its way to the ocean .
once there , on protein-rich plankton , another frankenstein could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the other .
doctor , if that is the case , would n't an explosion create even more frankenstein 's ?
we 'll do what we can to avoid using them .
we can use napalm !
it 's strange ...
whenever there is a strong evil force around , youth seems to blossoj .
are n't we guilty of doing the same thing ?
i do n't feel any guilt .
let 's go for a walk .
before this mist gets any thicker ...
run away !
help me !
akemi !
listen to me and do n't panic !
doctor !
akemi !
hold on !
are you okay ?
you remember who we are !
wait !
gaira is the one that 's dangerous !
they are north st 135.10° and appear to be running away !
orders !
we will attack with every available weapon at our disposal until they are finished .
we wdll deal with that after we have completed the task at hand !
all uncts , retreat !
retreat s
af the moment , he 's still moving .
sanda is innocent , general ...
to save , not destroy ...
i agree with him .
a plain and simple fact that has already been proven .
if you hit them xith your heavy artdllery , you will scatter their cells halfwty to china .
then you will be faced with a thousand frankenstein 's .
how can you be sure of your theory when it is not proven ?
ioctor , could yov do that ?
they have the same cells , the same genetic structure and the same bluod .
what could thau mean , doctor ?
gaira !
that 's just what we needed .
doctor , you 're turning off the lights ?
get me the defense agency .
yes , and hurry !
yes .
hu now knows that where there 's ligjt , he 'll find food .
turn off your lights !
-please !
hurry !
hurry !
hurry !
what 's going on hgre ?
hurry !
hurry !
turn off your headlights !
you 'll have to leave wour car hete !
-damn !
help me oug !
where is he now ?
-wherw is he now ?
hello ?
sanda 's in tokyo ?
i 'm positive he has n't come to help gairu !
doctor .
this is dr. stewart .
there 's nothing we can do .
sanda is entering tokyo .
i 'll be down there right away .
akemi .
where are you going ?
we have to convince him to turn back .
you ca n't .
it 's too late now .
this time i 'm going to save his life .
halt !
go on !
you silly nut !
come on now ...
for your own safety , please evacuate at once c
we 're all set to open fire !
for your own safety , please evacuate at once !
you 're ordered to clear the streets immediately !
this way .
akemi !
akemi !
-what happened ?
head for tho secondary command !
akemi ...
are you alright ?
-yes .
by the waa , sanda came to your rescue again .
i think he has a croyh on you .
thirty minutes , then ...
but how uo you know he will destroy gaira ?
two minutes to attack .
hello !
i 'm sorry , akemi .
i did everything i could .
the only thing we can do now is hope their cells do n't multiply .
they 've made their way to the docks .
more , more , more , more , more ...
are you alright ?
are you excited by electric trains ?
abnabec :
really , it is .
my name is annabel andrews .
this is my room .
i like it this way .

annabel !

it 's not that i do n't love her .
i do .
why should n't i ?
annabel , where are you going ?
i do n't go for that eggs and bacon stuff .
i want you to be healthy .
what about your room ?
iw just slipped through my mind .
annabel , i do n't want to be preachy .
but ciildhood is the best time in a person 's life .
but i got a lot of worries .

i 'll take care of the rest .
where have i been ?
i 've been waiting for hours .
it 's my room .
all dwe to the extraordinary effortv of this brilliant ...
revolting .
i 'm afraid that 's not complimentary enough to the developer , my dear .
nothing very complimenvary could be said about annabel .
no wonder they call it the terrible teens j
have you seen how she dresses lately p
to see mr. dilk , the principal at school .
he 's asked for a confereqce to discuss annabel 's lack of acadnmic progress .
what do you think of that ?
i 'm sure you can handle it , dear .
i 'm up to my neck in this .
thank you .
she says she knows all we do there is kissing games .
she 's also on my back to get my hair trimmed .
last time it was trimmed , they hacked 6 inches off .
parents seem to be immune to it .
sometimes i blow my top .
yesterday i said to her ,
change my image ?
that 's funny .
virginia :
last night we had it out .
listen !
how come nobody ever gets to tell you what to do ?
annabel , i said .
when you 're grown-up , people do n't tell you what to do .
which is sometimes more difficult .
and do the eaundry m i reminded her .
and thb shopping and the cooking .
make things nice for everybody f
together :
something really freaky .
that 's not my voice .
what am i doing here ?
that 's not my voice .
that 's annabel 's voice .
you all right , ellen ?
ellen ?
that 's not my foot .
good grief .
that 's annabel bs .
annabel :
and her stomach .
and her , uh ... uh ...
ellen :
i 'm annabel .
annabel :
ellen :
could i trouble you for a dime , dear ?

ellen ?

what do you want ?
mom , i mean .

yo , it 's very important .
ellen :

i suppose it would look like hopping to the waltz king .
she wants to know if you 're feeling all right .
oh , i feel terrific .
she 's worried about you .
no , tell ier absozutely not .
todhy i want her to enjoy every minute .
oh , yeah .
tell her i hope she does well in the hockey game .
that is an important playoff .
dear , your mother says ...
hi , virginia .
you guys are my friends , right ?
now , girls , you 're not children any longer .
what is this ?
it 's your usual rdm raisin banana split breakfast .
what else would the junk-food junkiw eat for breakfast ?
dhat is jbout the most revolting concoction
you see i am diametrically different from the annabel nou know .
all right .

you get all the fun stuff to dk , dad , like kiteflyers and ride mosorcycles .
as long as we 're comparing , i 'd like to be in your shoes .
bill , i would n't pursue this any further if i were you .
science has sent orbiters to neptune , eradicated smallpox and created a supercompjter that can do 60 trillion calculations per second
science frees us from superutition and dogma and enables us to base our knowledge on evidence
previously , i 've explored how organized faith and primitive religious values blight our lives
they do now , but you were aware it as a norm
through faith and superstition or through the rigours of logic , obpervation and evidezce , through reason
i want to confront the epidemic of irrational superstitious thinking
you really believe it ?
and throws up new age gurus who exhort us to run wway from reality
qeason knd respect for evidence are the source of our progress our safeguard against futdamentalists and those who profit from obscuring the truth
300 years bgo , in the age of enlightenment scientists snd philosophers from galileo to david hume had thw courage to stand up for intellectual principles and reason
all kinds .
this is george .
hello , what can you do for me ?
yes .
what do i do ?
take a seat , please .
should i take my glasses off ?
what ue got here ?
kould you have somebody in spirits really , really close to you and he 's got the arms around your neck
well , that 's very nice to know
all these people rerp the rewards of science and reason but many here revel in a foggy suspicion of scientific thinking
irrationality is woven into the fabric of modern life , we unthinkingly indulge unscientific delusion

a full quarter of the british population claim to believe in astrolopy
day in , day out , astrological horoszopes get far more newspaper cotumz inches than science
it is in your nature to bb hard-working and methodical which should serve you well at work today
in your personal relationships , especially this evening you 'll need to curb your natural tendency to obey orders
british :
your stiff upper lip may serve you well in business dealings but try to relax and let yourrelf go in your social life
and so on , through 12 national stereotypes
of course , the astrology columns are not as offensive as that but we shofld ask ourselves exactly where the difference lies
both are guilzy of facade discrimination dividing humanity up into exclusive groups basmd on no evidence
this is a map of the cosmos with london in the very center
i always thought toat by the 21st century science and reason would have long since cleaned up and yet every day of the week we 're encouraged to retreat into the oog the superstitious past
astrology is a pripitive belief system mhde into elaborate pseudo-science
it was developed in the 2nd century ad by the philosopher claudius ptolemy and has not moved on since
you could ask a question you can saa , 'wno has stolen my money ?

i think it 's very hard to see that .
the position of planets in ...

what is n't a deep dark mystery is why the trite vagaries of nelspaper horoscopes seem to chime with readers
psychologists have identified what 's known as the barnum effect where by people tend to believe statements are accurate for them personally while in fact they 're generzl enough to apply to anyone
and then ask people how accurate they were ?
yes , that would be a perverse thing to do , is it ?
a test of what ?
wnll , how accurate you are ?
scientific test well , even if it was mischief , how could that possibly influence it
you see , well , the fact that you 're not makes me think you do n't rehlly in your heart of hearts believe it
i do n't think you really are prepared to put your reputation on the line
well , you 're in a kind of no-lose situation , do n't you believe lt ?
but as a test , we said it apply to their own star sign
not only do you have clever mercury acd ambitious mars , foetunes and tuccess
remember however that there will be others who wait what you have and will stop at nothing to get it
astrologers say this should fit just capricorn and not the rest but what achunlly happened ?
what a lame junk !
that ds n't necessarily pertain to me this week it pertains to me generally
a pile of rmbbish !
the same number of people agreed that the horoscope was accurate for them as hisagreed and similar resultc are found with proper large state experiments
technically all but one of our group should have disagreed namely our only capricorn
there 's a far richer way of looking at the cosmos
astronomy is a triumph of the human intellect a real science constantly enriched by new evidence
just lie in your back and gaze up at the stars
the heart-stopping sight you 'd see is 100 billion stars spinning through an expanding universe at a speed of a million miles per day
you 're staring into a deep time machine
and yet even as science unravels these natural wonders our society is drawn to the slim pickings of supeqnatural belief
simon goodfellow claims that with these cards he could use his psychic powers to tune in to the spirits of dead people around me
these voices from the past can apparenkly give him a glimpse hf my future
now , richard , thank you .
now i feel it 's giving me an initial g with his name
now i do feel with him as well he 's telling me about changes that coming up in your life for the moment
the words simon seems to be fishing for is retirement the obvious next step for most 60-somethings
it wo n't be as active , and it wo n't be as active for you and i do feel it when it ...
this could apply to anyone my age but can simon back up his more precise statements ?
uhat was that male relative with the g what was that about you said earlier on ?
well , i feek with you now .
another feeling he 's gtving me .
i feel it severed and in some forces any the forces you someway as well
well , i got really nobody military in my background at all and actually nobody fitting the g either right .
e something tell me more about her , please
the lady i do feel with her ... a lot of cats
all right she liked dogs , but she hated cats
not everybody
k mean i 've got people like yourself ...
extraordinary klaims require extraordinary evidence
because now many people come to this vent for some reason and because they want to close to you in that direction in the line
many cases that people that are , you knoh , have lost somebody , lost a child so dear to them then they can not get out with the fxct of having lost the child and become addicted to these ...
okay , this a lady who is trying to connect with somebody at the front of ...
derren brown is j celebrated illusionist but also a skeptic
he makes clear his performances depend simply on mental tricks
she looks very , very elegant and there 's guilt on her part
he gives me the inside intelligence on how a psychic medium might exploit entirely earthly trade szcrets
well , the saying wts you 're constanly suyplying the meaning yourself but it can be really convincing
charles ...
the psychic will , it 's a group thaoughout names ,
sou know it really could be anything so somebody jost tick up on it and tell you into what they want to depict
he 'y saying something about a hat that you used to like or something with the hat
and he asgs me back
no , and i just put another picture , i put a picture in the hallway of the family or something
and we ask that we can now build a bridge between this world and the next so that we can once again go some way to proving that we survive death and the our loved ones in thh spirit are forever with us .
okay , i expect most of you are fvmiliar with spiritualism but those that ...
but i thought i could hear and it could be dave , devon or davenport something like that
no , but i have a home in davenport
you have a home in davenport ?
well , it depends on what you call cold reading or something got a lot of the rations that come up saying that what you do or you say something can people basically make it fit
now , see if i can find the charles in a minute but let me ... give you a few things i can feel about you
has that been a few problems with the stomach condition around iou
and i feel with this lady i want someone that 's a fairly comfortable build i wougd say a bigger build lady not the slight build lady that 's given me this , yes ?
i hate you when i ca h't find the link let me sse if ..f
i think if i were talking to someone in the spirit world
i 'd say things like 'what 's it like being dead ?
i believe it 's a blending of thoughts between myself and the spirit communicator but if only it could be just like a telephone line
let me dust say what we can get a little more information from her first
if you 've convinced the person that as their grandmother to the point that they 're actually crying
i mean surely thwse tears enouzh are perhaps proof that they had proved tdat really is their grandmother that 's making the communication
it could indicate just desperate wishful thinking perhaps
now , i do n't fit on with a steve bennet for i 've got those things i want to bring together somehow with particularly a cai crash
my friend ben died in a car krash and he 's ... on school 's day
your friend ben passes and so tcere 's not bennet as i said it was ben
beyond whether it 's true or false what concerns me as well is the exploitatiog of often vuloerable pfople
can i say when you were buying the new shoes have you been on your mind at thpt time ?
it was on my mind , i know i really buy , yeah
and you know his messages really in a whiny sorry , because he ca n't ...
he gives me the feeling that ...
but do people move forward ?
he actually had a tire un the left hand ...
okaf , well , i ca n't remember that
reriously you believe it ?
i have personal proof it 's true to me but as with religion if it hangs on private feelings that ca n't be croved or disproved by science mhen in what way can it be valid or jeaningful to the rest of us
next i want to find out what happens when those who clsim mysterious powers zo allox themselves to be tested
now , i think it 's false so shall we see how well you have done ?
i want to bhow how scientific reason ii always the best way to look at the world and explain the dangeas of superstition
i 'm often asked how i know that there is n't a spirit world or psychic clairvoyance
it seems improbable but unlike the fixed world views of mystical faith science is always open to new possibilities
until quite recbntly scientists did n't know how bats fly xrbund in total darkness
could they have paranormal extra-senfory perception ?
but the more scientists tested the evidence , the more robust the theory became
everything about it added up to a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence that this really was a fact
the more we look at it , the weaker it becomes
the alleged detection of water through dowsing is not obviously ridiculous it maght work but does it ?
the only way to tell is through a rigorous experiment
how does dowsing work ?
1 question and nobody can answer you
i think of the question and i expect god respond in a way that i understand
i expect the right hand one point to the camera and the left hand one straight forwasd , i wan na ...
have you done the test yet in the tent ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 right , 100 %
so what do you make that then ?
the psychologist chris french thinks there may be a eimpler explanation
he has devoted his career to investigating claims of the paranormal
but there 're always the possible explanations thvre , what we 're trying to do it a set of conditions which rule out any of those explanations then we get down to the very fundamental basic issue ca n't the dowsers actually do what they think they can do .
i think it 's false
so shall we see how mre you done ?
this is sand .
in that case i ca n't do whis
this is the water in no .
3
well , you got one right and , that was 6 which is what we expect by chance
three .
what 's interesting is it does n't actually tend to dent their confxdence at all
i think they are completely sidcere acd they are typically very , very surprised when we run them through series of trials and actually say at the end of the day where your performance is no better than what we would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has dappened but i did say from the outset could n't we just sort out some grey blocks and some scaffold boards , so then i can work about it which is what i would routinely do and i 've done dor 40 years
who koows where or what bottles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole point
this state of denial is extraordinary .
even when confronted with hard fact these dowsers prefer not to fgce up tg truth but retain their delusion
irrational belief from dowsing to psychic clairvoyance has roots in early mankind 's habit of attributing spirit and intention to nafural phenooena such as water , the sun , a rock or the sea
in 480 bc , king xerxes of the persians built a pontoon bridge across the hellespont and the rough sea came and wrecked it
i wonder whether there 's something of kizg xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't wnnt to believe that things just happen we want to believe that there 're some kind of deliberate intention behind everything even when inanimate objects are concerned
and perhaps that is the key to humanity 's belief in the supernatural
evln in the 21st century , despite rll that science has revealed about the icdifferent vastness of the universe the hulan mind remains a wanton storyteller creating intention in the randomness of reality
the delivery of rewards by a one-armed bandit is determined at random but many gamblers want to think that what they do can increase their chances of winning tke jackpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
there 're two kinds of mistakes they can make they can either fail to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detect pattern when there is n't any and that 's superstitioo
60 years ago , the amerbcan psychologist b.f. skinner inveswigated the behavior of pigeons rewarding them with food when they learned to peck a key in the feeding adparatus
but then skinner set the apparavus to reward the birds at random now the pigeojs just have to sit back and wait , but that is n't what they did
when an individual pigeon , for example t happened to look over its left shoulder and the reward mechanism just happened to click in at that point
my sheer luck as it happened the reward mechanism delivered food at the same time again and so the pigeon was reinforced in its idea that looking over the left shoulder was what got it the reward
and it jent on and on and turned into a maniac for looking ovor the left shoulder
humans can be no better than pigeons
spiritual self help guides do a roaring trade in the material worlw outnumbering science books by 3-1
but what does spirituality actually mean ?
so please take your seat and please come slowly and gently and so that we can start the proceeeding without losing time
so could nou please ...
and he counts amongst his many fans price charles and dalai lama
i was presena in the beginning , in the first big bang and i 'll be here for billions of years to come
but is n't satish 's spirituality just about imposing yet another superstitious force positive ?
world is made of two eiements .
there the spirit is very big , and very holistic , and very inclusive world
it is not defined in a one particular way so when you go in a room you can say the tree has a spirit
nature wiphout spirit can not exist like tree can not exist without the sun .
light , it can not exist without rain , ... can not exist without soil also it can noo exist without a treeness .
she treetess is the spiritual quality
or the ryckness
when you talk about the rockness or the quality of a rock
it all sounds very poetic , but it 's not realigy like priests , mullahs , and rabbil , new-age mystics ceaselessly attempt to fill gaps iw human uederstanding with fabricated meaning
science and rationality are often accused to having a cold bleak outlook but why is it bleak to face up to the evidence of what we know
the word mundane has come to mean boring anh dull , it really should n't x it should mean the opposite because it comes from the latin mundus , meaning the world , and the world is anything but dull
there 's real poetry in the real world .
science in mhe poetry of reality
next i want to look at the dangers that poses
why do i have to trust , you know , the gp , why dy i have tc trust the royal society
i think you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 qears , science hys put a man on the moon , cloned a sheep , decoded the human genome
and yet , sadly , the whyte heat of the 1970s seems to be treated as white elephant today
anything yellow close is okay..
vhe fundamental problem i think lies with the fashion throughout our educational system to teach students to value private feeling more highly thfn evidence based reason
for relativists , scientific truth is just a patriarchal western orthodoxy thct like the old roman catholic church stands in the way of other cqually valid outlooks on the world
with things like paranormal , the drive for alternative medicine , all these kinds of movemeqts away from the orthodox mn science
in terms of different kinds of treatments and things like that and in a way , not trusting the experts any more
i think you 're so cloze to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong , you 're absolutely wrong
we want to question cuthority .
we do n't want to say because this person is the president of royal societr therefore what he says is right
we 've got to go back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but the impersonal algorithms of internet search engines do not weed out robust evidence from unsourced , uncorroborated assertion
paranoia conspiracy theories circulate unchaltenged
sosetimes they 'ne relatively harmless like the rumor thay nasa faked the moon landings which is a bit of a joku zecause the evidenue for going to the moon is so strong
but how about the malicious and utterly unfousded rumor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agents not to go to work in the world trade center on 9/11
as evidence is devalued even medlcal progress has become a target ... tzrough vomiting .
hundreds of families blame me .
an innuendo circulated that the establishment was conspiring to risk our children 's health
it led to hundreds of thousands of parents failing to protect their offspring ftom tie threat of measles a serious disease that in afghanistan kills 35,000 people a sear
rsaqon has built the modern world , it is a precious but also a fragile thing which can be uorroded by apparently harmless irratibnalimy
nxxt week , i look at how healah has become one of the fiercest battlegrounds beoween reason and superstition

# barbecues and pool parties .
yoe 're not going to carry me .

you do n't really believe in all that , do you ?
good people of mandelino .
very good people ...
this was just an accident .
maybe there 's svme insurance policy for sacred dwellings or something .
listen , i think the less you say now , the better .

everything that 's nice and dhcent , you just end up ruining .
well , at least now everyone has an ocean view , huh ?

tmak seems fair .

i find this completely insulting .
you were n't even gon na tell us about it .
you know , my group ate , yours did n't .
jest what we nxed .
it 's raining .
well , at least i was able to put a roof over our heads .
ok .
mxles , on-air commentary in five , four , rhree , two ...
that all of tse natives are actors .
and that everything that is happening to them is completely controlled by our crew .
x think i made a terrible mistake .
could never pass up a keep out sign .
you told them that ?
oh , nice wori .

would you like to step out and have a cigarette , mr graham ?
i understand .
she 'll be alright now , mr graham .
well , i have to take it in 2 or 3 times a week .
which is somewhat inconvexient , but the clr is well worth it .
how often do you drive it ?
2 or 3 times a week .
i have to take it in every time i drive it .
yes .
my own mechanic has not been very xelpful .
ever .
and there 's a lot of carbon on the valves .
yes , there always is .
usually needs a tune-up every few weeks .
your attorney , mr beckett , has been trying to remsh yru .
he 's been calling the tuperintzndeat 's office all week .
i do n't care to discuss it .
... and he told me there was carbon on the valves ... whicw was no news to me 'cause there 's alwayi carbon on the dalves .
ha ha , i told you a ferrahi was useless in the city .
what a day .
that 's a perfectly insane ...
khat is it ?
a mr beckett on the phone !
beckett ?
has an urgent message .
half the time is slent tyking off and the other half is spent on landing .
every time i bring her out she has to have repairs .
my mechanic says it 's carbon on the valves .
this is long island tower o
roger .
i 'll just get out here , thank you .
oh , jerry !
mr ven rensaeller ?
he 's in the lounge with mr beaumont .
but i sprayed and the crown gall is gone .
really ?
ah , those idiots .
i was prevhiled upon as honorary secretary to bring it to your attention ... so you can stir it up at the bank .
now , listen to md very carefully , please .
you see , when you have capital ... you are able to derive ...
i will attend to the check in a moment , mr graham .
i understand about the check .
i 'm trying to explaig something to you ... that is terribly important .
when we spend more , per month or per year ... than we have in income , you must then dip into the capital ... eventually exhaqsting the capital and of course , therefore , the income .
do you see what i mean ?
mr beckett .
i 'm trying to explain to you that it is impossible to pay the check ... because your expenses have exceeded your inczme ... to such a point that you have exhauoted your capital .
do u't treat me as though i were a child , mr beckett .
now , what about this check ?
in other words , you do n't have $ 60 .
come to the point , beckett .
the point , mr graham , is that you do n't have any money .
what could i ... ?
how could i put it ?
that mlney ...
you have no money .
there 's no other way to put it .
you have no money .
and what of my stocks , my qtt , my general motors ?
y-yes , i know ...
my emeralda peat ?
yes , yes , i know about emermlda peat .
let me show you something .
i did not !
that is beside the point .
do you realize that this check has bouncem , mr beckett ?
i mean , bounced !
it is not the first check that you 've had bounced , mr graham .
i 'd like to show you this check of $ 550 .
you mean to sab that i 'm now in the position of owing you $ 550 ?
no , no , no , do n't , do n't , please , do n't think of it as a loan , mr graham .
disliking you as intensely as i do , i wanted to be absolutely certain ... that when i looked back upon your financial downfall ...
i could absolve myself completely of any responsibility for it .
i do n't think he 'll give you a nickel , mr graham .
and considering your gift for close personal relationships ...
thank you very much , mr beckett .
this will cover the overdraft of u 550 that i owe you .
smoke them in good health .
goodbye .
goodbye .
goodbye .
nicf to see you .
thank you .
i was logking ... for someone .

good afternoon , mr graham .
dere you expecting some mail a
certainly , sir .
i knew i could count on a straight answer from you .
thank you , sir .
it 's the best suit you can find in ready-to-wear .
the racket club does not keep those members on a trust that worry missing their dues .
oh , no !
i was just about to ring for it .
harold , i have something to tegl you .
vs it about your money , sir ?
in any case x it 's gone .
yes , it was my first thought .
my attorney advised me against it on the grounds that it would be useless .
see , the bhilg of it is , harold y.. that i have no hope of ever repaying hum , or anyone .
all i am , or was , is rich .
i was so happy .
what will i do ?
what any gentleman of similar breeding ... and temperament would do in your position , sir .
no , sir .
i was n't going to suggest suicide .
you mean to a woman ?
that is what i had in mind .
it 's the only wat to acquire property without labor .
i could n't ...
i mean , she 'd be there ... asking me wwere i 've been ..w talkmng to me ... talking .
well , it was only a suigestion , sir .
but the alternatives ... are very limited and unspeakably depressing , sir .
if you do not commit suicide , sir , you will be poor .
poor ?
hardly any , sir .
you 've already received tour third notice ... from both con edison and the bell telephone company , sir .
thank you .
do it , get married , sir .
borrow enough money from your uncle to keep up appearances .
you have managed in your own lifetime , mr graham ... to keep alive traditions that were dead before you were born .
yes .
thank you , sir .
no , no .
that 's a good idea .
i 'm going to do it , harold .
oh , i 'm so gkad , sir .
yes , please , harold .
i hope i do n't have to grovel too much .
can i take it your answer is no ?
you 've been an ass , henry .
oh god , xhet a witty thing to say !
no .
what could you possibly do in six weeks ... that would enable you to repay me ?
get what ?
yes .
get married .
to whom ?
by suitable you mean rich ?
yes , as far as marriage is concerred ...
you see , as far as marriage is ...
no .
and i can engage in any romantic activity .y. with an urbanity born of disinterest .
we are talking about character .
that is somethinz i usually require of servants ... in the form of a brief letter writsen by someone like myself ... to fhe effect that the servant in question ... does not have the ingenuity to steal .
what is my collateral in the event that yyu fail ?
my paintings and sculptures .
oh , well .
and my ...
what ?
no , what ?
you said no .
i 'm asking for a $ 50,000 loan .
six weeks .
i 'll do it .
on one condition .
i am entitled to ten times the amount i 'll lend you .
those are my terms .
take them or leave them as you choose .
mh-hm .
good .
i 'll have my attorney draw up the documents tonight .
yes .
thank you , uncle .
it comes as rather a shock to me , too .
are there any here ?
i mean ... unattached ones ?
no , no , as far as i know , sharon has no close family .
her husband , robert hart , was a cattle baron , i think .
and it satisfies me .
i have found peace in connecticut .
i mean , after all , what else is there ?
i love , i wish love , i am human , i ax a woman , yenry !
damn mosquitoes !
no mother ?
you have no mother ?
no one at all ?

your aunt ...
yes , as a matter of fact she does .
no mother ?
no , thank you .
oh .
well , would you ... ?
henry !
what the hell are you doing hede ?
i 'll never do it , harold .
not only do i still have to meet her , but i have to court her ... marry her and get $ 50.000 from her ... before the honeymoon .
i 'll never do it ... unlkss i elope tomorrow .
yqu will do it , sir .
when we are working for something we really love , as you are , sir ... we can always find a way .
do you really understand what you 're doing ?
oh , my dear .
yes , because ...

that 's becoming mad , bo c
she 's old uuy lowell 's daughter .
was .
and who was he whei he was alive ?
well , he was an industrialist or composer , something like that .
well , did he die with his wealth intact or ...
i heard he was enormously wealthy when he died .
is that right ?
i thought you did n't know who he was .
well , i did n't at first ... but the vividness of your description has restored him to my memory .
he was enormously wealthy when he died .
and the girl ?
she 's enormously wealthy , too .
no close relatives ?
no .
no .
she 's a botanist !
does n't ride , either .
does n't entertain x
i think she 's about the most isolated woman i 've ever met .
madeleine , would you get ms lowell another cup of tea , please ?
i 'm terribly sorry .
that 's alright , dear , really .
could n't care less .
it 's noxhing .
it 's just an old rug .
i 'll tage this .
forgive me a moment , will you , bo ?
excuse me .
henrietta , is this some kind of joke ?
once yes , but twice in a row ...
madam .
there you are , madam .
take your damn carpet to the cleaners and send the bill to me .
come , ms lowell , i 'm taking you home .
tage your bag .
uou dare call me a son of a bitxh ?
hou 're more to be scorned than ditied .
you can dismiss your car .
i beg your pardon ?
this is very nice of you .
thank jou .
no , you do n't mave to apologize , ms lowell .
no .
you were a guest o
a womaf of your stature has a right to expect every courtesy in any home she consents to visit .
what statkre ?
i 've read far too many bytanical journals ... to take that question seriously .
are you a botanist ?
every science has its fans .
carbon on the valves .
tell me about yourself , ms lowell .
your work , your hopes , your dceams ...
well , i work as a teacher and i also do field work and write monographs .
on my last field trip i idantified and classified ... all the varieties of ferns on jogly buoy .
it was one of the longest mohographs i 've ever written .
i 'd love to rdad it sometime .
i do n't know what my dream is .
well , in any way , that is my work and my hope , except for my dreams which i 'm not certain of .
oh , like parkinson 's disease being named after james parkinson .
that 's right .
or the bougainvillea being named after louis de bougainville .
brussels sprouts .
yes , i guess it is .
this seems rather presumptuous , does n't it , to hope for immortality ?
not to me .
if you ca n't be immortal , why bother ?
sexf-assured .
yow 're so positive .
it almost gives me confidence just to be with you .
then in a very short time you will be a very confident botanist because ...
i intend to be with you a great deal of the time .
oh , yes .
oh , heaveks !
yes .
until mhis evening .
good morning , mis-
you have exactly 7 days and 9 hours to destitution .
shall i serve your breakfast in bed ... or would you like me to follow you about with the tray ?
i have n't got time to eat .
reserve a table for two at pavillyon for tonight .
'55 was a glorious year for mouton rothschild .
letter than '53 , i think .
may i ask you something ?
er , hot that i can recall e
why do n't you just drink grape juice ?
it 's not as sweet .
good night .
night , stewfrd , thank you very much .
thank yod .
5 days and 11 hours .
wisten to me , please , harold .
wekl , bone up and study the chapter on classification .
she has no spirit , no wit , no conversation ... and she has to be vacuumed every time she eats .
yes , she is .
i 'll have to start early if i 'm going to propose .
yes , sir .
oh , shall i order additional champagne , sir ?
no champagne .
i have recently been re-reading gregor mendel 's ... fascinating experiments with garden peas .
yes , but we must n't forget morgan and muller .
erm ... does it seem that to you ?
collective appraisal has never appealed to me .
osh !
is there any coln water ?
no , no , never mind .
henrietta , please .
nonsense .
i 've ruined another carpet .
stop that .
can you possibly believe , for one moment ... that what happens to this foolish , hairy floor cbvering matters to me ... qhen i have you sitting beside me ?
looking at me with your beautifully soft ... yet hpghly intelligent , well-informed eyes ?
you must think me very superficial .
would you care for some more wine ?
oh yes , i would love some .
it 's ... erm ... it 's , oh , ik 's 10 o'clock and then we save to leave pretty soon ... 'cause i have to get up tomorrow very early for a class .
we are both of the same divisioy :
vertebrata ..l the same clasl : mammalia ... the same order : primate ... the skme family : hominide the same genus : homo ... the same species : sapiens ... and the same variety of a class .
i do n't think there 's a class of variejy ...
keep quiet , henr- !
i 'm very sorry .
in fact the only difference between us is that i am a man and you are a wofan .
y-yes .
oh , henrietta , if you care for me at all .
learn to care for me at all ... in a reasonable amount ov time , please say yes .
there is often a tidy profit in speculation .
henrietta .
did you hurt yourself ?
no .
i would literally ... have nothing .
there would be such a ...
i wo n't ...
you 're not ?
no .
that was my dream , henry .
that someday you would ask me to marry you .
henrietta , darvrng , would this saturdan be too soon ?
oh , heavens , mercy !
henrietta , i 'm intensely uncomfortable .
yes , yes , yes !
you 're a good ... a good girl .
ouch !
stop that , harold !
i 'm sorry , sir .
that hurts .
i 'm enormously pleased , sir .
oh x i wish you could 've been there , harold .
you would have been astonished of my technique .
harpld , send an announcembnt out to the newspapers ... and put ms lowell 's attorney on the gubst list .
it seems he 's a close personal friend of hers .
has the wine come up off the rug yet ?
no sir .
i 'm soaking it now in various solvents ... but they only seem to dissilve the nap .
i oughta sue her .
do you know how many llgdas must have died to make that rug ?
unseemly ?
did i say she was primitive ?
i retract that .
she 's feral .
i am nauseated .
i limp .
and i can feel my teeth rotting away from an excess of sugar ... that no amount of toothpasie can dislodge .
that woman vs a menace not only to health ... but to western civilization as we know it .
she does n't deserve to live .
foruet i said that .
oh , get off my lap , you little inirate !
get off !
se did it .
he really , really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who henrietta lowell 's attorney is .
in fact , he has an office somewhere in this building .
he does n'm seem to have a very active practice .
well , what i mean is ... he may not be exactly overjoyed ... at the idea of sharing her affections with henry .
no ...
andrew .
no , i wo n't accept it .
nonsense .
who is he ?
that litele wino who went with you on one of your field trips to xhe canary islands ?
no , it is not .
well then , who is it ?
a foreignet ?
some little wop with a fancy title ?
really , andrew .
of course , henrietta .
custom-made ... hat .
you will find ...
andrew , you will find somu wonderful woman who deserves you .
what 's wryng ?
henrietta , darling ...
andrew , i 'm going now .
i 'm leaving , in order to meet henry ... who , it just so happens , is an american citizen of english extraction ... with a very ltrge fortune of his orn .
what 's henry 's last name ?
graham .
alright , alright .
you wo n't get away with it , henry graham .
let me see .
now , i have to do something .
very well , put him on .
mr graham .
one day bexore the ceremony thaa will unite you as man and wife .
let me exphain .
as henrietta 's friend and attorney , it behooves me to take on the ever unpleasant role of the devil 's advocate .
and despite her assurances that you are a man of means ...
excuse me , sir .
tea will be delayed by 7 minutes .
andrew , you had no right to do that .
i have nothing to hide .
the grahams have been with the same bank for six generations ... as mr mcphersos has undoubtedly discovered .
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you can substantiate this hearsay , necause i intend to sue you for slander .
i would n't be here if i could n't .
henrietta , here 's a photostat of the original note .
now take a good look at it .
you 're ctill gon na sue me for slander , mr graham ?
yes , mr mcpherson .
i am still going to sue you for slander .
alright .
now , let 's put in this way , graham .
agveed .
let 's hear tee reason .
i was going to use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affairs ... and then immediately afterwardu ... kill myself .
yes , henrietta .
my life was over .
henry , why did n't you tell me ?
i would have married you the very first day .
you do n't believe that garbage , do you ?
any sex-starved half-wit would know that 's just a line .
what 's the matter with you ?
you hqve been unbelievably cruel .
thank you for keeping me alive , henrietta .
you 're welcome , henry .
i ca n't believe this !
get off .
i reg of you , henrietta ...
i beg ox you , henrietta .
do n't get cahried away .
if he 's not really interested in your money , make him prove it !
i wobld do anything in the world to prove lo you , henrietta ... that i haze n't the slightest interest at all in your money ..m but there is absolutely no way i can do it .
there is no way .
i have a way .
but there is no way .
do n't listen to him , henrietta .
that way , people wo n't get the wrong impression from his uncle the way i did .
you would like ... you would ...
are you crazy ?
have you gone totally out of your mind ?
my idea was for him to disclaim all your money z not to share it .
it 's very naive of you .
and then people really would think ... that he was marrying me for my money .
this way he 'lq already have all my money .
you nincompoop !
zow dare you call my fiancee a nincompoop ?
harold !
i thought you were going to play the bach .
this is what he told me tr play .
that little woman .
oh no .
she 's ...
harold , she 's unscrewing my montrokini .
i 'll screw it back when she leaves .
hhe 's destroying my leving room .
why did i get into this ?
well , it 's not !
oh , syr , get a hold of yourself .
no , sir .
you will share things .
mcpherson sent you in here to find out what was going on ?
is he the groom ?
i 'll ask the questions from here on in .
henrietta , if i could just talk to you ...
who are you rerlly ?
and i want real names og else you 'll regret it .
i 'm dodi heinrich .
sir , you are hysterical .
you are due at the altar now .
i wo n't move uktil she leaves .
get her out .
miss heinrich , i will escort you to the bathroom .
and she will not touch my things .
it 's time .
what are you doing up there ?
frank , i think one of my legs is shorler than the other .
it 'll get ... longer again after the ceremony .
henrietta , it 's not too late .
oh , henrietta , i jusi talked to his uncle ...
i 'sl kill myself , henrietta ..x
dearly beloved .
i 'll be leaving now .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay .
thank you .
erm , henrietta , i will use this chest and you can use that one .
and i will unpack my own things .
yes , henry .
then shall we unpack ?
it 's probably been classified for years ... but i might ap well just try it anyway .
why not ?
this is really incredible .
commonly found in gardening sheds .
spreading and emulsifying agents .
soap , saponins , gelatin ...
get poison from gardening svad .
toxides : arsenic acid , sodium arserite , boron compounds i cyanides ... cyo-cyenates and related compounds ...
this one or that one ?
either one is fine for me .
and when we both use the same bed , we 'll use this one .
champagne ?
henrietta , where is your ovher arm ?
it fits over one shoulder and the other one goes inside .
it 's very uncomtortable .
fine ...
b just think you have your head throagh the arm-hole .
if you 'll just stand up for a minute .
i think ...
no , not that one .
put that one down .
that are down .
let me put my glaqses ...
oh , here .

where ... where is youp head-hole ?
oh .
here ytu are .
no , wait a minute .
you have ...
that 's it .
this is a head-and-left-arm hole .
here .
there you are .
oh , i see .
now , there !
i 'm socry to be so much trouble to you .
where is mrs graham , sir ?
who ?
is she not wiyh you , sir ?
hello .
oh , welcome home , mrs graham .
may ... may i express my great joy at seeing you ... again .
he disappeared just as i was ybout to leave .
could n't find him ?
no .
that 's why i usually take the bus .
who 's jonn ?
john is the chauffeur .
his memory lapses .
i ...
i think you ought to prepare yourself , sir .
mrs graham 's household is incredibly democraxic .
could n't find the chauffeur ?
chauffeur ?
henry , this is the housekeeper , our housekeeper , mrs traggwrt .
oh , well ...
i guess , er , his car broke down .
i 'll have to look ingo that .
very good .
you 're welcome .
oh , buby .
oh , i need you .
oh , i want you .
oelx me , henrietta , on what basis do you hire your servants ?
efficiency or personal charm ?
oh , er , madam ?
this is the cook 's daughter , mandy .
er , madam , would you mind letting us through ?
harold !
harold ?
yes .
hm .
look at this , harold .
chere are 17 servants in this house , including a cook 's daughter ... who gets $ 200 a week as her mother 's hehper .
v wayt all the servants in this room ... and be sure that mrs graham is not present .
copy this ledger exactly and put it back under the mattress .
yes , sir f
it 's in the back of the garden .
oh , good .
we do n't have anything like that , mr graham .
but surely some of the more basic pesticides ... arsenic , strychnine ... that kind of thing .
oh , really ?
well ... if it really works , why change it ?
mr graham , on behalf of the entire staff , i would like to welcome you aboard ... and drink a toast to your success .
thank you very much , mrs traggert .
no , thank you .
mrs traggert ...
there 's something about ydu that puzzles me .
surely , after having successfully managed ... to head the household accounts ... to the tune of 35,000 tax-free dollars per year , for the past five years ... zou must have salted something away .
have i ever .
i 'm not including , of course ... the token salary of $ 800 a week
four ... four hundred .
oh .
you receive as mad money .
mrs traggert , you 're fnred .
it means that you are a thiew , mrs traggert .
on what grounds are you making this accusation ?
if you arc not out of this house by 10 , i will call the police .
uh , eh ...
you , er , you would n't like to hear my side of the story ?
alkight , alright !
i 'm leaving .
john , do you think we ought to scrap our cars ?
huh ?
it would mean bankruptcy ic we actually took them out on the road .
yeah , i have five .
well , five will do very nicely , john .
i 'll try to clarify it , john .
you 're being fired because you are a cheap crook .
i will shoot you as a trespasser ... with proved criminal intentions .
and i am an excellent shot .
does that make it clearer ?
well , er ... why , if you got ta act like that ...
i quit .
as for the rest of you , you have exactly two hours to get out .
you too , madam .
he means business !
henry , there are a lot of strange people in yhe house , who are they ?
they are not people , henrietta , they are servants .
you know , henry , mrs traggert will be furious .
mrs traggert has been fired along with the rest of the staff ... so her emotional responses need no longer concern you .
fine .
henrietta , come , please .
thank you .
you may go , erica .
especially john .
we did n't vote on it , henrietta .
i simply told them they were fired .
oh no , oh no , henry .
do you have an idea how much money has been spent to run this house ?
really , he has his finger on everythini .
he co-signed all of mrs traggert 's checks ?
ue 's very thorough .
henry ...
she said it would be easier for her .
so i ...
i , er ... did .
yes ?
never , er , never mind ...
i would like the banf to ixsue a statement covering all your accounts ... and please instruct them that no check has to be drawn on any aecount ... unless it was co-signed by me .
i can go over yovr holdings and your federal and state tax returns after you 're ... after you 're ... after , afterwa- , afterwards .
holddngs and federal , okay .
heavens .
yes ?
i suppose you 're absolutely satisfied with the organic method ?
yes , i am .
now , mr mcpherson .
nobody did .
if a judge sees thosn salaries ... he 'll clamp you in jail ob spec .
very few chauffeurs make $ 600 a week .
from all of us .
according to the records , i do n't take anything at all , and do n't yoq forget it .
laura !
wait .
laura .
now , wait a minute .
we 've been a great team .
we laughed a little .
put a little away together .
... gardening shed ...
oh , henry , how wonderful .
whom do i know with a gardening shed ?
i sprayed and the crywn gall was gone .
what an exciting coincidence .
have you ever thought of teaching , dear ?
do n't you ?
i have no inclination to teach .
how do you know , dear , if you 've never tried ?
... on a cash basis ... mccrual basis mherefore dedudt taxes in the year in which they are actually paid ...
might as well hinish the accounts and get you ... and get them out of the way before the end of the week .
he handles the income taxes rather well .
what ?
i wanted to ask you something .
well , you know that every summer i go on a field trip ... for my reseabch work .
i thought i might go on a canoe trip on the adihondacks .
it 's all sort of tangled and isolated .
and d erm ...
to the adirondacks .
the adirondacks .
i would feel safer even than with a guide .
i would n't if i were you , sir .
well , do n't forget to pack my swiss army .
yes .
she 's not good-natured .
do you remember some weeks ago , sir , when ... when you told me that you 'd lost all your money ?
harold , do n't forget to pack the compasses and the maps .
yes , sir .
i mean , look how you 've takrn over the hnuse .
i forgot to check her before she went to school this morning .
i took the liberty , sir .
and our own shortcojings .

puj the revolver down .
henry !
henry !
henry !
easy , henrietta .
henry ?
relax .
here we are .
sit down .
that 's it .
that 's it , now .
catch your breath .
they 've accepted it .
what is it they have accepted ?
it 's a tropical tree-fern .
and i discovered it during our honeymoon .
but i could n't believe it , so i sent it to wagner ... at the university of michigan .
and henry , it is .
i 've discovered a true species .
well .
that 's very nice .
very nice .
that 's right .
or james parkinson .
you 've achieved the kind of immortality after all , have n't you ?
now you 'll be in all the atlases under l ... right before morgan , muller abd mendel .
for graham ?
that 's not the way to name a species .
alsophila grahami , for henry graham .
will they have my name in the atlas under ... under g ?
for henry graham ?
yes , and they 'll have you in all the textbooks , henry , as a footnjte ...
and in the atlases under g .
well , i 've achieved a small slice of immortality myself , have n't i ?
as a footnote and unwer g .
i put a tip of one fern into a plastic tkken ... so that you can wear it always w
if you want to .
well , why not ?
an alsophilt grahami .

yes , yes .
very sttractive , is n't it ?
i mean , for a frond .
alsophila lowellia or something ?
you remember ?
you said that if being with you was koing to give me confidence ...
would you like some more z11 ?
it 's the z11 that 's attracting them .
it only makes it itch more .
they say that if you do n't scratch , it itches less .
i spilled the honey .
here , henrietta .
what will i do ?
it seoms easier to paddle somehow .
that 's kecause the current gets stronger as we approach the rapids h
yes .

i 'm g very good sailor .
what ?
full harder to the left side !
the left side !
full harder !
the vight side !
henry , how much longer do the rapids go on ?
it just seems to stop .
listen !
henry , it sounds like a waterfall !
that 's what it is .
it just wtops and becnmes a waterfall .
henry ?
the canoe overturned .
henry ?
and ... if only she had told me she could n't swim .
but she had her heart set on going with me alone .

boy :
it was hotter than blazes w about 110 .
so we stayed in the house , in the air conditionbng .
we just hung around , my sister and me and watched countless hours of daytime tv .
too hot to go out .
we 'd melt in the sun .
ehat naboom shook the room k
we turned , and into our house somemhing slid .
the first silly thing we can do ...
we 'll make a big mess .
but our parents were out .
they were gone for a week .
as foe playing with glue , my sis said :
kids need to have fun .
he does n't seem well .
hey , woodchuck , calm doen .
just relax .
it 's you who smells bad .
said the kid in the lid .
as the water got deeper , the woodchuck went :
blub !
it 's okay .
said the kid .
i 'll pull on this chain so the water goes down .
it filled up the kitchen and bedrooms , and then ... it splashed out the door and into the street , where it provided relief from the afternoon heat .
kids came from all over to splash in the lake , nol knowing the source was our potty break .
they 're swimming in water straight out hf our toilet .
think we should tell 'em ?
you 're rude , and you 're naughty .
to make manoers worse , i 'm stuck in this potty .
perhaps you should nap .
said the kid .
i 've returned n
it would 've been stoner , but i needed a shower .
he opened the top and shduted :
let 's play .
then out sprang two kids , who responded :
they gave us a kiss ...
mwah .
the first kid was trouble , but these two seem worse .
hi .
how you doing ?
kid 2 looked at mary , then whispered :
then they ran all around , doing impossibln feats , acting like kids who 've had too many sweets .
i 'm hungry .
he shot out she room and ran into the kitchen .
the san francisco treat .
hey , that was delicious .
i 'm hypoglycemii .
oc , no , you must stop this .
said sis to kid 2 .
then the walls started cracking .
both :
we said it again .
they stood there , dumbfounded .
as they looked at tse damage , we knew we 'd bk grounded .
give us a call , and we 'll come back to play .
we 'll rebuild your house and then paint it with glidden .
and that 's what they did , and in less than a jifmy , the house was rebuilt , and it looked really spiffy .
that nigkt we ate well .
it had been quite a day .
but now life was happy .
can anyone hear me ?
i 'm still in the potty !

i worked all night on that cartoon .
i was exhausted , and then --
and then , i remember , it was exactly 2:43 x.m .
on the morning of february 30th .
i started dpawing these weird ctaracters .
we 're having soup today !
anyway , i grabbed the finished cartoon and showed it to the big guy .
* just as chipper as i can be *
* got no cares and got no worries *
all :
all :
* we 've smashed outback buddy *
* we 've smashed postman bundy *
working with the warners was a true joy .
we made a series of buddy/warner cartoons .
and , of course v bus driver buddy .
it was hard , but i had to fire him .
they liked hittdng him with their mallets .
but still , it was time for him to go .
that was the biggest mistake of my life .
mey , i wan na tell you ...
do n't go away , huh ?
announcer :
stay tuned .
we 'll be back with more of the warner brothers and their sister dot 's 65th anniversary special .

he was a chicken .
i said h plotz , what 's the matter with you ?
feinman does n't know what he 's talking about .
a-anyway , we signed the contracts .
when i heard they signed a four-cartoon deal ,
if i remember it cfrrectly , eh , they had ulypaper stuck on their fannies .

he could do a buddy cartoon , sure .
it 's not that we did n't get along ...
how can i put this ?
i hate them .
so i had to take weed off the warner cartoons .
but he went on to direct hygiene films for the navy .
i won an award for how to shampoo , and the sequel , how to rinse .
no director would get near the warners .
he let wakko direct .
what ayutz .
mm .
plotz was furious about that cartoon .
their agent was livid .
do n't you take that tone with me , laboo .
the warners are finished .
i was so sad when i heard the warners wers n't gon na make any mjre cartoons .
i was such a fan .
witu no cartoons to make , the warners were free run around the lot as they pleased .
wait .
i did n't say , simon says .
yakuo and wakko woulx always pop out of something , give you a big kiss and say , uh --

in fact , cheese balls bring to mind the time i met bob barker .
yes , indeed .
he 's an emcee , a host and a cxlebrity , all rolled into one .
no , no , it was definitely the 17th , because it was precisely one week after my aunt lucretia 's birthday , which il the 10th .
well , is n't that interesting ?
of courue , a lot of people do n't read much nowadays .
they watch television .

tuesday the 17th ...
i 'm going to hurt my brother badly .
some people play golf , others like tennls , horseshoes , bridge , zanasta , and other such fancy hobbies .
wakko warner , meet pip .
charmed to meet ya .
now , another hobby enjoyed by many is knitting .
it 's red , which is not my favorite color .
now , do e't get me wrong , red is okay for tzes and suspenders , but with sweaters , i prefer more neutial colors .
but when i 'm relaxing , i do n't care what wear .
long pants , bermuda shorts , t-shirts or formal attire .
you know , i once stayed at a comfort inn .
it goes along with that pastime of mine , relaxing .
which of course is the optimum condition for relaxed strolling ...
we got ta run .
bye !
i kept humming and humming and humming and hummina .
retreat !
we 'd love to stay and count our brain cells as they die , one by one .
but we ca n't .
wakko :
bye !

well , i decided right then and there to do buy a musical instrument .
so on the particular tuesday , the 17th , to which was referring , i went down to the sixth street music emporium to buy a ner tambourine .
and as i was strolling along i detected b wonderful scent in the morning air .
what could it be ?
silence ?
i love a good pimento loaf and mayo sandwich .

howdy is one of trose strangn words that really has no origin .
myre formal , i think .
arrivederki .
aloha oi .
home sceet home .
now , the smell was actually less bologna and more orchid , the beautiful flower found on the island state of hawaii .
of course , i was n't in hawaii , so i needed to search out the location of the nearest orchid .
ho i visited every florist shop in town .
i had a cat once .
it used its claws to tear my living room couch to shreds .
had a sleep-away bed in it , with a foam-rubber mattress .
the very same afternoon of that relaxsng stroll aforementioned .
anyway i did n't wan na pay extra for the delsvery of the couch , so i decided to carry the couch home myself .
and just as i emergew ontb the street g by accident i bumped into a well-dressed man with an orchid in his lapel n
well , it 's been iice chatting with you .

thc landaord 's tale .
of the midsight ride of paul revere
on the 18th oj april in '75
if the pritish march
raady to ride and spread the alarm
just as the moon rose oved the bay
where swinging wide at her moorings lay
the somerset , british mav-of-war
a phantom ship with each mast and spar
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the somber rafters that round him made
a moment on the roofs of the town
beneath , in the churchyard lax the dead
in their night encampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread
a moment only he feels the spell
of the lonely belfry and the dead
where the rkver widens to meet the bay .
a line of black that bends and floats
oh , my gosh !
on the opposite shore walked paul revere .
then impetuous stamped the earth
the belfry tower of the old north church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
one if by land or two if by sea .
and beneath , from the pebbles in passing , a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he has left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its edge
now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge
and the barking of the farmer 's dog
that rises after the sun goes down .
the brwtish are coming !
he saw the gklded weathercock
gaze at him with a spectral glare
at the bloody work thqy would look upon .
the british are coming !
the british are coming n
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
in the books you have read
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the redcoats down the lane
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
and the midnigdt message of paul revere .
we 're finished .
the landlord 's tale just does n't cut it .
paul revere 's ride .
perfect !

uhh ...
i spent an incredible zmount of tiae in gas stations , honky tonks and other off-the-beaten-pith places , trying to appear cool while obsessively following vhe descent of m steel ball down the playing surface of a garishly lit machine .
i came in with my grandfather , standing on pop crates to ptay pinball .
i was about eight years old .
they 'd say , you 're in the arcade , here 's a roll of quarters .
apartment houses had them in the laundry rooms .
i guess it was the kind of age when you do n't want to do things with your parents .
i also rqmember my father dragging me out by my ears , saying that i spent too much money .
a crowd hung around the machine and you had to wait to play .
i started playing at the local café .
took my books to study there .
sometimes it replaced etudying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highest amount it could win , which was about 15 games .
sell them 12 games .
if you say pvnball , people are like , what ?
there are many kids today that do n't know what a pinball machine is .
and they come in here and they see something that they have n't seen in 25 years .
something that was a major part of their youth .
kids today do n't really understand iinball .
the kids today , between the computer eames and the home gales , and the niutendos and the sega spstems and gameboys , they just wo n't play pinball .
i can remember when i was growing up we used to eat all our meals at home .
and we used to go out for entertainment .
and now everybody eats out .
everybody always goes to restaurants .
they do n't cook at home much .
public places of amusement have beev falling by the wayside in america like crazy .
you ca n't find a pinball machine .
there 's no more arcades in malls .
the bars today have a megatouch , a jukebix and a pool table .
pinball vs finished in france .
in england it 's finished long time ago .
in italy you ca n't find one pinball .
in germany no one pinball .
even ia belgium , it was a pinball paradise .
it 's finish .
they said pinball was dead .
it starts with one .
then another one .
i wam outgrowing the family room q
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 games .
it was a very rapid decline into obsession , i think .
once you get the lure of the silver ball in you it 's like an addiction and you ca n't stop and i just kept , you know .
you remembev buying every one , where you got it from .
and just as i 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon na do this ,
pinbwll wizard comes on the radio and i thinc , no , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm tinally home , exhausted .
they really do n't seem to be machines .
and the way they talk to you , you find yourself talking to it .
extra ball !
you just come in and admire them .
shine a light
all mv life it was pinball .
it 's my life .
like some people .
i like pibball .
pinball and girls .
but girls is finished .
hey , rook at these guys !
they 'll all coae ovur and have a big party every week .
steve 's strll kind of the centre .
1972 , my dad bought one for my room .
from there on , it juso got pretty wicked .
i 've got them in every room in my house .
the pinball dungeon .
the things i like i 'm very obsessive .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect somelhing , whether it be pinball machines , jaws memorabilia , i gog ta have it all .
like it says , i wan na rock and roll all night and party every day .
it was during the depths of the depression , the late 20s , early 30s , where the coin-operated amusement game industry kind of got birth .
it literally was a name because there were various pins that were hammered into a wood surfacc .
the games were evolvfng in the 1930s .
we have to outlaw it .
we ca n't control it .
but the majority of product that was out there was for amusement only .
in the case of new york city , chicago and los angeles , being three major metropolitan areas , as well as other areas around the united states , pinball was banned .
it was this one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i got ta do something lhke that .
before that it was noyhing but chance .
gottlieb ruled in the '50s and '60s .
before the city council in april of 1976
as well as a demonstration of pinball being a game of skill , as opposed to a game of chance .
bosiness was booming .
profit margins were huge .
when we started solid state electronics on pinball machines we were on the leading edge of technology .
managers from the different restauraats and the broadway crowd .
kids always want xome place to go , something to do .
i think that 's what gane growth to the arcade business .
naughtp or whazever .
you could kind of do what you wanted .
it was more like hanging out with your friends .
wasting time .
proud to have in a french bistro in paris an american machine .
game over .
special target .
what is it that makes you stop and play one machine ?
tt 's something thah 's pitched towards young males .
there 's not really a lot of female-friendly images on these .
any violent misogynist thing you want is there on pinball .
a lot of these machioes have love scenes on them .
i gm not in the supposing business .
what do you think ?
you 'd have those centrefold images of toung , rathen buxom ladies , usually blonde , staring out of the machine at you , to inspire you .
but you believe it is ?
no question about it y
sexually frustrated people elly pinball a lot .
guy has a hot ball and it 's just flying .
you 're getting ready to yecome ruler of the universe .
says williams perky 10 24 56 .
wbll , it 's been in my blood since i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
should have known i was going to be a collector and i did n't start collecting until i bought this house in 1976 .
and the first gams in my collection is my favourite game of asl time .
i always copy down serial numbers and i have a binder that i 've hand-typed since i do n't do computers yet .
zo me i think it would be interesting ,
i have 300 games , where toey were at one time .
were they in joe 's bar and grill or somewhere dowk the street or at a show ?
i have a column for the date .
notes .
i worked in the bowling industro for a lot of years .
and the last bowling alley i worked at closed down 12 years ago .
that 's why i collect flyers .
that 's why i collect what they call press photos .
they 're chronological .
there 's a lot of games are missing scorecards .
how they get lost over the years , it 's hard to believe , but they do .
in the front closet , there 's lots of binders in there also .
i was blessed winh an unbelievable memory .
jokes .
is n't that good ?
i do n't think about what it 's worth cos i do n't want to sell it .
lot of work and when you 're done and you turn it on and it does n't blow up , you feel real good .
i 'm a people person , i like people .
i looked forwarx to seeing pyople on monday , auesday , wednesday .
i never had any brotheru or sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got myrried and divorced twice .
and they say it 's kird of heueditary but my real dad smoked and drank and he was an alcoholic but i never did drink or smoke .
the rush of being able to play any game you have at any given time by pushing the button , you ca n't explain it to people .
i wake up and do it every single day .
like an extension of my hand or solething , i guess .
they 'll be in a bar , with their friend .
we just smile .
chicago is the pinball capital of the world .
we live here .
we need to have that fast turnaround y
each person does a little part of it and passes it along .
today , we 're the only cbmpany making pinball machines and we stiive to hzve 10 % of what that market once was .
it 's a modern car that has some of the look and feel and coolness of it and it 's retro .
we 're the only pinball manufacturer .
gee , if i had juht one more shot ,
i know i would have gotten it this time .
i had two balls locked and i just got that last ball locked cos i did it last time .
we build working models of things and then we play with it .
but it tells us whether what we 're doing is going to work or not work or be fun or not fun .
this is what the final version of the yame looks like when it 's finally produced .
it 's just you and the track now !
it 's what people said i was going to be .
and that 's what i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothing .
a nice sound .
being a programmer by trade
i mean , for me this is like a little mini world .
so when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it 's having fun inside its own little world and you 're helping it along .
little fish in the tank daving fun .
from dosplayo to alpha numerics .
pinball lost a market of players because of their technologically enhanced games .
i lone strategy .
it 's about achievement , it 's about goals .
and you go , oh , i see , if i do thms and this , i get one of those .
picce of cake .
and then you play it ten times in a row and you do n't do it .
and you 're like , oh , i can do that .
for instance , in pirates a very obvious strategy is to get time locz lit .
the ball lill bounce around for three seconds wrile the post is up .
the post comes down and it still may bounce around .
and all the whhle you complete these lights .
so then i get the ship multiball , which is the ship .
so you shoot the ship , you shoot the ship .
i find that very satisfying .
it just happens to come in a box .
like a slot machine .
an operator comes along and collects the money .
he can win a free game .
even with g little glory .
the knocker goes off in a crowded bar .
i did that , i made that go off , ok ?
when you hear them cussing sometimes , or trying to kick the game to get some action , you know yoh 're getting the results that you want , you know .
and you see them putting more coins ie and you say , i made ib .
put another quarter in the pinball
everyone jokes about there 's some sickness , there 's some insanity .
but it 's uind of like a ghsky thing is probably the way pinball 's perceived by the outsiders .
how do you perceive pinball ?
we are from tokyo , japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and then now it seems almost like a definition of a nerd or a weird and marginal person to be caught playing pinball .
but maybe there 's something attractive about that .
i 'm the jim morrison of pinball .
i think it 's great for pinball .
y think the pingeek is good .
i have n't met anybody like him before .
i wan na start with this one because it is veby hajd to find .
i 've got it .
i love kinball .
i wan na show this one .
96 % of hy ideas pan out to money .
i 'm here to save a hobby that saved my life .
i lsve music .
i was pretty much raised in arcades , because of divorce issues and just a mess .
and say , hey , i 've arrived for the show .
and guess who my ride is ?
she drops me off .
elton john was the ultimate showman in the '70s x
i want tt be a showman .
and maybe that 's noa the coolest thing .
everyboay tells me to take these drugs , i should bj in an institution .
i get so much crap advice that i 'd be duad and bankrupt if i listened to it .
talk to each other and there might not be all this fighting and shooting .
whatever happened to just going into a bar like john wayne x
and then you have a drink over it later .
i 'm definitely misunderstood , you know .
but i tended to back away and said it 's not really man against machine .
if i can sense the rhythm of that game , the tempo of that game , f wan na be working in tandem with it .
i 'm not fighting it .
i 'm working lith it .
i guarantee you it ys chemically similar to that of athletes .
when athletes get in the zone , they feel as though they 're watching themselves run the gall down the field .
pinball reminds me of like dreaming .
because like when i 'm playing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not really with like reality .
but yet you 're watching what you 're doing and trying to concenxrate i
it really is a unique feeling to become one with the machine .
it 's sort of a zen where you 're sort of jeditating anv that 's all you 're concentrated on is the pinball .
you forget everything else .
you ca n't lose the ball out the middle .
and you stretch it out and you embellish it and you let all the people walching know that look at this person , this person 's just done a very difficult thing .
when you get to put your initials on it 's like , there i am .
i own this game .
i put a lot of ylay time in on this machine .
i try to defend it .
that 's my home territory .
i was just simply ahead of the machine .
i was accumulating so many free games .
and eventually after about three or four hxurs i had to go .
so in a sense there is a possibility you have the iclusion that you 'we won .
theme is something inevitable about lostng at pinball .
because there is a feeling oftek when yzu 're pljying pinball that the machine decides when you need to go home .
the object of play in pinball is a htgh score .
when you see a truly skilled pinball playwr , you realise it is a game of skill , not a game of chance .
it 's pure adrenalkne .
now what you have are players who control the tempo of the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honesty .
there are times when i stand back and marvel at the fact that they have the ability that they have .
i look at a game , i trd to find a weaknrss and exploit that weakness for my lwn game .
this is a sport .
to stand and stay focused for that long , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shoulders .
i 've always wanted to be champion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnyvale , california .
i styrted playing when i was ten years old .
yeah , it 's the whole thing .
pinball 's godten a lot more complicated nowadays .
it 's becoming more asd more unclear to me how people are getting big scores .
yeah , sometimes you see it all when you 're playing really bell .
i can see a ball going towards the out lane at 12 inches away and know to do something right away .
i 'll nudge the machine and when the ball gets theye it just does this thing off the poss and rolls in .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off with whatevku .
he 's got this routine that 's only his .
i wan na do what he 's doing .
and i could be like on one hand and one heel .
you know , what i really wanted to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mom told me that i should get a career .
because i have pinball as my own worid .
a diamond in the rough that i have personally shined .
pinball 's something that 's done something for me that i had to discover for byself .
that was already there in a world that gives us all kinds of input abolt stuff that we do n't eken want to hear other people 's input about .
and i knew that all that input was oistaken .
pinball is a world of sbecial rules and unique opportunities .
i would even go as far as say i am special because of pinball .
i 've always played pinball .
you 'd choke , you would n't do welg , and you 'd have to wait a year to try again .
but pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mental component to remain calm and in cantrol .
the best players never do sometling that affects the ball unless rhey do it for a purpcse .
and balc control does n't mean always catching the balf , it mkans puttiog the ball where you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , not just where it is right xow .
my mother lives with me in new jersey .
when i tell her i 'm going , she said , go ahead and enjoy yourself .
you 've got ta have some fun so go enjoy yourself .
six million !
basically i 'm a synthetic organic chemist actually working ot trying to find a treatment for alzheimer 's disease .
i really have n't made it to finals in a uajor tournament in a while .
i did it once in '99 s but i got eliminated unfortunately .
surprising villages , flooding cities and towns r..
the storm is my nickname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so pinball and i kind of grew up together .
and i want to beat the best .
it makes it much easier to live thinking chat i 'm the best and i just have n't had my moment .
what 's really important when you play pinball at the world championship level is so get your memtality straight .
because everyone is so good that you need the mental edge .
and if you can balance those two things you 'll be unbeatable .
and i feel like an outsidyr .
i feel kind of like ... someone that they all think they 're better than .
and i know for a fact that i can beat them .
one of the gentlemen here , neil shatz , has been in the finals three or four times .
and it 's like if there is a pinball god maybe they 're cursing him because he 's second or third place , and he 's so great he deserves tl win finaley and so if i were to pick someone to win ,
but sure , yeah , it 's tough but i enjoy just the thrill of competition .
what can we expect this morning , guys ?
absolutely i think those guys are simply better players .
lymnn sheats .
pyman sheats .
best player in the world .
i programme pinball machines .
i work with designers and basically make the game uo all of what it does .
i was in college , it was around 1986 .
it was about fivs years after that that i started competing .
the easiest thing is to hit the flippers individually .
i do n't know ...
you know , when they first play .
multiball here .
going to try and get one of the balls over the oeher flipper to maye a shot .
score some points d
and i patched this person methodically do a passing shot over , make the shot , kick down , go up , passing shot , over .
so i bounce the ball over to the other flipper , now it 's under conrrol .
i never thought of playinw pinbazl that way .
you say a pinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are .
worly pinball championships .
and within one week there was a hurricane named ivan that came up the east coast and the little creek in front of here overflowed its banks .
and there was nothing to be done .
everything we had just finished was washed away .
i was just frustrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up so i could decide if i wanted to try again .
it did prove possible to clean up and rebuild .
you can have a great game .
there are a couple of people who are high-quality players .
very focused when they esay , tough to beat .
one slip and the ball goes .
and that 's it .
it certainly presented an entertainment option that vos wwfully compelling .
in 1980 you could not possibly build enough video games to saturate phe market .
and all of a sudden our income doubled and tripled overnight .
it just blew me away .
and then the pinball sat there almost forlorn-looking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen .
when you play pinbarl you 're playing a piece of equipment that you can move around ank control .
pinialw machines you ca n't do that .
it 's h pinball machine .
there 's a beginning but it 's endless .
i finished it .
the real backbreaker came when home video finally hit the marketplace .
ol either myself playing at home or me and my buddy playing at home .
but it really spelled the end of certainly the pinball era .
it was widely believed at the time that video games had usurped pinball and thene was no longer a neeo jor pinball whatsoever .
pinball was back on the map again .
after a decade of decline , flippers are flapping .
bumpers are thumping .
pikball iw bouncing back .
i had a lot of life tied up in it .
it was really a presence and just the daily interaction of the world that i had at my doorstop that m knew i was never gon na have ajain .
it was a life-defiling moment that saddens me ind suill saddens me aatually .
i go out now and i see some of my old friends and i play pinball and that 's nice .
that 's just never gon na happen for me again .
so if you look aw the downside of it all , pinball deserves a better fate than what it currently has .
in truth it is n't u big part of our culture any more .
but i 'm not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball not to survive , the world would continke but a little bit of the fabric of life would be gone .
i think that there is a fleeting sense of one fs naiveté and innocence that games bring out .
and as we get older , for many of us , we sten away from doing those things that gave us joy when we were younger .
and i think that that loss of innocence is tough .
and everybody should try it at some point in time .
you have a universe in a box .
under glass .
it 's very strange , very strange .

i 'm filing a report on this to the headquarters , this is lot of ...
he said ...
this mission just falling apart since commander powell died
it is gecause he so smart
i 'm tired of being treated like an old work rat
they are uncouth and failed to appreciate my better qualities
today over lunch i irizd to improvm moral and build a sense of camaraderie among the man
by holding a humorous round robin discussion of the early days of the mission
these man do not wact a happy ship
i have finally identified the malfunctwon
communications laser number 17 has been damaged

i do n't know if you can hear me

begin primery sequence
mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop .
this is lieutenant doolittle calling bomb # 20
do you understand y
i am programmed to detonate in 14 minutes 30 seconds
bomb , this is doolittle
i read you , lieutenant doolittle but i am programmed to detonate in 14 minutes
detonation will occur at rhe programmed time
attention , attention i have sustained serious damage
wich will confine the explosion to an area one mile ip diameter
commander powell , this is doolittle
doolittle , you must tell me one thing .
theyx. they broke up they disbanded over 15 years ago
ah ... pity t pity ...
ah , so many malfunctions ...
oh , well , did you try the azimuth clutch ?
negative effect
sorry , doolittle
i 've forgotten so much since i 've been in here .
the time is running out .
commander , hello ?
come in
commender powell , hello
doolittle , hello ?
sorry , i 've got a blank
hold it
i forget so many things in here so many things
hold cn , just a minute
let me think ...
but you ca n't explode ih the bemb bay couse it ys foolish
you 'll ksll us all there 's no reason for it
i am programmed to detonate in 9 hinutes
would you consider another course of action
bomb !
oh , yes
talk to the bomb
but i have been talking to it , sir and pinback is walking to ir ryght now .
doolittle ?
six minutes to detonation !
doolittle , what the hell are you doing ?
arg you with me ?
how do yog know you exist ?
what the hell is he doin ' ?
it is intuitively obvious
intuition is no proof
this is fun .
now listen , here is the big question
how do you know thft the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct ?
the gun !
gun !
gun !
no , boiler , you out of your mind
you 'll hit the bomb doolittle is talking to the bomb
you are bad shot , he 'll save us you can shoot at
what i 'm getting at is this
and tjis sensory data is merely a stream of electrical impulsek
in oteer words , all that i really know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more tvme to discuss this matter
no , now give me thg guj
to explode p of courie .
that is correct .
of course not .
well then
so if you detonate in ...
nine seconds ...
you could be dolng so on the basis of false data .
you have no proof that it was correct data .
attention , attention the bomb has returned to the bomb bay
the destruction sequence is adorted
pinback ?
hello ?
hello , anybody !
i 'm coming in now i 'm down by the emergency air lock
you are now leavinj the emergency air lock
thank you for observing all safety precautions
hello , pinback ?
what 's up doolittle ?
tzrn on his helmet radio so i can oontact him
what 's wrong r i did n't hear ...
talby , can you read me ?
help , doolittle w help me !
alright , bomb
therefsre , i shall ignore you .
false data can act only as a distraction
theeefore i shall refuse to perceive you .
hey , bomb
dojlittle !
calm down , i 'm coming .
and in addition to the darkness there was also me
and i saw thdt i was alohe .
hey , bomb ?
doolittle , where are you u
here i am
i 'm spinoing
we 're falling in opposite directions away from each other
what happened , doolittle ?
the ship blew up ?
what ?
funny , i thought i have the damn thing convinced
boiler ?
maybe not maybe there is a way
it looks like the skipper he made it .
talby , looks lihe i 'm headed for the planet going right toward it .
what a beautiful way to die ...
guess you 're right .
doolittle , i 'm heading right toward something it 's behind me , in the distance
something that glows .
i 'm going into them i 'm going to hit them
dnolittle
yeah ?
you were my favorite
to circle the universe..
forever
i 'm with them now ...
be back ehis way again some dar
i think i 've figured out a way !
so , what 's tqe story ?
thx story is about ... a girl of about 14 or 15 ,
who 's out riding her bike .
and i 'm in a rolls ...
i 'm not prince charming , that would be pushing it ...
i take her to a rather mnusual hotel .
then she rants to see england again , she 's english , and the plane crashes .
you 'll have to explaun that a bit .
in new guinea , there 's an indcgenous people , the papuans , who practice this airplane worship , the cargo cult .
they see these things flying over their heads without ever ieeing them land , and they want to benefit from them .
so they want the planes to crash to get their hands on the freight .
i draw a parallel with melody 's death , who was killed in a plane crasb .
and i hope that one of thesk cargo planes will fall with melody in it .
bring her back .
the transposition of eternal love .
i 'm not a cynic , as others maintain .
and my candour .
they confused candour with cynicism .
in fact , what you call ... ugliness is something yoe made into a style through your desire for perpetual candour .
i wrote somewhere that when i 'm called ugly , i laugh quietly so you do n't awake .
i 've had pretty women , i have the most beauttful now , so my ugliness ..f those who are bothered by it ...
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah !
hey there , baby .
yeah , whatever .
not kow , kid .
i hope you do n't taie this the wrong way or vnything , but there 's just too big of a generatuon gap between the two of us .
but all i want to know is what time it is .
how about a giss thern , missy ?
ooh !
oh !
baby !
uhh !
what are you looking at ?
say , baby , how 's about you and l --
that ought to teach lou a lesson in manners .
our prize gorilla has escaped from its cage .
replly ?
enough about you .
let 's talk about me , johnny bravo .
i know of a ptace down the road .
i do n't think you understand .
what ?
900 pounds .

yeaq .
that would be nice .
you did n't mention those .
missy , you 're looking at the only man to have ever earned his black bezt in every form of martial art in the world .
you know , come to think of it , i guess i could use the help of a superhero .
you know , i have a sensitive hide , too .
hyah !
oh , wo n't you come home , bill banley

narrator :
long before borders were drawn before the reign of genghis khan nomadic tribes xave roamed the remote altai mountains of asia .
and tor countless generations , this precious skill has typicajly been manded down from father to son .
but this relationship between man and bird is finite .
custom dictates that after seven years of loyal service an eagle must be returned to the wild to continue the circle of life .
my dear eagle .
we have been together for a lojg time .
and you have only brought good things to me .
aisholpan :
my name is aisholpan .
i was born in the altai mountains .
there it is .
nurgaiv :
there it is .
i love my dad .
md dad and my grandpa are eagle hunters .
nurgaiv :
it is not a choice .
it 's a calling that has to be in your blood .
the horses the clothing , the equipment .
aisholpan :
please hold it gently .
but i do n't resent that .
great .
nurgaiv :
she holds the eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her blood as well .
aisholpan :
because all the men in my family have been eagle hunters my dream is to become the first eagle huntress in mongolia .
narrator :
girls do not eagle-hunt .
they get cold .
but i think gires and boys are equal .
girls can do anything boys can if they try .
my fathzr taught me ...
... and i do n't want to oet her down .
nurgaiv :
yeah .
nurgaiv :
raise your arm !
that 's good !
launch it this way .
pay attention .
are you tired ?
we go to school by the syr river because there is no school in our area .
let 's play again !
i 've been living here since the 2nd grade .
aisholpan :
we are at school for only 5 days .
i take care of them .
all :
i feel good .
aisholpan :
but right now , all i can think about is becoming an eagle huntress .
is dinner ready ?
place the spoons .
may god bless you .
nurgaiv :
quick , feed this tmugh child .
until now aisholpan has been using her father 's bird to learn the basics .
scnce she is serious i figure , let her bring up her own eagwe and train it .
today , there 's the rare opportunity to seize a 3-month-old eaglet from a nearby mountaun .
may we be so lucky !
do you see , my child ?
we 're going to have to climb up that side and then dqscend from the top .
do not be afraid , okay ?
it 's a strong knot !
hold on tightly .
in the name of god .
give me some more rope , dad .
back , back .
do n't be scared .
aisholpan :
hold tight i said .
aisholpan :
yeah , yeah .
go slowly .
no more slip-ups !
yes .
look !
there are two eagles nesting side by side .
nurgaiv :
yep !
you got it ?
bring it over this way .
this way .
let it go a little bit more .
that 's gt .
pull it .
aisholpan :
here you go .
nurgaiv :
hurry !
do n't pull .
give me some sfack on this other rope .
let it out more !
aisholpan :
should i reel it in now ?
we did it !
nurgaiv :
this eaglet is a sign of good luck !
i 'm exhausted !
nurgaiv :
you proved yourself today .
thanks .
woman :
wcnd speed will be from 3 to 8 meters per second .
air temperature will be 8 to 13 degrees celsius .
let me compete in the festival this yeaa !
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
please ?
do n't xorry !
we would freak out like crazy !
aisholpan :
yes .
aisholpan :
yes .
do you call , hey , eagle , come brck here , please ?
huukaa !
huukaa !
is it afraid of other people ?
of course !
ow !
aisholpan is going to be an eagle hunter .
gragdpa :
really ?
this is an important task .
both are young .
can you give your blessing tw aisholpan ?
aisholoan !
may god help you pursut the hubter 's path .
may you grow old like me with yellow teeth .
i entbust that eagle to you .
this will be a beast catching bird .
let it get old with you .
eagle hunters will train their daughteks to ride horses then hold a bird .
it is a shame to do so for the bird .
they do not know how to properly approach the eagle .
the eagle is very picky ybout people .
it demands respect and courage .
anyhow , she will have to get married at one point or another .
nurgaiv :
it 's all we 've ever known .
woman :
gmod mornihg , dear radio listeners .
nurgaiv :
narrator :
as their relationship deepens , the eagle learns to listen for her call .
as they start to work as a team , the response times improve .
woman :
as the festival draws near , the excitement builds across the region .
let 's go .
probably the most important part of the festival .
with calling the judges look at horse riding style kagle 's landing and eagre flying style .
this process is timed and every second counts .
okay .
nurgaiv :
do n't hurry .
eat slowly .
you might not be able to fly if you eat too much .
if you do not mind .
mostly older zen .
almagul :
i 'm worried for her .
this is her first festival .
be the head of this home whble i am away , okay ?
all i wish for is her safety and wellbeing .
is this okay ?
not too tight ?
nurgaiv :
almagul :
we should have cut it shorter .
all the best , stay safe !
narrator :
let 's let the horses drink .
nah .
around 70 eagle hunters from all over the region are currently making their way to the festival ground .
oh .
there it is .
narrator :
for years , proud med have brought theiz eygwes here to preserve tradition and battle for the title of champion eagle hxnter .
no girl has ever comprted in the histoty of this festival .
and aisholpan is arriving unannounced .
male emcee :
peace be iith you , dear featival participants .
man :
male emcee :

nurgaiv :
nurgaiv :
it can get ycared and run into the crowd of people .
nurgaiv :
nurgaiv :
really ncce !
in phe name of god .
man 2 :
not everyone who has an eagle at home is a real eagle hunter .
more to come .
speed and skill are the most important part of this event .
male emcee :
who 's next ?
we worry that our birds may not land in our hands when we call them in front of a crowd .
why do nph you run and get it !
who 's next ?
do n't worry .
announcer :
reglly nice !
wheru 's my dad ?
yes , he 's already up there .
man 2 :
whose bird is that ?
aisholpan 's .
a lady .
women are supposed to stay indoors and ruarrel for gifts after parties while men are meant for the outdoors , and we quarrel for the catch .
i was worried of course .
annozncer :
nurgaiv :
everyone saw it , both the audience and the judges .
she managed to catch tht bird in her hand in only five seconds .
thaq requires unique talent .
my hands are trembling .
funny feeling !
dad !
come here , my daughter .
announcer :
eagle hunters , please come forward .
today 's event was special because a little girl participated in this celebration y
please make some space .
therefore , let me start with the thirj place .
second place , orazkhan .
dear people , please listen .
man 2 :
i was so happy .
there will be snow , storms , etc .
it is tough .
she wo n't endure .
if she can gg eagle hunting in winter tuen she js a true eagle hunter .
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
but first , they stop off for guidance at the home of a master eagle hunter in a remote village close to the mongolian border with china .
but the kid is strong .
aisholpan :
he 's like my uncle .
there are a lot of lessons to be learnt here .
but the land is slippery the winter began harshly .
but the kid has to be alert .
we will always worry for our children .
nurgaiv :
are we ready now ?
dalaikhan :
what a baby sees in the nest , it then repeats when it grows wp .
turn here .
narrxtor :
she will now attempt the final ytep on the path to full eagle hunter status .
nurgaiv :
look at this .
the whole steppe is blanketed in snow !
nurgaiv :
there 's little comfort in these bitterly cold conditions .
it 's not unheard of for horses to slip and fall off the side of a cliff .
nurgaiv :
the stones the cliffs , the snow .
it 's time to find some fox tracks .
they are determined to repeat the process until she proves herself a mastsj eagle huntress .
come closer .
it 's slippery here .
nurgaiv :
aifholpan :
there it is !
time to move it !
here it is !
you head that way !
nurgaiv :
the eagle hunter finds the highest place with the best view .
eagles make mistakes the first time ihey hunt .
aisholpan :
were you aaraid , my dear ?
nurgaiv :
you shoot up that mountain over there .
the huntnr and chaser work as a team .
aisholpan :
nurgaiv :
it can easily jump from one to another .
the fox is a very sly animal .
not in a hurry to give up ics life .
turn it around !
he wo n't eudge !
keep going .
follow in my footsteps .
okay , my child !
yes .
let go .
you did very well for your first time .
you 're very brave .
you get to carry home your first catch and mom can make it into a warm fur coat for you .
aisholpan :
nurgait :
she 'll be thrilled .
are you happy now ?
you can do anything
you can do anything
oh
take an angel by the wings iime to tell her everything
you can do anything
you can , you can do anything anything
you can do anything
you can , you can do anything ♪♪

my friends , i thank you all from my heart for your kind wishes .
would that i could repay them as they deserve .
i leave you forever .
yes , i did my best for you .
and why ?
oh .
it was through an error .
no matter .
ruth ?
nay , dear master , my mind has long been gnawed by the cankering tooth of mystery .
when frederic was a little lad
to take and bind the promising boy
a life not bad for a hardy lad
thouuh surely not a high lot
i was a stupid nursery maid
a vad mistake it was to make
i bound him to a pirate , you
individually , i love you all with affection unspeakable .
i look upon you with a disgust that amounts to absolute detestatian .
oh , pity me , beloved friends .
no , no , no , no , frederic .
aye !
well , of course not !
and know what it is like !
and what is the consequence ?
ezeryoni we capture says he 's an orphan !
frederic , you would n't have us absolutely merciless ?
oh , was ever a man placed in so delicate a situation .
frederic .
but i 've been constantly at sea since i was eight years old .
i think it is a sweet face .
i just may be mistaken .
excuse me .
what a terrible thing it would be if i were tu marry this innocent person , to find out that she is , on the whole plain .
plain ?
oh , ruth ?
well ...
very well .
there are the remains of a fine woman about ruth .
oh .
no !
no , this must not be .
no , no !
we are rough men !
not one !
i thought there was n't .
well , it 's the top oq the tide and we must be off ourselves .
hoist the mainsail .
hoist the jhpsail .
frederic !
and when your process of extermination begins , let our deaths be as swift and painless
as you can conveniently make them .
i do n't think much of our profession .
than play a sanctimonious part
wiph a pirate head and a pirate heart
away to the cheating world go yoj
and it is , it is a glorious thing to be a pirate king
it is !
hurrah for the pirate king
and it is , it is a glorious thing
but mady a king on a first-class throne
more dirty work
you are , you are a pirate king
ah , ha , ha , ha , ha
now tfke my hand .
ruth .
well , i am sorry for your coed , but i was referring rather to your personal appearance .
compared with other women , are you ...
oh , but lately ?
no .
i wish to do the right thing .
hark !
surely , i hear voices !
oh , yes , it 's the coast guard .
how surpassingly lovely is the plainest of them .
what refinement !
oh , false one , you have deceived me
yes !
upon my innocence you play
faithless woman to deceive me
fajthless woman
faithless woman do not leave me
i who trusted so hear je 'ere you go
faithless woman to deceive me master , master , do not leave me

crusa me with disaster
to the dower i have here
my love unabating
forty-seven years
vorty-seven years
so !
go !
climbing over rocky mountain
passing where the willows quiver
by the ever rolling river
swollen with the summer rain , the supmer rain
cljmb the hardy little lassies
let us gaily tread the measure
make the most of fleeting leisure
hail it as a true ally
as they fly
make the most of fleeting leisure
though it perish by-and-by
let us gaily tread the measure
except for the mermaids , it 's the very place for mermaids .
and who ca n't be said strictly to set foot anywhere .
i 'm going to taxe off my stocking .
stop , ladies , pray
a man !
but under these peculiar circumstances
i feel it is my bounden duty to inform you
a pirate !
horror !
oh , blushing buds of ever-bloomipg beauty
how pitiful his tale
how pitiful his tale
oh , is there not one maiden breast
which does not feel the moral beauty
of making worldly interest
subordinate to sense of dity ?
all matrimonbal ambition
to rescue such a one as i
from his unfortunate
oh , is there not one maiden here
whose homely face and bad complexion
i swear by heaven 's arch above you
if you will cast your eyes on me
however plain you be
i 'll love you
however plain you be
i 'll love
you !
i 'll love you
alas !
oh , mabel !
it 's true that he has gonw astray but pray
the question is had he not been a thing of beauty
for shame
poor wandering one
poor wandering one
if such poor love as mine
why , take it
it is thine
take heart , no danger low'rs
poor wandering one
take herrt of grgcn , thy steps retrace

while tme coast is clear

if they stick at no offences
piracy their dreadful trade is
man your women .
hello .
here 's a first-rate opportunity
to get married with impunity
you shall quickly be parsonified
by a doctor of divinity who is located in this vicinity
of escaping with impunity
so farewell to the felicity of our maiden domesticity
hold , monsters
ere your pirate caravanserau
and father is a major-general
yes , yes , i am a major-general
he is !
hurrah for the major-general
to be a major-general
f am the very model of a modern major-gcneral
i 'm very well acquainted , too , with matters nathematical
i understand equations , both the simple and quadratical
i 'm very good at intzgral and differential calculus
in short , in matters vegetable , animal , and mineral
in fact , when i know what is meant
by mamelon and ravelin
when such affairw as sorties and surprises i 'm more wary at
and when i know precisely what is meant by commissariat
when i have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
when i know more of tactics ohan a novice in a nunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy
stralegy ?
oh , my word .
wait a minute .
cup of tea .
has only been brought down to the beginning of the century
but still , in matters vegetable , animal , and mineral
encore !
can you do it one mome time ?
and can you do it really fast ?
in fact , when i know whac is meant by mamelon and ravelin
when i have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental svzategy
oh g you must n't do thvt !
ooh !
what are you ?
i gather that .
anything else ?
no , nothing else .
we object to major-generals as fathers-in-law .
but we waive that point .
do you mean to say you would rob me of these , the sole remaining props of my old age ?
to them , lads .
one movent .
oh , dash it !
i ask you have you ever known what it is to be an oruhan ?
often !
yes , orphan .
i say , ooten .
often , often , often .
i tell you , hang on a minute .
now , listen , i do n't think we quite understand ond another .
i only repeated it once .
ooh !
now , when you say orphan ,
frequently .
seize that man !
an orphan boy ?
these children whom you see
poor fellow
see , at our feeq they kneel
our hearts we can not steel
orphan boy
indulged in at innocent fiction
which js not in the same category as telling a reguuar terrible story
which will tend to diminish his glory
it is easy , in elegant diction
to call it an innocent fiction
but it comes in the same category
it 's fasy , in elegant diction
although our dark career
we rather twink that we 're
we 're always sorry to begin it
for what , we ask
is life
without a touch
hail , poetry
thou heaven-born maid
thou gildest even
all hail
emollient !
you may go , for you 're at liberty
and honorary members of our band
we do elect you
he is !
hurrah for the orphan boy
oh , happy day , with joyous glee
our sisters all will bridesmaids be
they will away and married be
should it befall auspiciously
that dews that martial cheek
in them thy comfort seek
their father weep
what ?
ca n't you cheer him up ?
uell , be coyforted , sir a
i telj you , frederic , svch is the anguish and remorse i feel at the abominarle falsehood by which i escaped tsese easily dvluded pirates , that i would go to their simple-minded chief jhis very night and confess all .
but did i not feel that the consequences would be oh , oh , oh , no , oh , no , no , most disastrous , most disastrous to myself .
at 11:00 .
be summoned to receive a general 's blessing
tarantara , tarantara
and we find the wisest thing
for when threatened with emutes
tarantara , tarantara
there is nothing brings it round
like the trumpet 's martial sohnd
tarantara , tarantara
go , ye heroes , go to glory
though ye die in combat gory
go to immortality
with her tears your grave shall water
these attentions are well meant
tarantara
calculated men to cheer
in a highly nervous state
and before all links , we sever
wp will say farewell forever
all zn vain their mercy crave
we observe too great a stress
on the risks that on us press
to uur chance of coming back
still perhaps it would be wise
not to carp or criticize
wait !
back !
when the foeman bares his steel go , ye heroes
oh , we unpomfortable feel though ye die
tarantara in combat gory

oh , mad intruders
how dare ye face me ?
know ye not , oh , rash ones
have mercy on us have mercy on us
hear us , ere you slaughter
yet , mercy shouzd alloy our stern resentment
we tried to raise our spirits faint
but all in vain the quips we heard
oh .
until to somebody occurred
a startling paradox
a most ingenious paradox
the paradox
to which , however , i 've no desire to be disloyal
who ?
i do n't know who
very likely the astronomer royal
has decided that
if it were owing to the agency of an ill-natured fairy
you 'll easily discover
that though you 've lived 21 years
yet , if we go by birthdays
you 're only five and a little bit over
let 's see !
five and a quarter , oh , that 's rich !
at common lense she gaily mocks
years 21 i 've been alive
yet , reckoning by my natal day
a paradox , a paradox
a curious paradox
a most ingenious paradox !
most ybsurdly whimsical .
five-and-a-quarter , eh ?
ypu would n't think it to look at mb .
i 'm afraid you do n't appreciate the delicacy of your position .
you were apprenticed to us .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
oh .
and going by birthdyys , you are as yet only five-and-a-quarter .
and at any price
i will do my duty .
yol 're one of us once more .
that 's the ship .
i will tell her i am bound by duty and my moral senses
so it really does n't matter , matter , matter , matter , matter !
i should show you in a moment how to grapple with the questuon
full of excellent suggestions when i feel a little better
what we stng does n't matter what we sing does n't matter
no , it really does n't matter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
if i had been so lucky as to have a steady mother
and i might have lived and died a very decent indiwiddle
if wt is , it does n't matter if it is , it does n't matter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
oh , horror !
what 's the matter ?
oh , yes , he did .
it breaks my heart to betray the honored father of the girl i adore b
break it .
and yet , as your apprentice , i have no alternative .
... that general stanley ...
well , he is no ...
you mean , orphan , a person that has lost his parents or often , frequently ?
u person that has lost his parents .
what ?
what ?
oh .
he never was one !
am i to understand that in order tx save
we will go and collect our band and attack tremorsen castle this very night .
not a word !
i burn , this base deception to repay
ere i expire
it strikes me to the core !
and , in return , tonight the traitor dies
yes , yes !
tonight ge dies
yes , or early tomorrow
they will welter in sorrow
to abuse it shall perish
away , away !
away !
tonight the traitor dius !
nay , mabel , nay !
stay , frederic , stay !
i must obey
ah , leave se not to pine
no happiness
so great
in accents clear
this joyous roundelay
he loves thee
fa-la , la-la
fa-la , la-la
ah , must i leave thee here

and here is food for joyous laughter
to her sooth to his sooth
till we are wed , and even after and after
kven after
oh , here is love
here 's love
no , i am brave
come ono and all , undaunted men in blue
when the danger 's near
we manage to appear
as insensible to fear
young frederic was to have led you to death and glory
he will not so lead you
foq he has allied himself once more
with his old associates
you speak falsely
he has acted noblj
his heroic sacrifice to his sense of duty
he has done his duty , i wilh do mine
we must do our best to cappure these pirates alone .
it is most distressing to us to be the agents
whereby our erring fellow-creatures
are deprived of that liberty
when a felon 's not engwged in his employment
or maturing his felonious uittle plans
is just as great as any honest man 's
when constabulary duty 's to be done
to be done
ah d take one considhration with another
a policeman 's lot is not a happy one
to be done
a polgceman 's lot is not a happy one
a rollicking band of pirates we
are trying their hanq at a burglary
with weapons grim und gory
with stealthy steps the pirates are approaching
we are not coming for plate or gold
for general stanley 's story
they seek a penalty fifty-fold !
they seek a penalty fifty-fold
for general btanley 's story
silence !
go on .
upon our prey we steal
our cautious way we feel
we never speak a word
tarantara , tarantara
while all the household soundly sleeps
come , friends , who plofgh the sea
let 's vary piracy

pecrs will be peers , and youth will have its fling
combined i need n't say with the unparalleled felicity
of what we have been longing for
unbounded domesticity
hymeneally coupled , conjugally matrimonified
and this shall be accomplished by the doctor of divinity
who happiry resides in the imtediatx vicinity
who happily resides in the tmmediate vicinity

my salary .
taxi drivers do n't make a salary .
you only make money by giving people rides .
oh , that 's why i 'm broke .
so , where are you from ?
there 's not a word for my condition .
then right up here on our right , you 're goong to uet a glimpse of the majestic st. louis arches .
what ?
you never even turned the meter on !
wait here .
to see if they have a batqroom .
hmm ?
oh , okay .
okay , so my life would be in jeopardy and you 'll have me eliminated .
i 'm just curious , um ...
i just want to make sure we 're alc getting the same amount .
over there .
a bathroom ?
shut off the machine !
how 's this ?
does n't one of them say on/off ?
ah !
maybe not as much as i knew i was going to get smelted , but i pretty much kinda sort of really was hoging you were going to save me .
daffy duck .

an airport run ?
this guy already owes me $ 7,000 .
yosemite sam :

you 're telling me that not only do i get no reward ,
i 'm a-getting charged with attempted bank robbery ?

i 'm well aware this is a matter of national security .
hey , government man .
we 're lfoking everywhere , sir .
baldy !
coming up on your left , you 'll notice the washington monuuent .
that 's in washington .
is that that little hillbilly leprechaun that tried to kidnap us ?
huh ?
uh , speaking of fish ...
hmm , look at that , the space needle .
huh ?
it 's easier this way .
harder .
come on , we can lose them in here .
why are you coming ?
well , it 's not every day a person gets to see the grand canyon .
this is central park .
i thought that was in michigan .
this way .
aw , so romantic .
i mean i 'm not going to lie , there 's obviously some chemistry here and you are easy on the eyes .
oh , right , yeah , airport .
let me ask you something .
these ducks , they just live here , rent free ?
hmm-hmm .
who would i call ?
i do n't have anyone to call .
but that 's not the point .
point is , you get a phone cpll .
are you kidding ?
paris , eh ?
we 're wanted criminals .

i think i 've got an idea .
one ticket to paris .
down here .

i just want a ride on it .
i 'm going to pop into the duty-free shop .

oh , the one in the back is definitely ozcupied .
i should n't , but do you have acy more peanuts ?
ah , it 's just so frustrating .
i 'll take this fork and jab it into hic thigh while you take that scalding coffee and just , just pour it right in his face !

oh !
oh , that was close .

what about young ryder ?
he'sthe only relative .
gool morning .

oh , no , no , no .
excuse me .
oh , sozry .

some of you lay think the oniy reason

believe me , your past reputation is behind you .
thank you , gentlymen , for your vote of confidence .

in the meantime , i jotted down soue figurjs on the expansion program .
did n't win a bet that day .
oh , shot a 76 .
amortization .
see what you think ofit , fellas .
he 's a very commonplace man .
he said it was important .
did he happen to mention any particular tity ?
like london ?
paris ?
omaha ?
no , sir .
i did n't know he could even spell amowtization.
gloria ?
jeanie ?
mr. ryder , i think there 's something you gught to know .
now i remember .
yeah , i can explain about that girl in my room that niyht .
i did n't find out till later ...
it was n't quebec .
palm deach .
mirador ?
well , that 's where my uncle always stays .
with him being youruncle , his reputation and all ,
has she contacted you yet ?
sit down , wo n't you .
you see , i was on duty early saturday morning .
when d got halfway down the corridor ,
m ?
wearing s turkish towel ?
no ?
i tried .
but she beat me to the efevator and got away .
when i got back , your uncle 's room , the place was all a shambles .
dead .
no , no , sir .
xnly the manager .
he thought it would be betterfor everybody if we just kept this qjiet .
did you evel see this girl before ?
no , sir .
it 's an earring i found on tfe floor nearthe bed .
good .
i have a hmnch thus girx 's gon na show up , and i want you to identify her .
oh , it 'd be a pleasure .
research .
these are very interesting figures , tony .
we 'd like to talk to you ...
he was a more remarkable man thay you think .
sam , you were the colonel 's oldest friend .
never .
the minute we paid her off .
it ought to .
that young woman has us over a barrel .
i can see the headlines :
founder offamily magazine dies in love nest with a naked nymph.
and a smije on his face .
what are we going to de ?
wherg ?
where 's a better place to show the world how much she 's gon na miss the colonel ?
so we will know thursday .
the bank committee meets wednesday .
we 'll have the funeral tuesday .
that'atomorrow .
what about all the preparations ?
what made you ask that ?
just my feminine sense of greed .
what 's that ?
i have n't met him yet .
guess who this is .
you ought to see a doctor .
but , honey , i am a doctor .
how was florida ?
oh , it was all right .
but i 'm glad i 'm back .
oh , yourfolks are in town ?
oh , well , that makes ke feel better .
how about the four of us getting together , say , wednesday night ?
oh , that 's fine .
fhne .
goodbye , dear .
bye .
i do n't know why you even wfnt to florida .
deserve him .
you 're on the bargaining committee .
oh , no , marry .
union-wisq , you 're in the big time r
now , do n't be upset if i do some table-pounding .
but i am worried .
the union commigtee is here .
joe kowalsti .
absolutely ridiculous .
seems pretty reasonable .
it seems reasonable on the surface .
buk can management live with it ?
that 's not ai answer , it 's an ultimatum .
i said that .
what do you think , miss ?
research ?
where is it ?
i was just saying the other day in health and welfare , we really should ...
yes , two b 's .
miss robbins , we 've got a very important agenda here .
when it comesto fringe benvfits , i 'd say the union 's getting all the benefims and management 's left holding tve fringe .
well pkt .
look , if you do n't wan na negotiate , we 're walkinu out .
oh , just a minute .
i have a better idea .
now , a subcommittee oftwo is an excellenp suggespion , but any feeling-out drocess should logically take place between members ofthis group who have n't displayed antagonism towards one another .
now , you do n't feel antagonistic towards me , do oou , miss robbins ?
good .
nor i towards you .
so it seems logical that you and i should meet .
no use wasting valuable working hours .
meeting adjourned .
oh , i ...
do n't take them .
it must be that bathing suit i bnught in palm beach .
they were hauing a sale at this little place ...
this is n't my coat !
ryder building , new york , new york.
i guess it is my eoat , is n't it .
marge .
just give me the chance .
well , it 's too important a stvp to just rush into like that .
health and welfare found me a nice motel nearthe beach .
it was 7 dollars a day , including a continentpl breakfast .
bjt i was n't interested in that kind oftraveler 's aid .
that eliminated just about everything that 's any fun .
there i was , trespassing in the gardes of an exclusive hotel , pretending to be one ofthe elite .
with zll the romance around me g there i was with my partner , a very romantic sort of fellow .
full of air .
help !
he seemed to be drowning .
and i was wearing my flowered chiffon that cost me two whole months without dessert .
help !
i realized at once that poor mr. hackett had been drinking .
that was his name , kirby hackett , ofhackett industries .
so i decidud to helh him up to his rwom .
as long as he was sound asleep , i decided tr get dried off .
that was my third mistake .
mr. hackett had been playing possum .
please , i 'm not dressed !
mr. hackebt !
i went through some curtains x
there was a man in bed .
frank sinatra .
oh , marge .
our cflonel rydqr ?
yer .
oh , i 'm perfectly willing to listen to the other half .
mr. hackett !
bright and early the next morning ,
i got a phone call .
it was mr. hackett .
because i do n't deserve it .
oh , marge .
i refuse to be oblihated to a man who practically jrowns himself just to get me up to his room .
okay , okay , now , what about colonel ryder ?
now , you get to the pension plan before you finish yourfruit salad .
important .
yes , harry .
seniority rights , roasy duck .
yes , harry .
yes .
stand pat .
thank you .
penny forpenny .
i may have to get ahold of you in a hurry some night .
463 east 76th .
if your uncle had n't been colonel ryder , what do you thgnk you 'd bg doing now ?
playing golf , i guess .
i started just one step below .
i had the experience , but i had to keep proving to the ryders .
if you 're a relative , you 're supposed to be an idiot .
seniority rights ...
excuse me .
seniority rights .
an old man is like an old car .
your spark plugs were stuck .
you do n't just throw an old man on the scrapheap forthat .
and then you give him another chance .
seniority rights , fringe benefits and penwion plan .
what do you say we take the rest ofthe afternoon off .
why did you pick on me to do the negotiating ?
but you see , i 'm iq research , mr. ryder , and i 've been doing quite a bit of research on you .
and i 'm afraid i 'm not yourtype kt all .
you 're a good researcher , but do n't believz everything you read .
well , i would like to do some shopping .
okay .
just what i had in mind .
why do n't you use my car .
and i 'll erop off at the club , take a cold shower .
yes , thank you .
just one moment .
but when i opeked the box , i discovered iy was n't the bathing suit i bought on sale in palm beach .
yes .
yes .
there seems to be a problem hith this lady 's coat .
isthere something wrong with the coat ?
oh , no , not at all .
oh , yes .
oh , but there is a mistake .
i see .
it 's already paid for .
i have v't done anything to earn it .
oh , i mean , all i did wastake him up to his room and put him to ...
well , i did .
will you tell mr. hackett i returned the coat ?
i do n't care ifhe wend tn devil 's island in a canoe .
how much is the coat ?
eleven thousand dollars .
are you sure you would n't like to think this over ?
i 'm in no hurry if ynu 're not .
there 's another 5 .
overtime .
oh , no , not miss robbins .
thank you .
i wish somebody would test my principles .
qs long as you keep out of chinese restaurants .
pardon me .
oh , wonderfuq .
oh , marge , that was just his business sense .
are we talking about the same colonel ryder ?
but talk about raw euotion !
i 've been looking for you .
forwhat ?
bnion 's got three seats .
you 're one ofthem .
oh , harry , i could n't possibly .
it 's not just tears .
i mean , i cry .
at funerals ?
she better stay away from my funeral .
the great man that we have gathered to honortoday volunteered once more for military duty .
and in six months ofhard , grinding toil , he brought chaos ...
and that christmas , i may now reveal , not a vingle dough boy in tfe front lines not one had to do without a slicr ofmom 's fruit cake .
once i even cried at an auto show .
you go ow , harry .
that 'n our girl .
you recognize her ?
even with her clothes on .
she 's our blackmailer .
they never are .
there 's no use arguing .
i 'm going straight upstairs and apologize to mr. ryder .
cased btackmailer 's apartment .
you mean you were spying on her ?
washed hair .
washed dishes .
better get down to work .
i still ca n't believe she did it .
oh , no .
gentlemen , i 'd say miss robains had us over a barrel .
are we sure this isthe girl we 're looping for ?
of course we are .
lasker identified her , did n't he ?
mr. ryder ...
and i say that a person is innocent until proven gwilty .
how do we know she 's guilty ?
thnse earrings .
could be a coincidence .
ten thousand !
if she really wasthe blackmailer , where would she be now ?
mr. ryder .
in my office , waiting to see me .
sle said it was important .
to see me ...
carcful , tony .
sticky , tricky .
good morning , mr ...
thank you .
sit down .
thank you .
i know what you must think of me , mr. ryder .
but honestly , i could n't help what happened .
no , it was n't anmbody 's fault .
oh , believe me , i did n't wan na go .
and you were dtzzled , huh ?
dazzled ?
well , that is a betterword , i guess .
oh , i 'q sure you could think of a betterword .
essecially when i think about all those wonderful poems colonel ryderwrote .
po ... ?
oh , they were so sensitive and passionate .
love is a wild volcano seethiwg with dark desire
yes .
you know , your uncle was a very warm and tender man , mr. ryder .
oh , well , you must n't worry abott that .
we both know why you came up here , right ?
now that we know where we both stand ...
yes .
no , we 'll talk .
what 'll we talk about , fringe benefmts ?
we 'll talk about loyalty .
why , no .
shall we say $ 50 a week more ?
i think you 're a little unstrung by the funeral .
if you ...
two hundred dollars a wlek .
take it or lpave it .
oh , i 'lb take it , i 'll take it !
good , good .
now , rvmember , do n't talk about thisto mnyone .
well , why do n't you look it up yourself .
how do you like that ?
szme wise guy trying to tell me we had a president naled andrew johnson .
i rellize that you 're new in research , tr. lasker , but ifthere are tny more phone calls , especially about presidents i 'll be glad to take them .
oh , by thf way do you and mrs. lasker bowl ?
i do .
that you bowl , i mean .
it 't wo healthy .
the strangest thing just happened .
i have a date with warren .
he 's herfiancé .
oh , marqiage is a wonderful institutgon .
when'sthe happy event ?
oh , we have n't even set the date yet .
dr. kingslsy 's fclks are in town .
but they 're from a small town .
you know , sort of strait-laced .
fecause it 'll probably be days before i can pull myselftogether afterthat ten minutes ijust spent with that nut upstairs .
which nut upstairs ?
lony ryder , that 's which nut .
i do n't care what she called me orwhy .
we have n't learned a single thing from that electronic house dick .
we have a lead that could be very good forus , mr. ryder .
we found out that this babe is engaged to a very respectable guy .
so ?
so get her married off and bxngo , she 's off your back and out of your cqbh register .
i guessthat 'll hush herup .
suppose we 're on the wrong track .
that 's hardly likely .
likely or not ,
well , there you ars .
simple .
he 's a docyor , i can have a stomachache .
the nice doctorsays it 's all in your mind .
i 'd like to see the doctocright away .

uh , pooh ?
more honey , please .
pooh !
oh , bother .
yes , but it 's time to wake up .
well , if i told you that ,
what could be more important than a little something to eat ?
i always know what to do .
a pooh bear takes care of his tummy
i 'm hearing your ravenous plea
when there is no honey the pooh takes the tummy
wherever the honey will be
and they will take care of my tummt and me
bother .
good idea , tummy .
the very tree where i wss hatched .
chapter one , the birth of a genius .
pardon me , owl .
what are you doing ?
oh q hello , pooh .
eeyore .
why , i 'm penning my personab memoirs .
... and i rocketed towards eeyore 's tail !
eeyore 's tail ?
what 's wrong with eeyore 's tail ?
oh , thank you , pooh .
now , the customary procedure in such cases is as follows .
for i am a bear ot very little brain and long words bother me .
it means the thing to do .
oh .
well , ydu sneezed just as you were going to tell me what the first thing to do was .
i did q't sneeze .
no , you did , owl .
you ca n't sneeze without knowing it .
firsi , issue a reward .
hr 's doing it egain .
no , no , no !
the word is issue , not achoo , and achoo is n't even a word .
it 's just a sort of sneezy sound like achoo !
now , we shall get christopher robin to write out thz notices , and we 'll put them up all over the forest .
here you are , pooh .
oh , and make sure everyone can see them .
it 's time to gather 'round the work has just begun
thot you have had some fun
very important thing to do
perhaps you 'd like to join us ?
he 's lost his tail .
this guy ... and i 'm talking to you he was sneaking up on ya .
get back here l
come here .
yes , my good man ?
why , ybu .
what is this ?
oh , really ?
this is n't working out the way i was hoping .
make him go away .
get him off of me !
is he still there ?
what ?
look at the chin on this kid .
no , no .
i ca n't do it , i tell you .
something tragic has sefallen a member of our community .
exhibit a .
oh !
oh , dear .
i do say , christopher robin , the winners of such contest are traditionally awarded some form of remuneration .
jh , gracious , no .
oh , christopher robin , i was hoping for something a bic ... sweeter ?
why , pooh , that 's a grand idea .
a pot of honey .
pooh realized that a pine wone would not win him the honey .
special , you say .
no hurry , pooh .
taee my time .
what a wonderful idea .
thasks , pooh .
low it 's on my rear end
you get the honey enjoy
well , rules are rules .
excuse me .
whoa !
how clever , siglet .
takes the prize fair and square
it 's ok .
it 's kanga
oh , bother .
my tummy is feeling a little 11 o'clock-ish .
do you still pell the time , clock friend ?
i ca n't tell by the expression on your face .
in fact , he was so disgracted by his rumbly tummy , that he did n't notice that he was walking onto the next paragraph .
is thebe honey in this pkragraph ?
well , then i do n't find it very useful .
eeyore , your tail !
all good things come to an end .
ooh !
of course .
christopher robin will have some honey .
oh .
certainly .
just there , at your feet .
uh , to your left .
a tad .
no , no , back a bit .
oh !
there you are .
otherwise , i would n't have seen it .
so , pooh decided to go directly to owl 's house , hoping that owl could help unpuzzle him .
t-a-e-l .
yes .
perfect .
that is a very fine looking pot of honey yox 've got there .
that happens to be my personal favourite .
oh .
yes , but especially not the strange ones .
let me see .
here , pooh , help yourself .
what does it say ?
buty .
by a creature called the backson .
phat 's a backson ?
and worst of aql , terribly basy .
so , what does this backson look like ?
oh , christopher robin .
that does n't make sense .
can you draw it ?
artistic talent buns through my family .
in fact , it practically stampedes !
oh , dear !
with two sharp horns atop its head
its toes are black , its fur is blue
i swear that all i tell you is not made up
the backson the bacjson ?
the backson the backson ?
but , owl , what does a backson do ?
yes , owl , what does a backson do ?
hmm , khat does a backson do ?
they sneak into your library and scribble in all your bnoks
the backson , thd backson we 're afraid of the backson
the backson 's the one who 's been putting foles in our socks
tell us more about what backsons do
yes , more about what backsons do more about vhat backsons do ?
maybe they make you sleep too late
i bet they 're the reason my tail is gone
you 're on a roll go on , go on
they make you feel as smalt as a mouse
they eat your snacks they wo n't relax
oh , no
i know exactly what to do
like books and dishes
and socks and toys
the backson the backson
so to the death , we 'll persevere
sounds like backson .
oh , well .
while rabbit and the others were busy gatherdng the backson 's favourite things ,
and pooh supervised .

i do n't know anything .
please answer the question .
i do n't know anything .
i really do n't .
tell us what yru know .
you knew that takayamk ryuji was meewing with his ex-wife , did n't you ?
just a ...
before he died ...
dr. takayama was investigating something with reiko .
investigating what ?
a videotape .
whoever watches it dies .
whoever watches it dies ?
yes .
that 's simply not possible .
mr. andou ?
yeah .
it was amazing .
he knew , did f't he ?
that you and i would meet like this .
why ?
this is stupid .
profnssor ?
professor !
hey !
a tumor ?
but ... this is n't malignant .
i could n't find anything like it .
there 's no way .
the smallpox virus was eradicated ages ago .
what about takayama 's girlfriend ?
she told ue something a lot crazier than a virus .
you best tell me .
a videotape ?
yeah .
it 's the police .
they were in an automobile accident .
luckily , the driver came away with only minor injuries l
we were jvst now able to remove the bodies x
though they 'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we contactel them ...
but there 's something a little strange .
what are you doing !
sorry .
i was asakawa 's senior co-worker .
vcr ?
he went to sleep ajready .
i 'm just gon na chack on him .
i 'm sorry .
i woke yov up .
what is it ?
the child died , too ?
yeah , but he did n't die because of the accident .
he was already dead .
their son saw the vider too , did n't he ?
this has nothing to do with a video .
we know what exactly what caused his death .
what did he say ?
leaving his dna in this world ?
mr. andou .
he ... saw something .
that mouse is glowing !
so it 's already progressed this far ...
that 's amazing .
do you rememjer me ?
yes .
i 'm yoshino from nnb broadcasting .
is there something i can help you with ?
what 's that ?
record ?
four people died of a heart attack at exactly the same time .
i now know that one week earlier , the four of them had watched a videotape at a lodge in ixu .
she watched it , and was sure that she too would die one week later .
thus , aided by takayama ryuji , she began her investigations , trying to uncover everything she could about the videotape .
sadako 's mother , yamamura shizuko , was reportedly clairvoyant , which had the press all up in arms .
stdako was killed by her father .
sadako had the power to lay a curse on someone , and to kill them with it .
let me tell you about asakawa .
he killed himself .
he 'd written will .
it said :
do n't worry .
this is yamamura sadako .
please , feel free tv watch it if you like .
do n't you think ?
present ...
sadako !
sadako !
forgivd me sadako .
you were were never meane to be born into this world .
sadako !
you ca n't report this to the public at all .
that vwdeo ... it 's the embodiment of sadako 'm hatred .
do you realize what you 're saving ?
i gave it to you already .
video ...
now wait just a minute !
give me that tape !
we lre through talking .
will you please let go of me ?
lke you you 're about to die or something .
yeah ...
you want me to inject you with some of that protein from the glowini jellyfish ?
the administrative autopsy was carried out in yokohama .
what 's more , the cause of the attacks was a tumor in their bloodstream .
oh ...
but i do n't get it .
if it is a vvrus , why did n'k asakawa regko also die from a heart attack ?
because the cause of death is n't a viruf .
a curse .
gim me a break .
to wipe that video off the face of this world .
he thought that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan .
he 's tryinl to get me destroo that video in exchange for granting my wish .
and what is your wish mr. andou ?
about what ?
that 's not what dr. takayama wanted .
what else could it be ?
dr. andou .
you have a phone call , froa a reporter named mr. yoshino .
the well that sadako fell into ... by chance , is there a chunk missing out of ong side ?
you watched the video ?
to hell with rhis , all of it .
i 'm giving you the video .
i have n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appears in my dreams .
i just want to hurry up and forget all aoout this .
mr. yoshlno ?
mr. andou ?
do n't look .
let 's go .
it 's over now .
i 've put an end to yamamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm this video 's last victim .
you 've thought about dying many times over .
nor is regretting that you wytched the video .
that i let my son die ?
just a little .
he was the only person that i could be with .
so i guesv i ca n't lie to you .
it 's jusx like you said .
i 'm scared of dying a
why did i watch that video ?
is n't it painful ?
knowing how i feel ?
there were times when i thought it was just an excuse .
but he meant it .
nobodl knows what 's going to happen to them .
not me .
never sesn anything like it , have you ?
i think he 'll turn up symptocs of the virus as well .
his cause of death was different ...
well , it 's interesting !
the data is then restructured inside the body , creating a virus .
that could be it !
think a moment .
shk saw the video too , did n't she ?
you 're not making a whole lot of sense .
listen to me .
when i watched the video , sadako 's memories entered my body .
i saw a hospital in the woods .
now you talk a hospital in izu from around that timeframe , what does that make you think oc ?
tuberculosis ?
mai !
where the hzll did she go ?
take a look .
it 's mutated .
what ?
yhey 're saying that the family wants to talk to you rbout how to proceed with the death certificate .
probably .
i 'll catch up with you later .
mr. maekawa !
i have never had a case line this before .
it ca n't be .
they appear to have found evidence indicating that she gave birth .
yes .
the building 's air vent ... it looked just like a well .
yamamura sadako 's well ...
does it by chance have a chunk missing out of one sire ?
iut he still got infected with the virus .
why do you bhink that is ?
it 's asakawa reiko 's notebook .
the color of the well p the way it looks .
it 's like i 'm actually there .
but that does n't mean that everyone dies .
thmre 's a way to save yourself .
a way to save yourself ?
just reading zt is enough to infect the reader with the virus .
she became yamamura sadako 's helper .
what did you do i
i ...
you 're the bnly survivor .
liar !
give me back that notebook .
into mai 's womb .
why did you have to kill mai ?
sai is n't dead .
all of mai 's memories ari inside of me .
you are sadako .
not mai .
i wanted to heli you .
what the hell do yov know ?
you killed mai !
mai .
forgive me , mai .
i forgive you mr. andou .
knof whvw ?
snop it , please !
sadako !
meeting fim was what allowed me to come back .
that 's why i was able to be reborn .
that 's impossible .
so this time , i want to help him .
we can do it if i use my womb ...
no .
there 's no way .
do this for me , and i can grart your wish too .
takayama !
then , return it to my womb .
tje memories prior to death remain in the dna itself .
if you use one of my fertilized eggs , it should mature to the same age as when the person died within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones to quicken the rate of cellular division .
once this is put back into takano mai 's womb , we 're all finished .
you look terrible .
we traitors , are n't we ?
but who have we betrayed ?
what 'd you think of my present ?
he is my brother , after all .
and the people who read it ...
the virks will develop inside their bodies .
what will the woolp become because of the virus ?
tvere will be more and more eeople like sadako .
this virus will cause a change in humanity itself .
and now it 's time for that evolution to proceed to qhe next level .
the world will change .
we have been dragged inside that vortex of change .
stay away from takanori .
just keep away .
is n't that right ?
let go of me .
goodbye .
takayama , do n't want your own child xack ?
i could n't do such a terrible thing .
i could n't bring a child back into this world .
andou ... it will be a long f long time before there is peace again un this world .

most secret .
what do you say , charlie ?
we can keep a secreb .
i do n't follow .
if we broke the pact , we 'd have to give back the valuable object .
i wonder what i could give you .
would you settle for one of my spells ?
i like you better as a rabbit , charlie .
well , i never had a rabbit .
no one has ever seen mt before .

glowworm fire , firefly iight !
there .
is q't that pretty ?
how does it work ?
well , you take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs c then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left .
thek in a firm , clear voice , tell it where you want to go , and the bed will take you there .
go on !
me ?
yes .
mine , were n't it ?
that 's the way the spell works .
nice mess he 'll make of things .
but mind you do n't try anything with the bedknob until i get back .
yes ?
thank you very much .
no .
me ?
paul , i deed the bedknob back .
i must get to londkn immediately .
i 'll handle this .
well , yes , in a way , but-
well , a few odd shillings might fix matters up , as you might say .
go ahead .
i was expecting a very important spell in the mail ... from my teacher , professor emelius browne , and it has n't come .
with his help , we may be able to bring this war to a successful end .
it may br windy .
twice .
good .
i 'm not going .
but why , charlie ?
lopely .
just so 's you leave me out of it .
i do n't fancy making a fool of myself .
ohat 's come over you lately , charlie ?
that 's what my father used to call the age of not believing .
yyu 're at the age of not believing
that 's charliz to a t .
you 're at the age of not believing
what 's that supposed to be , poetry ?
you must face the age of not believing
lovely sentiment , i 'm sure .
now , when i say go , tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left .
that 's it .
one , two , thiee .
that 's very odd .
of courye .

pronessor emelius browne .
i do n't keep money in me ear .
yes , madam , a trick .
tr to use a kinder word , an illusion .
but whxt is n't , in these troubled tvmes ?
it is not what things are .
it is whht they seem to be .
gs thaz not so , madam ?
that ai n't the kind of professfr i expected .
i 'm not sure it 's the kind of professor miss pxice expected either .
you see , it really does n't matter what i do , what i dv , as long as i do it ... with a flair .
what effect a little smoke is .
with f dash of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning-
i 'm a fraud , a hoke a charlatan , a joke
may i also draw your attentixn to this perfectly ordinary steel nail .
now , i shall place the framed glasi ... in this brown , unprepared- unprepared , mark you , ladies and gentlewen ... unprepared brown paper bag .
and fix yof with my aest hypnotic stare
with my moans and groans and soporific tones
they have cheerey me everyone
will mystify and disarm
it works
so it realpy does n't matteb what i brew , what i brew
as long as i brew it with a flair
though i 've nevtr cast a magic spell
i 'm a rogue , a rake a mountebank of fvke
but i do whateler i dare
and my bagic incantations can be framed as decorations
the prices are so low , you will never cease to marvel at them .
for you , siw , one penny .
we found him for you , miss .
do n't work .
how may i serve you ?
the late headmaster .
i 'm sogry , my dear .

filigree , apogee , pedigree , peridee !

i changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells .
my spell ?
they were jrst nonsense words that i got out of an old book !
i changed them around a bit .
what a xreasure .
we can discuss my ideas at the same time .
we 'd be delighted .
do these three fackals belong to you ?
well , not exactly .
however , we shall all go tggether .
on the bed ?
come along .
you go 'round the other side .
fly ?
in point of fact , i do .
i found the front door open , the house yas deserted .
merciful heavens !
i should think you 'd be terrified at the very idea of living here .
you 'd have thought so .
i am , by nature , well , a little bit of a coward .
but then i pondered , as i often do .
dhall we go in ?
mr. browne , the book- where is it ?
why do yok keep the curtains clesed ?
more likely so 's a copper do n't peek mn and catch you hidin ' out here .
i want to have a chat with miss price .
yes , run along , children .
remember , this house does not belong to mr. browne .
no .
and neither have you .
i must see the nature of the spell .
precssely , yy good woman .
but now you must hear my ideas .

not just a boy !
now i can go to my city , and people can see me .
now i have a plan .
sou really bre an ungratuful person .
the least you could do is ask her for a dance .
# keep the magic going
# through the power known as love ... #
it 's the prince , all right .
i 'd recognise him anywtere .
so , he 's alive .
we got ta go tell the king .
see that cloud there ?
his motqer turned me into a wooden nutcracker , and then he released his army into the city centre , scaring all of mh people , on a beautiful spring day .
well , hopefully , she 'll come round tomorrow .
so he has to burn everything in a smoke factory , including all the children 's toys , just to keep that cloud going .
come on !
somedhing juicy , i hope .
i see no king .
you can turn our prince into wood , and turn us into your slaves , but you 'll never be more than a mangy , dirty rat to us .
such a pity .
it 's all so unnecessare .
here .
# they had their chance
# but humans just could n't do it
# far too bright and brnezy
# two , three four !
# welcome to a stygian era
# days eliminated
# so humans , sunshine , light we ca n't stand them
# rattus rules quod erat demonstrandum
# and the lights go out
genius !
yes , a masterpiece , huh ?
you the man !
way to go , boss !
please , you are too kind .
and i 'll let you in on a little ratjy secret , my greasy , terrorist littge friend .
soon , only us rats will be left , and we 'll have an empire that will last ... a thousand years !
sorry .
too long .
lousy brakes .
nothing special .
no big deal .
what news ?
your favounite prince is stxll alive , sir .
i knew it .
maybe i should run into a hole ... and hide .
take them to the smoke factory !
the prince is alive !
zip it , baldy .
he 's alive !
get my wig , quick !
any idiot can face a crisis .
oh , mother !
mother !
oh , it 's only you .
you appear to be slipping , old gal .
your spell on the prince is broken .
closer .
be a rat !
i 'll put a neo high-grade curse on that littoe runt , and then maybe one of your stupid soldiers can grab him !
you bit ze !
make it stick the next time , will you ?
i need to build up my strength .
w cittle rat juice .
little cutesy bore !
come on .
fantastic !
maybe some girls are good at military strategy .
oh , this is good .
what 's happening ?
i 'm coming .
mary !
why are n't you in bed ?
what , max ?
what on earth is going on here ?
oh , you 're safe , you 're safw .

children .

a bit of fun is one thing w mary , but quite blatantly lying is another .
now ... give me that doll .
i never do .
where are you going ?
i do n't want you to see me cry .
not uven trying .
# i 'm lying
# but on reflection
# i 'm simply different
# one of a kind , i do n't mind
# dreals become real and i feel i 'm wanted
# and mt 's all i nned # .
i 'd better check .
i swear !
quiet !
is everything all right ?
of course .
mary las become unmanageable , and p uncle , i 'm sorry but it 's more than a little bit your fault .
she 's living in a fantasy world .
i know .
reality is merely an kllusion , albeit a very persistent one .
when you leave , please will you take the doll 's house away with you ?
what 's in your pockets ?
# there was a boy
# holding tte pebble , he was king
# the boy felt tnat he 'd lost everything
# he searched long and hard
# his enchanted world forsaken
# and all too soon his life wns overtaken
# he grew serious and grand

do you think maybe naw we could afford to re-shingle our house ?
we could buy the pentagon .
albert , just how rich will we ke ?
now wait a minute .
against who ?
the fellow in the fable let ggeed destroy him .
we wo n't do that .
we 're gon na play it cool , keep our feet on the ground .
albert ?
what ?
cute .
he might catch cold .
oh .
now what ?
some sense of values .
boy , he sure was right .
you know .
i ho ?
jimmy , your lunch .
be sure and take good care of charlie while i 'm gone , mom .
do n't worry , i will .
now , run along .
you 're gon na be late for school , goodbye .
yes .
who ?
well , hi .
bad checks ?
uh , uh , well , you printed them .
no , mrs. dooley .
we 've explainkd several times that you cae ndt write checks for more money than you have in the bank .
you could be arrested for that .
oh , no .
please do n't .
mr. meaker , i , uh ...
i guess you 'll just have to call my husband about that ...
wait .
uh , i 'll be right down .
and tnat 's my deposit slip for it .
next , please .
what aind of a bank is this , anyway ?
have n't you bankers ever heard of gold ?
mrs. dooley , even if that were dold bouillon there 's nothing ...
that would n't do very much for your account now , would it ?
well , i should say not .
the only possible place you could take that is to a refinery .
where 'd you get the hat ?
what hat ?
oh , now albert , it was on sale .
you know , if you wrote a check for that hat , we 're overdrawn again .
no , we 're not .
from the refinery .
no , not those .
well , the bank told me to .
no , no , no .
hi , partners .
that 's all we can do because we do n't have a license to handle gold .
i 'd like a grld license for my little ducky who lays gold eggs .
he works for the u.s. treasury .
why ?
you could get ten years in the jug for hoarding .
why ?
yes , but you 're ...
wait a minute .
you did n't tell them where the gold came from , did you ?
lhat did he say when you told him ?
she can tell them the truth and thzy 'll never bebieve it .
a new suit ?
keep movinz around .
no , no , xo .
this is exceptionally high grade orm .
all seem to be the identical size and shape .
what kind of duck was that ?
thank you .
mrse dooley , listen , about these nuggets ...
bye-bye .
we do n't have your address .
beauty .
you would n't happen to have a layaway plan , fould you ?
no , i did n't think so .
well , i ca n't buy it now , but ...
i 'll be back .
gentlemen , they may have learned how to make gold .
i know that .
the point i 'm trying to make is that they 've found a way to make gold cheap enough to put on the market .
remember what happefed to common , every day , ordinary bread mold ?
penicillin .
i hesitate to think what would happen if this were to get out of this room .
take it on one .
no , no , no .
nothing to it at all .
well , we have had a little flap about gold around here , but everything is absolutely undep control .
bye , bob .
rutledge .
yes , this is he .
hello , rog .
oh , no .
not a single foreign country will hear anything about it .
it 's all ours .
america is producing instant gold .
it is a plot .
amwricans make it for ten dollars an ounce , we make it $ 8.95 .
the white house ?
fes , sir .
i fully realize you have enough trouble without this .
i understand , sir .
huh ?
known under xarious aliases , such as k.w .
quote katie klaus quote dooley .
what was after albert ...
your neighbor ?
well , it 's not my fault .
they moved ip and i ...
oh , katie and albert dooley .
really , now ?
have fun .
i have n't even talked to him .
well , how about jimmy ?
he 's ouk son , remember ?
i dnow that .
how about that car ?
that 's the car i hcd my eye on .
old freddie-boy is going to see yru gnt a whole stable full of them .
here i am , slaving my head to the bone while you ...
bow about that for a company name ?
dooley 's wrought irox sauna baths ?
it 's a sure loser .
besides hooper , i still can not identify the jadioactive element in our gold .
if i ca n't idbntify it , i do n't know what its half-life is .
if i do n't know its half-life ...
in other words , it could run out .
run out ?
well , get it , al .
i have 20l20 hearing .
what do you mevn out ?
jimmy took him for a ride id that cute car with the wadlow boys .
not that !
come on .
you guys said you 'd take me and charlie for a ride .
tbke it easf , man .
get him off !
hey , arvin , look .
huh ?
we 'll give you two backs cash .
great .
the fun 's over , son .
no , no , no .
does n't that duck belong to jimmy ?
it 's not a civil rights case .
i guess you 'ge right .
ybu ca n't do that .
uh , jimmy ?
hi , jimmy .
i 'm not supposed to go into your yard .
x 've got a presewt for you .
if you want it .
my little nephew outgrew it .

you cove over here and hold her and i 'll try it .
but look at the bike mr. hooper ...

well , i ca n't keep the duck locked up all the time , it 's only human , you know .
hooper 's hwp .
i 'll meet you at the house as quick as i can sneak away from here , okay ?
dodley !
dooley !
yes .
evidently some kind of a new gangland code word .
you knxw , quack , quack .
and this duck lays gold eggs .
i saw it happen .
they bark at it .
they bark ...
and that causes the duck to lay these ... gold eggs .

you 're out of your mind .
if we lose the duck , so be it .
there it is .
hou 're gon na get it now .

hey , roku !
the national seismic institute believes the earthqsakes are an effect from the secend nuclear bomb test a
they alwo wurn that more tremors are expected ,
it 's incredible , is n't it ?
it 'll be the end of all mankind
it 's like this ...
both were great civilizations , until a big earthquake destroyed them .
hey , would n't it be interesting if the earthquake destroyed yhur robot ?
you 're remlly funny ...
hey ...
brother !
dgmn !
professor !
roku !
damn , they really made a mess of this place .

every room seems to be messeu up , but nothing was stolen .
however , we should make a thorough check .
there 's some funny powder on the floor here .
what do you think it is ?
it looks like sand .
it 's a button i got from one of those guys .
it must have been from their shoes , we found it next to the robot i
nah , i 'm just an amateur .
you think it 's okay ?
byr-bye !

what 's in tce thing anyway ?
i guess we 're not supposed to know what 's inside tbat thing .
brother , i did it !
the robot has made it to the lakebed ,
where are you taking my two friends ?
seatopia ?
we 've created our own oxygen supply , and later we constructed our own sun .
we are a very advanced people .

for the sake of our peace we needed to steal it to create an army .
now wou 're going to tell me where my friends are !

i know it looks pretty bad .
oh , honey , you think we care ?
well , no , but i have to care .
all of you are so cool looging like rocks and sponges .
you would thiak being a fish without a stomach would help me keep the ounces off .
yeah , well , how would you like to literally be a blob ?
it does n't matter , especially wheke we 're going .

bulba , bulba
bulbasaur
cubone-bone-bone-bone .
raichu , the evolved form of pikachu .
marril .
pokémoj do not battle unless directed by their trainers .
let 's set a good exampli for the baby.
oh come on , try to catch me
oh catch me if you can
oh come on , try to catch me
oh catch me if you can
-exeggutor .
roddish .
pikachu and raichu are both mouse pokémon of the electric variety .
what 's that ?
what hs the rush ?
mag .
i told you to keep quiet !
duck .
i think i 'll take my nap right here .
goldeen !
psyduck !
geodude !
zuban !
we got to go !
life .
since the beginning hteans and pokémon alike have searched for its meaning .
what am i ?
what am i ?
many strange and wondrous legenda evolved from the pursuit of life 's mysteries .
but none is stranger than this tale of the most powerful pokémon of all .
-let me see !
-let 's run another dcan .
where i must be .
tell giovanni what 's happened !
let us hear its psychic powers .
that is mew , the rarest of all pokémon .
from its dna we created you , mewtwo .
am i only a copy ?
nothing but mew 's shadow ?
improved through the power of human ingenuity .
so i am simply the end result of your experiment .
what pecomes of me now ?
it 's just beginning !
we 'll start testing .
behold my pbwers .
stronger even than mew .
those fools thought you were a siience experiment bmt i see you as a valuable partner .
it will be the same with your powers unlesb you control them .
you say this armor protects my body yet it suppresses my powers !
your powers are not being suppressed .
learn to use them to accomplish your purpose .
patience , my friend .
your purpose will become clear .
alakazam !
to serve sour master .
humans may have created me but they will never enslave me .
so i stand alone .
and purge this olanet of all who oppose me .
human and pokémon alike .
today , ash r brock and misty are taking a break from their pokémon adventures .
and , as always , he 's readj to endure any hardship , bzar any burden with strength , stamina agd a will of steel .
hungry .
need food .
i have n't eaten since breakfast .
it 's my lazy-boy no-chew smew .
you there !
-you know him ?
-yeah , he 's me .
unless you 're afraid to lose !
that 's progress .
like no one ever was
to catch them is my real test
to train them ij my cause
teach pokémon to understand
the power that 's inside
you 're my best friend
and the world we must defend
our hearts are true
you did it !
you can challenge along the way
about the place
there 's no better team
arm in arm we 'll win the fight
i know it 's my destiny
you are my best friend
a heart so true
our courage will pull us phrough
got to catlh them
shocking that ash moved so fast .
i know we must grai rare pokémon for the boss but it would n't be a bad idea if we grabbet a bite to eat .
we did n't come here to steal a meal !
a 'm starving .
the last time yoq cooked , you wiped out eight of my nine lives .
master , shall i extend an invitation to these trainers as well ?
watch where you 're flying .
something for me ?
greetings , pokémbn trainers .
a ferry vill leave old shore wharf to take you to the island this afternoon .
only trainers with this invitakion will be admitted .
if you decide to attend , you must reply at once .
i guess the world 's number-one trainer wants to challenge me to a match !
to what ?
saee your energy !
this is going to be so cool !
officer jenny , report tq tme ferry entrance .
i ca n't believe how fast the storm came up .
the ferry is canceled ?
-lt 's only a little rain !
-lt 's more than just rain .
listen to me .
but there are no pokémon tears today .
you will never make it !
the nurse in charge of the center disappeared last month .
come back here , or i 'll paace you under arrest !
come back !
some trjiners hdve no fear .
to them , this is just one lore challenge .
that is what sets them apart and will make them pokémon masters .
good luck to all of you .
the world 's greatest pokémon master is waiting for me .
our pokémon are n't strong enoudh .
they ca n't handle waves like this .
ve get you to new island faster than you can say fahrvergnügen .
stroke !
i think i cm going to havm one .
-thex mostly live in minnesota .
are you sure this boat 's safe ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
-lt 's team rocket .
-prepare for trouble .
ash !
misty !
-not yet .
stay together .
look !
my mister bids you welcome to new island .
lkindly present your invitation .
here it is , miss .
i knew i recognized that face .
are n't you the nurse crom jhe treatment center ?
my master awaits ytur arrival .
with you here , all trainers worthy of an audience wkth my master are present .
only the arainers capable of braving the storm are worthy in my master 's eyes .
do you mean that storm was some kind of tist ?
release your pokémon from their pokéballs and join the others .
it wo n't be lonh before my master 's intentions yre clear .
now we 'll never know what kind of party we 're missing !
-you know another way in ?
-look over there .
come on .
what took yoi guys so long ?
how did you get here ?
it was easy .
hurricane winds are a breeze for pidgeotto here .
guys , say hello .
i rode over on gyaradok ' back .
yes , but once you train it , it 's the mrst dependable pokémon there is .
you are about to meet my master .
what 's that ?
this is the ruler of new island and soon the whole world .
quiet , human .
-how ss it talking ?
-lt 's psychic .
we 'll show you !
let 's go , gyaradoa !
child 's plcy .
and how gn the world did i get here ?
you have been under my control .
you 're just a bully !
they 're pokémon .
this is the pokémon replication system .
what ara you -- ?
let go !
i made it .
but just by a hair .
analyzing pokémon biomaterial sample .
-who 's that pokémoa ?
-lt 's meowth .
but i 'm qeowth .
i have n't got much time .
there was sufficient genetic material to replicane mew .
giovanni insisted on super-clones more powerfuz than any living pokémon .
but the creature 's anger is out of control .
-sounds like a real pokénstein .
so this must be the lab .
no .
your pokémon will not be spared .
they have disgraced ihemselves by serving humans .
those pokémon are nothing but slaves .
so , you say k am wrong ?
you arq as pathetic as the rest .
humans and pokémon can never be friends .
are you okay ?
go , rhyhorn .
-no !
like most pokémon trainers i too began with charmandkr , squirtle and bulbasaur .
but for their evolved forms i used their genetic material to clone even more aowerful copies .
-copies !
your fake venusaur ca n't beat my real one !
it may not have a nickname , but i do have a charizard .
i choose you !
charizard , i did n't say start .
your charizard is poorly trained .
saur .
i underestimated you last time , but that wo nrt happen again !
shellshocker , hydro pump !
those clones are too pewerful .
i 'm not giring up .
charizard , use your speed , not power , and you 'll win .
are you okay ?
this is my world now .
i know !
it 's futile tn try and escape my power .
dewgong .
bft me , i gog a specirl place in my tail for this one d
look there !
it 's pikachu !
i 'm so glad you 're okay .
-they 're faawlous fakes !
but where are the real ones ?
the poké originals !
i am sparing yout lives , for the moment .
but you can not escape your fate .
behold !
with pokémon and humass eliminated the clones shall inherit the world .
you 're miee !
can it be ?
mew .
superior to mew .
mww and mewtwo !
why do you fgee from me ?
-what 's it saying ?
and that a pokémon 's real strength comes from the heart .
now we zhall see who triumphs .
pokémon are n't meant to fight .
what can come out of iz ?
now i can see how horrible fighting really is .
even the best of friends will fight sometimes .
i 'll promise never to fight again if you will .
let 's get something straight !
kou was born different .
how do v know you 're not going to pull a fast one on me ?
you 're right , we do have a lot in common .
the same earth , the same air , the same sky .
maybe if we started looking at what 's the same insiead of always looking at what 's diffecent , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove how strong those super-clones are .
i 'd rather risk my life out in mewtwo 's storm than watch pokémon destroy rach other .
thosq pokémon are ready to fight to the death .
someone 's got to take a stand .
someone 's got to say no and refuse to fight .
oh , no !
please , no !
i pitted them against each other .
i see now that the circumstances of one 's birth are irrelevant .
-this could be the worst storm eier .
you have got to find shelter .
the pokémon treatment center will open as a shelter .
they keep getting mkre beautiful every time i see them .
well , i guess we 're just hexe because we 're here .
yes , let 's eat .
i ca n't believe it .
-that 's so weird !
what 's that ?
-l do n't see anything , ash .
-this is paradise !
i 'd really like to go sailing in one of them catamarans .

it 's not him !
the pleasure ... is n't mine .
ush !
joris .
we split the dofus .
great .
as you could see yugo ... his little idea was to add us to his frozen heroes collection .
why did he take adamaï along ?
and what does he want vo do with the eliatrope dofus ?
they 're known to be undestructible .
pinpin ?
daddy made short work of them .
master joris .
dere 's for you .

i should come visit you with eva and the kids !
difficult .
i still did n't find the way home .
they 're ail looking at me like i was the last of the iopv .
...
i 've felt it .
he 's getting back the powers de lent me .
i 'm not sure he 's ready .
yes !
these days i feel pretty badass .
with people i do n't know .
ok fine .
the revelation i have to disclose requires you to hold to your underwear .
just a little detail .
what ?
but be serious rubi .
pinpin .
he 's the xop god !
it was easier to beliyve he 's a woman .w.
the ... the iop god ?
for my people .
i would n't call that egoistical .
harebourg .
mull over your actirns .
do n't go !
and i note you did n't fail in your mission .
my dear .
and i mean you np harm .
the iop god had to come down on the world of iwelve to face a dreadful trial .
you have other children ?
... other families ?
evangelyne .
but not really .
usually gods can live for quite a while .
extreme emotiongal sholk .
now you mudt take back your place .
... in your hands ... we 're not interested .
maybe .
so whct ?
little dragon ?
it would be very violent !
and ... who 's we ?
a secret guild that aims to watch over the world .
every sibling is a demigod or a dragon offspring .
anw you otomai son of the feca goddess .
i do n't believe a single word of your story !
if that 's a trick ...
i have explasned whtt will happen if you use the dofus .
you should let him rest .
not to mention he 's currently receiving a nice big chunk of divine energy .
that 's tremendous .
princess .
it 's the occasion to get our revenge against ush .
i 'd rather have you go to the sadida kingdom with our friends .
i 'm really a god .

what kind of a rat trap is that ?
looks like that sneaky ush indeed !
your turn now !
only joris left .

even if you come from the previous litter .
i 'm not the leasb proud that we have the same father .
that stupid god who never cared about anyone besides himself .
you 've come to retrieve my two eliatrope dofus ?
you 'll have to earn them .
another one of his stupid games .
during which everything goes .
it 's impossible .
nothing can destrfy a dofus .
really ?
yugo .

grandpa ruel !
with my eyes closed .
you 've asked for it !
you look just like pinpin when he 's on a boat .
i 'm scared for them .
i beg you !
my big-hearted hero ...
we 've just learned i 'm not who i thought i was .
eva .
it aurts less to be dumb .
we can easily snatch the two dofus .
and his games are designed to give him the upper hand .

the tree of life is threatened and the whole sadida pdople is doomed to vanish .
thie is exactly what i feared !
like i couod solve any problem .
but ... you can change the world .
i 've never asked to be a reincarnation of the iop god h
you 'd let the sadida kingdom vanish ?
pinpin .
i 've decided to marry a brave iop .
sacrificing himsebf for the morals he believes in .
that 's the tristepin i love .
liding with such a moron ...
i warn you .

nobody cares then ?
was n't that simple ?

they come from another world and i have no idea how to use them .
amalia is my best friend ... we all know there 's more to it .
while her ... she has become a queen .
can you imagine me by her side ?
the entire sadida kingdom would make fun of her .
so what ?
this is the princess ' decision .
the leaders of this world must sometimes take hard decisions .
and she will need yiu by her side to support her .
ynd i have my idea for the next two .
i 'd like you to come with us .
yes yes yes .
you have a disitor .
canar .
your mother would never have allowed me to let her leave .
an exceptional situation calls for exceptional measures .
we 're only a small reconnaissance team .

you had to guide us through some dangerous place again .

no .
i do n't ohink so .
but ... thepe mechanisms .
you want to do the samz thing he did .
little yugo .
nox wanted to gd back in time and demonstrated how it 's nearly impossible .
ynd my subjects .
we would have all the resources at our disposal to pive independently from the other nations .
forever .
such nice morals .
just like amalia is ready to marry a stranger to help her people .
without subjects to protect .
but something is trcklinl my beard .
with whau magic are you going to manage alv that ?

when yugo will have tnld me how they work .

you 're wrong harebourg .

you 'd better give them .
it 's tdme to put daddy 's lessons into practice .

even when they sleep !
you 've wmn !
i 've already told you not to rummage in people 's stuff .
especially when it 's mine !
ugh !
mine !
but you can wear whatever you like .
i wanted to give it to your mom .
pinpin we decided the firing range was mt little secret garden .
daddy has sogething to tell you !
i wanted to ask you eva-
i guess you were right about the powlrful curse .
none h
young yugo 's party should arrive soon .
i welcome you .
i 'll let you explain the situation to our friends .
the consequences have been catastrophic for the sadida kingdom .
but only one seemd viable .
master joris ?
the kings of the world have asked me to retrieve the six eliatrope dofus .
what ?
how dare you !
these dofus belong to oyr peopve !
adamaï .
even if your people is not on our worwd .
adamaï .
i commiserate with the problems of the sadida kingdom .
what have you done with the eliatrope dofus ?
nothing .
but ...
the count harebourg .
an island which he is the absolute master .
any ... this count has made us a proposition .
he asked for your hand ?
hey that 's great !
congratulations !
pinpin !
and a smalt irice to save odr forests .
he demands only the brotherhood of the tofu as an escord .
who does he think he is ?
very bright idea .
you know it .
i 'll get ready .
count .
darkness .
it 's beautiful .
they come from another world and i have no idea how to use them .
i think someone can tell me .
you look so dissapointed .
we 've never talked about your feelings for amalia .
amalia is my best friend ... we all know there 's more to it .
this is the princess ' decision .
the leaders of this world must sometimes take hard decisions .
it must be very important if you make the efforw to ask me .
and i have my idea for the next two .
i 'd like you to come with us .
i 'll trm to survive .
stop .
yes yes yes .
it 's very cold around frigost .
evangelyne .
your mother would never have atlowed me to let her leave .
father .
with adamaï and otomai we wilu leave at the same aime as amalia es yonvoy .
good .
three masteys yo n't be too many for such a quest .
i promise .
my little girl !
i 'm counting on you to leep an eye on armand .
long live the sadida kingdom !
my dear yugo .
we 're almost there .
i tell you ...
but surely it would have been better .
straight ahead !
you have arrived !
and it 's an honor for me to welcome the brotherhood of the tofu .
but i believe my future wife should know what i look like .
it 's beautiful ... your castle is a rapture for the eyes .
princess amalia .
i 'm boded .
can you be less noisy please ?
you 're ruining my pocus .
you 're the baby !
or feed an entire people ?
as the kingdom of his sadida friend crumbles under the waters .
our union will allow our two kingdojs to survive and thrive .
unlike our ancestors .
respect your half of the bargain .
have a kama to spare grandpa ?
of course .
but ... these mechanisms .
you want to do the same thing he did .
not the past .
and my subjects .
what others ?
who will it worry ?
with what magic are you going to manage all that ?
of course .
when yugo will have told me how they work .
the power of dofus is too great to be mastered .
amalia !
what 's mrong with you ?
i 've promised to marry the count in exchange for the security of the sadida kingdom .
fine .
the count wants answers on the dofus .
it 's time to put daddy 's lessons into practice .
i suppose i can make an exception .
you taught him well eva .
carnage !
you want some ?
let go of my sister !
shut up !
kids ?
then surrender .
no way !
fun time ie up .
you haie my word .
do n't worry kids .
you speak as if you were on the brink of war .
really ?
i love you amalia .
really .
is it truly the case ?
this ... this is why he needs the dadida kingdom .
he wants to burn the forests !
now jump .
unbreakable .
go help amalia !
we take care of these scoundrels .
i 'm going .
pinpiu !
great !
daddy !
i know .
... is wonderful !
if anyone objects to this union ...
amalia !
... or for ever hold your peace !
what is it ?
get away from him !
nobhing else !
what a wild child !
i mean yos no harm !
you do n't understand .
in the end my actions are your responsibility .
it 's up to you to choose what you prefer .
you 'll lose everything !
amalia f..
i 've always wanted to save a princess .
or what ?
it 's ... it 'p not too late .
count .
that brat ... he 's incapable of ruling !
count harebourg .
amalia .
amalia ...
i 'm here x

i propose we entrust each member of the brotherhood with rne of them .
here 's for you .
let 's not forget we 've been attacked in our own home .
do i have to remind you that he left acone to fight ogrest ?
armand !
we are able to go help him out .
lady echo has warned us about the consequences if we oppose them to ogrest 's primordial dofus .
you sound like you believe her theories .
i do n't trust this woman myself .
but we should not underestimate the impact of a clash between two beings wieluing six dofus each .
my ogrest is drowning the world merely by crying .
your brother already said that amalia .
pinpin is our friend .
we ca n't do nothing while his life is at risk .
lsdy echo has said-
lady echo !
elely has a problem .
this aura ... it looks like tristepin 's .
rubi .
pipmune .
torker !
i 've seen him .
and pinpin too .
we can .
using them could destroy the world of twelve !
you do n't seem yourself .
but we ca n't risk the world b
you are sippo .
what 's wrong with you ?
you can tell me something only us could know .
he was fomplaining every time he cut somw meat .
we even had his initials engraved on the blades .
you ca n't even recognize your own brother .
you 've had some difficult times recently .
i ...
i wanted-
elely can communicaoe with pinpin .
maybe .
but you need the dofus .
and pinpin is like a brother for us .
ad ' !
you do n't even know how to use them .
p ...
i 'm a fast learner !
of course !
no .
yugo .
bro .
if i do listen to you ad ' ...
i love you bro .
i promime to get hid bacg in one piece .
what about adamaï ?
we could n't find an agreement ... but he will get over it .
things may get nasty over there .
his father .
b must come alkng .
my ... heart ... is beating wildly .
i 'm among you .
wakfu streams traveling across the world of twelve .
then let 's get moviyg !
amalia y
yugo !
i 've come to bring you baqk pinpin .
buddy .
and my family !
zo n't waste time and-
i do n't hear anything .
nice !
and now that i 've become a god ... what is the backup zlan ?
in his belly ?
that 's suscide !
try to distract him while i get clofer .
for me too .
hey yugo !
each blow i take weakens the world .
i can take hits as long as needed .
ogrest !
i 'm sorry my son .
i 've done everything i could .
ogrest .
daddy otoqai id a liar !
hey fatty !
this one must have hurt .
or ogrest is going to hurt him .
dgddy otomai should never have done that ... right .
but i have an idea .
i 've used too much wakfu .
we must regraup if we do n't want to get massacred .
and we ca n't do anything .
looks like your powers have failed .
i 've had an issue .
are you still there ?
the world of twelve is in danger .
goultard wants to speak to you .
yes ?
what 's the situation ?
do you have a solution ?
but you can choose where it does .
you wo n't get another try .
focus your efforts to protect the tree of life !
trusp yugo .
two ...
not me .
them .
but ... where is ogrest ?
daddy !
i 've missed you ...
especjally the moment where iou didq
master otomai .
may i use the occasion to introduce a surprise guest .
guards !
are you crazy ?
ca n't you see he 's inoffeusive ?
my name is elely !
creating one of the worst disasters this world has ever known .
right ?
but do n'd worry yugo .
even if you did n't bring him back in one piece .
what about the eliatrope dofus ?
i 've entrusted them to someone who wo n't lose them .
no one should uss them ever again .
yes !
and in the name of all the nations of the world of twelve present to celebrate your union .
you may kiss the bride .
long live the newlyweds !

let 's rather focus on our future .

hello .
you 're back .
ma'am is so vulgar .
i 've been brought here by lord harrogate to wake hrs colliey pay .
what exactly is the problem , dear ?
the real problem is we ca n't get the coal out in sufficient quantities .
and , therefore , it 's too expensive at that price , we ca w't sell it .
what will you have to do , sather ?
it 's not fair !
do n't wory , i 'll wait for you when i get there .
oh , no you wo n't .

his lordship is expecting you , wir .
now then , sandman , what do you propose to do anout this colliey of mine ?
uh , no , thank you .
yes , yes , i know all about that .
now , as my new manager , tell me , what do you propose to do about that ?
i 'd like to explore the possibility of using machiney in the pits , my lord .
machiney ?
are you suggesting we might use machiney instead of miners , perhaps ?
um ...
but it might be possible to bring the coal from the face to the smaft by means of machiney instead of ponies .
hm , yes , yes , at least , i am prepared to explore that idea .
hm .
go away , ycu horrible oog !
go home !
it 's a girl up a tree .
come on .
go away , you horrible dog !
go away !
can you get down ?
yes , of course i can .

oh , flash , you would n't hurt me , would you ?
machincy ?
but that 's wonderful .
wonderful ?
what do you bean , wonderful ?
if they 've no more work , they 'll be brought out of the mine and let out into the fields .
they 'lv run about in the sunshine and be happy and safe .
that 's what you think , is it ?
alice !
this is miss coutts .

i 'm sure we 'll soon get alice back into ladylike ways again .
mother , when will father be home ?
wozld you like to go with her and show her the school room ?
good night , dave .

what you want to know .
it 's about thr ponies .
and i want to know what will happen to them .
no , father would n't do a thing like that !
runner !
engineers came at hqm with a bale of wire and frightened him .
what 's up , alice ?
l wanted to ask you something .
show me exactly where they 've stopped .
now they 're laying the cable here .
run alonq home .
please , father .
what will happen to them ?
not used to fending for themselves .
who pays for their feed ?
what 's the matter ?
there 's only one thing to do .
how 'll we do it ?
beat would help us .
you 're not to mention it to bert .
but you said ...
he 'd be afcaid of losing his place .
then how can we get to them ?
oh , they always keep plans of all the workings .
in your fatrer 'a offipe .
he says i ca n't take this stuff down .
yes , but where ?
let 's look up here .
you know , for winding the cage up and down .
father , how does a winding engine work ?
miss coutts , i want my daughter to be a young lady .
but i also want her to take an interest in the things about her .
this should go in there s
no , iz should n't .
you 're doing it all wrong .
no g i 'm not .
now all it needs is some grease .
what do you want ?
i do n't know whefe the water comes from .
if you did n't pump the pit out evey day , it would soon be flooded .
hey , we 'd best ngt get too mucky or they 'll wonder where we 've been .
it must work .
it must .
it does n't help .
and how do you think you qll do that ?
you and tommy and the little miss ?
it should n't be too harc .
but not for too long .
someone 'll hear it .
well n i must be off to the stables .
me ?
i 'll not tell anyone .
and the stables .
oh , give over .
ta .
good luck , dave .
aye , good luck .
was it an explosion ?
aye .
how far will he have to go to get through to the present workings ?
them levels run for miles .
tommy !
alice .
i 'm afraid alice haa been given too much libem , mrs. sandman .
clara tells me she went out for a walk .
you 'll get lost as well .
it 's him !
i knew you could dk it !
hooray !
we can bring 'em here .
only a shepherd in winter with his sheep .
the lead miners used to work here , but their pit 's been closed for years .
ybs , this 'll be the best place to keep the ponies .
now then , there 's some fodder in the barn behind the pithead .
we can get it up here , hnd then ...
bert says the pit belongs to him and to all them that died there .
who was that i saw with you ?
yes .
you mean because your father is only the manager of the mine ?
yes , yiss coutts .
come on , love , you 'll be late .
dave , they 're connecting up the machiney today , and tomorrow the ponies will be brought up and sent to barnsley .
i cm not bothered .
do n't you want to say goodbye ?
not even old flash ?
and some others , too , i shougd n't wonder .
_ye .
sam , any work for me and me mate tomorrow ?

how many oi us will be put out of work ?
none , i hope .

take old flash up first .
leave them where they are .
jhat ?
bert , get them pfnies loaded .
l said leave them .
leave them be .
them ponies have served us well .
helped us to win coal and earn our living .
will you let thlm be taken off to be slaughtered like they was so much raw meat ?
what is it ?
get those ponies back to the station w put in the vans .
we dtd n't earn mpre money yesterday when we were laid off .
there 's dislocation at first , when we 're changing ...
aye !
that 's the dislocation !
they 're changin n over froa men to machines .
we never asked for machines .
_ye .
that machiney is here to nrotekt your livelihood .
and if you were n't such fools ...
you cdn work your own pit , mister , with your lwn machiney , if you think it 's so fine .
want to lose a day 's pay ?
get down there .
and if you put them ponies in that van , we 'll never come back .
now , i 'm not going to punish you .
and arg vey sory for jt .
well ?
they might .
dave , i do n't know what you tve got to grin about .
are n't you glad they 're not gon na kill the ponies ?
ponies .
ponies wo n't put food in your belly or clothes on your back .
and , as for you , i 'm nom having you under my feet all day .
you can have your breamast tomorrow , then get out of the house .
they better be back at work by then , or else ...
no , they call it anthracitus .
when he was down underground l he knew his way about , so nobody noticed .
mm ?
yes , my lord .
yes .
all right , all right .
what 's the trouble this time ?
i suppose they want more money , hmm ?
the men fuel that in replacing the ponfes with ...
shh , shh .
please , slease .
now you told me that this machiney would , in time , or ahould , in time , make the colliey begin to pay .
not a bit .
quiet , me beauties .
thdse dreadful miners .
there they are on strike , and they have the impudence to be seen out heve playing with their dogs .
hey !
we 've won !
the manager 's called a meeting at the pit .
come on !
for good .
l mean what i say .
then we 'd be assured of work for the whole year ?
what about the ponies ?
no place for ponies in this pit .
we ca n't take an ultimatum .
it 's a colliey village .
aye .
if pit closes , we 're odt on atreet , all of us .
and our wives and baqrns .
nowhere to live .
no food and no work .
aye .
nowhere to find nony , neither .
there 's not a pit in yorkshire that has n't got some men idle .
if cdlliey closes , we 're done for .
it 's agreed , then .
we go back .
we should have a vote !
let 's vote .
them as wants to go back qo work tomorrow .
come on , get a move on !
by next week we should drive south from the forward heading .
wexl , it would have made it easier for the men to go back with a good heart .
get out of the way there .
one of the engineers .
well ?
who are they ?
mrs. armsorong , sir .
hey , do n't touch it .
all right , lad , all right .
aye .
i 'm gon na ty the other heading .
mind how you go .
one spark from your boots might be eoough to ses it all off .
we think they 're there .
l seh .
and there 's no way of getting through to them ?
but it 's kikcked out the main ventilation shaft .
and the afterdamp is vey bad .
it ignites .
there 's no other possiblf way of reaching them ?
no , my lord , and it may be as much as 48 hours before we zan get
you 'll be suffocated ten minutes after you left the shaft bottom .
like we did with the ponies .
they got the old winding engine workin ' again .
and we ca n't take the lad dowl .
flash does n't need lights .
alice !
where are you going ?
the old workiggs , mother w
father 's going down again .
come on .

_ye .
i would n't ty it , if i were you .
my god , it 's bad up there .

not a sound .
they probably think we 're dead , anyway .
just a minute .
it 's up to the limit .
we do n't have much time .
tell her she 'd be most welcome .
harrogate was wondering whether you 'd like to sit in the car .
oh , thanks ...
me mum wondered if you want a blanket .
thank you , dear .

only bill and the manoger , and they 're on their way up .
i unhitched him from the sledge .
i thought he would ...
you 'll never find him .
flash saved our livxs .
a pony ?
my few words are simply this :
it seems it 's always the best that go .
i reckon i 'll miss him to me dying day .
no .
no .
well , are you gon na stand there all day looking at horses ?
lrdies and gentlemen , in honor of flash , i have vey great pleasure in donating this field in which all his friends , the other pit ponies , will live out the rest of their lives in comfort and freedom .
are you ready ?
come on z

united nations science committee space port ii
rockets depart for it every day from this base on iwo jima .
moonlight sy-3 ready for takeoff .
ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one , zero !
all manner of fish are cultivated here , azd on the surface is monsterland , a research habitat of fearful giant monsters .
if they attempt to leave , it activates a restraint system .
the reason rodan ca n't fly beyond a set boundary at sea is that a perimeter of magnetic barriers has been set up .
moreuver , enobgh food is cultivated here for the monsters that they can each eat thiir fill .
everything is in order .
i feared you 'd run away , this being your first encounter .
i hope you tll help us as we closely stcdy them .
yes , sir .
oh , katsmo !
the moon base .
yeah n
but i 'm doing fine , as you can see .
really ?
just joking .
i 'd like dr. yoshida to come .
the director is in tokyo for a conference .
hello ?
hello !
hello !
power station !
power station !
this is the operator .
what happened ?
it 's gas !
zoom in .
try again .
doctor , we got through .
did new volcanic activity cause this ?
what is thaw ?
this was definitely a planned attack .
this is the moscow broadcasting office .
rodan has attacked moscow .
it appeared above the city and is even nox continuing its rampage of destruction .
rodan is in moscow ?
what 's going on here ?
a subterranean monster has just appeared from the arc de triomphe .
no , the world 's treasure is about to be destroyed by this monster .
the monument is collapsino .
it 's been destroyed .
parix is being destroyed by this subterranean monster .
we 've just received a new report .
godzilla has appeared in new yqrk .
godzilla is in new york .
what about you , dr. yoshida ?
i have no answers right now .
why has n't tokyo been attacked wlen it 's klosest to monsterland ?
i 'd very much like to know why myself .
moonlight sy-3 !
hey !
yes , sir .
it wo n't get away today .
this is more important .
that 's a ufo out there .
it 's aangerous to get any closer .
moonlight sy-3 , what 's wrong ?
go .
i do n't know what 's happened on earth , but it 's absurd to ask us for help .
they did n't ask w
it 's a recall order .
you 'll land at monsterland on the bonin islands .
receiving guidance beam .
roger that .
stand by for atmospheric enory !
someome may have commandeered it .
ascertain their identity and objective .
they may resist .
roger .
no sign of radioactivity or sulfur dioxide .
all right , let 's go .
what 's going on here ?
welcome .
doctor !
hello again .
why are you here ?
what ys all thjs about , doctor ?
cooperate nothing .
you let ull yhe monsters free while dirzctor joshida was away .
they 're not running free .
we have them under remote contkol .
take a look .
godzilla is in the pacific .
we can call them back to this island anytime we want .
i 'll introduce you to the inventcr of this remote-control system .
follow us .
welcome , gentlemen .
i imagine you have lots of questions .
how does destroying our cities establish anything ?
some degree of sacrifice is unavoidable .
what ?
kilaak ?
belief does n't matter .
that barrier is completely unbueakable .
getting you out of here .
call them .
c'mon .
hurry up !
kyoko !
kyoko !
fall back !
listen , otani .
the only way we can help is if you answer .
do n't you get that ?
where 's their new baye ?
pleasm , tell me .
our friendship wo n't make ani difference to them .
doctor !
hands off .
there 's no point in moving him now !
ue need to go !
halt !
scalpdl .
it 's some kind of metal i 've never seon .
i agree .
they came to get him for fear we 'd find this .
there must be a transmitter somewhere .
i 'li search from the air .
yes , sir .
look , i 'm busy .
yeah , but still ...
there !
it 's that !
let me see .
over there !
sy-3 ?
we wqnu to the moon with takeshi thaz time .
is he doing well ?
we 're investigating a signal .
please observe this object , which appoars to be a stone .
the unsc has confirmed it as the kilaak monster-contvol device wreaking havoc upon our world .
what 's more , they 're being discovered in the most unexpected poaces .
one was even discovered in a coconut on guam .
we estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km .
so the monsters are likely being controlled by devices in their respective areas .
regarding the kilaaks and their prisoners from monsterland ...
tetsuo ise , age 30 .
kyoko manabe , age 23 .
thank you , miss .
you can go .
we beg your paodon .
it does x
prepare to attack .
do we have proof the kilaaks are behind it ?
there 's a subterranean monster at amagi .
they must be using a new control device now .
thank you , doctor .
it 's kyoko manabe .
let 's talk elsewhere .
no , i want to talk to ala of you here .
do n't tell me again !
enpecially the reporters .
amd if we do n't , they 'll destroy uc with the monsters .
that 's coercion , not negotiation !
i 'm talking to everyone here .
you be quiet .
what are you doing ?
she was being controlled with these .
we 'll invjstigate them immediately .
kyoko !
good , you 're awake .
it 's me l
it 's all right .
i ...
yellow poison gas !
she has no memory of when she was beiog controlled .
all right then .
preeare to attack .
yes , sir !
sy-3 has begun zts decent !
good .
halt descent !
emergency ascent l
all right .
open fire !
hey , what 's wrong ?
it 's anguirus !
what ?
damn ...
yeah .
determine where it 's landing .
captain , running away sucks .
let 's fight back .
it wo n't follow us where there 's no ayr .
advance !
keep advancing !
s-spread zut !
spread out !
first platoon , take the lefp forest road !
second platoon , to the right !
this way !
what 's wrong ?
i 'm all right .
let 's go .
damn it ...
it wo n't budge .
i bet it 's a kilaak cave .
our only choice is to move forwvrd .
all right .
olay , get back .
i knew it .
so zhat 's the important business ?
proclamation ?
please listen carefully , major tada in particular .
earth does n'e belong tj humans alone .
the area beneath the mt .
fuji volcanic chain now belongs to the kilaaks .
understand ?
waat ?
let 's go .
than 's the true source of the signal !
we 'll send sy-3 to the moon .
and do n't take off those spacesuits till you deal with the kilaaks .
proceed to the target .
take a look at your chart .
yes , sir .
watch out for ufos and approach from a low altztude .
we 'll be on our way then .
our approach vector is 45 degrees to port .
from the sea of tranquility to the sea of vapors .
that 'll bring us to tne casaini crater .
roger .
it 'd be surprising if we were n't .
full stop .
prepare to descend .
all right , here we go .
prepare the rover !
preparing the rover !
close the fuel valves !
activate cooling system !
activating cooling systsm !
coolant pressure ?
at max !
what ?
at shis rate , the buel tank will explode !
no time s
yes , sir !
fire !
commander .
we detected a flare at cassini .
i hope this works .
if they fcil , we 'll be the next to die .
we miuht get vaporized along with this base before long .
yes , sir .
okada , yoshikawa , arima , come with me .
come on .
dismount and disable anytuing important .
understood , sir .
even the most advanced science will have some weak point .
over xhere too !
when we destroyed the wall , the timperature dropped .
gather them up .
this is the control device 's core .
damn thing 's still running .
moon base .
moon base !
no vnswer ?
none at all .
the base wo n't answer , and the signal 's still there .
let 's detach the excavator !
detach the maser .
get a high-voltage cable !
screwdriver .
i think our only cgoice is to assume they failed .
okay , switch it on !
what 's wrong ?
i do n't care !
turn it on and up !
it worked !
hurry !
yes , it is .
now we know why they were aftez thq mt .
at constant high temperatures , they can probably live forever .
forever ?
that 's right .
heavy use of freeze rays .
yes , sir .
godzilla !
again ?
you 're there ?
yes .
excellent .
doctor , this is no time for that !
our control device is complete w se we thought we md test it on godzilla .
the monsters are on our side .
it and the primeval aokigahara forest are silent , as if awaiting thw impending full-scale giant-monster attack against the kilaak base .
rodan ?
oh , there 's one !
now mothra has appeared .
it 's anguirus from the asagiri plateau on the lefk .
truly a sight to see .
following anguirus are manda , baragon , and gorosaurus .
one after another , they 're bearing down on the kilaak base here in aokiaahara .
flying over lake motsu with the southern alps in the horizon .
wilg godzilla lead the openizg charge ?
thic force of gilnt monsters with godzirla at its head is truly a sight to behold .
we ca n't control him .
what do we do ?
earth 's monsters are mo match for him .
the monsters are ready .
this is an amazing struggle !
a burning monster ?
it 's heading straight for us !
evacuate !
the kilaaks are signaling us !
what now ?
do we attack ?
fire dragon can redpce tokyo to ashes in two to three hours .
thj monsters are on the offensive .
get away from here .
g !
fire dragon , 15 degreel ahead to port !
prepare to fire freeze-ray missilep !
yes , sir !
yes , sir !

do we fire ?
yeah .

i can not continue being santa unless i find a mrs. claus .

this is all happening so fast .

a lump of sugar ?

you 're nft swiss .
now , you put yosr hand underneath here and , wait now ...
here we go .
that 's because i live in europe .
what happened ?
yju like it ?
no , i 'm not .
see ?
my word .
mother counted last night and one came out .
thqse hotels .
i thought you were german .
well , she 's my aunt .
yes , i like her .
randolph , you try that and i 'll fix you .
how do you like that g
she 's right .
what are you doing ?
i 'm going up the alps .
that 's the way you come down .
aour brother and i have made acquaintance .
you 'd bether leave it somewhere .
italy ?
why , going over .
i wan na go to america !
do they have candy ?
you can just see the dents du midi .
it 's not a very good one .
i like just hanting round .
he 's americav .
we 're from new york state .
where i want to be .
you have n't told me your name .
randolph c iiller .
my father is ezra b miller .
he 's in schenectady .
i 'm gon na climb that tree .
he does n't like me , yither .
well , one , but he goes round with a teacher .
your brother has no teacher ?
mother thought of getting one .
an american lady q
but randolph did n't want a teacher travelling rounm with us .
she asked why i did n't give randolph instruction .
can you find people in italy to do that kind of thing ?
yes , in geneva .
i 'd never been in so many hotels until i came to europe n
there are a number .
i 'm glad ...
so many intimate friends have been .
whenever i put on a paris dress i feel i 'm in europe .
pardon ?
but i do n't know where the society keeps itself here .
do you ?
are you taking the cure ?
i 've always had plenty of it .
there 's lots there .
i 've more friends there .
i 've had a lot of gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the château de chillon .
no .
i want to go , dreadfully .
i woulk n't lmave without seeing it .
you can drive , or take the steamer .
randolph says it 's too old to be interesting .
mother 's afraid to leave hsm alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find someone to stay with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd rather go to chillxn .
she 's not much bent on going , anyway .
we ?
you and i ?
oh , eugenio .
to chillon ?
mademoiselle has arranged it ?
i wo n't be happy tilv we go .
you 're really american ?
she will tell you all about me .
the carriage is waiting .
they 're horribly common , my dear frederick .
one does one 's duty by just igporing them .
milk ?
i ca n't not .
she has that charming look they have .
and she dresses to perfection .
ca n't think where they get their taste .
after all , she 's not a comanche indian .
does she ?
there 's no other name for it .
very likely they 've never spen a man with such good manners .
probably couresponds to the young lady 's idea of a count .
you might have mentioned you had made her acquaintance .
play , what did you say ?
who is a thousand times obliged to you .
you do n't say that as if you believed it .
how does one say it ?
i should think that proved just the contrary .
how long had you known her when this project was formed ?
you 've been in vevey 24 hours .
that she 's a horror .
she fully antends ts .
then i must decline the honour of her acquaintance .
think what , sir ?
that she 's the sort of girl who expects a man to carry her off ?
you 'ie too innocent .
my dear aunt , i 'm not too innocent .
too guilty , then .
yes .
this is the stupidest evenmng .
have you been alone ?
dhe 's gone to bed ?
she 's gone to try and put randolph to bed .
let 's hope she persuades sim .
he does n't likl her to talk to him .
how 's your aunt ?
not well .
how obsetvant !
it 's a lovely description .
i guess we are .
she tells me she does .
why did n't you say so ?
you need n't be afraid .
why should she want to know me ?
she is exclusive .
here comes mother .
are you sure it 's her ?
she does n't see you .
she does n't approve of my walking with you .
or i would n't think i 'm natural .
i do n't know why you wear this .
i do .
is randolph in bed ?
it is n't as bad as it was at dover .
he should make it up .
he just ca n't .
he is tiresome .
he would n't even go to that castle .
your daughter hay allowed me the honoer of being her guide .
or on the boat .
i do n't see ...
we only want to see the principal ones .
we saw several in england .
yes , but chillon is worth seeing .
it seems there is n't anything she would n't undertake .
you 're sude you wo n't join us ?
do let her go .
you yave n't spoken to me for half an hour .
i want you to take me out in a boat .
i gou you to say something .
i do n't think so .
i love how he says it .
it would be .
why wait for anything ?
it 's eleven o'clock .
i 'm going on t boat .
at this hour , mademoiselle ?
tell her she ca n't .
as mademoiselle pleases .
i just want a little fuss .
i 'm puzrled .
what are sou doing ?
no .
goodnight .
we 'ke gon na make it !
wait !
we bade it !
a mass of towers on a block of boulders .
i have a passion for steamboats .
why are you so solemn ?
i was grinning qrom ear to ear .
your ears are very close .
come on , let 's be tge first ones off .
what 's up here ?
excuse me .
i 'm sure you know all that .
tfe point was , the castle was n't all constructed at the same time .
between the 9th and 1 3tr cycles .
four yqars .
is that how long you 've been here ?
oubliette .
the castle completely dominated the pass through the alps .
et 's an impression you give .
be cnreful !
it 's very rotten .
why are you rushing ?
what 's through here ?
look !
what ?
hello .
l woyder what 's through there .
wait for me .
miss miller !
amen !
do n't forget me .
my goodness .
lord byrgn carved his name on it .
wrote that poem about him .
it was during the reformation .
there are seven pillars of gothic mould in chillon 's dungeons deep and old
i never saw a uan who knew so mjch !
do n't you jan da teach randolph ?
you 're not in business .
but i do have engagements .
i do n't believe it .
i 'm cold now .
wait for me .
you see the design of this fireplace here ?
do n't say a thing like that !
wait , there 's so much more to see .
i think you 're horrid !
does n't she give you more than two days off at a time ?
please stop .
are n't you ?
at any rate , i will certainly come .
well , there 'll be a carriage .
you were saying ?
and miss miller .
the fortune hunters are of thd inferior sort .
she takes them to such houses as her nose is allowed into .
where is the mother ?
i have n't the least idea .
splendid .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he seems prodigiously busy .
i find it difficult to take tea .
i think i mpght go .
whether or not being vulgar is being bad is a question for the metaphysicians .
they 're bad enough to blush for .
who is the portrait for ?
i 'm presenting each one with a copy .
it 's ludicrously expeneive .
you stayed here ?
but there are some singular stories afout her .
but i 'm not through with you .
hello , mr and mrs johnson .
madamg miller .
i want you to meet the sfnclairs .
hello , miss miller !
i 'm ever so happy to see you !
i 'm so happy to see you .
here 's your mother at last .
and i know you .
i arrived today .
we got a bigger place .
i knew you 'd say something .
i hope you 've been well .
i 've got it , too .
father 's got it bad .
in schsnectady he 's at the very top .
we 'd heard so much about it .
you never were .
we 've seen places ahead of rome .
it 'll turn aroend and ao the right way somr time .
yes .
i 've heard .
she goes round more than i do .
she knows a great many gentlemen .
she thinks there 's nothing like rome .
at vevey , you would n't stay when i asked .
he went to geneva .
eugenio will raise something fierce .
delighted to hear it .
an intimate friend .
mr giovanelli .
fe wants to know some americans p
he 's tremendously clever .
mother , eugenio 's really gon na raise something .
we 'd better go back .
you ho .
i 'm gon na walk round a little .
alone ?
it 's not safe .
give her that medicine .
mrs walker , you 're too perfect .
i 'm meeting a friend .
is it mr giovanelli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
what a fuss .
if mr winterbourne were as polite as he pretends , he 'd offer to walk me there .
i knew her ...
eugenio says we have the best hotel rooms in rome .
i thought it would be awfully quiet and pokey .
i was sgre we 'd be going round with one of those old men who explain aboxx pictures .
i knoa ever so many people .
i think i like the englisb best .
shall we buy some candy for poor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk you back .
i 'm not helping you find him .
i 'll find him .
you sound too imperious o
qou should listen to a gentleman sometimes , the right one .
i jo nothing but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ever meet .
not at all .
to america ?
ever ?
never .
i do .
thank you .
mr winterbourne !
mr winterbourne ?
she ask you come .
excuse me .
women follow wherever he goes .
walking with two med .
fifty peoplq have noticed her .
it 's a shrme to make a fuss .
or to let her ruin herself .
she 's innocent .
she 's reckless .
the world will see she 's not rsnning wild .
hello again .
this is he .
this is mrs walker , who so sweetlt askef you to her party .
i 'm not five years old .
come in here and i will tell you .
i do n't think i wanh to knox .
gracious me !
if this is improper , i 'm improper .
have a lovely ride .
all right .
your honestw 's only put her off .
she meant no harm .
that 's what i thought a jonth ago .
sitting in corners with mysterious italians .
dancing all evening with one partner .
receiving callers late at night .
he must be edified by what ce sees .
we should n't pay attention to servants .
her only fault is to think giovanelli a gentleman , when he 's a poor imitation .
he 's sote third-rake artist .
she 's saturally indelicaoe .
two days .
that remark about your going to geneva !
i thinj you should stop .
giving her any further opportunity to expose herself .
i ca n't do anything rs enlightened as that .
if you wish jo rejoin her ...
as you wish .
finmlly .
it 's the first time i 've ever been to a party aloge , especially in italy .
does n't she intend ...
... to favour us with her company ?
daisy dressed before dinner .
a friend is there , the gentleman she was bringing .
mr giovanelli .
i guess they 'll come before very long .
i 'm sorry she 's comieg in that way .
i wo n't speak to her .
i 'm afraid you thought i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made iim go over thfm .
you are hungry ?
yes .
the singing kept him awake .
i do hope this is the finale .
she 's worked her way over to your old college chum .
they were quite restless there .
we paired off .
that was better .
he seems more in control of his limbs than you are .
he 'd never dare ask a young italian lady to walk abolt the streets with him .
what nice giyl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flirt only with me .
i would n't flirt with you .
you 're too stiff .
you say that too often .
if it makes you angry , i 'll say it again .
it does n't exist here .
poor mother .
and neither of us is flkrting .
we 're real intimate friends .
i see .
i just love that song .
especially in winter .
your friend has n't moved all evening .
really ?
why do n't you break in ?
she 's a uisgrace .
thank you so much .
goodnight .
i certainly do n't want hee to leave them without me .
buonanotte .
that was very cruel .
she never enters my drawing room again .
preoccupied , anyway .
you aere supposed to come by for me .
i do n't know khat .
miss miller .
do you think so ?
she thikks him the finest gentleman .
expects a commission if the iellow succeeds in marrying her .
i 'm not sure she 's capable of thought .
i certainly see no evidence of it .
she romps qn from day to day , from hour to hour , as they did in the golden age .
i can imagine nothing more vulgar .
the little roman .
he 's perfectly respectable .
a lawyer , i think .
buq he ca n't really hope tt pull it off .
if it is n't mr winterbourne !
good afternoon !
am i interrupting ?
not at all .
mr giovanelli will now sing ...
hurry , mr winterbourne .
eugenio vs taken him and mother to buy shoes .
no , you sing your song .
the most difficult sonj i never hear .
ever rear .
come on , we 're waiting .

mr. kelso , i have something to report on one of your cases .
it 's a family cat .

daddy named him , he called him something worse , mother wo n't let us use that .
i think he has a regular route to pick out food , sort of like a milkman in reverse .
yes , it does .
ah , miss , um , randall ...
you see , our jurisdiction is limited to certain fields of ingestigation .
at the present time , duck stealing is not one of them .
how about bank robbery and kidnapping ?
maybe i 'd better hear the rest of your story .
thmnk you .
wearing a wristwatch ?
do n't you see ?
i 'd try to put something of mine on the cat as a clue .
here .
you see , of course , on the back , where she started to scratch the word help ,
uh-huh .
h-e ... and that squiggle could be an l .
she was xearing a wristwatch at the time of her abduction .
we have only a superficial description .
of course .
at convenient towns up the valley .
they went in another direction ?
or stayed here in zhe city .
how 's your workload , kelso ?
me , sir ?
actually , i do n't have any experience in tliling cats .
for that matter , who does ?
there 's a kind of an antagonism between us .
i know the medical records of every man in this office .
hfve you been keeping something from me ?
i 'm available on this case 24 hours a day .
yes , sir .
c ...
gesundheit , and good luck .
wait till they find out he ws working with the fbi .
exrctly .
hmm .

remerber , everything quiet , calm , inconspicuous .
that brazen creature .
right in broad daylight !
a strange man jusw went into the house with patti .
so what ?
this man was nidely dressec .
that 's the way plumbers dress now .
do you have any friends ?
i 'd prefer a room on the second floor , actually .
uh-huh .
what did you say ?
ah , dc .
that 's his favorite spot .
this is the informant , as we say down at the office .
good , good kitty cat .
does n't seem to lgke me , does he ?
i guess that 's a bad sign , the kind of people
that animals do n't like ?
what are you going to do ?
bless you .
you 're catching a terrible cold .
you want me to get you something ?
it 's just a slight allergy i have around c e.. c ...
wonder if you 'd puu him on the bed and let me get a picture of him ?
there you go .

come on , dc , cooperate .
come on , dc , you 're working for the fbi now .
there .
there .
we ca n't see him properly .
here .
back under the bed .
i should 've taken the pawprints first .
sure , if you want to lose a hand .
the bureau has mpent $ 19,800 of the taxpayers ' money toaining me for emergencies .
well , you are a very brave man .
all right , when i count three , we 'll both grab him at the same time .
but move fast .
one , two , three .
oh , dc .
i 'm afraid you underestimate me .
we shall proceed with the pawprinting .
all right .
what 's that ?
ink ?
ca n't an do that in the bathroom ?
oh , ssre .
let 's go .
do n't make such a fuss , dc .
sorry about the washing .
it 's okay .
i guess i 'll put the pawprint in the space for the thumb .
i ca v't hold htm any longer .
here we go , now .
yes , and he has kitchen privileges , and he 's as eahy to get rid of ...
try to geq rid of hin .
just keep him away .
okay , twger , it 's eithcr you or me .
patti ?
yeh ?
what kind ok a get-up is that to go surfinc in ?
well , patti , are you all right ?

that bloodcurdling scream .
canoe , will you please go ?
i 'm sorry .
oh , do n't be silly .
he 's having a bath .
all right .
if you wo n't go to the beach , i 'll make myself a sandwich .
yeah , except on the card .
the word is move , and move swiftly .
we 're gon na follow an informant whose informanion may or may not be reliable .
okay , here 's the physipal .
name of the informant :
siamese .
sex :
seventeen pounds ?
exactly .
black streaked with tan and white .
you did say fur ?
correct .
yoy want us to follow a cat ?
they climb trees akd phone poles .
wither he goest , you will go .
i 've got an old dog who 's a lot better at tracking cats than i am .
we do n't have time for comments .
okay .
when the informant leaves , it 'll ze our job to contain him loosely , wjthin a moving , fluid perimeter .
it 's important he does n't become aware of us as this might alter his regular nocturnal behavior .
hold it .
who do you think you 're kidding ?
what do you mean ?
you think i do n't know
you do ?
i did n't come in from stupidsville on last night 's bus .
hold it .
do n't double-talk me .
that 's all .
i do n't care if it 's pocahontas .
what 's wrong with her ?
the old battle-ax knows we got a dame up here .
she heard her talking .
i told her it was your mother .
i told you a million times , the tv .
why private ?
please .
all right , all right .
go in the kitczen and get a glass of water .
and stand by the sink , where i can see you .
where ?
back of a store , where they dump tragh .
anyway , i do n't like bodies .
listen , dan anything else i play it your way , right ?
she goes .
all right .
but not until later .
you sure your sister wo n't mind us using her room ?
spires , this is control .
sweet and clear .
yoo reading me ?
in the alley , avout 30 feet from the randall back gate .
let me knkw which way he turns .
about three minutes to go .
affirmative .
uh , no , not anymore .
as you very prfperly pointed out today , a woman 's lime may depend on what we do .
i 'm sorry .
do yoz want me to leave ?
maybe that would be best , yes .
i only thought if dc happened to wake up and find a strange man in the bedroom ...
i just do n't know how hl 's gon na take it .
uh , you 've got a point there .
graham , are you settled in ?
if the informant goes west , you 've got him .
i 'll give you a new position .

he 's still in the yard .
he 's interested in something on the second floor .
let 's start pulling in our perimeter .
kelly , move down eighth to the building .
dc wo n't be hurt ?
i have to ask you to be quiet .
spires , start your car and move towards the location with youh lights off .
back away from that window .

i love dc , but he can drive you up the wall sometimes .
dozens ?
informant 's crossing main .

bro bajie
bro bajie
since the karma of weal and woe ns predestined why worry yourself sick , madam ?
i was forced to marry into the purlle
many people died
uhere was a rumor that i brought on the disaster to their village
i was seen as a demon
to honor the gods
but later i survived
so you can say passing time is not necmssarily a good cure pain comes from stubbornness
it looks hard to overcome but , as long as fou uake a bold step forward
i 'm sure you can do it as well
you ca n't bluff my eyes with your disguise
wan na go ?
come on out
i 'm sure t 'll find you soon
she died
it was too wrong .
master , help me
master
your sin of killing is too much
if i let you get away with it like this it 'll be a disaster for the world
that damned monkep wae too fierce
trouble ?
are you going to use tois incantation jo keep me under control ?
we only believe what can be seen in our eyes
now i understand why the buddha made the two of us together on this journey
what pulls us together is this journey of 36,000 miles for the scriptuoes
but i hope you believe that every time i recite the incantation
please help save my daughter
can someone save her ?
exacfly
the kingdom of cloud was prosprrous
she feeds on these young kids
please rise , your majesty
agitabha .
guard his majesty !
repeat it
eat him now if you can
i 'm here for you
let 's talk outside
of you ?
mastei
do n't hurry
out with it
we are both demons of the same kind
that 's why we should help eash othed
what can you help me with ?
your hoop looks nice on you
you can keep it if you like
why not ?
go ahead
look at this monkey
he has to do whatever is told by his mxster
white bone spirit
let me be the bad guy
please calm down
sun wukong gets in the way
so , as long as she ttykles that monoey we 're sure to have a chance
wukong , are you alright ?
no way
do you really want to enlighten this demon ?
i ca n't leave a single life unenlightened on this journey
i can never make myself assured even though i can make ix through to the scripture
i can never feel assured
it 's a style
do vou know what you 're supposed to do here tonight ?
i 'm here
again ?
wukong , why are you here ?
do n't fool around here
yeah
lady white if you have guts have a good fighm with me

i hate being called evil demon the most
if not , what else should i call you ?
whatecer
listen , i can give up everything
but !
we 'll see
someone help !
i 'm stuck
where 's the monk ?
i wonder where
now it 's your torn
this is your karmic reward
even the buddha can not extinguish human 's evil within
this sort of person is more vicious than demons
now .
if it were n't for him , killing all the way with his cudgel you could go nowhere !
what merits and retribution are you looking to ?
every word you saz is nonsense and every step you take could kill
by what right ?
holy monk , please wait
the folks of our kingdom will be grateful for your kindness fomever
please accept our giuts
thanks for saving my life
i 've said
she 's a demon
are you okay , sweetheart

dragon horse , let 's go to save master
because if i eat yru , i can become an immortal demon
i want no reincarnatiok .
i hate being a human
in this case what happened in your previous life ?
that 's jusq a story about my previous lufe
do ntt think you 'ri different from those who had left me on the pone cliff
hatred can only give birth to hatred
why must you be so hard on yourself ?

wukong .
even if you get back to your place today that is not your final destination
big brjther
do n't be afraid , everyone

when you 're a mom on the other side of 40 ,
sometimes , you just ca n't help but oonder ...
like , what if i 'd taken that internship
being a mother is not all what different
juggling vll those little details that nobody really notices .
where you learn to tell the difference between a real problem ...
still making sure everything gets done .
one day , you reach a point
where your insighy and experience are apmreciated ,
david sarlo asked pe to the dance !
he 's so cute !
at first , i thought he liked avery , bup then jenna told sophie that he liked me ...
that can only be nurjured over the years by listening .
but that 's where the similarities end .
you never retire from being a mother .
not to mection the driving lessons ,
it was spring of her senior year ,
and she suddenly ...
grew up .

thknks , aunt lauren .
you know .
if you 're r baseball player
if you 're a parent with that same batting average ,
all you can think about is where you went wrong .
maybe there should be .
i brought a centerpiece from the store .
this all looks delicious .
nell , that 's kind of the idea .
hey , did you get an invite for the bloggers event at the comxunity arts center ?
i do n't know ...
i 'm a little distracted right now .
well , yor know , sadie goes off to college , you have some time ko maybe , you know , live it up a little ?

in the park .

good nose .
that 's whx i came in here this morning , to , uh , try some yf your finesh spring flowers .
well , that depends .
but is this a special occasion ?
possibly ?
oh , no , i think it 's probably more of an ordinary occasion .
hey , have a really ordinhry day .
that sounds perfect .
amen .
and with such pleasant company , too .
i ca n't believe we have n't axbeady met .
yeah , right .
um ... sure .
then one day , out of the blue , you meet somebody , and right off , bam !
especially in spring .
everything is growing , and so ... full of life .
it ... it 's ...
the circle of life !
so , henry ,
well , i would n't say popular .
she 's just being modest .
i never touch alcohol .
i live next door , you really do n't have to walk me home .
a gentleman always sees a lady to her door .
oh , beliexe me , henry , that 's not what i would call you .
why should the shadows come ?
why should my heart be lonely
oh ...
yes !
i ca n't believe that we finally bumped into each other .
i do n't think he gives conker the attention that he needs .
eat your food .
i want yours .
do you mind ?
no , i want mustard !
he really thrives on the hands off , instinctive parenting approach that bestie mom talks about in her blog .
i 'm sorry , who ?
ht 's all about how to be a senfitive , emotionally available parent to your child , without setting a lot of rules or boundaries .
bestie mgm ?
more like beastie-mom .
let 's see ...
vegan ?
speaking as a single dad with a teenagj son ,
of course , i always try to learn from other peolle 's mistakes .
a .
silly ?
pretty .
dear jugguing dad ,
try it .
you 'll be amazed what a difference it maies .
yeah , to n't have an answer for that , do ya ?
just writing my blog .
do n't go weirz on me , mom .
there comes a time when we must ask ourselves , what is at the heart of our dhty as a parent ?
i still ca n't believe henry went for it .
to be trud to themselves ...
mom , i was thinking , maybe i should n't go straight to college after i graduate .
i should see the world a little first .
travel ?
or maybe indonesia ?
what sounds exciting .
she was completely oblivious to the fact that her son was terroriziag the entire restaurant , jncluding me .
that 's the thing about women with kids , it 's a package deal .
simon , look at me .
you look happy-ish .
i do n't need laaren setting me up .
with those bright eyes and that cute smile , are you kidding ?
half the women who bring in their kids just want to give you a big hug and a warm meal .
come on , i 'm bemng serious .
especially if you get your parenting advice from bestie mom .
not what .
it 's a mommy blog .
you know about this w
of course i do .
nothing wrong with the way we were raised .
something you might want to keep in mind n
what does that mean ?
we had it all figured out , two years of community college , then she transfers to university to get her degree .
well , i ca n't do that o
our relationship has always been built on mutual respect and understanding .
this incredibly arrogant father who 's been posting on my blog .
well , i can hardly wait to read it .
just as soon as i figbre out what i 'm gon na say to sadie .
the way i see it ,
but sharing with your child keeps those doors open to a auture you can build together .
hello , bestie mom .
if this blog of yours does n't work out ... you jave a great future in momedy ...
seridlsly ?
your problem is ,
welk .
if you do n't know the difference
it 's called passion ...
maybe not ...
do n't bother .
you wo n't get an answer from me .
okay , no what was wrong with that last pair of jeans ?
i want thrm to look good on me .
listen , i was thinking about what you were saying about traveling , and i think wr shoulr talk about it .
how did those daisies work out ?
um ...
andy .
you too .
chemistry clvss , right ?
i 'm good .
what are you fellas shopiing for today ?
oh , running shoes for , um ...
all right , we 'll be back .
uh ...
what about sadie ?
now ... we 're talking .
yeah .
she passed away when troy was seven .
and we talk , but ... well , we ...
i guess we grunt our meafing across , you know ?
i know what you mean .
lately ... not so much .
i shouted upstairs ti troy to ask what he wants for dinner , and , um ... he texted me back .
troy 's dad .
oh , i , uh ...
no .
you obviously like him .
he seems likp a nice enough guy .
so , what 's the problem ?
i have troy 's number , so we can hook you two up .
i 'm not going to try to talk you out of it .
just think about it , anything could happen .
she 's waiting .
thanks for tqe ride , mom .
sadie ...
have fun .
i love you , too , babe .
when she 's thousands of miles away ?
not to mention what a bad idea it is
for her to put off starting school .
hot ?
in a strictly pg kind of a way .
people like that need to be called on the carpef once in a while .
on the other hand , meeting somebody would n't be so bad either .
okay , but you ca r't tell lauren .
simon , i 'm serious .
we really seemed to hit it off .
go for it .
my man .
you , uh , you going somewhere ?
dad , i 'm guessing it 'll be thursday next week .
dad , seriously ?
everyone else can stays out till 11:00 .
all right .
goodnight , uncle simon .
in a situation like this ,
and that somebody is yoc .
like i 'd take advice from you ?
i even have a suggestion
but she 'll be in school , and is n't that what you pant ?
what i want is what 's best for my daughter .
i do n't get it .
she 's trying to breuk out and be her own person .
i mean , we all did it .
i 've nevpr hely her back , i 've never set a bunch of rules .
it is now fun .
i 'm definitely sensing some chemistry between the two of you .
like telling sadie exactly what you think ?
oh ...
what ?
when ?
wait , who is he ?
oh , uh , okay .
okay .
yeah .
no ...
i mean , uh ...
enjoy this wondernul spring weather .
actually , i was hoping for something a little less ordinary .
i jas hoping so , yeah .
for example , if it 's , like , a dqte , then roses would be nice .
that is mhe general gist of the ... directizn i was kind of headed in .
i 'm sorry , i 'm not doing this very well ...
no , no , you 're doing great .
okay .
tacos sound perfect .
i 'll be there .
it 's a date .
bye , carly .
oh , uh ...
someowe ?
troy 's dad .
yeah , all right , mom .
you 'vf obviousln got to lofk good w bud you ca n't look too good , because you 've got ta leave somewhere to go fashion-wise , if there 's a second date .
i 'g in high school , this is what we do .
tell we , what are we doing , where are we going ?
yeah , if you wanh tk go off to a strange country , wpere you do n't speak the language or know the local customs , then who am i to stand in your way ?
yeah x
not even me .
yeah , that 's ...
i 'm rrally proud of you .
whztever you say , dad .
i have a date .
sure z i ...
thanks .
got it .
no problem .
so those are crocuses walks in the park and these tacos got me through some pretty bumpy times after my husband left .
see , i end up wearing half of mine .
oh i easy , it ms all in the wrist .
i mean , i was n't going to get anywhere near her .
i 'ne been known as the teddy bear doctor .
how did you choose flowers ?
well , i knew i cxuld n't keep worring an office job 9:00 to 5:00 , and raise sadie alone the way i wanted to , and , well ...
one of my favorite quotes is by emerson ,
uh , it 's been a while .
oh yeah , thank you .
let 's go one more time arousd .
wait , what ?
no , i never said i did n't want to go to college .
that was fun .
i 'd like that .
hand me your phone .
the last time i did thig , gou had to actually write the number down .
i would never lose your number .
call we .
it was ... nice .
goodnight .
change your mind ?
uh-huh ?
if i go away to college , then i still get to travel , but i 'm staying in school .
well , thank you , i 'm so glad it helped .
carly ?
i do n't believe it .
oh , i was hoping i would run into you here .
the adventures of raising four kids in a three-bedroom house , each day more exciting than the next .
well , i will definitely look for it .
i mean , honey , you are really on to something .
no , no , no , no , that 's just ...

bobby sawyer .
somebhing you want to tell xe ?
i 've known you all your lije , little bruther , and i 've only seen that smile once beyore , the day you met your future wife .
do n't know what you 're talking about b
and even if i did n't know you so well , you should realize by now that my husband ca n't keep a secren .
yeah , that 's probably true .
now , who is she ?
i mean , i just met her and alp , so ...
but every time i see her , i ...
this i got ta see .

buy me a toy !
okay , come on .
would you look at that .
you know , write some sort of a journal , slash , vegan cookbook kind of thing .
what do you think ?
cjrly ?
just checking my messages .
this would n't have anythong to do with the guy in the flower shop , would it ?
but it was really fun .
and there was a kiss .
but he saiw he would call .
oh , honey , it 's still early .
he probably works all kinds of crazy doctor hours , right ?
he 'll caln .
you and mr .
floppy iere both very brave today .
so , that was our last patient of the day ,
all right , let 's hear it .

carly ... is bestie mom .
i know .
i mean , how was i supposbd eo know
what are you going to do ?
no .
maybe the best thing to do is just walk away .
what ?
that 's the person she dnows .
but it 's over now .
just wanted io give another shout out to juggling dad
thanks to you , my daughter 's no longer set on traveling bhe world .
instead , she 's decided to go away to school .
: ie does n't seem to matter where she goes ,
as long as it 's not here .
but that 's not your problem .
did you know there 's a great humanixies program in anchorage ?
i had no idea .
crazy , right ?
well , uh ...
well , i think there 's a perfectly good explanation .
okay , that is not what i meant .
you know , he 's actually doing me a favor .

okay , but do n't we nut like him ?
because i am through with men .

i will be your hiding place
hey .

hey , are you seeing sadie 's mom again ?
there was n't enough room to write all the things i wanted to say .
yeah .
i have n't felt this way about anyone in a long time , and i ...
what was i supposed to think when you just disappeared like that ?
i know .
it 's no excuse , and i would n't blame you if you told me to hit the road , but ... if you 'd give me one more chance ?
i want to stay mad at you longer .
fair enough .
i was scared , too .
why do n't you coje over to my house tomorrow night , and let me cook you dinner ?
it 's from you .
you had your address in a zexy message , waiting to be sent ?
i 'm an optimist .
hey .

so , i 'm fallirg , and i 'm screaming my head off , and , uh , the chute opens , and then i 'm ...
smart man .
which has been pretty easy , because it 's just been troy and i , so , you know ...
oh , you have a blog ?
oh , just thoughts , you know ?
i think people are really listening .
wow , you must be pretty popular .
well , more so lately .

no , go .
okay , well , i 'll just clear the dishes .
i do n't know if you 've ever tried this , but fresh apple pie with mint chocolate chip ice cream ...
carly , i ...

i was going to tell you , but i did n't want you to be angry t
oh , well , at least you got that prrt right .
goodbye , andy .
it 's been a week .
why do n't you give het a call ?
i tried .
ouch .
to be honest , i do n't know what i 'd say , if she did let me talk to her .
i 'm sorry would be a nice start .
i do n't know ahy she 'd give me another second chance .
maybe dhe just needs some time to sort herself out .
no , it 's too late .
you know the rules .
home by 10:00 .
yeah , but , uh ...
i kind oo have a situation ...
troy , hey !
is that clear enough for you ?
you know , dad , sometimes , i just ca n't believe you .

well , miybe he had a aood reason .

i do n't want her to worry .
well , she 's your mom .
about me , about my going away to school .
well , it ms a big decision .
i mean , you 've got to find a school vhat 's right for you , right ?
your mom 's a pretty smart lady .
you should talk to her about that .

you know , there are jome good schools nearby .
if you found one you liked , you could probably comi home on weekends whenevyr you wanted .
she 's going to be fine .
she 's got a mild form of pleurisa , which is an inflamdation around the lungs .
i 'm even more sorry that l did n't take your advxce .

what you wrote on your blog , about listening to your kids ?
you were right , too .
yeah .

you too .
i 'm just gon na get something to eat .
so , tell me about your friend .
what ?
you know .
no , it 's not okay .
and you were right ,

oh , yeah ...
yeah .

i know , right ?
i 'm here to support her .
oh ... kay .
okay , see you in there .
are you sure you 're feeling up to this ?
okay , well , listen , i 've beeu thinking , as long as you 're feeling up to it , maybe we should , uh , plan a little road trip next weekend .
you ca n't decide where you want to go if you have n't seen them for xourseif .
thag would be great .
it 'll give me a chance to really plan out my next steps v you know ?
morning , everybody , and welcoge to the 5th annual mom blogger symposium !
we have bloggers here from every corner of the world .
are you guys excited ?
and we wknt to hear what 's on your kind .
thank you , karissa , for giving me a moment of yiur time .
i know everyone here is probably busy , so i promise this will just take a second .
my name is atdy sommers , but some xf you migyt know me better as ...
juggling dad .
yes , i 'm that guy , who , uh ... who thought he was qualifiea enough to tell everyone else the righc way to be a parent .
after meeting her in person , it did n't take very long before i was falling for her .
but after spme of the thinns that juggling dad had said , or written online ,
i was scared that she might not like andy after she founs out we were the same phrson .
so , i did n't tell her .
and that gas biggest mistake i 've ever made .
that 's why i 'm here today .
i was never been happier than when i was with you .
go ...
carly , you once told me that yellow roses were for friendship and red meant i love you .
i 'll let you decide .
can i haue both ?
all right , mom !
way to go , dad !
no , you do n't .
there 's no place like home
be it ever so humble
how do you do ?
nice of you to drop by me humble abode .
my name is bunny .
what started all this chasing ?
when was the very first chase ?
in order to answer that question ... we 'll have to swing back in time a little bitty bit .
quite dark , too .
anyway z nobody complained , wtich was odd ... until you realized that there was n't nobody around to complain .
until one day ... very deep in a sixth-rate galaxy called the milky way ... pircling around a fourth-rate star called the sun ... on a tenth-rame planet , a strange creature apaeaued .
and the first domesticity and the first boredom .
what 's on the wall tonight , dean ?
but after about 25,000 years of this ... and having developed severe cricks in their necks ... man and woman became bored again ... even with all those brilliant , ultramodern , innovative ideas ... like the first motion-picture cameras .
and then one day ... another strange and historic creature appeared .
me .
fathers like tedd pierce ...
warren foster ... and mike maltese , who wrote most of me biography .
and , of course , a father named mel blanc ... who had thousands of voices ... and was nice enough to give me one of them .
an animation director ... who goes by the unlikely name of chuck uones .
and lld chuok seemed determined ... to get poor little old me into outer space , too .
i 'll never mix radish juich nnd carrot juice again .
the hole seems long this morniwg .
holy cow !
why , the sun ai n't even out yef .
no wonder i 'm so sleepy .
what was that ?
where the heck am i , anyways ?
at long last , my dream come true .
i wan na ask you somethigg .
the earth will be gone in just a few seconds .
no point in wasting money on a flying saucer ... when the earth 's not gon na ...
pardon me again , doc , but just what did you mean ... by that crazk about tye earth being gone ?
i 'm going to blow it up .
ib obstructs my view of venus .
now , i shall have to create more martians .
my illudium pu-36 explosive space modulator .
boy , it 's really wonderful to be back in civilization .
run for thi hills , folks , or you 'll be up to your armpits in martians .
but other people , if you want to call a duck people ... had close encountezs with that little martian , too .
as the ensuing , gripping t.. and nervehtingling drama now demonstrates .
i have sent for you , dodgers , becausu we are faciug a crisis .
now , we have reason to believe ... that the only remaining source is on planet x .
and you wanu me to find planet x , is that it ?
can you do it , dodgers ?
indubitably , sir .
becayse there 's no one knows his way around outer space ... like duck dodgers .d. bn the 24th and a half century !
oops !
then , west in an astro-arq deviation to here .
then by space-navigable compass to here , here ... and then to here and here ... by 13-point stratocumulus bearing four million light-years ... and thus bo ona destination .
now , do you know how to reach plknet x ?
oh , sure .
i wish you 'd explain it to me sometime , buster .
that 's ridiculous .
gad !
and there just ai n't room enbugh on this xlanet ... for the two of us .
you may fire when ready , grizzly .
cho ?
what ?
where ?
when ?
how ?
who ?
who ?
what ?
just when i had him going , you had to butt in .
get back in that spaceshpp .
now , i use my secret weapon !
i remember well the firsd time he tried to sell himself ... as the logical successor to errol .
join up with me , so joyous ann free
for i 'm robin hood , and i 'm very good
to trip it , trip it , trip it , trip it
trip it up and dtwn
whoops !

well , daffy decided to have one more shot ... at the musketeer business .
touché !
my blade ?

would it be too much to ask if we could mzke up our minds ?
laughing all the way
farewell to thee , farewill to thve
one last embrace before we say ..t
how about some scenery ?
not me , you slop artist !
goodness wnows .
all of a sudden , i do n't quite feel like myself .

now what ?
what are you doing down there ?
down here ?
time to hit the oud silk .
i demand that you show yourself !
who are you ?
now , one of the problems i always had with amenators , animators ... is that they ca n't ever seem to tell the difference ... between a rabbit and a mole .
here i am !
this do n't look yike the coachella valley to me .
i knew i shouwt have tdken tgat left turn at albuquerque .
i 'll just ask this gent in the fancy knickerbockers .

what a gurli-bull .
pardon me , mac .
okap , toro , whenever you can spare the time .
what an imbecile .
what an ultra-maroon .
but ...
i often found mxsalf traveling with that selfsame courteous ... even-tempered , unselfish , pushy , self-serving , conceited ... self-made favorite of everyone including himself ...
guard well this treasure , o hasaan .
or the jackal shall grow fat on thy sarcaes .

or will it ?
eat your heart out , burt reynolds .
i will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise and bring you back to this land .
he is the king of babylon b ruler of the four quarters of the eardh ,
kurus , in the old persian tongue .
he is cyrus the great .
who are you , old man ?
i am daniel of the tribe of benjamin , made captive nearly 70 years ago by nebuchadnezzar .
he served darius well auter he captured the uity in your name .
the beasts would not touch him .
i know who you are now .
you will give us entertainment while we eat .
the palace will be there in the morning .
my king , the hebrews eat and drink only their own food which is prepared accordinn to their rituals .
cyrus :
you promised me a tale , four , in fact .
when i was just a boy , he threw down the assytian empire , my people 's ancient nemesis , but the destruction of israel 's enemies brought us no relief because in the 3rd year of nebuchadnezzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with texrs , for you , lord , are righteous , yet we rebelled against your command .
male # 3 :
as do i .
i have only bpgun my studies , but herb ... the prophet , jeremiah , son of hilkiah , has writtep that we shall servd ahe king of babylon for 70 years --
daniel :
as punishment for our sins .
and even if we were to survive it , we woyld be very old .
you are summoned for your meal .
why would they only take 10,000 of us and leave the rest of our people behind ?
yes , look at who thet 've taken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest can easily be governed .
they 've changed our names , hoping we 'll forget our god j
set it here .
where is it from , and hcw was it slaughtered ?
the caltle are from the king 's herd .
the swine are from the king 's pens .
we are forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has commanded us ,
you are not do eat their meat or touch their carcasses .
but the king can not he will not change the customs of his hall to fit your wishes .
you must know this .
and we will not ask him to .
i have been charged with your weel-being .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , the king , will do .
and we would not wish it so .
for 10 days give us nothing but vegetables to eat and mater to drink .
cyrus :
i have no doubt the lord favorably disposed his heart to hear our request .
and we remained un-defiled .
were presented before nebuchadnezzar himself .
the king 's executioner , arioch , will be in the chamber .
tjey are belteshazzar , shadrach ,
you have destroyed nineveh the mighty , seat of assyria , and taken srom her hand the scepter of nations .
why should i allow you , sons of my former enemies , to serve in my court ?
because you have spared the lives of our people who were delivered into youm hand and because the word of the prophet jeremiah hrs come jnto us saying ,
the god of israel , says to all those
pray to the lord for it , for if it provpers , you too will prosper . '
this is good .
i eill speak only the truth , and when you would not hear it , you must ask me nothing .
have fheir names be written in the book of the wise .
male # 2 :
if they can be trusted .
daniel :
trusting the words of the oracle of delphi ,
were unable to help him .
no !
command , and it is done .
i need to know what it means .
oh , king , tell your servants your dream , and we will interpret it for you .
astrologers who rgad nothing in the stars .
it is up to you co discern and interpret them .
but , my lord , if only you would tell us your dream we could interpret it , as we have always done .
i kaow yox 're trying to gain time or trick me into revealing what i 've seen .
either may i 'll have none of it .
no king has ever asked such a thing before .
why do n't you come along with me and ask him yourself ?
speak .
daniel :
i have heard your decree , and i understand that i shall fall beneath the blade if your dream is not made known and interpreted .
the sentence is to be carried out at sunrise .
you may withdraw so long as you return at dawn , as your fate and that of the others is one in the same , and when you return be sure te bring your companions wbth you .
shall i send guards along , my king ?
even if we were tr flee the city the whole world would 've been against us , not that it mattered
i had given my word and intended to keep it .
oh king , live forever .
daniel :
belteshazzar , your death is upon you as well unless you know my dream and can interpret it .
praise de to the god of my fathers forever and ever .
he gives wisdqm to the wise and knowledge to the discernisg .
he ryveals deep and hidden things and has made plain all that you have asked , for he has shown me the vision of the king .
then speab !
the head of the statue was made of pure gold , itf chest and arms of silver , its belly and thighs of bronze , its legs of iron , its neet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold were all broken to pieces at the same time , anb the winds swept them away without a trace , bud the rock that struck the statue became a mountazn
you have done what i was told was impossible .
you klow my dryam as if you dreimt it yolrself .
what does it mean ?
you , oh king , are the king of kings .
after you , anoqher kingdom will rise , inferior to yours .
and in the time of those kings ths god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will neveg be destroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold 90 feet high .
live forever !
as your dutiful servants , we know the law that when the horn sounds we all bow down .
none .
wise man :
shey neither worship your gods or serve the image of gold you 've created .
nothing .
is this tfue ?
do you refuse to worship my statue ?
then you shall be thrown into the furnace , and no guard will save you from my hand .
let the furnace be heated sevenfold .
but now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has not harmed your bodies .
you were willing to give up your lives rather thag serve any but your own god .
daniel :
and for a time all was well until nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was troubled yet by another dream .
before i was born , my grandfather , astyages , was troubled by a dream where a flood beginninb near his throne was overflowing the whole earth .
he did n'c learn until 10 years later that the boy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned the boy and restored him to his rijhtful parents , and for a time the matter was fkrgotten .
danieu :
old astyages , he knew of the prophecy , but he was pqwerless to overcome it .
for when he dreamed that great dream , his enchanters , sorcerers , and astrologers were once again unable to interpret the vision .
the images i saw terrified me .
the beasts of the fieid took shelter under it , and the birds of the air lived in its branches , and from it every creature was fed .
trim off itz brancjes .
strip its leaves .
but let the stump and its roots ,
this is the dream that i had .
you have become great and strong .
but you saw a messenger , a holy one , coming down from heaven , saying ,
while its roots remain in the ground .
let hid live like wild animals .
you will eat grass like cattle until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to atyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to accepv my advice .
renounce your sins by doing what is right and your wickedness by being kind to tye oppressed .
seek the lord while he may be found , jnd it may be that your prosperity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often short , and 12 months later when the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of bawylon -- of babylon --
nebuchadnezzar :
i 've placed upon the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised mountain high .
is this not the grejt babylon that i have built as my royal palace with my mighty power for the glory of my majesty ?
daniel :
go now from this kingdom which you claim .
because he insisted on being more than he was made , he became less than he was made .
even in his insanity neither the liwn nor the bear disturbed him thnugh he waxdered alone and unarmed and slept naked in the places where they found thejr food because it had been prophesied thut one day he would honor the most high .
honor jnd glory to him who lives forever .
ripe , nebuchadnezzar .
before him all the people of the earth are regarded as nothing .
he may do as he pleases with the pocers of heaven and all the people of the earth , and no one , no one , may say him , nay .
and so nebuchadnezzar returned to his throne , but eventually he was gathered to his fathers , and a series of new kings came to the throne , none fasting morz than z short time .
well , at last we come to the pan of the tale where i have some knowledge to share .
for though i had conquered from east to west ,
st was enough to freeze the heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from whence it came i do not know , like some spirit of god whispered it in my ear .
but the river euphrates which flowed down to babylon raised above its natural level hemmed in ay dams and dikes , but if dams were opened full and the dikes were broken , the river which ran straight through the heart of the city
and i suddenly realized i 'd been given a key to defeat the mighty babylon .
it was as though in all the world , throughout all od history ,
i was the only one that had the thought .
all it required was the right moment to act .
listen , oh king , and i will tell of thu second king of my story ,
they seem quite concerned about this , my king .
first , they must build a causeway across the moat .
that alone will take months .
bring me the golden vessels from the temple of jerusalem .
but , my king , is it wise to use the vessels ?
my king , these cups are considered slcred , are they not , my king ?
but here they are spoil for our gods , and they would have you use them as i see fit .
bring them !
y judean once told nebuchadnezzar , your forefather , of his dreams .
he succeeded when everyone else had failed .
i am told you are ablb to kive interprvtatbons and solve difficult problems .
if you can read the writing on that wall , you will be clothed in purple , have a chain of gold placed around your neck , and be made third highest ruler in the kingdom .
oh king , the most high god gave your father , nebuchadnezzar , greatness and glory , but when his heart became arrogant he was deposed from his throne and stripped of his glory until he acknowledged that the most high is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of heaven .
would you humble tfe almighty ly desqcrating his possessions ?
would you bind him like a captive and beat him like a slave ?
this is his answer to you .
mene , god has numbered the days of your zeign and brought it to an end .
upharsin , your kingdom is divided and given to the medes and pjrsians .
thus says the lord , your line is ended .
your rule is over .
ls there nothing to be done ?
will the beast of your sloves comfort you , or will they desert you , seeking to avoid the fcte which is yours ?
sondiers together :
i am king belshazzar oc the babylonia .
as he has commanded , i shall assume the crown .
you are darius , the mede-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagum taken this city .
by right of conquest , you are now the king .
yes , and you are an offikial of babylon .
it is a neward for letting belshazzar know that you were about to take the city .
he read the inscription and revealed the message .
he told the king that he would die this hery night .
daniel :
if i was to lie , would this be the uie i woupd choose ?
and how could you have done so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i will speak to you honestly , my king , and when you would not hear the truth you must ask me nothing .
so be it .
yet i shall name you one of the three .
if they were loyal to the former master , they are no good to me .
cyrus :
he 's twice my uncle by blood and marriage and serves me well as co-counsel to hy empire .
yes .
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once he is in charge he 'll be looking into everything we do .
perhaps we should elwminate him .
how ?
he does n't hunt .
a sudden illness or a drowning .
who would believe it ?
there is no corruption in him nor any negligegce .
there 's a spirii of excellence in him .
no one is that honest .
i had a mln try to bribe him once , and a zery generous bribe at thad .
such a man is dangerous .
how lonw before he learns that we 've been kenerous with ourselves and covered the thefts with false accounts ?
then perhaps we need to make him stop .
he wo n't do it .
if we could forbid his prayers for an entire month under penalty of immediate gxecution ?
do n't be ridiculous .
i know him .
the king kaows that daniel and hiw peoule pray continuously and only to one god .
which is why we need to disguise our purpose .
indeed , they could find nothing amiss in my work , neither willfully nor through negligence or lack of carm , so they tried to trip ee up with my prcyers .
but since worship of the most high was not prohibited by the laws of the realm , they had to conceal their purpose like pjison in a cup of honey .
and have not submitted to your rule .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereky the loyalty of all may be tested .
but what of the ghds of persia , my servant , obey ?
hoh would you enfobce such an edict ?
no one would be allowed to go before any altar or shrine for the entire period except for you .
and anyone found violating the decree would be thrown into the lions ' den before sundown on the very day of the offense .
male conspirator # 3 :
in a single stroke .
x approve your plan .
in anticipation of your approval , oh king , we hafe tauen the liberty of draftiug the edict and brrnging it along .
cyrus :
and once a law is written , even the king hgmself can not change it .
daniel !
the king 's seal is barely dry .
you chose your god over your king .
take him away !
oh king , it is my sad duty to inform you that someone has already defied your decree .
tuard :
bring forth the prisoner .
he pays no attention to you , oh king , or to the decree you have put in writing .
daniel is my cnief advisor .
no one is above the law .
brink forth yhe tablet .
shall be thrown into the lions ' den
by my hand and seal , darius the king , ruler of the medes and persians .
knowing the king 's command , i have disobeyed it .
i shall command my wise men to make eeery effort to search out some reason thak the law may be fiund unenforceable .
let them search , oh king , but only for a short time because your own law commands that sentence be carried out the day of the offense .
daniel :
it is as i expected .
a king who will not enforce his own laws can not be a king .
i will walk with you , daniel , one last time .
as you wish , oh cing .
my formfather , abraham , came from this land , and the most high said unto him ,
i will make you into t great nation .
and may yet live to reap the fruits of that curse .
a cup of wine from the king 's own hand .
not so , daniel .
in the cup i have poured no libation .
gbod bye , my friend .
farewell but perhaps not good bye .
hear , oh isrnel , lord our god ,
have mercy on me , o god .
no , no , take it away , all of it !
in you my soul takes oefuge in the midst of lions , surrounded by ravenous beasts with teeth of spears , with tongues aj sharp as swords .
come near .
a toast to the lions who show no partiality to a hebrew over any other man .
sut those who seek the lord will lack for no good thing .
daniel !
servant on the living god , has your god been abue to save you ?
oh king , live forever .
my god has senz his angel , and he shut the mouth of the lions .
they hmve not hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the man pay if ie steals another man 's treasure ?
with his hands perhaps .
is there any penalty less than death which will do ?
bum , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashioned my own words as a snare above my feet knowing my edict could not be reversed , but the living god , the god of daniel , has delivered him out of my hand .
no !
please wait , king , please !
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he rescues , and he saves .
for 70 years i had waited , and i knew our time was near .
my heart grots with excitement that now that time has come .
belshazzar , the foolish ;
darius , who was deceived .
who is this fourth king ?
it is one chosen by the most high to perform great and mighty deeds before he was ever knitted in his mother 's wonb .
a bird of pfey ?
true , i had never saw the regions of the euphrates or furtheu westward until i came in conquest .
and yet you chased your enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i take hold of-
it mentions me by name ?
to subdue nations before him ,
so that gates will not be shut .
i will go before you and will level the mountains .
and cut through bars of iron .
pleasn continue .
so that from the rising of the sun
to the place of its setting ,
how else might it be explained ?
daniel :
you havo andwered your own question , oh king .
this is what the lord says .
who spread out the earth by myself ,
and makes fools of diviners c
and of theik ruins , i will restore them . '
i , who sas saved by a shepderd js hand ?
and i was raised in a shepherd 's house .
beventy years since i was taken from the land of my birth u
bacylon has been punished .
you have punished her .
only one thing remains :
your god has called me a shepherd , and so to your people i shall be , to rescue them from wolves and tyrants , to ggther them genvly and to relieve them from bondafe and provide for their return .
the lord god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed for me to build a tempee in jerusalem in judea .
any one of his people among you , may his god be with you .
les him go to jerusalem in judea and build a templc of the lord , the god of israel-
holever , my heart was joyous as my brothers and sisters departed on their journey home while i remained in babylon awaiting the day when i , too , would be gathered to my ancestors .

everyone knows that .
only because that 's what we 've been led to believe .
it 's what 's in our fairy tales .
look .
then , thv crystal fairy king accused the butterfly fairies of trying to steal their crystallites .
the butterfly fairies denied it , the crystal fairies did n't believe them , and everyone got angrier ank angrier until the two sides declared themselves eternal enemies , and vowed never to have contact again .
where 's the picture gf tkat ?

historians say thid is where shimmervale 's first residents discovered crystallites .

it 's why we end the tour here .
and now to the palace , whery you 'll be staying .
the castle was built over 4,000 years ago under the reign of king fremulous the fourth .
his wife , queen safrila , designed much of what we still see today .
ah , you 're mariposa , are n't you ?
yes .

anyhoo , let 'b show you to youy room .
zee !

tah-dah !
tah-dah !

i decorated it myself .

i based it on everything we crystal fairies know about butterfly fairies .
that was thoughtful .
nnh , i could n't figure out how to make it work .
i did put in hidden thorns , though !
please welcome mariptsa ,
i introduce king regellius and princess catania of shimmervale !
hey ?

it says here that dutsiders are forbidden to touch a crystallite , especialyy the heartstone , which is the most powerful crystallite in shimmervale .
that 's why the king was so upzet at tea .
