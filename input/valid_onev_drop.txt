gosh .
yeah .
well , we 'd better hurry .
hope thy 're expecting us .
all right , gentlemn , we 've all had ur say , and we all agree on this one vitl point , w are clamping a tight security lid on professr brainard 's tremendous contribution .
oh , you 'll be recompensed .
goodness knows , the armed services are never chintzy .
matter of fact  i 'm putting two of my bravest financial officers on the mission .
professor , you are a fine , unselfish man .
it 's a privilege to know you .
but just relax .
no sweat .
the money is as good as in your hands .
schedule four s going in .
well , professor , i do n't think we need to take up any more of your tme .
we have to stockpile statistics , build up pressure , deploy ur firepower so we hit them from all directions .
well , no , i do n't suppose we do .
do n't let those double-breasted suits fool you .
those boys are tough .
well , the thing is , we do n't need all the money nw .
it 's big .
everything about it .
evrything is going to fall apart all the way down the line , and the free world loses another battle .
is that what you want ?
no , i would n't want that , sir .
remember , you 're in washington 
stop trying to be reasonable about money or yu 're going to bollix up the whole thing .
you 'd think those people at the pentagon could at least have given us a couple of $ 100,000 out of petty cash .
what 's gon na happen , professor ?
h , roger .
i 'm sorry , biff .
i got ta face it .
the only tme my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was whn he got me .
is n't it magnificent , gentlemen ?
medfield college has , i believe the saying goes , finally come into the chips .
why do n't you just chang the name of the place to brainard college and have done with it ?
a splendid idea , mr. hawk , though i ralize it was offered in a spirit of irony .
we 'll be up to our hips in crackpots .
no .
are n't you all getting a little high and mighty ?
oh , splendid .
ask him to come in , please .
gentlemen  would you be good enough to rise ?
when professor brainard comes in that door ,
i mean you , uh ...
well , you really should n't .
well , not exactly .
it 's just ...
they really sandbagged you .
they hung your hide up on the barn door to dry .
well ...
but i thought they were delighted with your discovery .
it 's just that ...
number on , the boys in washington latched on to your little discovery , so you ca n't sell t anywher else .
number two , they 're not about to give you any money until they think it over .
number three , meantime , you 've got no money .
number four , sombody better lay 350,000 clams on the barrelhead , first of the month by 9:00 a.m .
period .
end of story .
i ca n't believe you 'd do a thng like that , mr. hawk .
well , boys , it looks like i 'm calling the tune again .
i know how badly you must feel , president daggett , but things are n't as bad as they seem .
excus me .
as a civic leader ...
pearls !
h , i just love pearls .
i make it my business to know , mrs. brainard .
and now , little something to kep the chill off .
oh !
oh , you must n't .
well , you do n't think it 's a little bit too fussy , do you ?
like you 've been wearing it all your life , mrs. brainard .
and here , the finishing touch .
an empress .
i do , do n't i ?
this , as you can see , is a check for one million dollars made out to the professor and yourself .
for a kind word , mrs. brainard .
you know , n a business dal , the right word from the little woman ...
i 'm a great believer in the power of a woman .
you really got something , mr. hurley .
well , i do n't know what ned 's going to say about all this 
for a space-age scientist , he 's a little bit old-fa ..
guess who ?
betsy !
what i 'd like to do ...
betsy , what s all this the dogs and that coat ?
please take it off .
now why do n't we let the little lady enjoy herself ?
mr. hurley is a lve wire .
professor , when you invented this stuff , i do n't think you dreamed what you had .
do n't be so modest , professor .
that 's your trouble .
that 's where i come in .
flubbermint gum , it chews while you snooze .
flubberin , bounces away pain again and again 
hit them where they live .
they ll wonder how they got along without it .
howie  roll the film .
guess what this is ?
but , betsy ...
hi there .
newton and the law of gravity .
watt and the steam engine .
edison and the electric light .
and , my friends ,
brainard and flubber .
for it was not too long ago , in a small american city , that the discovery of flubber brst upon a waiting world .
that was the bginning .
from those first crde basketball shoes came more shoes , shoes for people in every walk of life .
he could walk with his head above the crowd .
but this was only the springboard , not only to  vast new line of products  but to a happier , safer way of life .
friends , is your home a booby trap just waiting to snare you the moment you set foot in it ?
i 'm home , der .
is your kitchen a savage jungle teeming with perils and pitfalls ?
dear , where 's the first-aid kit !
stop clowning , george .
transform it frm a booby trap into a love nest 
yes , flubberize yur home with hazard-free flubberoleum floors .
the foamiest , friendliest floor that ever fondled your family 's feet .
hi .
sweetheart !
i got him !
they live in the house with the flubberoleum floors .
i 'm very impressed  mr. hurley , but ...
now if you ll just sign ths letter of agrement .
that million-dollar check is the evidenc of our good faith .
a prior commitment ?
with who ?
ll right , boys , pack up the gear .
the party 's over .
forget it .
you 've hurt mr. hurley very deeply .
oh !
now just a minute .
do i have to give this bck ?
i wo n't !
now give him his check .
betsy , give me that check .
give it to me .
oh , very nice .
beautiful quality .
how do you do ?
my name is harker .
from washington ?
well , am i glad to see you .
come right in .
how do you do ?
it 's very nice to know yu , mrs. brainard .
may i take your ht and coat , mr. harker ?
you and your discovery have certainly crated quite a stir down in our nation 's capital .
and you 've come about the payments ?
well , thank you .
oh , but first , of course , we 'd like to pinch off just a tiny bit for ourselves .
just enough to take care of the househld bills that hav been stacking up for months .
all right , dear ?
internl revenue ?
the figure includes delinquent penalties of $ 12,895 at five percent for the first two quarters .
let me explain , mr. harker .
now they put a top-secret classification on it .
i 'm not even supposed to talk t anybody about it .
certainly .
excuse me .
we 've been counting on yo .
we trusted you .
you do n't build those rockets to the moon with green stamps , you know .
excuse me , dear .
joy 's here to collect for the paper .
i do n't thnk so .
there 's ten cents .
there 's another dime .
he wants his money .
thre 's another dime .
that s all i 've got .
we 're rooting for him all the way .
oh , ned , i cleaned all the loose change out f there .
oh .
but uncle sam has to run his store on current incme just like everyone else .
when the money he 's counting n does n't come in , he 's very sad .
thank yo , mr harker .
thank you .
thank you , mrs. branard .
h , joey marriano .
and how many customers would you say he has on his route ?
oh , i 'd say around 30 .
you would n't take money from a child .
w do our part to keep the wheels of democracy rolling .
funny yo should mention that about mom .
we nailed her dead to rights .
i missed you .
i missed you , too .
i just could n't help feeling sorry for all those people .
now  you take that income tax man .
we 're citizens .
now sit down , and hold your breath 
oh ?
what does that mean , you got hold of the weather ?
what it means , mrs. brainard , is that flubber was only the key that unlocked a great storehouse of cosmic forces .
i found a gas .
do you relize wht that would mean , betsy ?
it would mean tht , for th first time , weather would become the slave of man , rather than his master .
ca n't it be something modest that would bring just a few dollars into this house ?
or trash can lids that would actually fit the top of trash cans !
trash cans ?
i 'd say i could use a little machine like that right now !
anything can happen .
anything !
i thought you were nuts !
right .
and they 're practically national champs , right ?
right .
even my own father could n't close a colleg that had just clobbered the national champs , could he ?
what do you think the suit is for ?
i have n't bn hangin ' around professor brainard all semester just for kicks , you know .
what 's this thing supposed to do ?
how does that feel ?
oh , hi , prof .
good .
oh , by the way , professor ,
oh .
glad to know ya , humphrey .
hi there 
oh , not exactly .
sir , science needs brilliant young minds like humphrey .
besides , i needed a volunteer .
for what ?
sir , i hope you wo n't mind , but  'd like very mch to borrow a little flubber gas .
humphrey , come on , demonstrate .
there 's nly thing , biff .
i do n't know how much protection those pads are going to give you .
oh , we 're not thinking about protection .
we 're thinking abot offensive power !
just imagine , sir .
the teams line up .
the ball is snapped .
rutland linemen fall like ten pins in every direction !
he 's over for a touchdown !
yeah !
whaddya think , sir ?
i think you 're slightly nuts .
you go right ahead .
we 'll go on a crash program right now .
thank you  sir .
now the flubber gas is violent , but we need even more violence  so we stimulate it electronically .
now , let 's see what we 've got .
now let 's see .
you know , biff , this stuff is labeled dangerous .
oh , now , humph boy .
look , would i get you into a situation unless i knew exactly what i was doing ?
that shold do it .
i 've never seen them so worked up .
when i bombard a cloud with  beam like this , it just has to lead to clustering .
rain all over the plce .
now , for a cloud .
not a cloud in the sky .
ready .
aim .
charlie brainard !
betsy .
betsy .
and that 's only the beginning .
it 's a result of my fooling around with the molecular configuration of flubber gas .
ll i ask of you is to get dressed for dinner .
whatever you say , dear .
oh , did n't i tell you , dear ?
no , i d n't think you did .
if there 's one thing i 'm certain yu 're not , it 's narrow-minded .
it is n't as though he were coming all by himself .
we 're adults , you know , not chldren .
you do n't for one single minute mean ...
i 'll get it .
nzzie !
it 's wondrful to ...
who is that ?
as soon as they unglue themselves ,
i 'd like you to meet an old friend of ned 's .
now wait a minute .
i do n't know any ...
i 'll be darned .
i 'll be doggone .
betsy , do you know who this is ?
no , nuzzie , who is it ?
it was long before i met you  betsy .
by gosh , mary lee , you 've changed .
well , i 've been married here and there , and , uh ,
paris , huh ?
did n't you know that ?
gosh , we used to have the times , did n't we , mary le ?
betsy , there was one time when mary lee and i ...
well , i guess that 's all water under the bridge , huh ?
well , uh , desire was back in town , and i said to myself ,
old wood burns brightest ,
that 's très continental .
it 's so interesting seeing the kind of grl ned married .
well ...
a fnny thng happened out in the lab today ...
we 're so diffrent , you and i. i 'm the gay , irrpressible madcap flitting from flower to flower , and you 're the nice , snsible little homemaker .
n'est-ce pas ?
the wonderful thing about betsy is , she combines beauty with brains .
i think betsy 's sweet .
i think she 's just as sweet as she can be .
you know , i do n't think you realize how lucky you ar .
i had to go through three marriages before i realized that ned was the kind of man i was looking for all along .
oh , is that so ?
sometimes i get all choked up inside thinking of it .
imagine going all the way to the other side of the world when the bluebird of happiness was here all along .
oh , i 'm sorry , desiree .
yes .
poor , brave child .
what do you mean ?
there 's no reason to pretend with us .
what 's it to you ?
it so happens i have just ben made
that 's terribly kind of yo , and very flattering .
now , lt 's have no foolish pride 
just a minute , ned .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like a chance to express myself .
ned i did n't say i was going to take the position .
that is an absurdly old-fashioned atttude .
could i have an onon nstead of an olive this time ?
excuse me .
oh .
if i 'd married him , i wold have just spoiled him rotten .
you should n't take it this way , brainard .
after all , what are friends for ?
here we go .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do n't wish to pry , but may i inquire what this marvelous new discovery is ?
it 'll effect people all over the world .
my i ask how it works ?
i bmbard the clouds with a technique
i am not at the moment at liberty to divulge .
oh , i see .
biff !
biff !
tht is original thinking .
humphrey , ar yu all right ?
answer or i 'll blast you to ribbons .
nobody in here but us chickens .
dinnr 's ready when you are .
fine .
flubber gas has a certain antagonizing effect on th atmosphere .
yeah ?
and today i 'm really going to stir it up 
lke tht big , fat clod out there .
come on , humph .
let 's get suited up .
will you stp worrying so much ?
well , why could n't you test the suit with a chimpanzee ?
they need it there to .
switch on .
all right , here we go .
now ...
cry a little 
maybe we 're going to have a change in the weathr , dar .
ys .
just nothing .
well , you ca n't blame betsy .
no !
i just do n't see how you can bring yourself to sell it .
let 's see .
there 's 40 , 60 ...
broken windows ?
sure , captain .
sure .
hnson  kelly !
somebody answer me !
i hear water !
we 're just gettin ' the car washed .
no , no , no !
we do nt pay off on that !
read the small print !
hold on .
now look .
and that goes for all of ya !
absolutely nothing .
you can come out now , charlie .
well , charlie , maybe i was wrong .
it wo n't be the first time we 've struck out , will it ?
hey , where do we put this stuff ?
our test site 's over here .
what 's the big secret ?
you 'll find out soon enugh .
rainmakers have always run into that same old snag .
wait a minut , charlie .
or could it ?
now , this must have integrated the vaprific forces and promoted the coalescence of the interatomic junctures .
poor lamb .
oh , yes .
hugs and kisses .
rrvederci .
well , that puts the tin hat on it !
gt , dh .
we 've made our own cloud !
and it 's raining !
oh , my notes .
now i know how those texas oil fellas feel when a gusher comes in .
where 's my pen ?
hey , come on , biff .
you know , this is nt the first time we 've been roped in on some half-baked idea of yours .
you know , it was n't my idea entirely .
the professor 's in on this too .
just as good as 
'cause if the prof says it 's okay ... raining you know it 's raining
betsy !
betsy !
betsy , i made a cloud , and i made it rain .
ut f the moisture in th air around us .
well ..
speaking of things going on under our noses , have you been seeing desiree de la roche ?
i may have bumped into her a couple of times .
she phoned a while ago , mentioned something about a little get-together tomorrow night .
said that you 'd know all about it .
why , i have n't the ...
wait a minute .
thr was some talk about a party .
ha !
i was on my way home from class , and she just happened to be driving by ...
what ?
if i was n't such a sweet , innocent-minded little wife ,
mary lee ...
do me a personal favor and stop calling that woman a girl !
well , anyway , underneath all that glmour and gaiety and intelligence is really a simple , kind-hearted person .
betsy , i hate to say this , but i 've noticed a change in you lately 
it all seemed to start the night that sneak shelby ashton came over nd hre offered you that jb 
i told you  did n't want that job , but i m beginning to change my mnd .
betsy , are you gong somwhere ?
if it were n't for that , i 'd know exactly what to do .
yes , i m gong somewhere where i can think clearly .
think clearly ?
desre does n't mean anything to me , betsy .
well , yu should 've heard her on the phone when she thought she was talking to you .
but , betsy , that 's just her way .
ned , i 'm going to the daggetts ' for a few days .
betsy .
betsy , you ca n't go anyplace .
i did n't do anything to it .
please , betsy  ca n't we reason this out ?
but , betsy , you 're not being very logical about this .
ready , humph ?
oof !
who 's n there ?
that 's t .
i quit .
look , after all you 've been through , you 're not gon na turn chicken .
you 'd better answer it , mrs. daggett .
afraid to talk t him ?
why does nt somebody pick up that phone ?
is this the , uh , daggett residence ?
ja .
new maid , by golly .
oh .
well , hulda , may i speak to mrs. brainard , please ?
she invited many parties .
very popular ,  think .
oh ?
friendless , hungry .
there s nothing to eat in the house .
i think i hang up now .
as far as she 's concerned , i could starve to death .
there must b something to eat in this house .
dandy .
sorry , charlie .
mmm .
there 's just not a thing in the house .
trick or treat .
except these chocolates .
yes , we do .
hey , that 's some crazy radiator cap the professor 's got there .
wll  science mrches on , but not on an empty stomach , huh ?
grat !
yeah !
oh , i 'm sorry , prof , but the hot water bottles did n't work , and we had to blow every cent we had on the scuba suit .
god , i wish we were invited to one of those halloween parties around here .
i bet they got lots of eats .
now , let 's see .
help me get that old trunk off of the shelf , huh ?
but how 'bout humph and m ?
just a little something in case i get hungry later .
two longs and a short .
i 'll get t .
boo !
trick or treat !
well , we do n't want any tricks around here , do we ?
here 's some nice popcorn .
oh , boy !
popcorn !
potato chips .
i like potato chips !
i want a drmstick .
jiggers !
ther 's a tub of martinis in here , and everybody 's bobbing for lves .
it 's just terrific that you brought your saxophone .
oh , well ...
boys , i 'd like you t meet the finest saxophone player in the history of medfield high school .
now go on , nuzzie .
play .
it 'll be just like old times .
well , if you fellas do n't mind .
the same sweet clown .
i 'm so glad to see that girl has n't changed you .
a bit of gaiety will do you good .
god evening .
good evening , sir .
good evening , madam .
he 's so helpless all by himself .
hello , fredrick .
may i take your coat , madam ?
betsy !
excuse me , please !
betsy !
what in the world are you doing here ?
i might ask the same thing of you .
well , i was .
but there is an instinct called self-preservation , you know .
under crtain conditions even the lowest form of animal life will go searching for food .
look , neptune , why do n't you just submerge ?
you see  brainard , you 've already spoiled the party for her .
now why do n't you leave betsy alone ?
ashton , if you do n't stay out of this ...
some kind f a peasant , are n't you ?
wait , betsy ...
come on , nuzzie .
i did n't want to hurt you .
as the poet says , the hurt is not so deep as a well ,
nor so wide as a church door ,
but 't is enough  'twill serv 
i 'm sorry , shelby .
okay , charlie .
oh , say , captain , we want to thank you again for this new prowl car .
do n't worry  captain .
officer !
t 's that fiend , brainard !
he 's up there  somewhere !
bright and early , professor .
mr. hawk !
plate glass in stores , utomobile windshields , bottles , clock faces , glass of every kind and descriptin began to break and shatter in various portions of our community .
as yu see , they formed a pattrn , a sort of cone-shaped pattern of devastation , as thogh some unseen force had fanned out from ne beginning point , at a place on the corner of mple and litchfield .
now , i may be wrong , professor , but is n't that the precise point on which i 'm standing at this very moment ?
but outside of making me feel good all over , what would it get me 
n , the point is , i m not sore at you at all , professor 
while everybody else is busy making things , yo come up with the answer .
you come up with something that breaks things !
we replace it wth new glass .
it breaks .
mr. hawk , you do n't seem to understand .
how about that united nations bulding in new york ?
mr. hawk , you do n't for one minute think
i 'd go along with a scheme like that , do you ?
well , what are you acting so high nd mghty about 
look , professor , why do n't you just settle for what you got here ?
with the money from this thing we 'll both get fat .
and there 'll be enough left over for you to take care of the medfield problem .
save medfield college ?
that kind of money would never help medfield college or anyone else , mr. hawk .
well , you know what you 're doing , do n't you ?
and bfore this day is over i 'll be back here with the sheriff .
and we 'll have this place tied up tighter than fort knox !
with all your work and all your experiments !
and as for medfield , a year from now , people will have forgotten there ever was such a punk littl college .
out of the way , son .
you re  little overdue on my allowance .
why  i 'm just liable to send you off to jail with this criminal here , as a fellow conspirator , a partner in crime !
professor , you mean yo 're gon na hlp us ?
maybe the college wo n't be here nxt year , but we 're going to see that nobody ever frgets it .
come on , humph !
let 's hustle into it !
will you forget about that ?
the professor 's with us now !
the first team 's coming into the game !
biff , biff .
let 's take it easy for a minute .
i just thnk there might be a more effective way of using it .
boy , just think , 70-yard kicks , 90-yard passes !
are you cracking up ?
so , we never throw just the ball , we throw the player with the ball .
right !
that 's right .
humphrey , it 's just simple logic .
with the flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless  or buoyant , and then we thrw you with the ball .
you do ?
do n't you see the beauty of it ?
even f they intercept , we still have possession of th ball .
right !
right , humphrey ?
uh  right .
poor old medfield !
see them run !
well , ladis and gentlmen , her we are in the little community of medfield .
say what you will abt their footbll tam , at least the wather her is good .
i 'm afraid we ca n't promise you much .
mighty rutland university , untied , unscored upon for th past three seasons , knocking at the door of the national championship pitted tonight against puny mdfield 
oh !
wait 'll i get my hands on those two !
coach !
oh , good , good .
so go ahead without us .
steady .
best wishes !
oh !
and at fullback position for rutland , hjalmar woccskyinska , a 240-pound husky from broken jaw  idaho .
back home during his summer vacations ,
hjalmar runs a traning school for prison guards .
well , here come the lambs to the slaughter .
come on , medfield !
second quarter , rutland 's bll , first and ten .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
hut four !
sir , we 're never gon na get this thing ready in tme .
if you 'd just recnsider my idea .
what 's that , humphrey ?
there 's flubber gas in here .
well , so i do n't have to wear this suit .
instead , we give the good ole football a shot of gas , and then zzshhhh !
humphrey .
we 've been through all that .
with this new valve you have perfect boyancy control at all times .
we got ta get out of here .
wht 's wrong , biff ?
my father .
pop walked in to get th sheriff who was his dinner there , and i overheard them talking .
then they went over to judge murdock 's .
we 'll hve to fix the suit in the lockr room .
look out !
he 's getting away !
ladies and gentlemen , i 'm fraid it 's going just the way we predicted .
mighty rutland is shredding the little medfield tam to bits .
well , he must be here someplace .
you two get the rest of the boys and sprad out !
look , i do n't mind losng the football game , professor ashton , but spar us yor garbled quotations .
you 're not expecting anyone , are you , betsy ?
thank you .
you 're winning .
it 's a massacre , coach .
yeah , ai n't it a shame .
we should have brought along the girls ' vollyball team .
w could have sent them in .
everything 's okay , sir .
where 've yo been , hawk ?
and what 's all this static about a secret weapn 
you 're the secret weapon ?
it 's not fair .
it 's nt fair .
come on , boy .
let 's mop up the field with 'em .
way to go , humphrey !
come on !
and forget your manners !
and there goes the try for the extra point 
it 's good .
i tell you  that medfield touchdown was certainly a surprise .
george , what kind of play would you say that was ?
uh ...
nw w 'll see what happens .
hut one !
hut two !
hut thre !
what happened to me ?
what happened to you , clod ?
well , now .
did you see how that happened there , george ?
uh , well , it ...
here he comes !
catch him !
upsy-daisy !
down !
hut one !
of !
here 's a rule book .
you find it !
well  ladies and gentlemen , i guess you know by now , we are witnessng one of the wildest , slam-bang football games ever played anywhere at any time .
rutland fumbls !
medfield 's got the ball again .
hut tw !
hik !
the ball is snapped to hmphrey .
now hawk hs humphrey .
get off the playing ' feld .
take it easy , huh ?
well , it 's a race against time now .
medfield trails rutland by nine points .
with less than four minutes left to play , the big question is can rtland stop medfield 's brilliant aerial attack ?
oh , it looks as f rutland may have something up their sleeve .
i 've never seen 'em use this kind of defense before .
down !
hut one !
hut two !
now , remembr , you guys , the old lady with a twist on two .
ready ?
break !
the same thing again .
no !
btter gas up a little .
hut two !
biff !
biff 
medfield calls time out .
they 're back on their own two yard line with eight seconds left t play .
well , if you 'd just let me use my needle , we 'd have won easy .
well , it is n't doing us ny good back at the lab .
well , like i said , i never did trust this crummy sut .
humph !
there may b time fr one more play .
repeat , 98 yards .
too bad .
it 's gaining altitude .
and there goes the fnal gun as the game ends and medfield wins .
the ball , the ball is still going up ...
up ...
up ...
george , did ya see that ?
oh , shut up !
well , the trial of professor ned brainard swung into its third day today .
professor branard continued to act as counsel in his own behalf .
he was quoted as saying he was confident in the due prcesses of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony against him , as the prosecution kept a steady parade of witnesses moving through the witness box , today , the prosecution unlimberd its big guns against the defens .
professor brinard , you seem proud of your job as a tacher .
do you like it because you believe it maks you important ?
but i believe the work i do is mportant .
would you care to tell us a lttle about it ?
maybe plant a bug of discovery in their minds , or ...
and you think tht 's importnt ?
one of those young people might discover something the entir world has been loking fr .
he might not , but i like to feel that i had a part in giving him a crck at it .
i see .
now , regardless of whether you are found guilty or not ,
would you continue as before ?
would you recklssly incite the yung minds of your class agin ?
i put the questin to you again , professor , and i ask you to mark well your answer .
would you still persist in these dangerous and malicious follies ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , falling hair , even fear of mr. hawk .
we find our self apologizing , hiding our heads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog day only came once a year in this country .
now , i see a lot of students from my science class here in the courtroom .
they my not b the most studious group of young people in college today , but i 'll say this for them , so far they are unafraid .
i have high hopes for them .
am i to understand , professor , you actually ncourage mistakes in your class ?
suppos you are returned to your role as a teacher , would you do exactly as you did before ?
yes .
you may step down .
come on .
lt 's tie this thing up and get out of here .
15 or 20 minutes should do it .
in that case , i will sum up briefly .
may i suggest , professor , as defense counsel , you 're not doing much in your own behalf .
i 'm a witness for the defense , your honor .
both objections overruled .
but , your honor , this is most unusual procedure .
it is also unusual procedure for the defense to have no witnesses in his own behalf .
swear in the witness , please .
my time is yur time , mr .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?
elizabeth brainard .
will the defense question the witness ?
no , your honor .
as i was saying , my name is elizabeth brainard 
he scratched my fender in the parking lot just outside the administration building .
on october 30th of this year ,
i told him i did n't think i was cut out t be a scientist 's wife .
well , i 'd lik to inform the defndant at this time that i was wrong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
of course , she means it .
oh , betsy .
your honor , will you excuse the witness t this time ?
the defendant always said he loved me in midnight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does all this , uh , foofaraw have any bearing on the disposition f the case ?
you bet , your honor .
i do n't belive it .
that is , if you do n't mind wasting the time .
gangway !
gangway , everybody !
i do n't wish to pry , but would you kindly divulg your intentins ?
the court is waiting .
i 'm sorry  your honor .
may i ask that this witness be recalled to testify fr me ?
very well .
must we subject ourselves to irrelevant testimony trumped up by the dfense ?
the witness is qualified .
but your honor ...
i 'm the county agricultural agent , that 's who i am .
oh , yes , yes .
i certainly did .
and yo were very upset .
so much so that you decided to investigte the matter thoroughly .
well , i did n't come here to toast marshmallows , you know .
now , mr. allen ...
first , would you mind telling us about the soil conditions her in medfield county ?
medfield county has th thinnest , rockiest , wore-out , farmed-out , poopd-out soil in the whole state .
i 've been so ashamed .
it 's not much good for growing things .
wait , i 'll show you something .
that is an ear of corn .
a radish !
if you want to se something really miserable ...
smebody put ...
it 's around here somewher ...
uh  that s fine  mr. allen 
why , everywhere i look , everything is suddenly all fertiled up !
oh , i do n't ...
he can call it anything he wants .
i think that you 've invented ...
s it anything like taking a dry bath , or going for a dry canoe ride ?
you see , professor brainard 's rays must have combined with massive amounts of nitrogen out in the atmosphere , see ?
why , for all we know , it might be dry-raining right down in this courtroom this very minute , fertilizing everything in sight !
yu ca n't tell , you know .
do you expect this court to believe all this mumbo jumbo ?
can you substantate it ?
oh , my goodness !
come on !
that 's right , boys !
look at those carrots , judge !
boys !
do n't push !
your wife says to get home right away .
a summer squash just rolled off the vine next dor and smashed your sports car !
the jurors will please sit down !
thank you very , very , very much , judge .
you should try some of this walnut .
oh , yes , yes .
i leave it to you ...
case dismissed .
do n't take it so hard .
as a matter of fact , i 'm crazy about it , but ...
offhand , can you name one thing that science has n't improved upon , one way or another ?
oh !
i guess i 'll have to go along with that .
this is my home , the great karoo desert .
i 'm not even born yet .
surviving in these parts is nt easy .
you need to be tough and flexible .
that 's why we built this enclosure 
them being everyone who is n't us .
i got it !
it 's time .
it 's happening- it 's happening !
watch out .
here he comes !
keeps my stripes .
my brother is just a big dumb jock .
i know .
are there no stallions in my future ?
here comes mr .
right .
right now .
hey , nigel .
well  i 've been running .
um ...
come on .
seko , come quick .
it 's time .
aw .
that 's my boy .
that 's not right .
what ?
he has no stripes ?
how is that possible ?
so different .
lungisa .
dad , what 's ging on ?
huh ?
he 's funny looking .
what do you even call half a zebra ?
zeb ?
his name is zeb ?
seriously ?
you ar not half a zebra .
your name is khmba .
our son , khumba 
that 's nice .
he has no stripes .
barely breaking a sweat .
hey , tombi !
woo !
okay , water break .
do n't .
sore loser ?
i do n't .
i was just giving you a head start .
things are different now .
yep , do n't wnt any stretch marks .
mkhulu , while we wait for the rains , maybe we should ration the water .
yah , right 
good idea , seko .
until the rains come , we 'll only drink once a day .
okay , everyone .
timba , temba , burning nimba ,
show what you got !
yo !
hey , guys .
what happened to my stripes ?
muscle-headed lame brains .
vry funny .
that will take the shine off , all right .
go cheerlead with the other girls .
we wo n't always be here t protct him .
i my be half a zebra , but at least i 'm not an ass .
is it some kind of mp ?
what 's that ?
khumba ?
you okay , khumb ?
hey , i 'm sorry about what happened .
maybe they let me ff easy ?
i did cause a drought .
tht 's just dumb .
you trying to make me feel better ?
just leave me alone .
do n't you have anything btter to do ?
you think you 're the only one who has a hard time fitting in ?
ah !
well , we can only ask 
please , she is weak .
i do n't even know if i 'm allowed to talk to outsiders .
outsiders 
we used to live together ?
maybe you cold have some of my rations .
okay , and you and you .
whoa .
intruders .
intruders .
intruders .
where 's mkhulu ?
where 's mkhulu ?
i thught it would be okay .
da-da-dada-da .
the land belongs to all of us .
i ...
i do n't even remember brekfast .
he 's at the fence .
he 's at the fence 
phango 's at the fence .
he wants to get in !
we need more branches .
over here !
i think i cn hear him breathing .
you ca n't keep them hidden from me forever , mkhulu .
shh .
i can almost taste it .
what did he say ?
i did n't hear him .
if it does n't rain soon , you will have to let them out .
just saying , we 're safe .
dad , she needed help .
like mama .
khmba , oh .
you 're growing .
you have it .
i 'm nothing like dad .
skin ?
they say that the frst zebras to walk the earth all had exactly the same skin with n stripes at all .
mm-hmm .
all the other zebras admired his beautiful skin , and he ws proud to be so different .
i think i know .
they all looked the same .
whoa .
how are you today ?
uh ...
feeling different , pecliar , left out , having trouble fitting in ?
well , i ...
you want more stripes , but you think there 's n way in the world you could get more stripes .
f cours i 'm right .
wrong .
of course , the magic waterhole .
yep .
skalk 's 100 % natural , herb , miracle formula .
guaranteed to bring out the natural stripe in you .
no , no , no , wait .
i know what you 're thinking .
how could that be ?
but i tell you it works ... on anything .
even a rock .
samples of my work right here .
well , maybe if you show me how it works .
khumba   'm so sorry about your ... huh ?
khumba ?
normally , it 's very , very , very hard to get , but act now , the miracle naturl stuff is yours for the shockingly low price of , say ... a little water for me and my buddies ?
believe me , it could .
right this way .
with a fine feather duster , i might add .
oh , i 'm nt a cleaning implement .
did you hear wht he sid about my feathers ?
my mother died .
oh .
this is awkward .
skalk 's going to help me get my stripes with his 100 % natural formula .
hmm .
how can i ...
let 's do it over dnner .
he 's not food .
let 's eat him .
he 's our ticket to all that water the zebras are hogging .
you , too , you little one .
looks like we got urselves a dog fight , bradly .
he 's going to eat you .
sorry , kid .
i did my best .
keep your backs covered .
well , it s too late for some of us .
ha !
i 'm so thirsty , i 'd settle for any old waterhle .
right , mama v ?
where is this waterhole ?
the mantis .
he drew me a map .
point is , he liked the feathers .
she 's got four of them .
enough .
mama v has seen enough .
and keep your left hof up .
i would have been dead meat .
mama v is always picking up lost causes .
hopeless cases , losers .
oh !
no , wait .
two-and-a-half is a crowd .
i thought ...
tweak the beak .
so will there be water at this watr hole 
and is there such a thing as a magic waterhole ?
i guess that 's not a good-bye hug 
where you go , mama v , i go .
zuki !
khumba !
khumba !
he left .
i 'm going to go find him .
if we just follow his ...
all right ?
deal ?
deal .
yo know , guys ...
somtimes i do n't think you see the bigger pictre .
do it yourself ?
can i please slurp in peace ?
yeah , we 're the team .
whatever happened t the pack mentality ?
abandned by your pack ?
i was just having a little drink of water .
just mud , rally .
give me one good reason .
give it your best shot .
now you 're a sophisticated , discerning gourmet type .
you are what you eat , right ?
as in heart still beating fresh ?
as in yung and tender zebra fresh .
half striped ?
as it was fretold .
better than nothing ?
a herd of giant wildebeest .
a pack of crazed ostriches .
shw me .
w , dragging cross the karoo is hard work .
and it does n't help that you ca n't find a drop of water to drink .
you should n't scare him like that , bradley .
i 'm good .
did you know he eats his pray while there 's still a heart beat ?
do n't you have a home ?
i 've been persecutd , stigmatzed .
but i will survive
♫ although all my life , i 've been ostracized ♫
poor bradley .
that 's not ven a rel word .
traumatized .
♫ visualizd .
♫ i think i get the picture .
oh , yeah , laugh at me .
some birds are just not meant to be caged , hey , bradley ?
mayb some birds are n't meant to be let out 
i ...
and you , mama v ?
sometimes the past is best left buried .
now , i think it 's time for some shut-eye .
night , khumba .
nght .
maybe tomorrow we 'll find ourselves a water hole .
all i smell is dog .
i can fix that .
i 've got a natural blend of herbs and flowers .
i 'll g get you some .
it kills nasty odors dead .
dead dog ?
i 'm trying to avoid that .
the karoo may be going to the dogs  but it does n't mean i have to eat one .
the karoo all looks the same to me .
did we pass that bush already ?
yeah , i 'm sure we 'r going the right way .
you better be sure .
so you do n't want any of this , huh ?
i 'm still bloated from breakfast .
mmm .
wow , tombi would love it out here .
oh , hello , hello 
bradley , i would n't .
let 's go , bradley .
what 's this all about ?
there ?
here , there ?
i 'm confused .
oops .
you found the map .
ar you sure it was a map , tombi ?
what 's that ?
there 's a rustle .
it 's seto , qick .
what was he thinking ?
i ...
only phango 's tracks cm out .
but mybe he 's still alive .
all that we can hope for is that your friend , your son , did not die in vain .
mkhulu .
are you just going to give up ?
dad , how can you say that ?
i 'm just saying it .
uh , right , dad .
run , run !

zuki , you 're spooking nigel .

oh , but we 're staying .

this is incredible .
i 'm feeing the magic .
oh , lovely .

wow , things are n't usually so wild around here .
i do n't get my dad .
even with phango , we have a better chance out there .
i do n't know why i stay , either .
there 's nothing left for me here .
i 'd just go .
you 're right , tomb .
i 've ben hiding inside this fence for to long .
or did i dream it ?
what is a dream ?
what 's real ?
is life just a big stage , and are we all just ...
boys , enough !
d n't look back , only forward , all right ?
i do n't !
the black eagle knows .
because he has a bird 's eye view .
let 's put this to  vote .
all in favor of bandoning this wild goose chase ..
does everything have to be a huge drama for you ?
i 've been wating in the wings me whole life .
who dares pass through th ... th ... the crags of death ?
take care .
wings of dom .
we re just here to see the black eagle .
wings of doom .
no creature gazes up on the wings of doom .
wings of doom .
no one can even look at the black eagle ?
okay , so the bunny dd nt mention this part .
we got it .
we wo n't say his name again .
the beat 's all right .
ra !
hey , what do you think you 're doing ?
h 's got a rash .
he 's got a rash !
wings of doom !
black eagle .
wings of doom .
bradley !
wings of dom .
how was your flight ?
uh-oh .
who dares disturb the mighty black eagle ?
tabo , it 's time we put our differences behind us .
please  dad .
we 're leaving , and i hpe you 're coming , too .
the herd needs both of us .
no one has ever gazed upon th mighty black eagle and lived .
but i ...
to see the freak of nature for yourself .
the only white black eagle ?
i 'm lost .
i need your help .
answer me !
well , because until i find the magic waterhole and get my stripes , the zebras wo n't have any rain .
is that what you tell yourself ?
g 
and i think you know how that feels .
the place you seek is ngow mountain .
the magic waterhole .
there was a time when he was th outcast of the litter .
abandoned by his own kind .
he got his revenge , but it seems that is n't enough for him .
so he keeps on killing .
hmm , well , looks like dinner is going to be late .
why did khumba hve t leave ?
because he 's in a clss all his own , mate .
who 's with me ?
freedom !
that was wild .
come on , kids .
road trip , everybdy !
all right , keep together .

i 've been such a fool .
my grandmother moves faster than yu .

there 's smething i need to tll both of you .
this looks dangerus .
let 's keep moving .
he said we go through the valley of desolation .
valley of what ?
desolation .
oh , that 's nice .
there 's nothing that hits the spot quite like a valley of desolation !
can i just say one little thing ?
oh , look .

we 're not going to let a barbie stop s .
that 's hot !
smells like chops brning .
in the flesh at last .
but then ...
but you 're not the same , are you ?
it was foretold that a half-striped zebra would be born , and make one of us the most powerful leopard that evr lived .
but i killed my own cln so that i could have you .
you i 'd savor slowly .
whoa !
there 's only one way to find out .

h 's so mysterious .
look at him trying to eat human food .
all :
aw .
i have an idea .
bon , does that pizza have garlic in it ?
perfect .
wow , that 's really nice of you and all , but i ...
i ca n't actually eat that .
i 'm allergic .
to the garlic ?
uh , well ... yeah  and the chese and the yeast and ...
basically the whole pizza .

psst .
does this happen to you a lot ?
do you go to new schools and people think you 're a suprnatural creature ?
oh , were you rocky raccoon at your last school ?
you go out during the day , which pretty much goes against the most basic tenant of vampire lure .
do n't worry , i 'm not going to say nything .
because you 're making evrybody look like idiots .
i kind of love that .
but some advic .
ha !
hey , vi .
you knw , i 've been up all night trying to figure this vampire thing out .
that 's true .
talk to me like you 're really a vampire .
it was a vampire .
okay , well , first off , i 'm not the one with an accent .
nd secondly , just tell me how i should sound .
okay .
the modern vampire is more of a cross between a constipated model and a freshman poetry major .
more like you do n't want to deal with anything 
no charge , edward cullen .
you would n't understnd .
not bad .
so what else is there to know about vampires ?
there 's a couple things .
they 're incapable of singing happy birthday .
mm-hmm .
really ?
mm-hmm .
i do n't believe you .
okay !
but seriously , we really need to figure a way we can sell this at school .
now you got the hair and the clothes .
wear these at all times .
look at his eyes .
and on this edition of caitlyn 's world ,
some vampires can fly .
so we 'v got to get you off the ground .
caitlyn :
tody on caitlyn 's world ,
i have a story you can really sink your teeth into 
how old are you ?
time ... is for those waiting to die .
thanks t all my new followers for logging on to vote .
looking towards the future , wll you be attending
forksley high s annual sweetheart dance ?

he can maybe help us .
call him .
okay .
call him !
boy :
uncle derrick ?
oh 
is this ...
i will stalk the monster and i will kill it .
how do we know you can do it ?
i found myself nursing from a mother emu .
she took me in , and her family raised me as her own .
they taught me hw to hunt .
and how to kill .
what does any of this have to do with vampires ?
my skills are vast  i assure you .
which technically makes me a third degree black belt .
and i 've defeated the gme castlevania , every version of it .
that ... tht 's all great , but how is it going to help you get this guy ?
mark my words .
i will hunt this creature down to the ends of the world .
there is nowhere he can hide .
excellent .
which one is he ?
he 's right there .
excellent .
this continer is flled with water caught from the base of the carpathian mountains .
sssh , sssh , sh , sh .
sssh .
and i 'm here to deliver the water .
no water here .
you probably want the teacher 's lounge .
or perhaps ... or perhps it was right here !
ah !
drink this up you nasty , smelly thing from beyond !
yeah .
hey , vi .
ha , ha , very funny .
so ... hw do i look ?
mmm .

and you can occasionally look at the girl .

davis :

and now for the spotlight dance .
all abroad on this endless ride to forever
every night i feel so alive
forever
this guy is a clevr one .
and ever
yeah  t was the best .
caitlyn , there 's something i need to talk to you about .
i just did n't know how .
no .
it 's just that ...
no , no , no , no .
i have to go tell the girls .
come over to my house on friday , and we 'll go over everything , okay ?
yeah .
okay , great .
do you really think that caitlyn 's going to go through with it ?
why would n't she ?
girl :
caitlyn is telling everybody that you 're going to turn her into a vampire on friday .
it 's too far .
i thought we were having fun .
you 're jealous .
no .
i think you 're jealous of me for being popular .
why would you be jealous of caitlyn ?
i can just confess , and we can just put all of this behnd us .
i do n't care about that .
i like you for you .
davis 's thoughts 
just tell her the truth , and everything will be fine .
 'm going t turn her into a vampire .
i 've been meaning to tell you .
bite me .
okay .
better not disappoint .
ready ?
it does n't really feel lik anything .
uh , that 's how it 's supposed to feel .
girl 
may ... maybe it just did n't take .
i 'll try again .
it 's just m davis .
guys ,  was joking .
it was a joke 
ca n't you take a joke ?
come on .
hey , honey .
you okay ?
yeah .
yes , mom , i 'm fine .
 am sorry you have to go through that all the time .
i get you a kaleidoscope every time we move ?
because you look in it  and it 's beautiful .
but the slightest turn f th wheel ... can change everything .
sometimes maybe even more beautiful than it was before .
this change stinks .
you know , with everything that 's happened since you arrived ,
i 'm sure there 's something here you think is beautiful .
loser !
this was like all those times combined .
liar !
davs 's thoughts :
times like 40 billion .
okay , it sounds great .
like a vampire .
play it back .
please promise to meet me by the first tree ...
what are you doing here ?
i do n't remember there being any cameras there .
what are y working on ?
i just wanted to tell yu that what i did was wrong , and i 'm a complete goon .
and ...
no , davis , i 'm sorry ... for you .
caitlyn :
oh my gosh !
ten thousand subscribers !
wht do you want ?
need more footage of me acting like a jerk ?
why ar yu helping me ?
you better have , because i 'm not doing it again .
i had to show everyone what i had just seen .
but how ?
davis 's thoughts :
and i had just the right costume .
davis 's thoughts :
rally ?
do n't be afraid .
no , wait .
i thought it 'd be the only way that i 'd finally get some real friends .
i 'd say you made plenty .
no .
anyways , i 'll ..
you make real life way better thn make believe .
davis .
tonight , we 'll be showing
i have something to show you .
loser !
except for one person .
caitlyn crisp .
and i have proof .
looks pretty good .
did you get that ?
by :
is that thing off ?
i turned it off .
what a bunch of boosers and followers .
i did n't think you hd it in you .
bon , stop him .
what an idiot .
ah !
this is your beloved caitlyn .
caitlyn :
the rules are written by the winners .
you 're all my friends , and i adore you .
hey , guys .
guys !
listen !
hey , listen !
no n rally knows who they are yet .
and we 're all still trying to figure things out .
and i do n't blame you .
i mean , caitlyn crisp is no more miss perfect than i am a ...
who are you ?
okay .
dude , that 's , uh  stewart 's uncle .
he still thinks you 're a vampire .
it is not wise to ignore me , creture .
what are you talking about ?
this whle not really being a vampire thing just is n't sticking with you , is it ?
i am coming down .
bloodsucker !
ah !
with sch speed and agility , how can you claim to not be a vmpire ?
i 'm the real deal , and i 'm real dangerous .
so i 'd advise you not to challenge me .
give up nw .
arm yourself !
okay .
ah !
yo know that there 's only one wy to render a vampre powerless .
exactly .
and i accept your challenge .
on the count of three .
you fought bravely , human .
i see .
there 's humanity , even in th undad .
i will spare your life .
i will spare his life !
vi !
i forgot vi !
well , maybe .
but i 'm thinking you 're probably blaming m for all of this , and that you might actually hit me .
that 's true .
so cool .
yeah .
you 'r not even my typ .
both :
you 're welcome .
now this is my scene .
hold on tight
all aboard on this endless rid
so maybe
 m not the coolest guy in the world , but who cares .
and thy all seem to like the real davis .
that 's pretty cool to me .
and just to treat you fair and square , we 're paying double wages and a bonus , from frisco to shanghai and back , all found .
tell 'em what yo saw , bill .
and it came a-bellerin ' out of the night , with one big eye like a lighthouse .
we 'r stoved into starboard .
nd then it come up amidships .
and broke our backs and sunk us .
and it 's a miracle old billy 's alive today .
tell 'em about its teeth , billy .
you mind answring a few questions ?
monsters interest me .
all kinds .
boiled down for his ol , lads , there 'd be free grog for all hands , if you can swallow it on top of his tall yarns ...
there !
stop it !
come on , casy 
this is no place for a clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie !
do n't bother nloading .
this is ridiclous .
we just hv to get to saigon .
halfway around the world from paris , and now this happens .
except pack and unpack .
oh , professor ?
i 'm from the bulletin .
these gntlemen are from the globe and the post .
we 're interested in your opinion of this monster .
professr  what does the national museum in paris think abot it ?
i can not answer that .
we heard this expedition of yours was to gather fcts about th monster .
i 'm afraid you were misinformed 
why do n't you ask a fish ?
do n't yu print that .
you do not deny then that such a monster could exist .
is that correct ?
thank you , profssor .
look at this drawing .
i knew it .
by professor arronax of the paris national museum .
why , this is the most far-fetched nonsense yet .
far-fetched ?
you 're not serous , professor ?
oh , i do n't mean flying off with  ship in its mouth .
but the general size ...
i 'm not a reporter .
may i come in ?
thank you .
would you accept ?
 would be interested , yes , naturlly .
why..
i think the honour is ours .
as the foremost authority on the sea and it 's mysteries , you cn be an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it concerns the monster .
very much so .
according to the papers , you seem to beleve the rumours .
no .
yes , i 'm afraid  was misquoted .
however , i have an open mind on the subject .
we accept 
god .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like you to come downstairs and meet captain frragut .
he 's in command of the warship upon which you 're sailing .
every man aboard was on the lookout , and the watch was kept day and night .
captin farragut left nothing to chance .
with traditional throughness , the navy plan was to cut the south pcific into squares and search each square .
false alarms were common , and thy did n't hlp our morale .
our hopes began to wne .
it came as no surprise ... when captain farragut on the night of december 8 , 1868 , summned us to the wr room .
gentlemen , i believe my obligation to this legend has been dispatched .
it does n't seem to me we have proved anything one way or the other , captain .
we 'll set yu ashore in saigon .
cheer up , professor .
i thought they promised you a bonus if you harpooned this monster , mr land .
knowing full well  could n't collect it .
when i get back , i 'm shipping out n the first whaler that 'll take me .
you scare m .
be a good loser  professor .
what a pity , professor .
i know you had visions of that monster mounted in the national museum .
'bout the flapping fish and the girls i 've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
met her down in madagascar
she would kiss me
got a whale of a tal to tell you , lads
a whale of a tale or two
bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
thre was typhoon tessie
met her on the coast of java
blow me down and pick me up
she was the captain 's wife
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was harpoon hnnah
if i kissed her
and held hr tenderly
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
ahoy !
ship off the starboard bow !
aye aye , sir .
i 'm thinking she went down with all hands .
wht could have st it off  though ?
you meaning the monster , ai n't ya , mate ?
aye !
it might be the monster .
sure , it s the monster !
it is the monster !
pipe down on deck !
i must insist , professor , that you keep these fish stories to yourself .
there 's the monster !
look alive there !
get your range and fire .
well , hit her in the heels .
aye aye , sir .
run her out smartly .
she 's turning !
stand by to lower away .
professor !
hey , do n't leave us !
help 
they can not help .
but they must !
help !
i 'm getting numb all over .
look , professor .
thre 's something over there .
i do n't know .
it looks like the mnster .
a submarine boat .
but , this is incredible .
men have dreamed about such miracles .
you know somthing ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahoy !
it sems deserted .
i think we are askng for trouble , professor .
mayb somebody will come up .
no .
if we wait , this thing is liable to sink under us .
why , it 's as bright as day .
there is great genus behind all this .
yes , and great evil .
do n't forget this is an engin of destruction .
is anybody aboard ?
wait .
look at this .
give me a hand with this line , mate .
anybody els get off ?
yes , the professor is down below .
well , he rally got his mnster , did n't he ?
i 'm not anxious to get in their company myself .
my sentiment exactly .
big .
i 've nver seen a barge like this before .
hey , this looks like the galley .
cook 's day off , too .
professor .
professor 
professor .
professor , where are you ?
hello .
i 'm in here .
what is it ?
you know  ned land s here with a boat .
that tall one must be the leader .
they ll be coming back any moment .
gt away !
help !
help !
search the boat .
you are from the warship that attacked me , are you not ?
this is ned land , master harpooner .
you may remain .
i did not invite you here .
you came as an enemy t destroy me .
they 've done no harm .
do n't blame us because the warship shelled you .
the sea shall have you back .
easy , mate !
i 'm nt what is called  civilised man , professor .
but i am as guilty as they are .
i will grant yo that both of them and me , too , enlisted t track down what we thought to be a mnster .
but , in that case , we are no more guilty than the rest of the world .
yu 've carried your work as far as terrestrial science permits .
the real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off , wonders that defy my powers of description .
the secrets that are mine alone , but which i would be willng to shar with you .
at the expense of my companions ' lives ?
 'm sorry .
then i can not accept .
professor , i regret your choice .
take hm up !
and secure for sea .
aye , sir .
all stations ready !
prepare for diving .
yes , sr .
prepare for diving 
ahad slow .
trim your forward ballast .
what about the other one ?
i found out what i wanted to know .
there .
come in , gentlemen .
be seated , please .
professor .
i 'd like to express our gratitude , captain .
we are grateful to be alive .
i want none of your gratitude .
you 're all on the strictest probation , and i 'd dvise you not to attempt escape .
you understand your position ?
i guess that makes us a little bit of both .
i tolerate no guests aboard the nautilus , and you already know the fate of prsonrs .
the food is delicious , is n't it , professor ?
oh , very good .
i 'm indifferent to 'em .
these dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchn .
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppose this is n't lamb , then .
yes , my cook excels in preparing these various products .
well , just the main course .
the cream is , of course , milk from the giant sperm whale .
saute of unborn octopus .
since we are nearing the island of crespo , you 'll have an opportunity of selecting your own food .
for a brief hunting expedition .
wll , that suits me fine .
when do we start , mate ...
almost immediately .
delightful smoke .
havana ?
i am still curious as to the reson you spared our lives .
i may have use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaced ?
it comforts me to know that your life was not too dear a prce to pay for the love of yur fellow man .
at the moment , i do n't intend that you should .
we 're almost at the island of crespo .
all this was once an island .
 knew there 'd be a catch to ths .
seems you ca n't do anything on this boat without gettng wet .
hey !
wait a minut .
where you going with this ?
an expedition from the nautilus .
it 's a new experience for thm .
they 'll learn quickly .
i 'll introduce them to you .
captain nemo and i were not alone .
an underwater larder filled to overflowing , and all captain nem for the taking .
ballast ?
ballast !
ned , you forget yourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. land .
why did you do it ?
ask him .
that was scientific interest .
i had n idea he was after treasure .
oh , no ?
we must n't quarrel among ourselves .
we must stay together .
it 's our only chanc .
chance ?
you want to play a waiting game , hopng to learn nemo 's secrets .
i believe we owe the world that much , ned .
have you a better plan ?
i want to get off .
of course i do n't mind going with my pockets full .
and do n't cll it stealing , because that 's the wy h got it .
if we could take this thing over , we 'd be rich .
i 'd have a ship of me own , and you would n't have to be starving n a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me wth those soft-boiled eggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them when that chest busted .
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win the captain 's confidence , but i need time , nd i need your help .
all right .
it is the best way , believe me .
trivialities .
nonsense .
that depends on your pont of viw .
i just think that ned values his life above scientific achievement .
today we encontered a fearsome storm .
an ordinary vessel would have suffered heavy damage .
a whale f a tale that 's true
at my host 's invitation , i inspected the ship .
we went to the very heart of the vessel , the propulsion unit .
this secret alone gave him mstery of the sea .
and in a sngle stroke , harness power beyond the wildest dreams of science .
or destroy it .
with seming indifference ,
as i studied him ,
i bcame aware that powerful forces were at work within this strang man .
think of it .
on the surface , there is hunger and fear .
men still exercise unjust laws .
they fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few feet beneath the waves , their reign ceases , their evil drowns .
here i am free .
far better that they think there 's a monster and hunt me with harpoons .
after travelling 10000 leagues under the sea 
i felt at long last i was to have my answer .
the prison camp of rorapandi , the white man 's grave .
but i thought it had been abolished .
what is in thos sacks they are carrying ?
nitrates and phosphate for ammunition , the seeds of war .
they 're loading a full cargo of death , and when that ship takes it home , the world will die a little more .
i was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there .
look at it again , professor .
i do n't want you to forgt what you 've seen here today 
it sounds remote .
it was there that we built the nautilus .
you will have the privilege of seeing all this firsthand .
when our mission is compltd , the nautilus is going home .
they 're getting up steam , sir .
vry good .
that ship that flies no flag sails with the tide .
you have your orders .
i said go below !
collision speed , full !
professor ?
are you all right ?
all those men , they did n't even have a chance .
ned , do n't .
damage report , sir 
we 'll make temporary repairs here .
i askd you to leave , professor .
why ?
you are not only a murderer .
well , i see murder , too !
there are the assassins , the dealers in dath .
i am the avnger .
is mrder a right reserved for that hated nation that has taken everything from me ?
they tried .
they cast me into prison , and when they failed ...
what you fail to understand is the power of hate .
i was just trying to tidy up .
about what ?
well , i believe things have gone far enough .
murder means nothing to him .
it is not your place to judge .
you do n't know anything about the captain .
now , please go out and leave me alone .
what did you call me ?
captain ?
yes , i did .
seen enogh ?
did the professor put you up to ths ?
yo bet i was right .
and i was right about you spying on me .
w may need it .
we ?
since when do i need you ?
i wan na be friends .
i want to escape .
so do i , with you .
you once said you had a plan .
well ?
trouble is , it wo n't work .
i ca n't figure how they navigate this brge .
no courses , no bearings , nothing .
if we could figure where we 're heading , we 'd have a chance .
that 's no problem .
vulcania !
aye , sir 
keep your ye peeled for the mate .
ned , put them back .
he 's coming .
that was close , mate .
maybe ...
ned , lt 's get out of here .
get me a pencil and paper quick .
i think i found something .
yes ?
see ?
all the distances are measured from that point .
it must be .
get me those calipers , quick .
quiet .
here .
have a cigar .
hey , she likes 'em !
you want another ?
be qiet !
i 'm not playing !
be a nice girl .
let 's go .
resume speed at 50 fathoms .
i 've got to do some research .
what kind ?
well , ned , you 've got everything here , from the rarest nudibranchs to oysters .
i want the bottles .
you ca n't do that .
these are priceless .
why , that went out with robinson crusoe .
that 's for spying ' on me .
do n't let me catch yo padding the shadow of my stern again .
remember that .
i do n't like bashing ' anybody , but you had it comin ' , ld .
and i thought we were friends 
sure we 're friends !
hit me .
hit me .
you mean that ?
you ca n't miss it .
oh , all rght , shipmate !
it 's priceless .
anyhow ... hold this  ld .
well  they had plenty of time on their hands , so they bgan writing ' notes , puttin ' 'em in old rum bottles and setting ' 'em adrift .
i swallowed it .
there was a flabellin oculina in there .
astern , full !
we seem to have run aground .
an accident , captain ?
the tide will float us free by evening .
would you like to go ashore ?
the last time we went ashore , it was a prelude to murder .
aye , sir .
throwin ' away a chance like that .
the professor 's lsin ' his ballast .
dry land , mate .
and so would the professor .
me ?
i 'm a collecting ' fool .
there 's no harm in asking .
and i can row , sir .
got a strong back .
i 'm no deserter .
happy to b aboard , sir .
very well .
permission granted .
thank you .
the natives are cannibals .
break out the skiff .
shove off !
take it easy .
hey , ned .
hey !
come here , quick .
a trail through the jungle .
you had this in mind all th time .
i figured that .
i ca n't get through that jungle .
yu 'll go faster alone .
we 'll be laughing about this , havin ' a drink together in frisco .
good luck , ned 
hey !
hey !
wait for me !
hey !
hey ... cannibals !
scores of boats !
naturally .
they 're coming aboard , captain .
gt me a harpon , quick .
this is amazing .
hey , captain , that 's one way to keep guests from droppin ' in .
a mild charge of electricity , mr. land .
not very hospitable , but harmless .
and speaking of hospitality , may i say you have abused mine for the last time .
you 've continuously disobeyed my orders .
who , me ?
i told you once the fate of prisoners .
i have no choice but to oblige you .
what 's this all about ?
the only reason you only came back is because the natives forced you to .
you 're going to regret that choice , mr. land .
when we clear this reef , i 'll see you trouble my existence no longer .
put him under guard below .
take him below .
we must brak free of the reef .
aye , sir .
lighten ship and drop all ballast .
get below !
let me out of this ...
professor !
a warship , professor .
we 're breaking out !
let us out !
wait !
break out a spare shaft !
put the aft nd under the leak .
take up the slack .
we 've gone too deep .
make braces !
braces in place  sir !
the air will clear now that the fans are operating again .
are you all right ?
have we stopped sinking ?
fortunately .
we 're deeper now than man has ever been before .
emergency speed , all engines !
full repellent charge !
prepare another charge .
sorry , sir .
then we shall hav to fight on the surface .
you 'll be fighting at close quarters with the most tenacious of all sea basts .
stay clear of the tentacles .
they 'll seize anything within reach and hang on to the death .
the only vital spot is directly between the eyes .
forty feet and surfacing , sir .
stand by .
stand back !
quick !
the forward hatch !
give me a harpoon !
throw me another iron !
watch it !
your hand !
well , i 'll be ...
what happened ?
mr. land .
get drunk 
and the girls i 've loved on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
glad to see you like music , too .
thank you , baby .
hey !
i 'v tried 'em .
your whiskers tickle .
let me see your whiskers .
come on , let 's try it again .
but eat they did th brisket squid
not so loud .
she loves those flabellinas oculinas .
i am happy you 're out of jail , ned .
the professor 's very happy , too .
we do n't want none of his gratitude !
wrap yurself up good .
i d n't want you to catch cold .
my apprentice tells me you have taken my journal .
may i ask why ?
i might have expected you to say that .
actually , he regrets saving my life as much as i would regrt saving his .
the only difference is that i would n't have tried .
then it is that difference that gives ned land a human dignity you no longer possess .
i know you were deeply touched by nd 's gesture , but you are ashamed to admit it .
you can not tolerate a faith in humanity , because if you do , all this , the structure of your very existence , which yu built on hate and vengeance , all this wll collapse around the naked lie of your life .
and you are a very gllible man , professor .
gullible ?
what he would d one day , he would gladly undo the next .
to be of benefit , goodness must be constant , forever building .
you will never find it .
if men and nations had this goodness that i speak of ,

no magical change
the first time it happens , you know

how simple , how rare
and just when you thought

than you dare to show
the first time you see her
no magical change
no dreams to arrange
the first time it happens , you know
what a great number !
nicky ?
for the first time
a-ha !
the moment it happens
then suddenly there 's a whole new world
the first time it happens
you know

here now , if we d all be a little more quiet , cooperative , orderly .
if we 'd all stop shouting and cooperate-

yu were very happy when my father donated the building to the town .
oh , for pete s sake , polly harrington , listen to rason !
ed , tell them what you said .
well , i do n't think i should say anything .
no , no , now , tell them what you said .
well , i got  look at the dispensary when i fixed mr. geary 's arm , and i mentioned it seemed a little inadequate for 32 children .
there you are .
now you 've heard it .
we 'll spend more to repair tht old building than to put up a new one .
it wo n't cost this town one cent !
is there ?
what abut you , reverend ?
you 're a man of influence in this community .
ben , speak up .
oh , karl .
chrlie , what dc you say ?
well , say something !
anybody !
there 's your whole town concil and your whole city conscience !
you certainly do n't need me as mayor around here ... as long as you 've got polly harrington running everything 
karl never changes , does he ?
ladies and gentlemen , we 're having a little light lunch .
sppose we stop for a while and have a bite ?
if you ask me , reverend ford should have taken sides with mayor warren .
said he never takes sides .
stop stickng your nos into their business nd get these sherbet glasses out there .
oh , wll , thanks for not spilling the beans about you-know-wh 
about cousin fred , you mean ?
mm-hmm .
is nt he handsome ?
how did you know ?
it was asy .
i saw you holding hands undr the table .
this sherbet 's turning to mush .
nancy ?
you know that man ?
what man ?
the one at the train station .
well , you might say they used to be friends ... sort of .
do you think he 's gon na marry aunt polly ?
fat chance .
who 'd wan na marry old pickle-faced harrington ?
are you and george gon na get married ?
oh , we hope to someday .
i think everyone should be married .
and maybe , when yu dc marry george ,
aunt polly will see how happy you are , and she 'll be very glad to get married herself , then .
glad this , glad that .
oh , lay off hr , angie .
stop picking on the girl .
now , take that sherbet out and serve it the way you shold .
go on .
well , let 's see what your aunt has on the menu for tomorrow .
your aunt has no imagnation .
oh , i love roast chicken !
did you ever har of sour stomach ?
wait 'til tomorrow .
prase him above ye heavnly host
they trust to nothing but a shadow .
but bear testament .
dath comes unexpectedly !
i intended to take effectual care , but death came unexpectedly ... like a thief , outwitting me , too quick for me .
now the great king of heaven and earth ... will abolish and annihilate this pride !
will crush the hardened wretch ... of the plluted infinite abomnation , and rain n him ... a deluge of fire and brimstone !
where are the great leviathans who defied god then ?
wher is their courage , these , these , these , these proud spirits ?
now , isaiah has warned us , on the day of vengeance , the earth shall be laid to waste .
the raven and screech owl shall dwell in it .
yea , he can lay the earth to pieces in one moment ... or shatter the whole universe with one stroke of his fiery sword !
how dreadful is the state of those who are in daily danger of this grat wrath , this abyss of death and despair .
there is no security for the wicked ... because there are no vsible signs of death t hand !
the arrows of dath fly nseen as noonday .
god has many different unsearchable ways of taking the wicked from this world .
calm in your knowledge of health , secure in your well-being .
yes , death comes unexpectedly !
i thought the reference to jermiah at the finish was very effective .
did n't you , mrs. ford ?
i ca n't deliver the messag with syrup .
yor voice is god 's instrument and shuld be used accordingly .
he sure sermonizes something fierce , does n't he ?
brimstone and dmnation on top of ham and eggs !
the one dy a week we have off .
ooh , i just hate them !
breakfast still a hot ball in our stomachs , and him chewing our ears off from that pulpit !
we get to have roast chicken , though .
what is all this glad business you talk about 
a game my father taught me .
helps what ?
tht reverend !
go away 
folks just hate the coming of sunday becaus of him .
tht 's true .
here it comes- miss goody two-shos ... is gon na find something about sunday to be glad about .
if you knew how to play the game , then you could find somethng to be glad about too .
well , there 's always something .
huh .
because it will be six whole days before sunday comes around gain , huh ?
why do n't you come out of the front door like normal people ?
they wo n't let us .
you can also fall and hurt yourself badly 
he grew it there , did n't he ?
so i can climb out anytim i want .
he did too !
why else would it be there ?
you are n't so much , you girl !
'sides , i 'm something you ca n't be .
i wan na go fishing .
i do n't have a hook .
oh .
hello .

what was it you and my aunt polly fught about ?
now , where did you hear about that ?
but thy wo n't discuss it when i 'm there .
well , pollyanna , it 's a strange thing about arguments .
at the time they seem very important .
aunt polly 's very pretty .
do n't you ?
i love her , but i do n't love the way she fixes her hair .
it was very soft .
did you used to be in love with her ?
come on , pollyanna , let 's go .
reverend ford and his wife are with aunt polly now , but they'll- but they 'll be leaving soon .
i
good-bye .
you can hide up in 'em , and people do n't even know where you are , and they 're walking right beneath you .
i never thought much about it .
well , thy are .
you wan na see something ?
what ?
come on .
i 'll show ya .
it says , keep out 
shh .
you see that place ?
what about it ?
keep quiet .

if he catches ya , he throws ya down in his basement ... and keeps ya for his slave .
then what are we doing here ?
up there .
the best climbing tree in town .
is n't it a beauty ?
do you mean to tell me that you brought me all the way up here ...

i 've told you 50 times to keep out of that tree !
you hear m ?
you keep away from me .
i was n't hurting anything !
stop it 
you let him go immediately !
oh .
you came back , did you ?
serves 'em right for trespassing on my property .
we were n't hurtng anything .
we just wanted to climb yur old tree .
you fall out of that tree and get hurt , and i get sued by your parents .
i do n't got any parents .
i 'm an orphan .
what name do you go by , boy ?
i like to kep a record of your name , you see , jimmy , so that i can tell ya from the rats down there in the basement .
lem me go !
come back here !
ys , sir .
get out !
what are you waiting for ?
you know what i thnk ?
no .
i do n't think ther 's any kids in your old basement .
oh , you do , do you ?
what are you doing touching things ?
just looks like a lot of old dusty junk to me .
how 'd you do that ?
how do you make it ?
i did n't make it .
where from ?
you see these hanging crystals ?
the sun 's rays hit it , and it acts like a prism .
you understand ?
you do not 
you do n't know what a prism is , now , admit it .
it makes a rainbow right on your wall .
sure , but it 'll be back again tomorrow when the sun comes agan .
well , good-bye , mr. pndergast .
it was very nice meeting you .
but i did n't show you my house !
hello , polly .
coming here like this without even callng .
could i get you some sherry ?
why , that 's very nice .
i do n't know why pollyanna would be at walker 's crek .
oh , she was playing .
yes , well , i 'm sorry that meeting got out of hand like that .
no one .
you remember her brother , beckett donnelly ?
no .
of course you do .
you two used to argue all the time .
i know that gary and nell would love to see you .
do you know that nell has eight children ?
please do n't .
well , that 's very fattering .
a busy person like you remembering me .
we made a mistake .
oh , but it 's been five years .
tell me about your work , edmond .
and we 're very proud of you .
what was it you mentioned yesterdy about the orphanage ?
i do n't rmember .
oh , yes , you do .
it was something about the dispensary .
it 's inadequate for that number of children , that 's all .
why should you buy it ?
i do n't know how we got off on the subject .
and your shoes .
oh , i 'm sorry , aunt polly .
i was playing , and i did n't realize .
nothing .
my hair ?
yes .
he said it was beautiful .
ah , yes , well ... clean yourself up for supper , dear .
yes , unt polly .
oh , but , aunt polly , please-
there 'll be no nonsense bout it , pollyanna .
charity baskets , child .
oh , the suffering in this world .

and there 'll be no dawdling .
and keep your clothes clean for a change .
come on , off with you .

go on and fix a cld pack for my headache .
go on !
let 's start acting like a community .
what do you think ?
i came here to fish , charlie .
i do n't want to butt in to your affairs here .
ben tarbell !
where you sneaking off to ?
a lot of us have got vested nterest in the harrington companies .
our wives belong to her ladies ' aid group .
all right , let 's get our hands out of our hip pockets and find a way to raise some money .
barly one mornng just as the sun was rising
i heard a maiden singing in the valley below
right , dan ?
right .
mary , you 've got to get that cocking done .
of course , you 've got that other thing to run .
hi , pollyanna .
i 'll be back in a minute , nancy .
hi .
lady , you are looking at the elected head of the entertainment committee .
well-
you can count on me to haul in that lumber !
it 's the first time folks have stood together against polly harrington .
well , of course they- george ?
she 's known it all along .
you 're a good girl .
when 's it gon na be ?
sunday night , a week .
let me tell you about it .
an extravaganza .
and i 'm in charge of all the entertainment .
and ot of the night , 50 bicycles apper moving down the sqare .
hey , pollyanna .
where are you going ?
there 's a big bazaar , and i 'm helping .
what 's it for ?
it 's an extravaganza .
darkness .
oh , boy 
can i help ?
mr. pendergast 's .
you 're going back ?
you 're nutty .
invite you in ?
but you ca n't sty long !
come on !
do n't touch anything .
do you mind ?
go ahead !
it 's getting so a man c n't call his home his own anymore .
through this little piece of glass .
explain it to him , mr. pendergast .
do n't you know anything about refracted light there , boy ?
now , boy  you see here the-
i like it th way it is .
lem me go , will ya ?
oh , yes .
now , pay attention , boy .
yu see the shape of this crystal ?
the light is tripped by that angle .
that refracts the ray , splits the colors , defuses them at an oblique angle ... and bends it ut into a dispersed colr band .
you understand ?
what he means is ... the sun comes through here and paints a rainbow .
you see ?
can i try it once ?
go head .
but do n't break anything .
snow ?
well ,  've just come from her place , and we strung a whole bunch of them up across her window .
you should see what that does .
let 's try it .
oh , no !
i 've got work to do .
do you kids think i 've got nothing better to do than to play silly games ?
go and get it .
oh , dear , dear , dar .
can yo se ?
oh , it 's gorgeous !
it 's not bd , is it ?
it 's not bad at all .
what do you mean , no ?
well , it 's what i came to see you about , mr. pendergast .
what for ?
hooked rugs , qults and crcheted tablecloths .
and we could have a stand and sell these- rainbow makers !
i never go into town , and i do n't believe in community projects .
but they need you !
they need me ?
i just wonder if folks would buy a thing like this .
now , i 'm not trying to sell you the brass , but it is durable .
well , the silver 's pretty  and i think you 're right about the brass 
oh , i do n't know 
hell , mrs .
snow .
well , where hare you been , you naughty girl ?
i 've ben helping for the bazar .
get them off my bed !
oh , they are n't dirty rgs .
you just take them right out of here !
i m not going to do anything of the sort !
mr. neely , the julians , and evn old mrs. thurm .
oh , she wants me to work in my condition .
do n't bother mrs .
snow , girl .
nobody 'll come to it .
that 's right 
because of your aunt .
that 's why not .
well , i do n't understand .
well  we do .
do n't we , mr. murg ?
mm-hmm .
good .
well .
now , about this white satin .
this is my first choice .
that 's right .
does she have to be here ?
go on into the kitchen and talk to mildred .
nw
well , it 's all settled then .
thirteen yards of the white satin ... t $ 1.20 the yard .
all right .
my father used to say ,
why do n't you go outside and play ?
hush up .
i want to hear what she has to say .
but surely he could afford a little thing like a doll .
we had to have the mony for food .
oh , for heaven 's sake .
so , anyway , my father wrote to the missionary people ... and asked them to please send a little secondhand doll .
wll , of course i was rather disappointed , so my father made up the glad game !
hush up .
certainly .
anyway , about the crutches , my father said , d n't let 's be gloomy .
let 's try and find something to be glad about .
so , anyway , we played the game and after a while ,
i forgot about the doll and being glomy .
well , there 's nothing happy about a pair of crutches .
well , we were glad that we did n't have to use them .
i just thought she could play the game !
i 'm not going t come and see you anymore .

oh , please , plase , mr. murg , leave me alone .
i 'm sorry if i've-
and that 's not all .
and that child !
helping them .
just a moment .
mrs. tarbell tells me you 're involved with that bazaar .
but , aunt polly , i m part of the fag !
we wo n't discuss it .
i do n't want you to see those people anymor .
and that 's n order !
yes , ma'am .
the blessings you 've heaped on that child , and her working with those people against you .
get down my cake tins , angie .
doing what ?
thinks she 's the queen of sheba , does she ?
where you gon na get the ingredients ?
whre do you think 
not to be kicked !
he kicked me in the stomach .
now , jimmy , you 've got to stop kicking mr. hooper and sit still !
i do n't wan na get my hair cut !
mr. pendergast .
i paid for the tickets .
i just ca n't show up at your affair .
claire , i just came from your newspaper offic .
now , take it easy , doo .
our space is all sold , and  ca n't go around-
you 're a coward .
t is n't baltimore up here , doo .
this is a small town .
you know as well as everybody our newspaper s owned by the harrington family .
liver-bellid bunch of miserable sheep 
just a minute , just a minute !
we ca n't afford to antagonize her .
claire ?
charlie ?
they 're afraid of polly harrington paying 'm back later .
you know her .
now , look .
we 've all taken a cut or two at the harrington 's , but she would n't do a thing like that .
no one will mke a move in this town wthout the harrington stamp of approval .
karl warren sent you , dd n't he ?
he knew no one would cooperate without me .
i just wanted it made clear you do n't mind if the others cooperate .
wo n't let your guard down for a minute , will you ?
you re still as opinionated as ever .
lots of meetings and civic duties and obligations .
it 's a por substitute for what 's really wrong with you .
wold you like to be paid fr your diagnosis ?
there 's no medical term for it .
you can give everything but love 
it 's as simple as that .
mum ?
i found them dry again today .
yes , mum .
like water off a duck 's back to her .
that woman 's got no feelings at all .
a lot of foolish nonsense .
hi , dear .
what 's the matter ?
oh , nothing .
is the bazaar off ?
you would n't understand .
is it because of aunt polly ?
yes .
it takes a wrd frm someone who is n't under her thumb .
fat chance yo got , ed .
one woman owning a town .
nancy .
that 's right .
what did you say ?
um , i just said that nobody could own a church .
our social structre in this small town seems to teeter on a delicate balance , one which i certanly can not in any way attempt to inflence .
then you 're siding with her by not mentioning it !
i 'm staying completely out of it , and that 's all there is to it .
reverend ford , if you 'll just let us say that you 're in favor .
there 's nothing more to discuss .
this is all just impossible .
i 'm fraid you 're right .

i do n't know whether i should laugh or cry
we 'll be together
we 'll b together till the end this time
you do n't know , you do n't know
do n't know the answer or the reason why
we 'll stick together till the day we die

you s , the first emperor , qin shi huangdi , was buried with them because the people believed they would guard him in th afterlife , but they did n't .

look , the only evil i know is my history teacher and jessica dawson .
and i do n't think you can help me with them .
that kick on the fild .
kay , look ,
i 'll admit there 's been some weird stuff going on with me lately , so i 'm gon na give you , like , a minute t tell me what 's up .
i have been reincarnated many times over the centuries to assist the descendant of the yin warrior to battle evil in the name of good .
the evil s imprisoned in the ganzi jade globe .
that kind of looks like me .
i really do n't like where this s going .
famine , earthquakes , oceans rising , locusts  fires , drought , darkness ...
h , there you are , wen .
hey , we 're going to the mall .
you wan na come with ?
i 've got a new skirt with no matching lipstick .
tory , i told you .
well , why is he dressed like that ?
no , look , can we not talk about this anymore ?
oh , hang on .
hey , i still do n't get it .
how could you not know you had a cousin in chna ?
sure .
hello ?
listen , i hear you have an interesting new friend .
that 's a great idea , tory !
we 'll write vote for wendy on a bunch of chopsticks and get your cousin to hand them out at lunch tomorrow .
no .
it will protect you during your training .
please , go back to your temple of doom or whatever .
look , i never agreed to train .
i know .
om .
you will be a great warrior .
i finished it .
it was all right .
frnk , yo all right ?
it 's sacrd monk stuff .
that 's col .
interesting .
we 've got a big problem now .
i would not have to do this if you would only wear the medallion .
evil is here .
you are so bad .
that 's god , right 
yeah , congratulations .
so , i hear ...
oh , my gosh , it 's been so embarrassing .
why ?
listen , why do n't you check to see if the bathrom is safe for me ?
yor instincts are becoming sharp .
so we 're still going to maria santiago 's party , right ?
oh , yeah .
the next homecoming queen should n't be partying without th homecoming king .
wendy , toilet now safe .
yeah .
many angry girls waiting for you to go .
actually , you ran into me .
anyway , i hope you know
that 's how you and i are .
i am so sorry about the disqualification .
from what ?
what am i thinking ?
i will help you .
it 's required in the temple .
well , that 's nice but we 're in school .
temple and school re just places .
chinese history is in here .
you tutor , i 'll train .
if we 're gon n do kung fu , yo do n't wan na pull a muscl or something .
so , how long is this gon na take ?
because we really should get started on my tutoring .
we will have time for both .
who 's gn na find a better way
wait .
hold on .
we need a hero
hey , tory .
what 's up ?
to save us from ourselves
oh , yeah .
me , too .

to save us from ourselves
lookin ' for a hero
sorry .
like nobody else
but if we ca n't find one
i will , i will
what ?
what ?
i think we should get started on my tutoring .
i 'll get my books .
you wo nt need your books .
as a yin warrior , you are connected to all of your ancestors as on life .
well , what does this have to do with my d in world history ?
you just have to learn how to remember 1,500 years of lessons .
okay .
i 'll go with this for a minute .
you must fcus your mind through meditatin .
that weird trance thing you do , going yum ?
not yum .
you would have been a great yin warrior and beautiful homecoming queen .
om .
om .
om .
om .
om .

i did it !
i remembered everything !
i got an a 
right .
wendy for homecoming queen flyers .
no , your traning , yu 'r not done .
hey , tory .
guess what 
but evil is very near .
we must be ready .
time for dinner .
in a minute , grandma .
funny , grandma .
when i see something or hear something or even smell something that reminds me of the village where i grew up .
what 's it mean ?
sitting on my grandfather 's lap on rainy days when he could n't go t work in the fields .
yeah , but , grandma , you do n't really believe that stuff ,
of course i believe it .
you told her ?
she already knew .
it 's a great honor .
hi , everybody .
what smells so ...
oh , hi .
ma , why did n't you tell us that your grandnephw on your second cousin 's father 's side was visiting ?
i thought i told you , or i meant to , or i 'm just old .
no , that 's silly .
not that there s anything wrong with that .
look , shen , even though it 's a little bit unannounced , we want you to fel welcome .
please stay as long as you want .
how long do you think that 'll be ?
ow !
 think he has to leave soon .
he 's on a misson to vsit us .
it 's a chinese thing .
it 's very rude to our guest .
eat .
oh , right , the posters .
yeah , it 's really fascnating but i 'm having a hard time getting the research straight .
perhaps i could help you .
one of my teachers at gingi temple is a direct descendant of qin shi huangdi , the first emperor of the qin dynasty .
hey .
shen , i would be so grateful if you could help me understand the history of some of the artifacts .
the exhibit is next week and i have to get everything organized .
hey , shen , do you know any kung fu ?
i have studied it for a very long time .
cool .
my football coach  he 's always n me about shaking the linebackers .
they 're always tagging me from th side 
monkey jumps over wall ?
that sounded cooler in chinese , man .
i agree .
whoa !
dude , you got ta teach me that .
oh , my .
soon .
ma , you have n't made these since i was a kid .
please , i hope you enjoy them .
mmm .
kenny , are n't you gon na have one ?
no .
excuse me .
ow !
but shen is really sweet .
just because they see me with him does n't mean they 're not gon na vote for me .
bye .
but how do you get the orange off your fingers ?
oh , hey , i was practicing that move .
watch .
yeah .
the same way dad said it was okay for you to ditch school and go surfing last week .
i 'll get the car .
how did you do that ?
t 's an ancient american move called , monkey jumps for smarter sister .
come on .
we 've got work to do .
i 've got a song bt i ai n't got no melody
i 've got a song but i ai n't got no melody
will it go round in circles ?
will it go round in circles ?
will it fly high like a bird up in the sky ?
i 'm gon na let th music move me round
will it fly high like a bird up in the sky ?
come n .
i thought yo were to full .
but it 's just when i saw these mooncakes , it was like i was a boy again .
and then i felt guilty that i grew up turning my back on all of this .
i do n't wan na do that anymore .
yo did n't do it alone .
no .
it 's so strange .
and opns my eyes to something we 've been missing .
it 's wnderful , is n't it ?
yeah .
oh , hi .
what do you think ?
i got highlights .
who re you looking for ?
he 's gon n wreck it for us .
maybe he 's a nice guy .
nice guy .
austin , that sounds a little snobby .
vote for wendy .
what did you do ?
he went from monk to hunk .
here , take one .
everybody was talking about you at school today .
yes , it was fun .
i 've never worn anything except that stupid robe .
is that why you were so willing to change ?
buddhists say the tiger is the mightiest but it is the chameleon who will endure .
you did it for me , did n't yo ?
this is good .
wht is name of ths taste ?
chocolate .
you 've never had chcolate before ?
well , do n't they have it in china ?
i 'm not sure .
some bettr than others .
not all yin warriors are memorable .
she almost faild .
tht 's why you must train hardr than any of your ancestors .
i hope so , but you may have to find the strength within you that i ca n't teach you , or ths may be the end for me and you and everything good .
whoa !
not too much pressure .
let 's talk about something else .
tell me about your girlfriends .
what 's it like being in love ?
then why are you with him ?
another buddhist saying ?
tell you what , since you lik my chocolate cupcakes so much ,
i will not be going home .
my dstiny is to perish during the battle .
it is how it has to be .
well , that 's a little harsh .
it 's all right .
oh , this is nothing .
i 'm gon na vote for you .
go ahead .
plus it 's a long weekend
get to stay out late tonight
do n't worry about the moves .
that 's t .

i just need to spend some time with shen right now .

tory , what are you doing ?
austin , pull her out !
austin , will you get me out of the pool ?

we 'll start with the snake .
what 's he doing ?
showing you respect .
why ?
he does n't know me .
he has known you for over 1,000 years .
hold on .
this is n't gon na work .
yes , it will .
you are stronger than you think .
t looks bizarre .
i have to live in this town .
oh , really ?
besides , it wo n't feel right fighting him .
he did n't do anything to me .
what 's up with this ?
coach gibbs ?
shen , what 's going on ?
i mean , monk .
we just thought you might want your phone back .
be as flexible as a snake .
what 's this ?
you call that balance 
cool .
let me call my frinds .
time for your final lesson , the aggressin of a tiger .
put everything you 've learned into one .
lt 's celebrate with your first cappuccino .

grandma  i 'm sorry if you 're mad at me but being a homecoming queen is all i ever wanted .
nobody asked me if i wanted to be a yin warrior .
you 're my granddaughter no matter what you do .
and i 've never questioned your choices .
i hate it when she does that to me .
well , it 's not gon na work .
get real .
so what if evil takes over ?
alone ?
hope it 's enough to beat these guys .
come on , daddy , i 'm gon na be late .

got ta go .
so do n't be late .
uhoh .

your hour of destiny has arrived .
and ...

we 're all on the way to my place for mooncakes 
you 're all invited .
i 've been eating them for 1,000 years .
let 's go this way .
nebula :
i got for busting inky wyndham and lutz .
uh-oh .
let 's rocket .
hey , will you ice ?
how 
you 're keeping out of trouble , i hope .
of course  commander plank .
enjoy your day .
you , too , kids .
woman :
we need a security dtail .
how thermo is ths ?
snooze central .
do yo wn na play ?
sure !
here it is 
okay , this is what you got ta do .
you move that mouse to make your bar go up and down .
then you got ta try and trap the little blips before they go off and go into the bigger area .
okay .
okay , let 's go .
zenon :
here we g .
here we go .
zenon :
okay  her we go .
zenon :
you 're doing good !
here we go !
here we go .
oh , my gosh !
there are so many blips in ther .
do n't let any ...
do n't let any of them out !
concentrate !
oh , my gosh , neb , come on !
there 's one left .
there 's one left .
do n't let it ot .
man :
they 're worried .
something wrong , lieutenant ?
plank :
zenon :
high five !
someday , we 're actually gon na find out what these little blips mean .
no , no , i ...
i understand fully .
yeah .
what 's wrong ?
i mean , it 's not lik i expected that we 'd be together forever .
i 'm not a moron-major , but , he dumped me !
i 'm not sure how , but she 's down there , and i 'm up here , and she 's probably been plotting to get gregory to jettison me and pay attntion to her .
it 's just ..
well , look at the upside .
all the time you 've been spending zap-padding greg can now be used to tke further advantage of your free run of the spay-stay .
zenon , i 'msorry , but after your little incident this morning ,
kindlyhandin yourrzrp to my offic asap .
and i lost my favorite shoe !
zenon :
yes , i 'm sure you did n't , zenn .
nevertheless !
i firmly believe that the discipline of working down here in the alien patrol lab will be good for you .
and truth be told , you 'll be performing a misson of mercy .
your por friend orion 's been working down here for five full years .
you know how many signals he 's picked up in all that time ?
none 
to assume w are the only units in space ,
i personlly call it rudeicrous .
nw , look  in my hardly humble opnion , bidirectional telemetry is only a matter of time .
come in , come in .
you know ?
okay .
zenon 's being assigned to a month of three-hour evenng shifts with a six-hour day on saturdays .
cetus-lupedus , commnder !
you simply need to be here .
but what if today 's silence turns to tomorrow s thunderous call from the void ?
look , no lie , just last week , i uncovered evidence of a new planet that may hav formed  mere 20 a from gamma pictoris .
yeah , see ?
i got ta get back to the command deck .
i expect you to report back down here at 1900 hours tonight .
what ?
oh .
uh , okay , you ready for your tour ?
the first thing you got ta know about are these babies .
um , lok , if they ever start rotatng at an accelerated speed , you come over here , and you sond the red lert ...
alien signal ...
alien signal !
alien signal .
alarm clock .
ah  congratulations , zee , you just survived your first shift .
zenon :
you 're in comprehension-mode-minor , mom !
well , the month will be over before you know it .
kind of like me and greg .
do n't worry , i am not so squashed .
protozoa .
butwhatis certain is tht sinc his rturn frommicrobe 's triumphant concert in space ,
protozoahasnot been sen in pblic , nor has he been in a recording studio .
cetus-lupedus , he ca n't be doing this !
why is he doing this ?
he 's on a break , a vacation , something .
repeat , allhands to the mess hall for an emergency briefing .
look , team , i 'm sorry .
me too .
military ?
yeah , what ...
all right , first they 're sending up a squad to assess the condition and contribution of each modul .
following that evalation , some space station components could be detached and jettisoned .
plank :
if that occurs , crtain personnel might be reassigned to earth , bt any speculatin in that direction is .
are they considering shutting us down altogether ?
to the best of my limitd knowledge , absolutely not .
what ?
right .
plank :
i know it 's hard , but we 're professionals , and if we can just wait for general hammond to arrive ,
i think everything will be xplained to you .
zenon , i know your mother has an incredible fear of flying and an ven more acute fear of earth , but any decisions regarding who stays and who goes wo n't be up to m .
but you 're gon na have sme kind of opinion , right ?
they do n't even know us .
general hammond nd his tem have arrived in the transport lounge .
all right , have him report to my office .
whenever i have a vital , formidable mission to assgn , i look for the best man or young woman for the job .
whatever you need , i 'm your girl 
it 's not often someone my ge gets to serve her country under the command of such a noble and gifted leader .
yu request t , i 'm in .
spacewalking , duct crawling , undercover ops ...
margie ?
margi girl .
since you 've had a long , grueling flight ,
but , daddy , why ?
i 'm not in the least bit tired .
hammond :
all right , all right , i was just ...
did i mention that gregory said to say hi ?
are you pancaked ?
i 'll survive .
but up here , you are n my turf .
if daddy s the commander of your ship , and let 's fce it ,
i 've got daddy totally wrapped .
no !
i have n't even worn it yet .
it just arrived frm the virtual mall this morning .
so if you 'r not mondo nice to me ,
bye-ness !
homework lesson b .
she only gets under your skin 'cause you let her , zee .
why so she can call up daddy and order him to send my family packing 
whoa .
yeah , but you know what ?
it 's not gon na happen to us .
znon !
voice : zum .
plank :
what is it 
you need t rocket over here warp speed .
well  there is a slight spike on the graph , but there could be 100 different reasons for that 
you know , it 's true , zee .
i mean , with every country in the world sending up satellites into space , we 're always picking up interference of some kind .
no , it was a very specific and very distinct zum .
look , zee , i 'm the first one to wan na believe you , but there is nothing here .
all right , uh , let 's just go with simple logic .
for as long as this space staton has been in orbit  for as long as mankind has monitored the skies , no one has ever gotten even the tiniest indication that there was any sort of intelligent life out there .
zenon , i assigned you this duty to keep you out of troble , and tht 's all .
you believe me , right , mm ?
i believe you believe you heard something , but it could 've been a billion things , honey , you know , a computer hiccup , a power srge .
d n't get mad at me for saying this , but you 've been having a pretty lousy few days ,
do n't you think it 's possible you could have invented this signal just to put yorself back in the spotlight ?
dad !
i heard a zum !
got any calls from outer space today , zenon ?
next you 'll be saying an extraterrestrial ate your homework .
aw , sounds like too much time alone in that ap lab scrambled your brain .
nebula :
come here , come here !
you 've got ta see this .
it does n't take disks or anything .
it 's wired into a totlly unlimited catalog of movies you can upload by hitting a button .
it even hs romo and juliet on mars .
one and two .
do you wan na come ?
what time is it ?
you ca n't .
you 've got ta go to the ap lab .
would n't wan na miss any calls from your alien pals .
margie , let me just say one thing .
hello , daddy ?
nebula , go watch the movie .
okay , see you !
zum .
zum 
hello ?
oh , come on !
is anybody out here ?
something wrong ?
another zum ?
well , knd of , only higher .
zum .
ah , well ,
that is what our monitor larm sounds like , zenon .
no zum or zum .
but , commander ,  ...
hammond :
you 're not going to believe this !
evn though the graph spikes clearly indicate nothing more than normal satellite interference ?
in fact , i think it would be better if we suspended the rest of your assignment up here .
inanticipationof the tremor-like jlt associated with the sepration , allpersonnelshouldreport to designated secure areas at that time .
where 's my strss helmet ?
as far as i can figur , wyndham and lutz 's sabotage effort knocked our staton out of its intended orbit .
are w just gon na sit here and take this ?
what do you propose we do ?
i do n't know , but i 'll think of something .
whn hard from your lips , zee , those are the most terrifying words n the galaxy .
you see this ?
s n't that more of a reason to fight back ?
this is where we re meant to be .
i 'm starting to wonder if we would n't all be better off back on earth .
i could marry judy .
i could get a normal job .
ctus-lupeedus , this is not you talking , commander plank .
girl :
my mom says that everybody 's calling her the girl who cried alin .
boy :
you have to come along .
you 'll love it .
there you are .
i need you to do my history report on the stock market crash of 2006 .
is n't that so fun ?
frget it !
in fact , why do n't you just forget we were ever friends !
nebula :
do you want to laser-zap me for it ?
i 'm sorry .
what 's this really about ?
she 's a pain-major , neb !
you 've been so caught up in this whole alien thing  i 've hardly even seen you .
fine , go with her and ride the inky commuter pod .
ugh !
i do n't care if they think i 'm a lunatic-major .
they can ridicule me and blame me , bt i fully know i 'm right about this .
 wish i 'd never been sent to that stupid ap lab in the first plce .
who .
i want you to hear something .
but it is .
zum , zum , zum
are you inferring aliens sent you that ?
why ?
thy 're not trying to contact anyone on the spaystay .
♪zoom , zoom , zoom♪
i 'm seriusly sure that we need to alert plank .
orion !
both plank and hammond s do n't want to hear about the aliens right now , so i 'm kind of thinking we should keep this to ourselves .
reporttosecureareas immediately .
thejettisoningof sector seven will begin in one minute 
i think it is rudeicrous times 10 how they are just blasting away our home bit by bit .
the way things are going , i half expect to look out the window and see a gigundos interstellr wrecking ball .
you wo n't listen to me .
you 're s fully inked-ot ver that silly little fight we had ?
we 're bfs for life !
okay .
be friends with margie if that 's what you want .
i just want to know how we 're ever gon na get past this if you wo n't tell me what 's truly tweaking you ?
no .
they are .
but , we 're a pair .
why did n't you tell me sooner , neb ?
well , you wre so mad at me , i did n't think you 'd care .
this is crisis-mode-extreme .
we 'll think of something .
what if those signals wer n't really from outer spac ?
besides , when you 're as low on the popular pole as i am , the only way you can go is up .
can you blieve it ?
zenon :
how am i gon na survive on earth ?
hey , at least it 's not as gaseous as we used to imagine it to be .
the food ...
the food is lunarous .
the second you get there , you have to order a bacon double-mshroom onon cheeseburger and dedicate it to me .
oh  w understand , believe me .
i wish those military clowns had some idea what they were doing to all of us .
woman  attention !
all earth-bound passengers mustnowboardthe shuttle in preparation for departure .
all earth-bound passengers ...
mn : 49er , alpha foxtrot .
zenon :
ow !
margie :
about time , houdini .
margie !
are you trying to ruin everything ?
i ca n't believe this .
were you spying on me ?
ugh !
d i look dreadful ?
argh !
oh , wait a second .
are you in truble again ?
was i supposed to pick you up somewhere 
what in the world is going on ?
breathe .
it 's okay .
i 'll explain everything .
and nobody wants to believe me , even though i know the aliens are real , 'cause not only did they signal me twice in the ap lab , but ...
oh , it 's aliens .
do you seriously believe that ?
as sure as i believe my name is judy kling .
most days .
i mean , how could there not be other life out in the endless expnse ?
what are we , a planet of egomaniacs ?
is n't she the most stellanarious grown-up ever ?
please ?
okay .
let 's think .
his own manager 's been on the flat-scren saying he has no idea where he is .
do you seriously think a ufo could swoop down , swipe up one of the most mega-famous guys on the plant  and then zoom away withot anyone seeing them ?
negatory , marge .
no .
he 's here .
yeah , and this would help ...
i know ,  know !
supernova girl .
impressive-major , aunt judy .
there was also nova nights , and
perfectdreamhadaline init about the nova of my heart .
so he 's a nova freak .
what does that prove ?
what else does he talk about a lot ?
okay , does n't h mention some linda girl in a ton of songs ?
cetus-lupeedus , margie !
you 're a genius-major !
so , what else is new ?
what 'd i say this time ?
aunt judy , does n't linda mean somethng in spanish ?
lnda nov , nova linda , hmm .
what are you doing ?
this is it !
as my manager , les , you should understand btter than anybody , that someone as undeniably fantastic as me should be doing only undeniably fantstic things .
well , i ca n't run for president .
but we 're older now and wiser and fully ready to handle anything .
margie :
i 'm tired !
i 've got all these icky little pricker-thingies in my ankles !
no , no , no , no , no .
see , that 's where i fully draw the line .
se ya !
hey , wait !
i hate this !
i hate it !
if people were intended to be outdoors , then they never would have invented houses !
zenon , if you 're gon n stop dead , you could at least warn a girl .
fine !
go right ahead of me .
margie ?
are you here ?
sinceyouprobablyleft this morning thinking i was still asleep  bythetimeyou get this , daddy , i 'll be on earth with zenon .
knowsheseemsharmless , but ever since this whole alien-mania thing ,
iloveyou , daddy .
i 'll contact you the second i can .
bye-ness !
there 's no other way through .
well , we ca n't just stand here until we turn into statues .
ca n't you knock it down or something ?
what if it 's poisonous ?
h , so you 'd rather me get bitten ?
obviously !
ew !
what happened earlier when you knockd ?
she 'll be fine by the morning .
she 's downstairs n her bedroom .
zenon :
go away !
leavemealone !
um , i betyu'reprobably wondering where your darling daughtr is ?
zenon :
years of practice .
you try too hard .
relax .
margie , it tickles !
i ca nt move !
never send an amateur to do a job that requires a pro .
no , margie 
do n't !
now i 'm stuck , too !
and that 's my fault ?
zum , zum , zum .
they 're flly imitating you !
of course they are , love .
who would n't be ?
she 's fine .
come where ?
 've done the space thing , remembr ?
proto zoa !
first rock star ever to sing for alien beings from another galaxy .
oy-oy-oy !
pack my spacesuit !
all i need to know is when do we leave 
sometimes judy gets so caught up in being the fun aunt , sh does n't always use her best judgment .
it 's not going to happen , hon .
but if it does ...
this has been our home fr so long .
it 's so familiar and protected .
and it 's where we belong .
being a family is n't about our address .
sorry , sir .
i 'm here on orders from genral hammond .
you and mrs. kar are under house arrest .
we 're what ?
what ?
we have to get down to our lab .
we have some very important experiments in progress .
i am sorry , sir .
i 'm actually writing .
i have n't been abl to scribble down a single note since i fell into my funk .
it 's like my mom says ,
gemma usually does all the coking in space .
yeah , and as soon as they land , creepy government official guys with lots of keys would try to catch them and experiment on 'em .
outer space s a pretty enormous xpanse , if i recall .
voice : access denied 
right aftr they sent the first message directly to me ,
orion said he suspected they also downloaded all kinds of information , but i have n't figured out how to get it .
accessgranted .
cetus-lupeedus , look !
wedefinitelyknow it 's a map , orion .
ijustdon'tknow how to read it .
okay , cn you uplad it to me ?
icantry .
i 'll see if i can match any of their coordinats and get back to you asap .
how does she do it ?
he would have gotten ll red-faced mad t me , if he thought i 'd flown off just to have an adventure .
oh , so once again , i 'm the expendable one .
but i thought you had him , oh , so totally wrapped .
about some things .
look , you fully have to convince him to let us use the shttle .
the aliens are waiting , margie , and if we can show the world that our spay-stay 's responsible for contacting other life forms then ...
maybe they 'll stop tearing it apart and leave us lone .
come on , marge .
that 's it .
proto zoa and i will be right here rooting for you .
thetruenature of our mission ..
hello , daddy ?
assoonas we 'verelocatedall space statin personnel to earth by the end of next week , wewilljettisonthe remaining sectors .
man :
i could hear him .
he just could n't hear me .
can you believe this ?
judy 
i 'm telling you what zenon heard hammond telling hart .
and soon .
supposei couldrustleup a shuttle , and suppose , just for a mnute , thati wasinsaneenough to take off after a pack of proto zoa-loving aliens .
judy :
re you ready for this one ?
thealienssentzenonamap .
they what ?
it'strue !
noonedownhere knew how to read it , but we 're hoping that he 'll have the skills and the tools to decipher it .
sweethert ?
doyouhavethe slightest idea how crazy this sounds ?
especially life with zenon .
i simply used their benchmark symbols of the earth and moon to calibrate ther distance units .
then i re-plotted those locations to our standard issue navigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in all candor , orion , d you blieve this map is legitimate ?
look , sir , if you get on a shuttle and you fly out to the location ndicated here in my hardly humble opinion , you are going to find yourself , face to face with extraterrestrials .
h , 'cause i was thinking ...
why do you hate me ?
what are you talkng about ?
you 've been mean and sarcastic to m sinc the last time i was on earth .
oh , that .
wait , are you actually saying peopl lsten to me ?
kay .
do you know how many tmes we 've moved , how many schools i 've gone t ?
i do n't try to be a jerk .
what if i get plank into a lot of trouble for taking that shuttle ?
everybody 's got pressures in their life , margie .
if you wan na make some rel friends , start by learning you 're not the nly person in the galaxy with problems .
like what ?
the ar is inky brown 
the food tastes lik plastc .
captain rand wills , united states intergalactic patrol .
to interview your daughter  and find out what she knows about the current whereabouts of zenon kr .
oh , please , come n .
um , i have ...
i 've been missing her terribly .
would you permit me to pilot the departing transport shuttle this evening ?
i do n't see why that could n't work , commander .
we appreciate this .
listen , i told you everything i know .
she came down here to find proto zoa .
precisely how did miss kr intend to discver his whereabouts ?
zenon 
he is actually coming down ?
that 's a mircle-major !
did you hear that ?
we got a shuttle , and plank s going to pilot us to meet the aliens .
where are w hooking up wth him ?
youguysneedtogetthere as soon as possible , butmakesurethat you stay out of sight .
what 's up ?
well , nebula called to say that hammond has a patrol dwn here searching for you , checking anywhere and everywhere that you guys might be .
have they shown p at your place yet ?
notyet , buti 'm sure it 's only a matter of time .
revise that .
oh !
did you her that , guys ?
we re going to space t meet the aliens 
woo-hoo !
judy :
it does n't seem like anybody 's here .
oh , man , you have zero idea how envy-green i am .
i mean , this is the real deal , commander .
this is the trip  have spent my whle life cogitating about .
i mean , you 're actually getting to meet extraterrestrals .
yes , well , i 'm still very ...
i 'm still very skeptical about this whole thing , orion .
wman :
oh , hang on .
yu do n't want to be rocketing off to meet the aliens without your navigational charts .
thank you , orion .
i ca n't tell you how much i appreciate ...
all your help .
now , before your heli-hover arrives i have to ask you on thing .
i 've seen luggage stores with less luggage .
let me remind you ladies that staying as fabulous-looking as i m requires mga attention
have we heard from zenon yet ?
thy 're bck from nova linda cove and they 're headed for crlson bech .
before we go , would you mind terribly if maybe i washd up a little bit ?
come on .
plank is now under full military arrest .
now , asmuchaswewanna support you in this , honey , yourmotherandi are startng to think thatmaybeyououghtto surrender to hammond 's patrol andcomehome .
and fully forget about the aliens ?
now , thebottm-lin reality is , plank is the only one on our sde whohastheability to fly a shuttle .
i ...
not to mention historical .
why could n't you be the pilot in the family ,
i mean , you 'd go out there in a heartbt , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
when did i turn into such a big , fat chicken ?
i used to love flying .
zenon does n't get it all from you , you know ?
i do know .
suddenly , the stakes changed .
i mean , she wnts me to do this more thn anyone .
so , where ar they ?
worry-down , aunt judy .
i 'm sure they 'll be here any minute .
i studied ths ship 's navigational charts 100 times .
you sure ?
i 'm capable of flying  shuttle at this point , orion .
i 'm telling you , mrs. k. , it 's fine , you wo n't have to .
what ?
what do you mean ?
um .
hi , you guys !
hi .
oh , how did edward ever pick this spot to land ?
cetus-lupeedus , aunt judy , no one 's told you yet ?
hammond threw him into military jail .
hammond 's going on the mega-warpath and if i 'm wrong about this whole alien thing , it could be disaster-extreme .
but , sweat-minor , aunt judy , 'cause i 'm fully sure everything 's gon na be just fine .
but , if edward is n't piloting the ship , who is ?
oh , my word , this was a mistake .
i ...
how did i let myself get talked into this ?
look , just relax , okay .
the only thing more terrifying to me than tking off is landng .
i , uh , i really do n't think i can do it .
look , i do n't wan na be unsupportive or anything , mrs. k. , but maybe you shold 've thought of that before we took off .
we 're the united states military , wills , she 's a 15-year-old girl !
it'sharderthan we thought , sir .
orion :
okay , brace yourself , we 're abound to enter the atmosphere .
h , dear .
oh , my word , the landing .
look , mrs. k. , i have full confidence in you , but can  suggest this is gon na be easier if you open your eyes !
frm you , dollface .
it 's true 
there it is , it 's almost here !
orion , what if it kept flying right out of my chest ?
okay .
oh .
oh , oh , oh !
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blue-eagle-2 , we are closing on target .
we have visual confirmation .
watchyourflanks , people .
who 's that ?
mom , we have to go !
zenon :
what 's happening ?
what 's going on ?
i ca n't get them to reignit .
engage target .
soldier 2 :
orion :
come on .
and your girlfriend .
mr. kar 
and since it 's also a very risky and brave endeavor , and since we all have people we lve on that ship , sir , maybe instead of assigning blame and punishment , we ought to focus on  way of helping them achieve a safe return ?
sir .
i do n't get it , mm .
well , the trouble is , converting their measurements to ours does n't mean the calcultions were precise .
i mean , even a variance of a few degrees on paper could mean thousands f miles ot here in space .
we are gon na find them  are n't we ?
i mean , we 'll just fly around out here until they show up ?
we have a finite fuel supply , limited provisions .
t 's okay , they 're gon na be here , i know it .
whatever ends up happening out here , thank you .
for what ?
hony , you showed me that it 's fine to wan na live a safe and sane life , but sometimes we can get so safe , yu practcally stop living .
ship console :
fuel tanks in depletion zone .
rion sad that the auxiliary tanks he put in are even larger than th main tanks .
ship console :
now , that 's wrong , it has to be 
please reconnect to main tanks .
auxliarytanksempty .
orion , did everything appear normal when you refilled the auxiliary tanks ?
i mean , i know they 're not exactly thrilled with us but they ca n't wan na leave us up here to die !
i tried calling but there must be a meteor shower in progress bcause all i got was static .
tell me one thing , do i look half as hysterical as  feel ?
what , more so than usual , you mean , love ?
uh , folks  we also have another problem .
bfore nyone can reach us , we 're gon na get sucked into the moon 's gravitational field .
is that bad ?
look , everyone first of all should stay calm .
are you sure ?
i hav always known that blasting into an endless void was bad for one 's health .
so , how did i end up here ?
zenon :
come on , come on  folks , we ca n't die out here in space .
look out .
exactly as orion predicted , the moon 's gotten a hold of us .
we 're going down !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
where 're they taking us ?
am i draming ?
how can this be happenng ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
what f thy try to come on board ?
do we think it 's ...
i certainly think so .
ctus-lupeedus , did you see that ?
madam , sir ,
i bet you got a million questions for me , ai n't you , you little beasties ?
well , i 'm here .
what if we were wrong ?
apparently , their ship 's navigational cmputer 's gone into meltdownmode-major .
it kind of feels lke ...
if they 're such highly evolved , intelligent beings why do n't they simply tap into our space station mainframe and take the charts they need .
what ?
we are telling you exctly what zenon zap-padded us .
margi 's wth them , they 're all safe , they 're on their way back and if we stand by , w are gon na witness something that is , and i quote ,
the most astonishing event-major of the 21st century .
lt .
at this point , sir , um , it looks like  flying rainbow .
zenon :
they were real !
but the fact remains , i was not set up here to be some mustache-twirling villain ,
this space staton has drifted out of ts prscribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hammnd , i ...
do you dare to argue with me ?
and we gave them the navigational stuff that they needed nd they gave us a tow home .
and the whole thing is so macro that the world needs to know about it .
proof , margie .
what no one her seems to be offering is prof .
uh , actually , we 're falling bck into orbit .
stellar .
thank you !
thank you , thnk you , thank you , ladies and gents .
well , as my pal zenon kar can testify , when she so cleverly found me on nova linda cove , i was a mess .
so , she told me about these space aliens , and she told me that they wanted to contact me .
they picked p my transmission of my concert in outer space and used that to contact a true believer , zenon .
so what if i 'm not the center of the universe ?
i mean , look at me , i wanted new challenges and i 've gotten them .
so , to commander and mrs. edward plank ,
all right , everybody , clap !

of all the planets in our universe , there is only one we know can support life .
it 's been called the lucky planet .
without that crucial tilt , everything wld hve been different .
all life on earth is built on chance and powered by the sun .
but the delicate balances of our world are faltering , as the planet struggles to support our growing demands .
january , the high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month .
every lving thing is just waiting .
perhaps it 's just to clean her fur , but it looks like sheer joy .
they 're drawn to ther mother 's calls , but these slopes are not the easiest plce to take your first steps .
the cubs have n't been fed this morning .
the mother has delayed their first meal on this special day .
hunger will draw them to her .
milk is the only food the cubs have known since they were born deaf and blind beneath the snow .
every year at this time , female bears need food desperately .
this is the only place the bars can hunt for seals .
if they do n't make it there before the ice breaks up , their families will starve .
it 's unlikely both of her cubs will survive their first year out on the ice .
march  and munch of the north remains snow-bound .
a thousand miles south of the bears , stunted conifers are still locked in ice .
it 's on of the last great wildernesses .
these cnifers have needle-shaped leaves virtually inedible so the forest supprts very little animal life .
this creture s the very essence of wilderness .
as spring creeps up from the south , the taiga is unveiled .
they 've come to make the most of the brief flush of spring fod and to have their young .
if newborn calves are to keep up , they must be on their feet and running the day they 're born .
but these vast herds do n't travel alone .
the clf may be young but it 's capable of outrunning the wolf , if it manages to keep its footng .
by this stage , the odds are even .
aprl in the arctic , and already the sun never sets .
but further south , the sun works its magic in more gradual familiar ways .
the broadleaf woodlands of europe and north america .
more than any other , these have been crowded out by towns and farmland .
only fragments remain .
summers are longer here and deciduous trees can flourish .
spring has also come erly for the mandarin dcks .
it 's a long way down for a maiden flight .
 few calls of ncouragement are needed here .
ther are still two missing .
only two dys old and already one great adventure behind them .
a seasonal cycle that seems increasingly unreliable .
but thre are parts of our world that have no seasons .
may , in the tropics , but there is no spring .
this is what allows the jungle to grow unchecked and support so munch life .
rainforest now covers a third of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planet 's surface and yet , it contains more than half of all the plants and anmals on arth .
he can concentrate on more important tasks , like tidying up his display area .
this magician has a special trick .
with the audence in place , the show can bgin .
she just has to have been impressed with that .
fter all that effrt , can she still have doubts ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % of its plants and animals nowhere is there more at stake .
deserts cover one third of the lnd 's surface on planet erth , and they 're getting bigger every year .
and the challenges are becoming greater than ever .
june in the kalahari desert of southern africa .
lt 's the dry seson here , and thusands of elephants have started the desperate trek for food and water .
at the moment it is dry , but water should come .
buffalo jin the great trek .
dust storms make the going tough all the way .
they 've become separated frm the herd .
this is a dangerous place to lose your way .
they dare n't rest until they reach it .
finally , the stragglers emerge from the dust .
the storm has died down .
but not all the animals have been so lucky 
sand dunes give way to prairies and savannah .
grass is a great unsung hero of our plnet .
this is the circle of life that most of us , in our urban lives , have lost touch with .
perhaps spurred on by a memory from the past , the matriarch leads the herd to a temporary water hole one that may have saved her life years ago .
the calf and its mother are most at risk .
ln the darkness , an elephant 's vision is little bettr than our own .
the lions bide their time .
it 's the calves they 're after .
the calves are too well protcted .
as the desrts grow , and traditional migraton routes are blocked by farms and fences , elephants must trek ever greater distances .
the sn that scorches the desert also brings water to the land .
as it beats down on tropical seas  moisture rises from the warming oceans powering our global weather system .
as the air rises , so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scene is set for one of nature 's most challenging migrations .
each year , thousands of demoiselle cranes try to escape the harsh winters in mongolia , by flying south to the warmer climes of india .
to get thre , they have to cross the hghest mountain rnge on earth , the himalayas .
the cranes hit violent turbulence .
the sun 's rays weaken in the afternoon and the turbulence falls away , but it 's too late for today .
the adults must guide their young on this hazardous trip .
it 's early morning and the warm air is already rising fast .
this is the great unending cycle .
for genertions , humans and animls alike come to depnd on the great rivers and their seemingly endless flow 
after months of drought , the rivers begin to flow again in the kalahari .
this is an africa we rarely see a lush water world totally reliant on a seasonal flood , originating from a tropical ocean thousands f miles away .
many animals are quite at home in the flood , but ther are some more apprehensive bathers .
after wks of marching , the elephants are exhausted .
after so many weeks  many hundreds of miles  they 've arrived .
the seasonal cycle that drives the lives of elephants on land , is just as importnt in the oceans .
it 's july and the humpback whales are in thr breeding grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no more than a few weeks old and as he begins to tire , his mother supports him close to th surface , so that he can breathe .
these shallow equatorial waters make good nurseries they 're warm and calm and there are few predtors .
to find food , she will have t lead her calf on an epic 4,000-mile journey t richer feeding grounds at the southern extremes of our planet .
this is the longest migration by any marine mammal , and it depnds entirely on a halthy ocean all along the way .
ot in the open ocean , the whals meet others searching for food .
they have to cross half the globe , from the equator all the way to the edge of antarctica .
th tropical seas are a long way behind them now .
they 're heading for stormy seasonal waters .
great whites attack whale calves , but they 're not the victims today .
thes magnificent predators , at the very top of the food chain , are a vital part of a healthy ocean ... and yet we slaughter almost a hundred million of them every year .
their populations are in freefall .
out to sea , the ice is now too thin to support the cubs ' father .
this is a disaster for polar bears .
without a solid platform , they struggle to hunt th seals they need to survive .
how will the father make it through the year now that the ice is almst gone ?
the waters are getting colder and rougher .
so as not to lose track of each other , they slap their fins n the surface .
the whales have fnally reached antarctica in time for the summer .
at last , fter their 4,000-mile journy , the humpback whales can feed .
now , at last , the mother can replnish her rserves as she and her calf join the rest of the team .
winter in antarctica and the greatest seasonal change on ur planet is underway .
soon the continent will be plnged back into darkness .
the aurora australia illuminates the southern skies , but these spectacular lights bring no warmth to the wilderness of ice .
our male polar bear is in great danger now .
after many dys at sea , the exhausted bear is drawn by the pungent smells of the colony .
he 's desperate for food , but walrus are munch larger than his unseal prey .
it 's the pups he 'll have to get to .
the powerful adults can d terrible damage with their huge tusks .
he tests the barrier .
and agin , in sheer frustration now .
it slips frm his grasp .
this ne took the gamble ... and lost .
unable to feed , he ca n't survive .
they 've left their mother ... and ar thriving .
the polar bear has become an emblem for the state of our planet and for all the creatures who are struggling to live alongside uns .

i choose to live here .
and nw , tell me about this friend of yours in paris .
not at all like the plebeian peasants you would meet out here .
how can you allow yourself to go to seed like a fat duck ?
ducks do n't go to seed , my dear sister .
well , lke a vgtable then .
a cabbage , an artichoke .
but , darling , think of paris .
lovely , gay paris .
that must be what they call catnip in paris .
champignons .
and delicious too .
too bad her beauty is wasted here .
we would go everywhere in style , would n't we , chérie ?
hey , mewsette !
what 's the matter ?
okay , okay .
you do n't have to push .
to mewsette , the prettest cat n all of france
it 's yur poem .
roses are red violets are blue
signed , jaune tom .
jaune tom !
you take that horrid , vulgar thing away from here this minute !
but ..
but cats like mice .
you 're not a ... ?
you 're a fe ...
what ?
i think she means a female , robespierre .
and all felines really like is champagne and champignons and champs élysées ..
i feel like a cabbage that 's gone to seed .
like a fat duck !
oh , go away , yo ple ...
plebeian peasant , you !
i never want to see you again .

so do we .
do n't we , jaune tom ?
jaune tom ?
now lok what you 've done , you ...
you old feline , you !
well , if yu do n't like us plebleens , why do n't you go away with her ?
i 'll bet she just lves on cham-pag-ne and cham-pygmy-ons and champs-ulysses .
i 'll go to paris .
well  bon voyage , mademoiselle feline .
au revoir , robespierre !
what do you know ?
i must have a way with felines .
free !
oh .
you are a girl .
you can come on back now .
mewsette 'll take the mouse ?
no .
she 's left , jaune tom .
tok off .
what do you mean she 's gone ?
she just went away in a carriage .
the one that took her to paris .
all felines go to paris , i guess .
let 's g mouse hunting .
hey .
wait for me !
mewsette !
for the last time , my lad , if your friend arrived in that buggy she has gone to paris .
all right .
i know that , but where 's paris 
what is paris ?
is it a school or something for felnes ?
yes .
well , thanks  lot .
he went thatawy .
good morning , jaune tom .
i 'm really n my way to paris !
delightful .
oh , yes .
visiting relatives ?
oh , no .
oh , but you must think i 'm terribly bold to talk this way to a stranger .
i think your nthusasm is charming , and i 'm not offended .
oh , thank you .
i just know i 'll be happy here .
of course .
oh , dear me .
you need a friend , a sponsor 
mademoiselle !
please forgive me .
it 's just that ...
i thought that my sister , one of the most influential cats in paris might be persuaded to take you under her wing 
oh , no , please 
then it is settled .
come along , my dear .
i ca n't , robespierre .
i have to find mewsette .
i 'm gon na look for trains 
yes .
here we are , my dear , the best in all paris .
is n't she pretty ?
henrietta , you are my sster .
sister !
she is an old dear but a little absent-minded .
imagine , not even remembering your own brother !
yes .
how slly of me .
of course i 'm his sister .
i have told her f your wnderful salon where you will make her into the belle of all paris .
of course , dear brother .
you know what must be done .
so this time , i want something in advance .
and you are the king of the scoundrels .
so i want one of you to keep an eye on that girl at all times .
as they say , evil is the root of all money 
gosh !
let 's go home .
no , robespierre .
well , i can .
so long , jaune tom .
well , do n't just stand there .
let 's start lookng .
mewsette !
stop that noise !
go way , you silly little pussycats .
scram !
go on !
i do n't know why you ever came to paris .
it must be refined , yet seductive .
like this :
oh , stop !
being sorry is n't enough .
we do n't want to disappoint meowrice , do we ?
now , let 's show him how poised and gracefully we walk wth a bowl of milk on our head .
now walk towards me .
head rect .
left .
revers .
oh , look out !
oh , no .
i 'm a failure .
no !
stop her !
stop her !
my poor dear .
would n't yu like to stroll on the boulevard , stop t  sidewalk cafe ?
and order champs élysées , just once .
let us be gay .
we shall do th town .
those sidewalk cafes were so much fun .
and paris is so beutiful !
what 's kissing ?
bt do they only kiss in buggies ?
why is that ?
because , my nive one , there is nothing so romantic as a buggy ride .
here we are .
hw foolish i was .
i tell you , jaune tom , it 's hopeless .
she 's probably miles from here .
let 's go back to the farm .
okay .
now you re talking !
robespierre , look !
look what it says : felines !
i 'll bet they 'd know where she is .
here we go again .
there 's no one here .
no one at all .
let 's find our way out of here and get back to that feline place .
dear mr. phtt :
p.s .
there are other suitors .
if you ever decide to mrry , boys , marry for love of money .
pardon me , my friend , but that was the most remarkable exhibition of virtu-mouse-ity i 've ever witnessed .
virtu-what-sity ?
virtu-mouse-ity .
we accept !
and now can we at ?
milk .
let 's really live it up big , jaune tom .
chmpagne for the greatest mouse catcher in all france and his manager 
one bottle of champagne , hot off the ice .
hey , it 's made out of bubbles .
everyone .
shaloot ...
i salute you !
here , what is this ?
lmpossible .
where are you going , turtle ?
what do you know ?
i wo n't hrm your little friend .
you see , we three are all in the same boat .
that is pretty funny .
no .
n , i guess not .
the truth is , w have been shanghaied , shipmates .
or catnapped , in your case .
jaune tom .
it 's all right , jaune tom .
we 'll get back all right .
oh , it 's such a big ocean , robespierre , bigger than all france .
i have now .
why , look .
there you are , shipmates .
i have good news !
we are headed for alaska and the gold rush .
we will strike it rich , my friends .
then we will return to paris in style .
no time for games , little turtle .
i must swab the deck , yes ?
according to your instructions , i am having mewsette 's portrait painted by the most fmos artists in paris 
you will notice how monsieur monet achieves a shimmering light throughout the picture nd an impressin of air and space .
henri rousseau is an x-soldier with no formal art training .
with his vivid imagination he is creating a charming world of his own where orangs grow on banana trees .
sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pose for him .
to achieve a strong emotionl impact he sometimes applies paint directly frm the tube .
monsieur edgar degas frequently uses ballet dancers as his models .
monsieur paul cézanne is an intellectual artist .
the dynamic paul gauguin has only recently returned from tahiti and his paintings show the influence of the south sea islands .
here .
now , i want no slip-ups .
i want you to see that she is comfortably settled in her ...
no money , no mewsette .
very well , thn .
it will be well worth it , meowrice .
mewsett is my greatest achievement , my crowning glry .
for the sake of your dear neck , i do hope so .
how gallantly you put your case , meowrice .
no girl could resist you .
momentary lpse , my dear .
even cats are sometimes human .
thank yo  monsieur .
you are most kind .
i do thank you for making it all possible .
paris awaits you .
and , dear madame , may i say everything that happens is because of your faith in me ?
it will be later than she thinks .
why , that duble-crosser !
he used disappearing ink .

cheer up 
i have a bird joke for yo .

ha ha ha !
wait a minute !
that is not funny .
that 's insulting to birds .
it 's just a stereotype .
birdo , calm down !
we 've both lost our homes .
do n't be ridiclous .
you wo n't last a week .
what do i look like ?
ooh , millet !
ack -- gravel !
it would take too long for you to learn how to live out here ,

look , birdo  i 'm swimming !

birdo , i 'm slipping !
so ...
lesson number ne -- food .
slugs are extremely juicy and tender ,
and these seeds are a wnderful between-meal snack .
they 're high in fiber , and they wo n't fill you up .
this is n't what wild dogs eat .
this is n't what any dogs eat .
there 's something you might prefer over there .
what 's to eat over thre ?
oh , t 's what you want .
it 's what you 've ben waiting for .
you want me to eat those ?
you want to eat , you got ta learn to kill .

it 's unnatural !
call me rudolph .
awk !
unnatural .
birdo :
lessn number 2 --
you must know how to tell
whether an animal is friendly or dangerous .
that , for example , is dangerous .
a house pet !
oh , yeah , that was dangerous .
i 'm not a house pet .
they still sting .
ow !
ow !
i got bit on my back leg .
you 're lucky yu only got scratched .
you bet !
not really .
birdo :
lesson number 3 -- weather .
if you 're going to live outside ,
anyway , nature can b brutal , puppy .
of course , it 's so cold i ca n't really feel them .
absolutely not !
did you know my grandfather was a siberian husky ?
ha ha ha !
well , i had a friend who was a husky .
that ws just a demonstration .
it 's hard to smell when everything 's covred with snow ,
can we just get back to the weather ?
listen .
and freezing fog .
freezing fog ?
napoleon , run !
awk !
napoleon !
are yo all right ?
blinding snow and freezing fog ?
i told you i smlled something .
i 'm nt perfect .

that 's just fine with me !
what is it ?
i smell candy .
hey , but it 's coming from over there
but how can that be ?

birdo , help !
nt that way 
no one listens to a snake .
uh-oh .
where there 's smoke , there 's ...
i 'm coming !
ooh !
napoleon !
sorry i yelled at you before .
i mean , you really , really scared the feathers off me .

i can handle anything .
i just do n't want to see you get hurt .
awk !
napoleon 
run !
cat !
run !
and little flying muse .
follow me , napoleon .
follow me .
mmm , hey , is that my flock down there ?
birdo !
look , it 's all my brothers !
what 's all that noise ?
sounds like birdo found his flock .
boy , what a noisy bunch of birds .
i should let birdo be with his flck .
i 'v caused him enough trouble .
hey , watch out !
get out of there !
great .
i just saved them from that cat !
napolon , there is n cat around here --
shut up !
this kitten 's really lost her mittens .
birdo !

hey , i 'll gve him a littl push .
away !
aw , come on , now .
do n't be hurt .
do n't listen 
forget them , napoleon !
go back home !
if i turn back , i 'll never know
what it 's really like to be wild ,
oh , you would n't nderstand .
becase you 're a bird , and i 'm a dog .
there is n't a dog thing you do
that this bird did n't teach you .
i ca n't leave you on your own .
of course i will .
napoleon :
all right , now where would there be water ?
maybe that thing knows .
i just wanted to -- ooh !
buzz off .
i 'd share my water with you .
ohh .
hey , i think you look sharp .
no ... i mean you look cool .
i mean it .
wait !
come back !
what you looking for ?
so what ?
it 'll be easier if i help .
oh , thank you .
but now i ca n't drink it !
you 're touching it with your dog lips !
ouch ...
hot sand .
mmm ...
boopbe-deboop .
woof .
that 's what 's been howling ?
were the wild dogs i 've been hearing that ?
ar-ar-aroo !

hey , a dog .

you 've never been in a desert rainstorm .
very dangerous .
stop pushing !
i smell a dog !
i hope your father does n't bring it home .
somewhere there must be a place bg enough
cold , drafty , and damp .
uhoh , my jungle instincts tell me
that there 's dangerous animals in here .

and no one will get hurt .
ok , buster , on 3 i pounce !

war of the gargantuas ( furankenshutin no kaijû :
captain !
captain !
oh , nurse ...
i 'm from the maritime bureau 
he 's not well enough to speak with anyone !
i only need two or three minutes .
he has n't regained consciosness yet .
is he in danger ?
the others must have drowned when th boat sank .
how is it ?
the only thing we found was this .
the ship 's too big for everyone to have been washed off ...
the water srge could n't wash away that many people s thoroughly .
it 's notjst a coincidence ?
it s amazing that you wre the only one to survive .
how many times are you going to say that ?
enough to hear your response !
i want you to tell us what really happned !
the four other men ...
i called out to them ... before the ship was jostled , and i saw the frankenstein monstr ... .
that monster has n't been found !
do n't you have another story ?
i know what attacked our ship !
i know in my heart that it happened !
after that , the fur men ... !
i am not lying .
believe me , i am telling the truth ...
captain , we 've discovered what happened to the four men .
you did ?
we 're sure this is all from the ship 
what culd have done ths to them ?
tokyo telephone ?
i need the kyoto shinagat institute , frankenstein research unit .
hell ?
yes ths is it .
yokoska ?
hello , this is dr. stewart .
we have n't had a frankenstein here since the one tht vanished at mount fuji .
yes ...
what did he say ?
he said that a frankenstein monstr may have eaten some humans .
oh , my ... !
they want to ask you questins bout the gargantuan  frankenstein .
have a seat .
-it is ?
he would n't be doing things like tipping over boats , or eating humans .
yes , that 's my opinion .
let 's leave that closed , okay ?
now , this is what we hve next .
not yet .
now , go ahead .
jst before he escaped , he found his way into my apartment .
what 's wrong ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
heave !
they re chasng any stry that relates to frankenstein !
i have ...
we just do n't know how much of this is false .
perhaps they just do n't know where he s currently lving .
look at this ...
it is ...
doctor , i would like to check it out , if you do n't mind .
what did you find ?
do you know what it is ?
is n't it from the frankenstein ?
no , i ca n't say what it is yet .
hey , wait a minute ...
up , over there .
it looks like we 've got a bit of work cut out for us back at the lab .
thnk you .
i 'm afraid that those are from frankenstein ...
i do n't believe those cells could have come from any other lif form .
but ... why is it living beneath the sea ?
flight 17 , proceed 180° at 10 knots .
a monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
no !
emergency , emergency !
your back !
what was the thing that attacked haneda airport ?
i do n't know ...
we have n't yet heard ny details of what had happened .
did n't you say that the frankenstein you had in custody posed no threat to mankind ?
everyone , please !
please !
we leave for tokyo immediately .
what could make frankenstein live in th sea ?
nothing ...
doctor , cn you answer some questions ?
-doctor !
what is the defense plan ?
we plan on sending a powerful electrical current through tokyo bay .
he ca n't withstand the light on a clear day .
dr. stewart , what do you say ?
i think yu 're right ...
does that mean that you 'd continue yur studies of frankenstein  regardless of what happened ?
yes ... yes , i would .
that is the point of our problem ...
do you know what wold happen if frankenstein appeared in a peaceful city like this ?
the lights !
is there a doctor here 
is there a doctor ?
the monster is going away !
go get a stretcher !
-right .
the monster seems to be harned by bright lights .
the monster seems to be harned by bright lights .
please turn on every light in the city area .
please open all of your windows and shutters 
give me the book ...
thanks ..
let 's go find out ...
hurry !
grandmother !
-kei !
kyo !
come with me !
hurry !
let 's go , let 's go !
we 've done all that we can 
halt !
move !
ready th searchlights !
we 're all set !
lights !
here is the latest report from headquarters .
the creature has prceeded from tokyo to the mountains along the river .
take positions !
command , we re at position 1095° .
the creture is approximately 300 meters ..
fall back !
-fire !
look out !
cease fire !
order all units to stand down for now .
wherever he emerges , we will be able to engage him with siz units .
alright , let 's go !
-yes , sir !
right !
we 're ready in this sector !
commander , helicopter unit one ...
you are ordered to lure th monstr into the established attack zone .
roger , roger !
the monster has slowed its pac .
w 'll attack soon .
calling base !
roger .
i think we should let him go a little further .
first unit is ready !
-right !
third unit is ready !
-switch the units on !
it 's time !
-alrght !
converter one is redy !
-generator two is ready !
go !
bring the helicopters into position !
hurry !
-hurry !
fall back !
fll back !
fall back !
-right !
we 're all set !
-fire !
calling base !
switch on the electricity !
-switching on !
alright !
commander !
calling the commander !
doctor !
that one has to be th frankenstein we know !
then it seems your hunch was correct .
well , it proves that there are two of thm .
now , i have to convince them that one is innocent .
that is all ...
it 's incredible ..
what 's sanda got to do with this ?
maybe , if we do n't ask so many qustions and try to find some clus  we 'll know that answer .
mr. yokosuka !
god find , akemi .
h , thank you !
thnk you for comng .
have you found the monsters ?
you may want to check the lakes and streams around here .
i see ...
notify headquarters .
shall we continue on our way nd see what we can dig up on gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like his hair and tissue ...
the cells are identcal .
this means that the frankenstein 's are brothers .
mybe not ...
he could have torn off some flesh on a rock that made its way to the ocean .
once there , on prtein-rich plankton , another frankenstein could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the other .
doctor , if that is the case , would n't an explosion create even more frankenstein 's ?
we 'll do what we can to avoid using them .
we can use napalm !
t 's strange ...
whenever there is a strong evil force around , youth seems to blossom .
are n't we gilty of doing the same thing ?
i do n't feel any guilt .
let 's go for a walk .
before this mist gets any thcker ...
run away !
help me !
akemi !
listen to me and do n't panic !
doctor !
akemi !
hold on !
are you okay ?
you remember who we are !
wait !
gaira is the one that 's dangerous !
they are north at 135.10° and appear to be running away !
orders !
we will attack with every available weapon at our disposal until they are finished .
we will deal with that after we have completed the task at hand !
all units , retreat !
retreat !
at the moment , he 's still moving .
sanda is innocent , general ...
t save , not dstroy ...
i agree with him .
a plan and simple fact that has already been proven .
if you hit them wth your heavy artillery , you will scatter their cells halfway to china .
then yo will be faced with  thousand frankenstein 's .
how can you be sure of your theory when it is n't proven ?
doctor , could you do that ?
they have the same cells , the same genetic structure and the same blood .
what could that mean , doctor 
gaira !
that 's just what we needed 
doctor , you 're turning off the lights ?
get me the dfnse agency .
ys , and hurry !
yes .
he now knows that where there 's light , he 'll find food .
turn off your lights !
-please !
hurry !
hurry !
hurry !
what 's going on here ?
hurry !
hurry !
turn off your headlights !
you 'll have to leave your car here !
-damn !
help me out !
where is he now ?
-where is he now ?
hello ?
sanda 's in tkyo ?
i 'm positive he has n't come to help gaira !
doctor .
this is dr. stewart .
there 's nothing we can do .
sanda is entering tokyo .
i 'll be down there right away .
akemi .
where are you going ?
we have to convince him to turn back .
you ca n't .
it 's too lat now .
this time i 'm going to save his life .
halt !
go on !
you silly nut !
come on now ...
for your wn safety , plase evacuate at once !
we 'r all set to open fire !
for your own sfety , pleas vacuate at once !
you 're ordred to clear the streets immeditely !
this way .
akemi !
akmi !
-what happened ?
head for the secondary command !
akmi ...
are you alright ?
-yes .
by the way , sanda came to your rescue again .
i think he has a crush on you .
thirty minutes , then ...
but how do you know he will destroy gaira ?
two minuts to attack 
hello !
i 'm sorry , akemi .
i did everything i could 
the only thing we can do now is hope their cells do n't multiply .
they 've made thir way to the docks .
more , more , mre , more , more ...
are you alright ?
are you excited by electric trains ?
nnabel :
really , it is .
my name is annabel andrews .
this is my room .
i like it this way .

i do n't remember what i weigh , but i 'm watching it .

i have one little brother .
a perfect person and a creep .
his name is ben , but i call him ...
it 's time for breakfast .

i mean , school is okay .
ysterday i ws made captain for today 's playoff game .
i 'm also pretty good on water .

annabel !

it 's not that  do n't love her .
i do .
why should n't i ?
annabel , where are y going ?
i do n't go for that eggs and bacon stuff .
i want you to be healthy .
what about your rom ?
it just slippd thrugh my mind .
nnbel , i do n't want to be preachy .
but childhood is the best time in a person 's life .
but i got a lot of worries .

wish me luck .
good luck .
good luck to me , too .
annabel .

about the aquacade ?
oh , bill , honestly .
it 's good .
i 'll take care of the rest .
where have i been ?
i 've been waiting for hours .
it 's my room .
all due to the extraordinary effrts of this brilliant ...
revolting .
i 'm afraid that 's not complimentary enough to the developer , my dear .
nothing very complimentary could be said about annabl .
no wonder they call it the terrible teens .
have you seen how she dresses lately ?
to see mr. dilk , the principal at school .
he 's asked for a conference to discuss annabel 's lack of academic progress .
what do yo think of that ?
i 'm sure yo can handle it , der .
i 'm up to my neck in this .
thank you .
she says she knows all we do there is kissing games .
she 's also on my back to get my hair trimmed .
last time it was trimmed , they hackd 6 inches off .
parents seem to be immune to it .
sometimes i blow my top .
yesterday  said to her ,
change my image ?
that s funny .
virginia :
last night we had it out .
lsten !
how come nobdy evr gets to tell yu what to do ?
annabel , i said .
when you 're grown-up , people do n't tell you what to do .
which is sometimes more difficult .
and do the laundry , i reminded her .
and the shopping and the cooking .
make things nice for everybody .
together 
something really freaky 
that 's not my voice .
what am i doing here ?
that 's not my voice .
that 's annabel 's voice .
you all right , ellen ?
llen ?
that 's not my foot .
good grief .
that 's annabel 's .
annabel :
and her stomach .
and her , uh ... uh ..
ellen :

no , it 's very mportant .
ellen :

she wants to know if you 're feling all right .
oh , i feel terrific .
she 's worried about you .
no , tell hr absolutely not .
today i want her to enjoy every minute .
oh , yeah .
tell her i hope she does well in the hockey game .
that is an important playoff .
dear , your mother says ...
hi , virginia .
you guys are my frinds , right ?
now , girls , you 're not children any longer .
what is this ?
it 's your usual rum raisin banana split breakfast .
what else would the junk-food junkie eat for breakfast ?
that is about the most revolting concoction
you see i am diamtrically different from the annabel you know .
all right .
listen very carefully 
i 'm not annabel .
i 'm her mother .
oh , that 's sensational !
tday we 'll be our mothers .
i 'm not jo-jo .
i love it .
are you kidding ?
do n't be fresh with me , young man .
jo-jo :
you 're terrific , annabel 
yu ought to be in drama class .
hurry along , children .
you 'll miss the bus .
our mothers could n't hack it .
your mother would n't make it through first period , bambi .
for sure .
or ms. murphy in typing .
young lady , a great deal has transpired in the last few minutes .
bambi :
you really have that down .
i like this game .
children , do n't tarry .
ellen :
what s so tough about a simple school day ?
you said scrambled eggs .
sorry .
yu can eat this .
oh  i ca n't .

annabel :
nnabel wants you to eat her sugar-coated snappy krackles .

you re right about your hair .
my mom had mine all hacked off .
and now look at me .
to tell you the truth , it 's much more becoming to you short .
whose side are you on 
that 's uncalled for .
ellen :

pay now , talk later .
i do n't have one of those cards .
virginia , could you possibly ?
no , i could n't possibly .
i know you have more change on you .
i could tell by your walk .
ellen :

ellen :

annabel :

i do n't really have a cold .
or an allergy to my mother .

boris !
you want to hang around outside for a while ?
being cooped up in here just gets me crazy .

mm-hmm .
okay .
excuse me .

then you bring it forward .
then you swing it back .
i 'd rather show you .

she 's no longer the same person who cut your head open with a tin shovel in the playgrund five years ago .
four .
anyway , if you 'd seen her lately , you would n't recognize her .
she 's nice-nice nice .
but , miss andrews , to be perfectly frank , that 's not saying much .
did it ever do that with you ?
you 're doing just fine .
what 's going on back there ?
i 'm sorry , miss benson .
i have an even better idea .
you 're too much !
i just ca n't believe it .
today you made us all look like dummies .
what do you want me to do ?
let 's get out of her .
bye-bye , brains .
what a zoo !
maybe we should do it again .
i mean , we could play monopoly , something .
well , i 'd lik that .
but , then , you 're not the same as most grown-ups .
annabel :
i love it .
you 're ...
did you notice my llergy is completely gone ?
but i 'm certainly not allergic to you .
hmm ?
i mean , she 's probably what they call a bad seed .
team , listen up !
i do n't have to tell you what this game means .
i want you guys to get out there and hit 'em high !
ellen :
i do n't believe this .

as long as we 're comparing , i 'd like to be in your shoes .
bill , i would n't pursue this any further if i were you .
science has sent orbiters to neptun , eradicated smllpox and created a supercomputer that can do 60 trillion calculations per second
science frees us from superstition and dogma and enables us to base our knowledge on evidence
previously , i 've explored how organized faith and primitive religious values blight our lives
they do now , but you were aware t as a norm
through faith and supersttion or through the rigours of logic , observation and evidence , through reason
i want to confront the epidemic of irrational superstitious thinking
you really blieve it ?
and throws up new age gurus who exhrt us to run away from reality
reason and respect for evidence are the source f our progress our safeguard against fundamentalists and those who profit from obscuring the truth
300 years ag , in the age of enlightenment scientists and philosphrs from galileo to david hume had the courage to stand up for intellectal principles and reason
all kinds .
this is george .
hello , what can you do for me ?
yes .
what do i do ?
take a seat , please .
should i take my glasses off ?
what we got here ?
would yo have somebody in spirits really , really close to you and he 's got the arms around your neck
well , that 's very nice to know
all these people reap the rewards of science and reason but many here revel in a foggy suspicion of scientific thnking
irrationality is woven nt the fabric of modern life , we unthinkingly indulge unscientific delusion

loyal , spend too much money a good leader
a full quarter of the british population claim to believe in astrology
day in , day out , astrological horoscopes get far more newspaper column inches than science
it is in your nature to be hard-working and methodical which should serve you well at work today
in yor personal relatinships , especially this evening yu 'll need to curb your natural tendency t obey orders
british :
your stiff upper lip may serve yu well in businss dealings but try to relax and let yourself go in your social life
and so on , through 12 national stereotypes
of course , the astrology columns are not as offensive as tht but we should ask ourselves exactly where the difference lies
both are guilty of facade discrmination dividing hmanity up into exclusive groups based on no evidence
this is a map of the cosmos with london in the very center
i always thought that by the 21st century science and reason would have long since cleaned up and yet every day of the week we 're encouraged to retreat into the fog the superstitious past
astrology is a primitive belief system made into elaborate pseudo-science
it was developed in the 2nd centry ad by the philosopher claudius ptolemy and has not moved on since
you could ask a question you can say , 'who has stolen my money ?
did n't an actual physicl influence for planets that somehow beams down and influences us , peopl ?
i think it 's very hard to see tht .
the position of planets in ...
and i told you i do n't know .
what is n't a deep dark mystery is why the trite vagaries of newspaper horoscopes seem to chime with readers
psychologists hav identifid what 's knwn as the barnum effect where by people tend to believe statements are accurate for them personally while in fact they 're general enough to apply to anyone
and then ask people how accurate they were ?
yes , that would be a perverse thing to do , is t ?
a test of what ?
well , how accurte you are ?
scientific test well , even if it was mischef , how could that possibly influence it
you see , well , the fact that you 're not maks me think you do n't really in your heart of hearts believe it
 do n't think you really re prepared to put your reputation on the line
well , you 're in a kind of no-lose situation , do n't you believe it ?
but as a test , we said it apply to their own star sign
not only do you have clever mercury and ambitious mars , fortunes and success
remember however that there will be others who want what you have and will stop at nothing to get it
astrologers say this should fit just capricorn and not th rest but what actually happened ?
what a lame junk !
that is n't necessarily pertain to me this week it pertains to me generally
a pile of rubbish !
the same number of people agreed that the horoscope was accurate for them as disagreed and similar results are found with proper large state experiments
technically all but one of our group should have disagreed namely our only capricorn
there 's a far richer way of looking at the cosmos
astronomy is a triumph of th human intellect a real science constantly enriched by new evidence
just lie in yor back and gaze up at the stars
th heart-stopping sight you 'd see is 100 billion stars spinning through an expanding universe at a speed of a million miles per day
you 're staring into a deep time machine
and yet even as science unravels these natural wonders or society is drawn to the slim pickings of supernatural belif

now , i think it 's false so shall we see how well you have done ?
i want to show how scientific reason is always the best way to look at the world and explin the dngers of superstition
i 'm often asked how i know that there is n't a spirit world or psychic clairvoyance
it seems improbable but unlike the fixed world views of mystical faith science is always open to new possibilities
until quite recntly scientists did n't know how bats fly around in total darkness
could they have paranormal extra-sensory perception ?
but the more scientists tested the evidence , the more robust the theory became
everything about it added up to a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence that this really was a fact
the more we look at it , the weaker it becomes
the alleged detection of water through dowsing is not obviously ridiculous it mght work but does it ?
the only way to tell is through a rigorous experiment
how does dowsing wrk ?
1 question and nobody can answer you
 think of the question and  expect god rspond in a way that  understand
i expect the right hand one pont to the camera and the lft hand one straight forward , i wan na ...
have you done the test yet in the tent ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 right , 100 %
so what do you mak that then ?
the psychologist chris french thinks there may be a simpler explanaton
he has devoted his career to invstigating claims of the paranormal
but there 're always the possible explanations there , what we 're trying to do it a set of conditions which rule out any of those explnations then we get down to the very fundamentl basic issue ca n't the dowsers actually d what they think they can do .
i think it 's false
so shall w see how are you done ?
this is sand .
in that case i ca n't do this
this is the water in no .
3
well , yu got one right nd , that was 6 which is what we expect by chance
three .
what 's nteresting is it does n't actually tend to dent their confidence at all
i thnk they are completely sincere and they are typically very , very surprised when we run them through series of trials and actually say at the end of the day where your performance is no better thn what we would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has happened but i did say from the outst could n't we jst sort out some grey blocks and some scaffold boards , so then i can work about it which is what i would routinely do and i 've done for 40 years
who knows where or what bottles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole point
this state f denal is extraordinary .
even when confronted with hard fact these dowsers prefer nt to face p to truth but retain their delusion
irrational belief from dowsing to psychic clairvoyance has roots in early mankind 's habit of attributing spirit and ntentin to natral phenomena such as water , the sun ,  rock or the sea
in 480 bc , king xerxes of the persians built a pontoon bridge across the hllespont and th rough sea came and wrecked it
i wonder whether there 's something of king xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't want to believe that things just happen we want to believe that ther 're some kind of deliberate intention behind everything even when inanimate objects are concerned
and perhaps that is the key to humanity 's belief in the supernatural
even in the 21st century , despite all that science has revaled about the indifferent vastness of the universe the human mind remins a wanton storyteller creating intention in the randomnss of reality
the delivery of rewards by a one-armed bandit is determined at random but many gamblers want to think that what they do can increase their chances of winning the jackpt
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
there 're two kinds of mistaks they can make they can either fail to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detect pattern when there is n't any and that 's superstition
60 years ago , the american psychologist b.f. skinner investigated the behavior of pigeons rewarding them with food when they learned to peck a ky in the feeding apparatus
but then skinner set the apparatus to reward the birds at random now the pigeons just have to st back and wait , but that is n't what they did
when an indivdal pigeon , for example , happened to look over its left shoulder and the reward mechanism just happened to click in at that point
by sheer luck as it happened the reward mechanism delivered food at the same time again and so the pigeon was reinforced in its idea that looking over the left shoulder was what got it the reward
and it went on and on and turned into a maniac for looking over the left shoulder
humans can be no better than pigeons
spiritual self help guides do a roaring trade in the matrial world outnumbering scince books by 3-1
but what does spirituality actually mean ?
so please take your seat and please come slowly and gently nd so that we can start the proceeeding without losing time
so could you please ...
and h counts amongst his many fans price charles and dalai lama
i was present in the beginning , in the frst big bang and i 'll be here for billions of years to come
but is n't satish 's spirituality just about imposing yet another superstitious force positive ?
world is made of two elements .
there the spirit is very big , and very holistic , and very inclusive world
it is not dfned in a one particular way so when you go in a room you can say the tree has a spirit
nature without spirit can not exist like tree can not exist without the sun .
lght  it can not exist withut rain , ... can not exist without soil also it can not exist without a treeness .
the treeness is the spiritual quality
or the rockness
when you talk about the rockness or the quality f a rock
it all sounds very poetic , but it 's not rality like priests , mllahs , and rabbis , new-age mystics ceaselessly attempt to fill gaps in human understanding with fabricated meaning
science and rationality are often accused to having a cold bleak outlook but why is it bleak to face up to the evidence of what we know
the word mundane has cme to mean boring and dull , it really should n't , it should mean the opposite because it comes from the latin mundus , meaning the world , and the world is anything but dll
there 's real poetry in the real world .
science is the poetry of reality
next i want to look at the dangers that poses
why do i have to trust , you know , the gp , why do i have to trust the ryal socity
i think you 're so close to bing right , but yt you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 years , science has put a man on the moon , cloned a sheep , decoded the human genome
and yet , sadly , the white heat of the 1970s seems to be treatd as white elephant today
anything yellow close is okay..
the fundamental problem i think lies with the fashion throughout our educational system to teach students to value private feeling more highly than evidence based reason
for relativists , scientific truth is just a patriarchal western orthodoxy that like the old roman catholic church stands in the way of other equally valid outlooks on the world
with things like paranormal , the drive for alternative medicine , all these kinds of movements away from the orthodox in science
in terms of different kinds of treatments and things like that and in a way , not trusting the experts any more
i think you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're drn wrong , you 're absolutely wrong
we want to question uthority .
we do n't want to say because this person is the presidnt of royal society therefore what he says is right
we 've got to go back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but the impersonal algorithms of internet search engines do not weed out robust evidence from unsourced , uncorroborated assertin
paranoia conspiracy theories circulat unchallenged
sometimes they 're relatively harmless like the rumor that nasa faked the moon landings which is a bit of a joke because the evidence for going to the moon is so strong
but how about the malicious and utterly unfounded rumor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agents not to go to work in the world trade center on 9/11
as evidence is devalued even medical progress has become a target ... through vomiting .
hndreds of families blame me .
an innuendo circulated that the establishment was conspiring to risk our children 's halth
it ld to hundreds of thousands of parents failing to protect their offspring from the threat of measles a serous disease that in afghanistan kills 35,000 people a year
reason has built the modern world , it is a precious but also a fragile thing which can be corroded by apparently harmless irrationality
next week , i look at how health has bcome one of the fiercest battlegrounds betwen reason and superstition

it appears your son sat on the forbidden throne , destroyed the scred royal residence nd put a curse on the entire village .
you do n't really believe in all that , do you ?
good people of mandelin .
very good people ...
this was just an accident .
maybe there 's some insurance policy for sacred dwellings or something 
listen , i think the less you say now , the better .
right .
it totaled itself .
everything that 's nice and decent , you just end up rining .
well , at least now everyone hs an ocean view , huh ?
listen , listen !
what about our luggage 
lean-to ?
we 're supposed t be living in a palace .
well , obviously that 's not an option .
wait a minute .
where are you sleeping ?
only sleeps one .. comfortably .
do n't worry , i 'll check in n you later to see if you survive .
all right .
come on .
let 's pitch in .
gt this thing up .

ren , can we not talk about this ?
it was an accident , i 'm sorry .
yo know , you should n't have even been in there , louis .
well , ren , i 'm sorry i 'm not perfect like you .
i am not perfect .

you have perfect behavior .
you have a perfect life .
boohoo , ren .
i do not want to talk about gil .
hey .

louis , you and donnie and i will go find some firewood , and ren , you nd beans will stay with dad and help start the shelter 
hey , beans , we 're all hungry .
if we find som food , we 'll pick it up and bring it back .
donnie .

mandelino tradition states that all apologies must be made in groups of three .
groups of three .
groups of three .
let the boy speak .
k .

hold on , hold on .
get up there .
oh , the big head ?
the big sacred head .

feasting ?
it is like eating , but with bigger plates .

they have feasted with us .
re they now worthy of forgiveness ?
hm ?
oh .

you 're going to be shunned .
yes !
no , son .
no one on the island can have anything to do with you .
why do n't they just tell us to our faces ?
yeah , it 's good .
seven days from now , you 'll all be heading home .
seven days ?
what feast ?

you 've got a little something on yor cheek

there 's a little thing abut being shunned .
that seems fair .

i find this completely insulting .
you were n't even gon na tell us about it .
you know , my group ate , yours did n't .
just what we need .
it 's raining .
well , t last i was able t put a roof over our heads .
ok .
miles , on-air commentary in five , four , three , two ...
that all of the natives ar actors .
and that everything that is happening to them is completely controlled by our crew .
i think i mad a terrible mistake .
could never pass up a keep out sign .
you told them that ?
oh , nice work .

oh !
thanks , miles .
there it is now .
we 're over here .
we re over here !
miles , this is n't exactly familiar territry 
well , i would ask the islanders to help you guys , but whenever i mention your names they shake with anger .

bacon ?

twitty , you look like you 're full .
just ...
and the best part is , those lunkheads think they 're halfway around the world .
i sad they think they 're halfway around the world .
where are they ?
just a coupl of miles off the coast .
i went on one of these things called a website .
we 're so close ?
all we really need is a boat , right ?
tom ?
ahoy , mateys .
what brings you lndlubbers down to the salty brine ?
whassup ?
i have , and i must say that  'm appalled as a sailor and a human being to see a family that we know and love being tortured like that .
oh , yeah ?
i set them up .
well , louis is my friend .
this afternon we wanted to se how far we could push our family until they finally cracked .
are you calling me stupd ?
i am calling you a liar .
you guys had to get back t us , huh ?
but we got the evidence .
how do you explin this , louis ?
do n't you talk to him like that .
you do not have a right to talk .
you cause all the trouble and you eat all the food .
you kids should n't fight just because your father 's trying to teach me a lesson .
and what would that be ?
but could n't you leave a little somthing for us ?
it 's my family too !
hold on , hold on .
we 'll be fine on our own , thank you .
well you cn sleep out in the rain tonight .
ha .
fine .
ha !
looks like things are getting personal and interesting .
ren , known back home for her boyfriend troubles , is having a little better luck here on the island .
mootai .
why not ?
because no mater what they will do to me , to be away from you wuld be worse .
what do you think ?
will ren let mootai kiss hr ?
do n't do it , ren .
oh , but he 's so cute !
i would very much like to kiss you too .
there 's a surprise .
# hey , ho , we ll blow the man down

good job , man .
nice scene today , kid .

i did n't have any sound anywhere .
i 'll get it back !
get sombody on tht satellite now , i tell you , now .
hey !
donnie ?
what are you doing here ?
you 're not cutting class , right ?
i do n't know .
i guess i 'm just overly sensitive about this whole job .
well , the fact that we 're starving on an island in the middle of nowhere  that could have something to do with it .
yes , and when we got there everything was empty .
sam with us .
so what happened to it ?
there was never any food .
you know what ?
i think he would 've 
it seemed like he was always trying t help us .
what are you doing here ?
i do n't know .
and ren ?
hey , guys .
look wht i found .
i thought this island did n't get cable .
that 's what miles said .
never heard of it .
you have n't ?
it 's the hottest new shw .
everybody watches it .
we do n't .
yo do n't ?
of course not .

i 'm really sorry .
do you guys hate me ?
what did you do ?
nothing .
just came by to help .
after  sld you guys out .
well , that 's good , because as embarrassing as this was for us , w still have a chance to show them that they did n't win .
that this is a family that sticks together .
that 's right .
bens was smellng a beetle .
and ren was trying to kill louis .
let 's go  let s go .
you fired everyone .
let 's go , people .
frankly .
i prefer wonderful dual tones .
now .
your egg will want to have a pair of littl bunny ears .
but that 's what makes a live show so exciting .
before our break , louis was hunting a squirrel and ren was hunting louis .
keith , where are those kds ?
i do n't know .
we found them .
oh , luis , i know you 're out there .
loks like ren is ticked off .
i would n't want to be lois right now .
ren has totally lost it .

she 's always in control .
just a leg or thigh .
i really liked mootai .
you ruined my life .
ren .
huh ?

that 's right .
squealing )
we 're responsible for these people .

wait a little bit longer , pleas .
hey !
great news !
you hear that , ren ?

ren 's a little upset .
this is the perfect time to tell you that you 're on the new reality show called famly fakeout .
yeah , that 's a nice try , miles , but it 's too late .
i 'd know .
ren !
mils is telling the truth , it 's just a silly tv show .
you know what , i know what you 're doing .
you 're trying to protect louis .
you 're alwys trying to protect louis .
well , yo know what ?
i ca n't take it nymore !
no , ren 
it was n't supposed to end this way .
nobody was supposed to get hurt .
miles mcdermott , this is lance lebow and i just dropped in to say :
gotcha , on yur own show !
yeah !
but ...
hey , miles !
yeah !
well , i jumped into a big old net , just like we planned it .
good catch , guys .
gotcha .
aw , they did n't fool me for one second .
why do n't we get back to that easter thing that we were having s much fun with ?
or yu can flp the channel and watch us live on gotcha.
a little bunny tail for its little bunny bun .
and it can also be used as a powder puff .
for those of you who are just tuning in .
let 's hear about how we made a total fool of my old friend miles on his own show .
yeah !
miles .
how 'd you get oprah to turn against us ?
you know , we put this prank together in a mater of just a couple of hours , thanks to family friends alan twitty and tawny dean .
thank you .
 bet you 're wondering , how did the stevens family turn the tables on you ?
no .
nt really .
i 've got to get back to the studio .
your career 's over .
that 's true .
yo see .
she had louis trapped in a tree .
they put aside their differences and we all came up with ths little charade .
hey .
lance .

they 're adrable .
look .

i 'll give you a three-second head start .
hey , ren .

donnie went off to college .
where he excelled in football .
just kidding about the philsophy .
he was bringing home the bacon again .
that 's just an expression .
louis got back to his ultra-longematic superchair .
became inseparable .
what 's for dinner ?
who invited him ?
lous .
hold on , why is everything my fault ?
you ca n't blame everything on me .
# do n't that sound nice ?

would you like to step out and have a cigarette , mr graham ?
i understand .
she 'll be alright now  mr graham .
well , i have to take it in 2 or 3 tmes a week .
which is somewhat inconvenient , but the car is well worth it .
how often do yo drive it ?
2 or 3 times a week .
i have to take it in very time i drive it .
yes .
my own mechanic has not been very helpful .
ever .
and there 's a lot f carbon on the valves .
yes , there always is .
usually needs a tune-up every few weeks .
your attorney , mr beckett , has been trying to rech you .
he 's been calling the superintendent 's office all week .
i do n't care to discuss it .
... and he told me there was carbon on the valves ... which was no news to me 'cause thre 's always carbon on the valves .
ha ha  i told you a ferrari was useless in the city .
what a day .
that 's a perfectly insan ...
what is it ?
a mr bckett on the phne !
beckett ?
has an urgent message .
half the time is spent taking off and the other half is spent on landing .
every time i bring her out she has to have repairs .
my mechanic says it 's carbon on the valves .
this is long island tower .
roger .
i 'll just get out here , thank you .
oh , jerry !
mr von rensaeller ?
he 's in the lounge with mr beaumont .
but i sprayed and the crown gall is gone .
really ?
ah , those idiots .
i was prevailed upon as honrary secretary t bring it to your attention ... so you can stir it up at the bank .
now , listen to me very carfully , please .
you see , when you have capital ... you are able to derive ...
i will attend to the chck in a mment , mr graham .
i understand abut the check 
i 'm trying to explain something to you ... that is terribly important .
when we spend more , per month or per year ... than we have in income , you must then dip into the capital ... eventually exhausting the capital and f course , threfore , the income .
do you see what i mean ?
mr beckett .
i 'm trying t explain to you that it is impossible to pay the check .. because your expenses have exceeded your income ... to such a point that you have exhausted your capital .
do n't treat me as though  were a chld , mr beckett .
now , what about this check ?
in other words , you do n't have $ 60 .
come to the pint , beckett .
the point , mr graham , is that you do n't have any money .
what could i ... 
how could i put it ?
that money ...
you have no money .
there 's no other way to put it .
you have no money .
and what of my stocks , my att , my general motors ?
y-ys , i know ...
my emeralda peat ?
yes , yes , i know about emeralda peat .
let me show you somthing .
i did not !
that is beside the point .
do you realize that this check has bounced , mr beckett ?
i mean , bounced !
it is not the first check that yo 've had bounced  mr graham .
i 'd like to show you this check of $ 550 .
you mean to say that i 'm now in the position of owing you $ 550 ?
no , no , no , do n't , do n't , please , do n't think of t as a loan , mr graham .
dsliking yu as intensely as i do , i wanted to be absolutely certain ... that when i looked back upon your finncial downfll ...
i could absolve myself completely of any responsibility for it .
i do n't think he 'll give you a nickel , mr graham .
and considering your gift for close personal relationships ...
thank you very much , mr beckett .
this will cover the overdraft of $ 550 that i owe you .
smoke them in good health .
goodbye .
goodbye .
goodbye .
nice to see you .
thank you .
i was looking ... for someone .
god afternoon , mr graham .
i 'm kind of surprised .
would yu like to have a table for ne ?
no , no , thank you .
i just wnted to ...
but it 's lways gret t see yu .
you 're always welcome here .
you know that .
i 'm sorry , mr sullivan .
i know nothing more about your application .
i 'll come back tomorrow and check .
good afternoon , mr graham .
were you expecting some mail ?
certainly , sir .
i knew i could count on a straight answer from you .
thank you , sr .
it 's the best suit you can find in ready-to-wear .
the racket club does not keep those members on a trust that worry missng their dues .
oh , no !
i was just about to ring for it .
harold , i have something to tll you .
is it about your money , sir ?
in any case , it 's gone .
yes , t ws my first thought .
my attorney advised me against it on the grounds that it would be useless .
see , the thing of it is , harold ... that i hav no hope of ever repaying him , or anyone .
all i am , or was , is rich .
i was so happy 
what will i do ?
what any gentleman of similar breeding ... and temperament would do in your position , sir .
no , sir .
i was n't going to suggest suicide .
you mean to a woman ?
that is what i had in mind .
it 's the only way to acquir property without labor .
i could n't ...
i mean , she 'd be there .. asking me where i 'v been ... talking to me ... talking .
well , it was only a suggestion , sir .
but the alternatives ... are very limited and unspeakably depressing , sir .
if you do not commit suicide , sir , you will be poor .
poor ?
hardly any , sr .
you 've already received your third notice ... from both con edison and the bell telephone company , sir .
thank you .
do it , get married , sir .
borrow enough money from your uncle to keep up appearances .
you have managed in your own lifetime , mr graham ... to keep alive traditions that were dead before you were born .
yes .
thank you , sir .
no , no .
that 's a good idea 
i 'm going to do it  harold .
oh , i 'm so glad , sir .
yes , please , harold .
i hope i do n't have to grovl to much .
can  take it your answer is no ?
you 've ben an ass , henry .
oh god , what a witty thing to say !
no .
what culd you possibly do in six weeks ... that would enable you to repay me ?
get what ?
yes .
get married .
t whom ?
by suitable you mean rich ?
yes , as far s marriage is concerned ...
you see , as far as marriage is ...
no .
and i can engage in any romantic activity ... with an urbanity born of disinterest .
we are talking abut character .
that is something i usally require of servants ... in the form of a brief letter written by someone like myself ... to the effect that the servant in qustion ... does not have the ingenuity to steal .
what is my collateral in the event that you fail ?
my paintings and sculptures .
oh , well .
and my ...
what ?
no , what ?
you sid no .
i 'm asking for a $ 50,000 loan .
six weeks .
i 'll do it .
on one condition .
i am entitled to ten times the amount i ll lend you .
those are my terms .
take them or leave them as you choose .
mh-hm .
good .
i 'll have my attorney draw up the documents tonight .
yes .
thnk you , uncle .
it comes as rather a shock to me , too .
are there any here ?
i mean ... unattached ones ?
no , no , as far as i know , shron has no close family .
hr husband , robert hart , was a cattle baron , i think .
and t satisfies me .
i have fund peace in connecticut 
i mean , after all , what else is there ?
i love , i wish lve , i am human , i am a woman , henry !
damn mosquitoes !
no mother ?
you have no mother ?
no one at all ?
oh  henry ...
how i long to hear another voice .
your aunt ...
yes , as a matter of fact she does .
no mother ?
no , thank you .
oh .
well , would you ... 
henry 
what the hell are you doing here ?
i 'll never do it , harold .
not only do i still have to met her , but i have to court her ... mrry her and get $ 50.000 from her ... before the honeymoon .
i 'll never do it ... unless i elope tomorrow .
you will d it , sir .
when we are working for something we really love , as you are , sir ... we can always find a way .
do you really understand what you 're doing ?
oh , my dear .
ys , because ...
henry !
everybdy !
this is henry graham .
this is harriet storch .
bo , of course , you know .
hi , henry .
mr and mrs sims , toot and rggie .

now come with me and have a nice chat with bo while i get you some ...
come sit with bo and i 'll get you some nice te .
henry , st down .

soty blotch !
i think it 's sooty blotch , i 'm nt sure .
that 's becoming mad , bo .
she 's old guy lowell 's daghter .
was .
and who was he when he was alive ?
well , he was an industrialist or cmposer  something like that .
well , did he die with his welth intact or ...
i heard he was enormously walthy when he died .
is that right ?
i thought you did n't know who he was .
well , i did n't at first ... but the vividness of your description has restored him to my memory .
he was enormously wealthy when he ded .
and the girl ?
she 's enormously wealthy , to .
no close relatves ?
no .
no 
she 's a botanist !
does n't ride , either .
does nt entertain .
i think she 's about the most isolated woman i 've ever met .
madeleine , would you get ms lowell another cup of tea , please ?
i 'm terribly sorry .
that 's alright , dear , really .
could n't care less .
t 's nothing .
it 's just an old rug .
i 'll take this .
forgive me a moment , will you , bo ?
excuse me .
henrietta , is this some kind of joke ?
once yes , but twice in a row ...
madam .
there you are , madam .
take your damn carpet to the cleaners and send the bill to me .
com , ms lowell , i m taking you home .
take your bag .
you dare call me a son of a bitch ?
you 're more to be scorned thn pitied .
you can dismiss your car .
i beg your pardon ?
this is very nice of you .
thank you .
no , you do n't have to apologize , ms lowell 
no .
you wer a gest .
a wman of your stature hs a right to expect every courtesy in any home she consents to visit .
what stature ?
i 've read far too many botanical journals ... to take that question sriously .
are you a botanist ?
every science has its fans .
carbon on the valves .
tell me about yourself , ms lowell .
your work , your hopes , your dreams ...
well , i work as a teacher and i also do field work and write monographs .
on my last field trip i identified and classified ... all the varieties of ferns on jolly buoy .
it was one of the longest monographs i ve ever written .
i 'd love to read it sometime .
i do n't know what my dream is .
well , in any way , that is my work and my hope , except fr my dreams whch i 'm not certain of .
oh , like parkinson 's disease being named after james parkinson .
that 's right .
or the bougainvillea being named after louis de bougainville .
brussels sprouts .
yes , i guess it is .
this seems rather presumptuous , does n't it , to hope for immortality ?
not to me .
if you ca n't be immortal , why bother ?
self-assured .
you re so positive .
it lmost gives me confidence just to be with you .
then in a very short time yu will be a very confident botanist because ..
i intend to be with you a great deal of the time .
oh  yes 
oh , heavens !
yes .
untl this evening .
good morning , mis-
you have exactly 7 days and 9 hours to destitution .
shall  serve your breakfast in bed ... or would you like me to follow you abut with the tray ?
i have n't got time to eat .
reserve a table for two at pavillion for tonight 
'55 was a glorious year for mouton rothschild .
better than '53 , i think 
may i ask you something ?
er , not that i can recall .
why do n't you just drink grape juice ?
it 's not as sweet .
good nght .
night , steward , thank you very much .
thank yu .
5 days and 11 hours .
lsten to me , please , harold .
well , bone up and study the chapter on classification .
she has no sprit , no wit , no conversaton ... and she has to be vacuumed every time she eats .
yes , she is .
i 'll have to start early if i 'm ging to propose .
yes , sir 
oh , shll i order additional champagne , sir ?
no champagne .
i hve recently been re-reading gregor mendel 's ... fascinating experiments with garden peas .
yes , but we must n't forget morgan and muller .
erm ... does it seem that to you ?
collective appraisal has never appealed to me .
ooh !
is there any cold water ?
no , no , never mind .
henrietta , pleas .
nonsense .
i 've ruined another carpt .
stop that .
can you possibly belive , for one moment ... tht wht happens to this foolish , hairy floor covering matters to me ... when i have you sitting beside me ?
looking at me with your beatifully soft ... yet highly intelligent , well-informed eyes ?
you must think me very superficial .
would you cre for some more wine ?
oh yes , i wold love some 
it 's ... erm .. it 's , oh , it 's 10 o'clock and then we have to leave pretty soon ... 'cause i have to get up tomorrow very early for a class .
we are both of the same division :
vertebrata .. the same class : mammalia ... th same order : primate ... the same family : hominide th same genus : homo ... the same species : sapiens ... and the same varety of a class .
i do n't think there 's a class of variety ...
keep quiet , henr- 
i 'm very sorry .
in fact the only difference between us is that i am a man and you are a woman .
y-yes .
oh , henrietta , if you care for me at all .
learn to car for me at all ... in a reasonable amount of time , please say yes .
there is often a tidy profit in speculaton .
henrietta .
did you hurt yourself 
no .
i would literally ... have nothing .
there would be sch a ...
i wo n't ...
you 're not ?
no .
that was my dream , henry .
that someday you would ask me to marry you .
henrietta , darling , wold this saturday be to soon ?
oh , heavens , mercy !
henretta , i 'm intensely uncomfortable .
yes , yes , yes !
you 're a good ... a good girl .
ouch !
stop that , harold !
i 'm sorry , sir .
that hurts .
i 'm enormously plesed , sir .
oh , i wish you could 've been there , harold .
you would have been astonishd of my technique .
harold , send an announcement out to the newspapers ... and put ms lowell 's attorney on the guest list .
it seems he s a close personal friend of hers .
has the wine come up off th rug yet ?
no sir .
i 'm soaking it now in various solvents ... but they only sem to dissolve the nap .
i oughta sue her .
do you know how many llamas must have died to make that rug ?
unseemly ?
did i say she was primitive ?
i retract that .
she 's feral .
i am nauseated .
i limp .
and i can feel my teeth rotting away from an excess of sugar ... tht no mount of toothpaste can dislodge .
that woman is a menace not only to health ... but to western civilization as we know it .
she does n't deserve to live .
forget i said that .
oh , get off my lap , you lttle ingrate !
get off !
he dd it .
he really , really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who henrietta lowell 's attorney is .
in fact , he has an office somewhere in this building .
he does n't seem to have a very active practice .
well , what i mean is ... he may not be exactly overjoyed ... at the idea of sharing her affections with henry .
no ...
andrew .
no , i wo n't accept it .
nonsense .
who is he ?
that little wino who went with you on one of your field trips to the canary slands ?
no , it is not .
well then , who is it ?
a foreigner ?
some little wop with a fancy title ?
really , andrew .
of course , henrietta .
custom-md ... hat .
you will find ...
andrw , you will find some wonderful woman who dserves you .
what 's wrong ?
henrietta , darling ..
andrew , i 'm going now .
i 'm leaving , in order to meet henry ... who , it just so happens , s an american citizen of english extraction ... with a very large fortune of his own .
what 's henry 's last name ?
graham .
alright , alright .
you wo n't get away with it , henry graham .
let me see .
now , i hav t do something .
very well  pt him on .
mr graham .
one day before the ceremony that will unite you as man and wife .
let me explain .
as henrietta 's friend and attorney , it behooves me to take on the ever unplesant role of the devil 's advocate .
and despite her assurances that you are a man of means ...
excuse me , sir .
tea will be delayd by 7 minutes .
andrew , you had no right to do that .
i have nothing to hide .
the grahams have been with th same bank for sx generations ... as mr mcpherson has undoubtedly discovered .
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you can substantiate this hearsay , because i intend to su yo for slander .
i would n't be here if i culd n't .
henrietta , here 's a photostat of the original note .
now take a good look at it .
you 're still gn na sue me for slander  mr graham ?
yes , mr mcpherson .
i am still going to sue you for slander .
alright .
now , let 's put in this way , graham .
agreed .
let 's hear the reason .
i was going t use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affairs .. and then immediately aftrwards ... kill myself .
yes , henrietta .
my life was over .
henry , why did n't you tell me ?
i would have married you the very first day .
you do n't believe that garbage , do you ?
any sex-strved halfwit would know that 's just a line .
what 's the matter with you ?
you have been unbelievably cruel .
thank you fr keeping me alive , henrietta .
you 'r welcome , hnry .
i ca n't believe this !
get off .
i beg of you , henrietta ...
i beg of you , henrietta .
do n't get carried away .
if he 's not really nterested in your money , make him prove it !
i would do anything in the world to prove to you , hnrietta ... that i have n't the slightest interest at all in your money ... but there is absolutely no wy  can do it .
there is no way .
i have a way .
but there is no way .
do n't listn to him , henrietta .
that way , people wo n't get the wrong impression from his uncle the way i did .
you would like .. you would ...
are you crazy ?
have you gone totally out of your mind ?
my idea was for him to disclaim all your money , not to share it .
it 's very naive of you .
and then people really would think ... that he was mrrying me for my money .
this way he 'll already have all my money .
you nincompoop !
how dare you call my fiancee a nincompoop ?
harold !
i thought you were going to play the bach .
this is what he told me to play .
that little woman .
oh no .
she 's ...
harold  she 's unscrewing my montrosini .
i 'll screw it back when she leaves .
she 's destroying my living room .
why did i get into this ?
well , it 's not !
oh , sir , get a hold of yourself .
no , sir .
you will share things .
mcpherson sent you in here to find out what was going on ?
is he the groom ?
i 'll ask the questions from here on in .
henrietta , if i could just talk to you ...
who are you really ?
and i want real names or else you 'll rgret it .
i 'm dodi heinrich .
sir , you are hysterical .
you are due at the altar now .
i wo n't move until she leaves .
get her out .
miss heinrich , i will escort you to the bathroom .
and she will not touch my things 
it 's time .
what are yo doing up there ?
frank , i think one of my legs is shorter than the other .
it 'll get ... longer again fter the ceremony 
henrietta , it 's not too late .
oh , henrietta , i jst talked to his uncle ...
i 'll kill myself , henrietta ...
dearly belovd .
i 'll be leaving now .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay .
thank you .
erm , henrietta , i will use this chest and you can us that one .
and i will unpack my own things .
yes , henry .
then shall we unpack ?
it 's probably ben classified for years .. but i mght as well jst try it anyway .
why not ?
this is really incrdible .
commonly found in grdening sheds .
spreading and emulsifying agents .
soap , saponins , gelatin ...
get poison from grdening shed .
toxides  arsenic acid , sodium arsnite , boron compounds  cyanides ... cyo-cyenates and related compounds ...
this one or that one ?
either one is fine for me .
and when we both use the same bed , we 'll use this one .
champagne ?
henrietta , where is your other arm ?
it fits ovr one shoulder and the other one goes inside .
it 's very uncomfortable .
fine ...
i just think you have your head through the arm-hole .
if you 'll just stand up for a minute .
i think ...
no , not that one .
put that one down .
that arm down .
let me put my glasses ..
oh , here .
lright .
see , you have your ..
you have your head through the arm-hole .
out of the arm-hole .
see , both of the holes look very similar .
where ... where is your head-hole ?
oh .
here you are .
no , wait a minute .
you have ...
that 's it .
this is a head-and-left-arm hole .
here .
there you are .
oh , i see .
now , there !
i 'm sorry to be so much trouble t you .
where is mrs graham , sir ?
who ?
is she not with you , sir ?
hello .
h , welcome home , mrs graham .
may ... may  express my great joy at seeng you .. again .
he disappeared just as i was about to leave .
could n't find him ?
no .
that 's why i usually take the bus .
who 's john ?
john is the chuffeur .
his memory lapses .
i ...
i think you ought to prepare yourself , sir .
mrs graham 's household is incredibly democrtic .
could n't find th chauffeur ?
chauffeur ?
henry , this is the housekeeper , our housekeeper , mrs traggert .
oh , well ...
i guess , er , his car broke down .
i 'll have to lok into that .
very good .
you 're welcome .
oh , bby .
oh , i need you .
oh , i want you .
tell me , henrietta , on what basis do you hire your servants ?
efficiency or personal chrm ?
oh , er , madam ?
this is the cook 's daughter , mandy .
er , mdam  would you mind letting us through ?
harold !
harold ?
yes .
hm .
look t this , harold .
there are 17 servants in this huse , including a cook 's daughter ... who gts $ 200 a week as her mother 's helper 
i want all the servants in this room ... and be sure that mrs graham is not present .
copy this ledger exactly and put it back under the mattress .
yes , sir .
it 's in the back f the garden .
oh , good .
we do n't have anything lik that , mr graham .
but surely some of the more basic pesticides ... arsenic , strychnine .. that kind of thing .
oh , really ?
wll ... if it rally works , why change it ?
mr graham , on behalf of the entire staff , i would like to welcome you aboard ... and drink a toast to your success .
thank you very much , mrs traggert .
no , thank you .
mrs traggert ...
there 's smething about you that puzzles me .
surely , after having successfully managed ... to head the household accounts ... t the tune of 35,000 tax-free dollars per year , for the past five years ... you must have salted something away .
hav i ever .
i 'm not including , of course ... the token salary of $ 800 a week
for ... four hundred .
oh .
you receive as mad money .
mrs traggert , you 're fired .
it means that you are a thief , mrs traggert .
on what grounds are you making ths accusation ?
if you are nt out of this house by 10 , i will call the police .
uh , eh ...
you , er , you would n't like to hear my side of the story ?
alright , alright !
i 'm leaving .
john , do you think we ought to scrap our cars ?
huh ?
it would mean bankruptcy if we actually took them out on the road .
yeah , i have five .
well , five will do very nicely , john .
i 'll try to clarify it , john .
you 're bing fired because you are a cheap crook .
i will shot you as  trespasser ... with proved criminal intentions .
and i am an excellent shot .
does that make it clearer ?
well , er ... why , if you got ta act like that ..
i quit .
s for the rest of you , you have exctly two hours to get out .
you too , madam .
h means business !
hnry , ther are a lot of strange people in the house , who are they ?
they are not people , henriett , they are servants .
you know , henry , mrs traggert will b furious .
mrs traggert has been fired along with the rest of the staff .. so her emotinal responses need no longer concern you .
fine .
henritta , come , please 
thank you .
you may go , erica .
especally john .
we dd n't vote on it , henrietta .
i simply told them they were fired .
oh no , oh no , hnry 
d yo have an idea how much money has been spent to run this house ?
really , he has his finger on evrything .
he co-signed all of mrs traggert 's checks ?
he 's very thorough .
henry ...
she said it would be easier for her .
so i ...
i , er ... did .
yes ?
never , er , never mind ...
i would lke the bank to issue a statement covering all your accounts ... and please instruct thm that no check has to be drawn on any account .. unless it was co-signed by me .
i can go over your holdings and your federal and state tax rturns after you 're ... fter you 're ... after , aftrwa- , afterwards .
holdings and federal , okay .
havens .
yes ?
i suppose you 're absolutely satisfied with the orgnic method ?
yes , i am .
now , mr mcpherson .
nobody did .
if a judge sees those salaries ... he 'll clamp you in jail on spec .
very fw chauffeurs make $ 600 a week .
from all of us .
according to the records , i do n't take anything at all , and do n't yu forget it .
laura !
wait .
laura .
now , wait a minute .
we ve ben a great team .
we laughed a little .
put a littl away together .
... gardening shed ...
oh , henry , how wonderful .
whom do i know with a gardening shed ?
 sprayed and the crown gall was gone .
what an exciting coincidence .
have you ever thought of teachng , dear ?
do n't you ?
i have no inclination to teach .
how do you know , dear , if you 've never tried ?
... on a cash basis ... accrual bass therefore deduct taxes in the yer in which they are actually paid ...
might as well finish the accounts and get you ... and get them out of the way before the end of the week .
he handles the income taxes rather well .
what ?
i wanted to ask you somethng .
well , you know that every summer i go on a field trip ... for my research work .
i thought i might go on a canoe trip on the adirondacks .
it 's ll sort of tangled and isolated .
and , erm ...
to th adirondacks .
the adirondacks .
i would feel safer even than with a guide .
i would n't if i were yo , sir .
well , d n't forget to pack my swiss army .
yes .
she 's not good-natured .
do you remember sme weeks go , sir , when ... when you told me that you 'd lost all your money ?
harold , do n't forget to pack the compasses and the maps .
yes , sir .
i mean , look how you 've taken over the house .
i forgot to check her before she went to school this morning .
i took the liberty , sir .
and our own shortcomings .
harold .
pack ... never mind .
put the revolver down .
henry !
henry !
henry !
easy , henrietta .
henry 
relax .
here we are .
sit down .
that 's it .
that 's it , now .
catch your breath .
they 've accepted it .
what is it they have accepted ?
it 's a trpical tree-fern .
and i discovered it during our honeymoon .
but i could n't believe it , so i sent it to wagner ... at the university of michigan .
and henry , it is .
i 've discovered a true species .
well .
that 's very nice .
very nice .
that 's right .
or james parkinson .
you 've achieved th kind of immortality after ll , have n't you 
now you 'll b in all the atlases under l ... right before mrgan , mullr and mendel .
for graham ?
that 's not the way to name a species 
alsophila grahami , for henry graham .
will they have my name in the atlas under ... under g ?
for henry graham ?
yes , and they 'll have you in all the textbooks , henry , as a footnote ...
and in the atlases under g .
well , i 've chieved a small slice of immortality myself , have n't i ?
as a footnote and under g .
i put a tip of one fern into a plastic token ... so that you can wear it always .
if you want to .
wll , why not ?
an alsophila grahami .
why do you ask ?
you like it ?
yes , yes .
vry attractive , is n't it ?
i mean , for a frond .
alsophila lowellia or something ?
you remember ?
you said that if being with you was going to give me confidence ...
would you like some more z11 ?
it 's the z11 that 's attracting them .
it only makes it itch more .
thy say that if you do n't scratch , it itches less .
i spilled the honey .
here , henrietta .
what will i do ?
it seems easier to paddle somehow .
that 's because the current gets stronger as w pproach the rpids .
yes .
just tell me exactly what to do , dear .
i 'm a very good sailor .
wht ?
full harder to the lft sid !
the left side !
full harder !
the right side !
henry , how much longer do the rapids go on ?
it just seems to stop .
listen !
henry , it sounds like a waterfall !
that 's what it is 
it just stops and becomes a waterfall .
henry ?
the canoe overturned .
henry ?
and ... if only she had told me she could n't swim .
but she had her heart set on going with me alone .
alright , henrietta !
i mean ...

dick , a good start ?
oh , yes , dot .
stay tuned , and we 'll be back to brng you the whole thing .
boy :
it was hotter than blazes , about 110 .
so we stayed in the house , in the air conditioning .
we just hung arond , my sister and me and watched countless hours of dytime tv .
too hot to go out .
we 'd melt in the sun .
that kaboom shook the room .
we turned , and into our hous something slid .
the first silly thing we can do ..
we 'll make a big mess .
but our parents were out .
they were gone for a week .
as fr playing with glue , my sis said :
kids need to have fun .
he does n't seem well .
hey , woodchuck , calm down .
just relax .
it 's you who smells bad .
said the kid in the lid .
as the water got deeper , the woodchuck went :
blub !
it 's okay .
said the kid .
i 'll pull on this chain so the water goes down .
it filled up the kitchen and bedrooms , and then ... it splashed out the door and into the street , where it provided relif from the afternoon heat .
kids came from all over t splash in the lake , not knowing the source was our potty break .
they 're swimming in water straight out of our toilt .
think we should tell 'em ?
you 're rude , and you 're naughty .
to make matters worse , i 'm stuck in this potty .
prhaps you should nap .
said the kid .
i 've returned .
it would 've ben sooner , but i needed a shower .
he opened the top and shouted :
let 's play .
then ot sprang two kids , who responded :
they gave us a kiss ...
mwah .
the first kid was trouble , bt these two seem worse .
hi .
how you ding 
kid 2 looked at mary , then whispered :
then they ran all around , doing impossible feats , acting like kds who 've had too many sweets .
i 'm hungry .
he shot out the room and ran into the kitchen .
the san francisco treat .
hey , that was delicious .
i 'm hypoglycemic .
oh , no , you must stp this .
said sis to kid 2 .
then the walls started cracking .
both :
we said it again .
they stood there , dumbfounded .
as they looked at the damage , we knw we 'd be grounded .
give us a call , and we 'll come back to play .
we 'll rebuild your house and then paint it with glidden .
and that 's what they did , and in less than a jiffy , the house was rebuilt , and it looked really spiffy .
that night w ate well .
it had been quite a day .
but now life was happy .
can anyone hear me ?
i 'm still in the potty !
* libel , libation , lanai *

that 's our weed .
i was directing outback buddy .

you 've discovered a cure for insomnia .
do you realze we hve to show this carton t the front office tomorrow ?

i worked all night on that cartoon .
i was exhausted , and then --
and thn , i remember , it was exactly 2:43 a.m .
on the morning of february 30th .
i started drawing these weird characters .
we 're having soup today !
anyway , i grabbed the finished cartoon and showed it to the big gy .
* just as chipper as i can be *
* got no cares and got no wrries *
all :
all :
* we 've smashed outback buddy *
* we 've smashed postman buddy *
working with the warners was a true joy .
we made a series of buddy/warner cartoons .
and , of course , bus driver buddy .
it was hard , but i had to fire him .
they liked hitting him with their mallets .
but still , it was time for hm to go .
that was the biggest mistake of my life .
hey , i wan na tell you ..
do n't go away , huh ?
announcer :
stay tuned .
we 'll be back with more of the warner brothers and their sister dot 's 65th anniversary special .
not after ... tonight .
and so the warners were scheduled to appear in their very own cartoon .
i told the kids ,
a real grinder .
guy by the name of , eh -- eh ...
oh , shrewd negotiator .
he was n't an agent .
he was a chicken .
i said , plotz , what 's the matter with you ?
feinman does n't know what he 's talking about .
a-anyway , we signed the contracts .
when i heard they signed a four-cartoon deal ,
if i remember it corrctly , eh , they had flypaper stuck on their fannies .
never mind .
it was the stupidest thing i had evr seen .
you try directing those kds .
weed was always screaming and yelling at them .
weed :
no , no .
spit out the spoon .
do n't just look at me !
do somthing !
noo !
spit out the bowl !
spit it out !
he could do a buddy cartoon , sure .
it 's not that we did n't get along ...
how can i put this ?
i hte them .
so i had to take weed off the warner cartoons .
but he went on to direct hygiene films for the navy 
i won an ward for how to shampoo , and the sequel , how to rinse .
no director wold get near the warners .
h let wakko direct .
what ayutz .
mm .
plotz was furious about that cartoon .
their agent was livid .
do n't you take tht tone with me , laboo .
the warners are finishd .
i was so sad when i heard the warners were n't gon na make any more cartons .
i was such a fan .
with no cartoons to make , the warners were free run around the lot as they pleased .
wait .
i did n't say , simon says .
yakko and wakko would always pop out of something , give yu a big kiss and say , uh --
no , that was n't it .

* the sense of smell 's the way you tell *
* that you need to change your socks *
* when you bang your toe on the bed 
* the sense of hearing s something good *
* 'cause if a tree falls in the wood *
* would there be sound ?
you bet there would *
* if it landed on top of your head *
* yur head *
* if a tree lands on top of your head *
* the sense of taste affects your waist *
* so you cn understand people like shirley maclaine 
all :
* or the scents of expensive perfume *
* when you practice a sense of fair play *
* ther are cents that you pay at a toll *
* and a sense of confusion we 're out of contrl *
all :

* and common sense it 's true *
* sense of wonder sense of beauty *
* a sense of doubt a sense of danger *

tuesday the 17th ...
i 'm going to hurt my brother badly .
some people play golf , others like tennis , horseshoes  bridge , canasta , and other such fancy hobbies .
wakko warner , meet pip .
charmed to meet ya .
now , another hobby enjoyed by many is knitting .
it 's red , which is nt my favorite color .
now , do n't get me wrong , red is okay for ties and suspenders , but with sweaters , i prefer more neutral clors .
but when i 'm relaxing  i do n't care what wear .
long pants , brmuda shorts , t-shirts or formal attire 
you know , i onc stayed at a comfort inn .
it goes along with that pastime of mine , relaxing .
which of curse is the optimum condition for relaxed strolling ...
we got ta run .
bye !
i kept humming and humming and humming and humming .
retreat !
we 'd love to stay and count our brain cells as they de , one by one .
but we ca n't .
wakko :
bye !
all :
free at last !
thank --
well , i decided right then and there to go buy a muscal instrument .
so n the particular tuesday , the 17th , to whch was referring , i went down to the sixth street music mporium to buy a new tambourine .
and as i was strolling along i detected a wonderful scent in the mrning air .
what could it be ?
silence ?
i love a good pimnto laf and mayo sandwich .
the more pimentos , the better .
is it from , how are you ?
howdy is one of those strange words that really has no origin 
more formal , i thnk .
arrivederci .
aloha oi .
home sweet home .
now , the smell was actually less bologna and more orchid , the beautiful flower found on the island state of hawaii .
of course , i was n't in hawaii , so i needed to search out the location of th nearest orchid .
so i visited every florist shop in town .
i had a cat once .
it used its claws to tear my living room couch to shreds .
had a sleep-way bed n it , with a foam-rubber mattress .
the very same afternoon of that relaxing stroll aforementioned .
anyway i did n't wan na pay extra for the delivery of the couch , so  decided to carry the couch home myself .
and just as i emerged onto the street , by accident i bumped into a well-dressed man with an orchid in his lapel .
well , it 's been nice chatting with you .
all :
huh ?
bye .
it 's too quiet .
i miss him .
pip , wat !
dot :

the landlord 's tale .
of the midnight ride of paul rvere
on the 18th of april in 75
if the british march
ready to ride and spread the alarm
just as the moon rose over th bay
where swinging wide at hr moorings lay
the somerset , british man-of-war
a phantom ship with each mast and spar
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the somber rafters that round him made
a moment on the roofs of the town
beneath , in the churchyard lay the dead
in their night encampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread
a moment only he feels the spell
of the lonely belfry and the dead
where the river widens to meet the bay .
a line of black that bends and floats
oh , my gosh !
on the opposite shre walked paul revere .
then impetuous stamped the earth
the belfry tower of the old north church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
h springs to the sddle the bridle he turns
one if by land or two if by sea 
and beneath , from the pebbles n passing , a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he hs left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him tranqil and broad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its edge
now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge
nd the barking of the farmer 's dog
that rises after the sun goes down .
the british are coming !
he saw the gilded wethercock
gaze at him with a spctral glare
at the bloody work they would look upon .
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the britsh are coming !
the british are coming !
the british re coming !
in the books you have read
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the redcots down the lane
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
and the midnight message of pal revere .
we 're finished .
the landlord 's tale just dos n't cut it .
pul revre 's ride .

i spent an incredible amount of time in gas stations , honky tonks and other off-the-beaten-path places , trying to appear cool while obsessively following the descent of a steel ball down the playing surface of a garishly lit machine .
i came in with my grandfather , standing on pop crates to play pinball .
i was about eight years old .
they 'd say , you 're in the arcde , here 's a roll of quarters .
aprtment houses had them in the laundry rooms .
i guess it was the kind of age whn you do n't want to do things with your parents .
i also remember my father dragging me out by my ears , saying that i spent too much money .
a crowd hung around the machine and you hd to wait to play 
i started playing at the local café .
took my books to study there .
sometimes it replaced studying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highest amount it could wn , which was about 15 gmes .
sell them 12 games .
if you say pinball , people are like , what ?
there are many kids today that do n't know what a pinball machine is .
and they come in here and they see something that they have n't seen in 25 years .
something that was a major part of their youth .
kids today do n't really understand pinball .
the kids today , between the computer games and th home games , and the nintendos and the sega systms and gamebys , they just wo n't play pinball .
i can remember when i ws growing up we sed to eat all our meals at home .
and we used to go out for entertainmnt .
and now everybody eats out .
everybody always goes to restaurants .
they do n't cook at home much .
public places of amusement have ben falling by the wayside in america like crazy .
you ca n't find a pinball machine .
there 's no more arcades in malls .
the bars today hav a megatouch , a jukebox and a pool table .
pinball is finished in france .
in englnd it 's finished long time ago .
in italy you ca nt find one pinball .
in germny no on pinball .
even in belgium , it was a pinball paradise .
it 's finish .
they said pinball was dead .
it starts with one .
then another one .
i was outgrowing the family room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 games .
it was a very rapid decline into obsession , i think .
once you get the lure of the silver ball in you it 's lke an addiction and yu ca n't stop and i just kept , you know .
you remember buying every one , where yu got it from .
and just as i 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon na do this ,
pinball wizard comes on the radio and i think , no , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm finally home , exhausted .
they really do n't seem to be machines .
and the wy they talk to you , you find yourself talking to it .
extra ball !
yo just come in and admire them .
shine a light
all my life it was pinball .
it s my life .
like some pople .
i like pinball .
pinball and girls .
but girls is finshed .
hey , look at these guys !
they 'll ll come over and have a big party every week .
steve 's still kind of the centre .
1972 , my dad bought one for my room .
from there on , it jst got pretty wicked .
i 've got them in every room in my house .
the pinball dungeon .
the things i like i 'm very obsessive .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect something , whether it be pinball machnes , jaws memorabilia , i got ta have it all .
like it says , i wan na rck and roll all night and party very day .
it was during the depths of the depression , the late 20s  early 30s , where the coin-operated amusement game industry kind of got birth .
it literally was  name because there were various pins that were hammered into a wod surface .
the games were evlving in the 1930s .
we have to outlaw it .
we ca nt control it .
but the majority of product that was out there was for amusement only .
in the cas of new york city , chicago and los angeles , being three major metroplitan areas , as well as other areas arund the united states , pinball was banned .
it was this one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i got ta do something like that .
before that it was nthing but chance .
gottlieb ruled in the '50s and '60s .
before the city council in april of 1976
as well as  demonstration of pinball being a game of skill , as opposed to a game of chance .
business ws booming .
prfit margins were huge .
when we started solid state electronics on pinball machines we were on the leading edge of technology .
managers from the different restaurants and the broadway crowd .
kids alwys want some place to g , something to do .
i think that 's what gave growth to the arcade business .
naughty or whatever .
you could kind of do what you wanted .
t was more like hanging ot with your friends .
wasting time .
prod to have in a french bistro in paris an american mchine .
game over .
special target .
what is it that makes you stop and play one machine ?
it 's something that 's pitched towards young males .
there 's not really a lot of female-friendly images on these .
any violent misogynist thing you wnt is there on pinball .
a lot of these machines have love scenes on them .
i 'm not in the supposing business .
what do you think ?
you 'd have those centrefold images f young  rther buxom ladies , usually blonde , staring out of the machine at you , to inspire you .
but you believe it is ?
no question about it .
sexually frustrated peple play pinball a lot .
guy has a hot ball and it 's just flying .
you 're getting rady to become ruler of the universe .
says williams perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been in my blood since i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
should hve known i ws going to be a collector and i did n't start collecting until i bought this house in 1976 .
and the first game in my collection is my favourit game of all time .
i always copy down serial numbers and i have a binder that i 've hand-typed since i do n't do computers yet .
to me i think it would be interestng ,
i have 300 games , where they were at one time .
were they in joe s bar nd grill or somewhere down the street or at a show ?
i have a column for the date .
notes .
i worked in the bowling industry for a lot of years .
and the last bowling alley i worked at closed down 12 years ago .
that 's why i collect flyers .
that 's why i collect what they call press photos .
they 're chronological .
there 's a lot of games are mssing scorecards .
how they get lost over the years , it s hard to believe , but they do .
in the front closet , there 's lots of binders in there also .
i was blessed with an unbelievable memory .
jokes .
is n't that good ?
i do n't think about what it 's worth cos i do n't want to sell it .
lot of work and when you 're done and you turn it on and it does n't blow up , you fel real good .
i 'm a people person , i like people .
i looked forward to seeing people on monday , tuesday , wednesday .
i never had any brothers or sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got married and divorced twice 
and they sy it 's knd of hereditary but my real dad smoked and drank nd h was an alcoholic but i never did drnk or smoke .
the rush of bing able to play any game you have at any given time by pushing the button , you ca n't explain it to people .
i wake up and do it every single day .
lke an extension of my hand or something , i guess .
thy 'll be in a bar , with their friend .
we just smile .
chicago is the pinball capital of the world .
we live here .
we need t have that fast turnaround .
ech person does a little part of it and passes it along .
today , we 're the only company making pinball machines and we strve to have 10 % of what that market once was .
t 's a modern car tht has some of the look and feel and coolness of it and it 's retr .
we 're the only pinball mnufacturer .
gee , if i had just one more shot ,
i know i would have gotten it this time .
i had two balls locked and i just got that last ball locked cos i did it last time .
we build working models of things and then we play with it .
but it tells us whether what we 're doing is going to wrk or not work or be fun or not fun 
this is what the final version of the game loks like when it 's finally producd .
it 's just you and the track now !
it 's what people said i was going to be .
and that 's what i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothing .
a nice sound .
being a programmer by trade
i mean , for me this is like a little mini world .
s when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it 's having fun inside its own little world and you 're helping it along .
little fish in the tank having fun 
from displays to alpha numerics .
pinball lost a market of plyers because of their technologically enhanced games .
i love strategy .
it 's about achievement , it 's about goals .
and you go , oh , i see , if i do this and this , i get one of those .
piece of cake .
and then you play it ten times in a row and you do n't do it .
and you 're like , h , i can do that .
for instance , in pirats a very obvious strategy is to get time lock lit 
the ball will bounce arund for three seconds while the pst is up .
the post cmes down and it still may bounce around .
and all the while you complete these lights .
so then i get the ship multiball , which s the ship .
so you shoot the ship , you shot the ship .
i find that very satsfying .
it just happens to come in a box .
like  slot machine .
an opertr comes along and collects th money .
he can wn a free game .
even with a little glory .
the knocker goes off in a crowded bar 
 did that , i mde that go off , ok 
when yu hear them cussing sometims , or trying to kick the game to get some action , you know you 're getting the results that you want , you know .
and you see them putting more coins in and you say , i made it .
put another quarter in the pinball
everyone jokes about there 's some sickness , there 's some insanity .
but it 's kind of like a geeky thing is probably the way pinball 's perceived by the outsiders .
how d you percive pnball ?
we are from tokyo , japan .
we are pnball lovers .
and then now it seems almost like a defintion of a nerd r  weird and marginal person to be caught playing pinball .
but maybe there 's something attractive about that .
i 'm the jim morrison of pinball .
i think it 's great for pinball .
i think the pingeek is good .
i have n't mt anybody like him before .
i wan na start with this one because it is very hard to find .
i 've got it .
i love pinball .
i wan na show this one .
96 % of my ideas pan out to money .
i 'm here to save a hobby that saved my life .
i lov music .
i was pretty much raised in arcades  because of divorce issues and just a mess .
and say , hey , i 've arrived for the show .
and guess who my ride is ?
sh drops me off .
elton john was the ultimate showman in the '70s .
i want to be a showman .
and maybe that 's not th colest thing .
evrybody tells me to tak these drugs , i shold be in an institution .
i get so much crap advice tht i 'd be dead and bankrupt if i listened to it .
talk to each other and there might not b all this fighting and shooting .
whatever happened t just gong into a bar like john wayne .
and then you have a drink over it later .
i 'm definitely misunderstood , you know .
but i tended to back away and said it 's not really man gainst machine .
if i can sense the rhythm of that game , the temp of that game , i wan na be working in tandem with it .
i 'm not fighting it .
i 'm working with it .
i guarantee you it 's chemically smilar to that of athletes .
when athletes gt in the zone , they fel as though they 're watching thmselves run the ball down the field .
pinball reminds me f like dreaming .
because like when i 'm playing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not really with like reality .
but yet you 're watching what you 're doing and trying to concentrate .
it really is a unique feeling to become one with the machine .
it 's sort of a zen where you 're sort of meditting and that 's all you 're concentrted on is the pinball .
you forget everything else .
yu ca n't lose the ball out the middle .
and you stretch it out and you embellish it and you let all the people watching know that look at this prson , this person 's just done a very difficult thing .
when you get to put your initials on it 's like , there i am .
i own this game .
i put a lot of play time in on this machine .
i try to defend it .
that 's my home territory .
i ws just simply ahad of the machine .
i was accumulating so many free games .
and eventally after about three or four hours i had to go .
so in a snse there is a pssbility you have the illusion that you 've won .
thre is something inevitable about losing at pinball .
becaus there is  feeling often when you 're playing pinball that the machin decides when you need to go home .
the object of play in pinball is a high scor 
when you see a truly skilled pinball player , yo realise it is a game of skill , not a game of chance .
it 's pure adrenaline .
now what you have are players who control the tempo of the game .
i se it with my sons , in all honesty 
there are tmes when i stand back and marvel at the fact that they have the ability that they have .
i look at a game , i try to find a weakness and exploit that weakness for my own game .
this is a sport .
to stand and stay focused for that long , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shoulders .
i 've always wanted to be champion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnyvale , california .
i started playing when i was ten yars old .
yeah , it 's the whole thing .
pinball 's gotten a lot more complicated nowadays .
it 's becoming more and more unclear to me how pople ar getting big scores .
yeah  sometimes you see it ll when you 're playing really well .
i can see a ball going towards the out lane at 12 inches away and know to do something right away .
i 'll nudge the machine and when the ball gets there it just does this thing off the post and rolls in .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off with whatever .
he 's got this routine that 's only his .
i wan na do what he 's doing .
and i could be lik on one hand and one heel .
you know , what i really wanted to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mom told me that i should get a career .
because i have pinball as my own world .
a diamond in the rough that i have prsonally shined .
pinball 's something that 's done something for me that i had to discover fr myself .
that was already there in a world that gives us all kinds of input about stuff that we do n't even want to hear other people 's input about .
and i knew that all that input was mistaken .
pinball is a world of special rules and unique opportunities .
i wuld even go as far as say i am special because of pinball .
i 've always played pinball .
you 'd choke , you would n't do well , and you 'd have t wait a yer to try again .
but pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mental component to remain calm and in control .
the best players never do somthing that affects the ball unless they do it for a purpose .
and ball control does n't mean always catching the ball , it means putting the ball where you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , not just where it is rght now .
my mother lives with me in new jersey .
when i tell her i 'm going , she said , go ahead and enjoy yourself .
you 've got ta have some fun so go enjy yourself .
six million !
basically  'm a synthtic organic chemist actually working on trying to find a tretment for alzheimer 's diseas .
i really have n't made it to finals in a major tournament in a while .
i did it once in '99 , but i got elminated unfortunately .
surprising villages , floodng cities and towns ...
the storm is my nickname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so pinball and i kind of grew up together .
and i want to bat the best .
it makes it much easier to live thinking that i 'm the best and i just have n't had my moment .
what 's relly important when you play pinball at the world championship level is to get your mentality straight .
because everyone is so good that yu ned the mental edge .
and if you can balance those two things you 'll be unbeatable .
and i feel like an outsider .
i fel kind of like ... someone that they all think they 're better than .
and i know for a fact that i can beat them .
one of the gentlemen here , neil shtz , has been in th finals three or four times .
and it 's like if there is a pinball god maybe they 're cursing him because he 's scond or third place , and he 's so great he deserves to win finally and so if i were to pick someone t win ,
but sure , yeah , it 's tugh but i enjoy just the thrill of competition .
what can we expect this mornng , guys ?
absolutely i think those guys are simply better players

best player in the world .
i programm pinball machnes .
i work with designers and basically make th game do all of what it does .
i was in college , it was around 1986 .
it was about five years after that tht i started competing .
the easiest thing is to hit the flippers individully .
i do n't know ...
you know , when they first play .
multiball here .
going to try and get one of the balls over the other flippr to make a shot .
score some points .
and i watched this person methodcally do a passing shot over , make the shot , kick down , go up , passing shot , over .
so i bounce the ball over to the other flipper , now it 's under control .
i never thought of playing pinball that way .
you say a pinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are .
world pinball championships .
and within one week there was a hurricane named ivan tht came up the east coast and the little creek in front of here overflwed its banks .
and there was nothing to be done 
everything we had just finished was washed away .
i was just frustrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up so i could decide if i wanted to try again .
it did prove possible to clean up and rebuild .
yu can hve a great game .
there are a couple of people who are high-quality players .
very focused when they play , tough to beat .
one slip and the ball goes .
and that 's t .
it certainly presented an entertainment option that was awfully compelling .
in 1980 you could not possibly build enough video games to saturate the market .
and all of a sudden our income doubled and tripled overnight .
it just blew me away .
and then the pinball sat there almost forlorn-looking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen .
when you play pinball you 're playing a piece of equipment that you can move around and control .
pinball machines you ca n't do that .
it s a pinball machine .
there 's a beginning but it 's endless .
i finished it .
the real backbreaker came when home video finally hit the marketplace .
of either myself playing at home or me and my buddy playing at home .
but it really spelled the end of certainly the pinball era .
it was widely believed at the time that video games had usurped pinball and there was no longer a ned for pinball whatsever .
pinball was back on the map again .
after a decade of decline , flippers are flapping .
bumpers are thumping .
pinball is bouncing back .
i had a lot of life tied up n it .
it was really a presence and just the daily interaction f the world that i had at my doorstop that i knew i was never gon na have again .
it was a life-defining moment that saddens me and still saddens me actually .
i go out now and i see some of my old friends and i play pinball and that 's nice .
that 's just never gon na happen for me again .
so if yu look at the downside f it all , pinball deserves a better fate than what it currently has .
in truth it is n't a bg part f our culture any more .
but i 'm not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 yars .
were pinball not to survive , the world would continue but a little bit of the fabric of life would be gone .
i think that there is a fleeting sense of one 's naiveté and innocence that games bring out .
and as we get older , for many of us , we step away from doing those things that gave us joy when we were younger 
and i think that that loss of innocence is tough .
and everybody should try it at some point in time .
you have a universe in a box .
under glass .
it 's very strange , very strange .

 'm filing a report n this to the headquarters , this is lot of ...
he said ...
this mission just falling apart since commander pwell died
it is because he so smart
i 'm tired of being treated like an old work rat
they are uncouth and failed to appreciate my better qualities
today over lunch i tried to improve moral and build a sense of camaraderie among the man
by holding a humorous round robin discussion of the early days of the misson
these man do not want a happy ship
i have finally identified the malfunction
communcations laser number 17 has been damaged
this evidently happened during the steroid storm

lieutenant doolittle , hello !
has now been activated nd will switch into a test mode
f you will look near the surface door
the laser will now energize please stand clear of the path of the beam
thank you for observing all safety precautions

i do n't know if you can hear me

well ... here goes ...
my eyes , my eyes !

to do so will cause immediate ...
begin primery sequence
mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop .
this is lieutennt doolittl calling bomb # 20
do you understand ?
i am programmed to detonate in 14 minutes 30 seconds
bomb , this is doolittle
i read you , lieutennt doolittle but i am programmed to detonate in 14 minutes
detonation will occur at the progrmmed time
ttentin , attention i have sustained serious damage
wich will confine the explsion to an area one mile in diameter
commander powell , this is doolittle
doolittle , you must tell me one thing .
they.. they broke up they disbanded over 15 years ago
ah ... pity , pity ...
ah , so many malfunctions ...
oh , well , did you try the azimuth clutch ?
negativ effect
sorry , doolittle
i 've forgotten so much since i 've been in hre .
the time is running out .
commander , hello ?
come in
commender powell , hllo
doolittle , hello ?
sorry , i 've got a blank
hold it
i forget so many things in here so many things
hold on , just a minute
let me think ...
but yo ca n't explode in the bomb bay couse it 's foolish
you 'll kill us all there 's no reason for it
i am programmed to detonate in 9 minutes
would you consider another course of action
bomb !
oh , yes
talk to the bomb
but i have been talking to it , sir and pinbck is talking to it right now .
doolittle ?
six minutes to detonation !
doolittle , what the hell are you doing ?
are you with me ?
how do you know you exist ?
what the hell is he doin ' ?
it is intuitively obvious
intuition is no proof
ths is fun .
now listen , here is the big question
how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct ?
the gun !
gun !
gun !
no , boler , you out of your mind
you 'll hit the bomb doolittl is talking t the bomb
you are bad sht , h 'll save us you can shoot at
what i 'm getting at is this
and this sensory data is merely a stream of electrical impulses
in other words , all that i really know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
n , now give me th gun
to explode , of course .
that is correct .
of course not .
well then
so if you detonate in ...
nine seconds ...
you could be doing so on the basis of false data .
you hav no proof that t was correct data .
attention , attention the bomb has returned to the bomb bay
the destruction sequence is aborted
pinback ?
hello ?
hello , anybody !
i 'm coming in now i 'm down by the emergency air lock
you are now leavng the emergency air lock
thank you for observing all safety precutions
hello , pinback ?
what 's up doolittle ?
turn on his helmet rado so i can contact him
what s wrong , i did n't hear ...
talby , can yu rad me ?
help , doolittle , help me !
alright , bomb
therefore , i shall ignore you .
flse data can act only as a distraction
therefore i shall refse to perceive you .
hey , bomb
doolittle !
calm down , i 'm coming .
and in addition to the darkness there was als me
and i saw that i was alone .
hey , bomb ?
doolittle , where are you ?
hre i am
i 'm spinning
we re falling in oppsite directions away from each other
what happened , doolittle ?
the ship blew up ?
what ?
funny , i thought i have the damn thing convinced
boiler ?
maybe not mayb there is a way
it looks like the skipper he made it .
talby , looks like i 'm headed for the plant going right toward it .
what a beautiful way to die ..
guess you 're right .
doolittle , i 'm heading right toward something it 's behind me , in the distance
something that glows .
i 'm going into them i 'm going to hit them
doolittle
yeah ?
you were my fvorite
to circle the universe..
forever
i 'm with them now ...
be back this way again some day
i think i 've figured out a way !
so , what 's the story ?
the story is about ...  girl of about 14 or 15 ,
who 's out riding her bike .
and i 'm in  rolls ...
i 'm not prince charming , that would be pushing it ...
i take her to a rather unusual hotel .
then she wants to see england again , she 's english , and the plane crashes .
you 'll have to explain that a bit .
in new guinea , there 's an indigenous people , the papuans , who practice this airplane worship , the cargo cult .
they see these things flying over their heads without ever seeing them land , and they want t benefit from them .
so they want the planes to crash to get their hands on the freight .
i draw  parallel with melody s death , who was killed in a plane crash .
and i hop that one of these cargo planes will fall with melody in it .
bring her back .
the transposition of eternal love .
i 'm not a cynic , as others maintain .
and my candour .
they confused candour with cynicism .
in fact , what you call ... gliness is something you made into a style through your desire for perpetual candour .
i wrote somewhere that when i 'm called ugly , i laugh quitly so you do n't awake .
i 've had pretty women , i have the most beautiful now , so my ugliness ... thos who are bothered by it ...
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah !
hey there , baby .
yeah , whatever .
not now , kid .
i hope you do n't take this the wrong way or anything  but there 's just too big of a generation gap between the two of us .
but all i want to know is what time it is .
how about a kiss there , missy ?
ooh !
oh !
baby !
uhh !

say , baby , how 's about you and l --

stephen house of th lndon exchang telegraph .
narrator :
long before borders were drawn before the reign of genghis khan nomadic tribes have roamd the remote altai mountains of asia .
and for countless generations , this precios skill has typically been hnded down from father to son .
but this relationship between man and bird is finite .
custom dictates that after seven years of loyal service an eagle must be returnd to the wild to contnue the circle of life .
my dear eagl .
we have been together for  long tim .
and you have only brought good things to me .
aisholpan :
my name is aisholpan .
i was born in the altai mountains .
there it s .
nurgaiv :
there it is .
i love my dad .
my dad and my grandpa are eagle hunters .
nurgaiv :
it is not a choice .
it 's  calling that has to be in your blood .
the horses the clothing , the equipment .
aisholpan :
please hold it gently .
but i d n't resent that .
great .
nurgaiv :
she holds the eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her blood as well .
aisholpan :
because all the men in my family have been eagle hunters my dream is to become the first eagle huntress in mongolia .
narrator :
girls do not eagle-hunt .
they get cold .
but i think grls and boys are equal .
girls can do anything boys can if they try .
my father taught me ...
... and i do n't want to let her down .
nurgaiv :
yeah .
nurgaiv :
raise your rm !
that 's good !
launch it this way .
pay attention .
are you tired ?
we go to schol by the syr river because there is no school in our area .
let 's play again !
i 've been living here since the 2nd grade .
aisholpan :
we are at school for only 5 days .
i take care of them .
all :
i feel good .
aisholpan :
but right now , all i can think about is becoming an eagle huntress .
is dinner ready ?
place the spoons .
may god bless you .
nurgaiv :
quick , feed this tough child .
until now aisholpan has been using her father 's bird to learn the basics .
since she is serious i figure , let her bring up her own eagl and train it .
today , there 's the rare pportunity to seize a 3-month-old eaglet from a nearby mountain .
may we be so lucky !
d you see , my child ?
we 're going to have to climb up that side nd then descend from the top .
do not b afraid , okay ?
it 's a strong knot !
hold on tightly .
in the name of god .
give me som more rpe , dad .
back , back .
do n't be scared .
aisholpan :
hold tight i said .
aisholpan :
yeah , yeah .
go slowly .
no more slip-ups !
yes .
look !
there are two eagles nesting side by side .
nurgaiv :
yep !
you got it ?
bring it over this way .
this way .
let it go a little bit more .
that 's it .
pull it .
aisholpan 
here you go .
nurgaiv :
hurry !
do n't pll .
give me some slack n this other rope .
let it out more !
aisholpan :
should i reel it in now ?
we did it !
nurgaiv :
this eaglet is a sign of good luck !
i 'm exhausted !
nurgaiv :
you proved yourself today .
thanks .
womn :
wind speed will be from 3 to 8 meters per second .
air temperture will be 8 to 13 degrees celsius .
let me compete in the festival this year !
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
please ?
do n't worry !
we would freak out like crazy !
aisholpan :
yes .
aisholpan :
yes .
do you call , hey , eagl , come back here , please ?
huukaa !
huukaa !
is it afraid of other pople ?
of course !
ow !
aisholpan is going to be an eagle hunter .
grandpa :
really ?
this is an important tsk .
both are young .
can you give your blessing to aisholpan ?
aisholpan !
may god help you pursue the hunter 's path .
may you grow old like me with yellow teeth .
i entrust that eagle to yo .
this wll be a beast catching bird .
let it get old with you .
eagle hunters wll train their daughters to ride horses then hold a bird .
it is a shame to do so for the bird .
they do not know how to properly approach the eagle .
the eagle is very picky about people .
it demands respect and courage .
anyhow , she will have to get married at one point or another .
nurgiv :
it 's all we 've ever known .
woman :
good morning , dear radio listeners .
nurgaiv :
narrator :
as their relationship deepens , the eagle learns to listen for her call .
as they start to work as a team , the response times improve .
woman :
as the festival draws near , the xcitement builds across the region .
let 's go .
probably the most important part of the festival .
with calling the judges look at horse rding style eagle 's landing and eagle flying style .
this process is timed and every second counts .
okay .
nurgaiv :
do n't hurry .
eat slowly .
you might not be able to fly if you eat too much .
if you do not mind .
mostly older men .
almagul :
i 'm worried for her .
this is her first festival .
be the head of this home while i am away , okay ?
all i wish for is her safety and wellbeing .
is this okay ?
not too tight ?
nurgaiv :
almagul :
we should have cut it shorter .
all the best , stay safe !
narrator :
let 's let the horses drink .
nah 
around 70 eagle huntrs from all over the region are currently making their way to the festival ground .
oh .
there it is .
narrator :
for years , proud men have brought their eagls here to preserve tradition and battl for the title of champion eagle hunter .
no girl has ever competed in the history of this festival .
and aisholpan is arriving unannounced .
male emcee 
peac be with you , dear festival participants .
man :
male emcee :
man 4 :
nurgaiv :
they are the ones wh have cared for eagles passed down to us from our great ancestors .
next is ardak son of a famed eagle hnter from altai .
great !
next , we have an eagle hunter from altai .
who is next you say ?
come her .
nurgaiv :
yu are awesome .
nurgaiv :
awesme .
that was good .
announcer :
an animal skn trget attracts the eagles nd we measure their sped .
nurgaiv :
nurgaiv :
it can get scared and run into the crowd of people .
nurgaiv :
nurgaiv :
really nice !
n the name of god .
man 2 :
not everyone who hs an eagle at home is a real eagle hunter .
more to come .
speed and skill are the most important part of this event .
male emcee :
who 's next ?
we worry that our birds may not land in our hands when we call them in front of a crowd .
why do n't you run and get it !
wh 's next ?
do n't worry .
announcer :
really nice !
where 's my dad ?
yes , he 's already up there .
man 2 :
whose bird is that ?
aisholpan 's .
a lady .
women are supposed to stay indoors and quarrel fr gifts after parties while men are meant for the outdoors , and we quarrel for the catch .
i was worried of cours .
announcer :
nurgaiv :
everyone saw it , bth the audience and the judgs .
she managed to catch th bird in her hand in only five seconds .
that requires unique talent .
my hands are trembling .
funny feeling !
dad !
come here , my daughter .
announcer :
eagle hunters , please come forward .
today 's event was special because a little girl participated in this celebration .
please make some space .
therefore , let me start with the third place .
second place , orazkhan .
dear people , please listen .
man 2 :
i was so happy .
there will be snow , storms , etc .
it is tough .
she w n't endure .
if she can g eagle hunting in wintr then she is a tre eagle hunter .
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
but first , they stop off for guidance at the home of a master eagle hunter in a remote village close to the mongolian border with china .
but the kid is strong .
aisholpan :
he 's like my uncle .
there are  lot of lessons to be learnt here .
bt the land is slippery the winter began harshly .
bt the kid has to be alert .
we will always worry for our children .
nurgaiv :
are we ready nw ?
dalaikhan :
what a baby sees in the nest , it then repeats when it grows up .
turn here 
narrator :
she will now attempt the final step on the path to full eagle hunter status .
nurgaiv :
look at this .
the whole steppe is blanketed in snow !
nurgaiv :
there 's little comfort in these bitterly cold conditions .
it 's not unheard of for horss t slip and fall off the side of a cliff .
nurgaiv :
the stones the cliffs , the snow .
it 's time to find some fox tracks .
they are determined to repeat the process until she proves herself a master eagle huntress .
come closer .
it 's slippery here .
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
ther it is !
time to mve it !
here it is !
you head that way !
nurgaiv :
the eagle hunter finds the highest place with the best view .
eagles make mistakes the first time they hunt .
aisholpan :
wre you afraid , my dear ?
nurgaiv :
you shoot up that mountain over there .
the hunter and chaser work as a team .
aisholpan :
nurgaiv :
it can easily jump from one to another .
the fox is a very sly animal .
not in a hurry to give up its life .
turn it around !
he wo n't budge !
keep going .
follow in my footsteps .
okay , my child !
yes .
let go .
you did very well for your first time .
you 're very brave .
you get to carry home your first catch and mom can make it into a warm fur coat for you .
aisholpan :
nurgaiv :
she 'll be thrilled .
are you happy now ?

pour  oh pour , the pirate sherry
yes , frederic .
my friends , i thank you all from my heart for your kind wishes .
would tht i could repay them as they deserve .
i leave you forever .
yes , i did my best for you 
and why ?
oh .
it was through an error .
no matter .
ruth ?
nay , dear mster , my mind has long been gnawed by the cankering tooth of mystery .
when frederic was a little lad
to tke and bind the promising boy
a life not bad for a hardy lad
though surely not a high lot
i was a stupid nursery maid
a sad mistke it was to make
i bound him to a pirate , you
individually , i lov you all with affection unspeakable .
i look upon you wth a disgust that amounts to absolute detestation .
oh , pity me , beloved friends .
no , no , no , no , frederic .
aye !
well , of course not !
and know what it is like !
and what is the consequence ?
everyne we capture says he 's an orphan !
frederic , you would n't have us absolutely merciless ?
oh , was ever  man placed in so delicte a stuation .
frederic .
but i 've been constantly at sea since i was eight years old .
i think it is a sweet face .
i just may be mistaken .
excuse me .
what a trrible thing it would be if i were to marry this innocnt person , to find out that she is , on the whole plain .
plain ?
oh , ruth 
well ...

there are th remains of a fine woman about ruth .
oh .
no !

we are rough men !
not one !
i thought there was n't .
well , it 's the top of the tide and we must be off ourselves .
hoist the mainsail .
hist the jibsal .
frederic !
and when your process of extermination begins , let our deaths be as swift and painless
as you can conveniently make them .
i do n't think much of our profession .
than play a sanctmonious part
with a pirate head and a pirate heart
away to the cheating world go you
and it is , it is a glorious thing to be a pirate king

my love unabating
forty-seven years
forty-seven years
so !

climbing over rocky muntain
passing where the willows qiver
by the ver rolling river
swollen with the summer rain , the summer rain
climb the hardy little lassies
let us gaily tread the measure
make the most f fleeting leisure
hail it as a true ally
as they fly
make the most of fleeting leisure
though it perish by-and-by
let us gaily tread the measure
except for the mermaids , it 's the very place for mermids .
and who ca n't be said strictly to set foot anywhere .
i 'm going to take off my stocking .
stop , ladies , pray
a man !
but under these pecliar circumstances
i feel it is my bounden duty to inform yu
a pirate !
horror !
oh , blushing buds of ver-blooming beauty
how pitiful his tale
how pitiful his tale
oh , is there not one maiden breast
which does not feel the moral beauty
of making worldly interest
subordinate to sense of duty ?
all matrimonal ambition
to rescue such a one as i
from his unfortunte
oh , is there not one miden here
whose homely face and bad complxion
i swear by heaven 's arch above you
if you will cast your eyes on me
however plain you be
i 'll love you
however plain you be
i 'll love
you !
i 'll love you
alas !
oh , mabel !
it 's true that he has gone astray but pray
the question is had he not been a thing of beauty
for shame
poor wandering one

man your women .
hello .
here 's a frst-rate opportunity
to get married wth impunity
you shall quickly be parsonified
by a doctor of divinity who is located in this vicinty
of escaping with impunity
so farewell to the felicity of our maiden domesticity
hold , monsters
ere your pirate caravanserai
and father is a major-general
yes , yes , i am a majorgeneral
he is !
hurrah for the major-general
to be a major-general
i am the very model of a modern major-general
i 'm very well acquainted , too , with matters mathematical
i understand equations , both the simple and quadratical
i 'm very good at integral and dfferential calculus
in short , in matters vegetable , animal , and mineral
in fact , when i know what is meant
by mamelon and ravelin
when such affairs as sorties and surprises i 'm more wary at
and when i know precisely what is meant by commissariat
when i have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
when i know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy
strategy ?
oh , my word .
wait a minute .
cup of tea .
has only ben brought down to the beginning of the century
but stll , in matters vegetable , animal , and mineral
encore !
can you do it one more time ?
and can you do it really fast ?
in fact , when i know what is meant by mamelon and ravelin
when i hve learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy
oh , you must n't do that !
ooh !
what are you ?
i gather that .
nything else ?
no , nothing else .
we object to major-generals as fathers-in-law .
but we waive that point .
do you mean t say you would rob me of these , the sole remaining props of my old age ?
to them , lads .
one moment .
oh , dash it !
i ask you have you ever known what it is to be an orphan ?
often !
yes , orphn .
i say , often .
often , often , often .
i tell you , hang on a minute .
now , listen , i do n't think we quite understand one another .
i only repeated it once .
ooh !
now , when you say orphan ,
frequently .
seize that man !
an orphan boy ?
these children whom you see
poor fellow
se , at our feet they kneel
our hearts we can not steel
orphan boy
indulged in an innocent fiction
which is not in the sme category as tlling a regular terrible story
which will tend to diminish his glory
it is easy , in elegant diction
to call it n innocent fiction
but it comes in the sam category
it 's easy , in elegant diction
although our dark career
we rather think that we 're
we 're always sorry to begin it
for what , we ask
is life
without a touch
hail , poetry
thou heaven-born maid
thou gildst even
all hail
emollient !
you may go , for you 're at liberty
and honorary members of our band
we do elect you
he is !
hurrah for the orphan boy
oh , happy day , with joyous glee
our sisters all will bridesmaids be
they will away and marrid be
should it befall auspiciously
that dews that martial cheek
in them thy cmfort seek
their father weep
what ?
ca n't you cheer him up ?
well , be comforted , sir .
i tell you  frederic , such is the anguish nd remorse i feel at the abominable falsehood by which i escaped these easily deluded pirates  that i would go to their smple-minded chief this very night nd confess all .
but did i not feel that the consequnces wuld be oh , oh , oh , no , oh , no , no , most disastrous , most disastrous to myself .
at 11:00 .
be smmoned to receive a general 's blessing
tarantara , tarantara
and we find the wisest thing
for when threatened with emutes
tarantara , tarantara
there is nothing brings it round
like the trumpt 's martial sound
tarantara , tarantara
go , ye heroes , go to glory
though ye die in combat gory
go to immortality
with her tears your grave shall water
these attentions are well meant
tarantara
calculated men to cheer
in  highly nervous state
and before all links , we sever
we will say farewell forever
all in vain their mercy crave
we observe too great a stress
on the risks that on us prss
to our chance of coming back
still perhaps it would be wise
not to carp or criticize
wait !
back !
when the foeman bares his steel go , ye heroes
oh , we uncomfortable feel though ye die
tarantara in combat gory
tarantara cornish daughter
lke the trumpet 's martial sund go , ye heroes
tarantra , tarantara go , ye heroes

oh , mad intruders
how dare ye face me ?
know ye not , oh , rash ones
have mercy on us hav mercy on us
hear us , r you slaghter
yet , mercy should ally our stern resentment
we tried to raise our spirits faint
but all in vain the quips we heard
oh .
until to somebody occurred
a startling paradox
a most ingenious paradox
the paradox
to which , however , i 've no desir to be disloyal
who ?
i do n't know who
very likely the astronomer royal
has decided that
if t were wing to the agency of an ill-natured fairy
you 'll easily discover
that though you 've lived 21 years
yet , if we go by birthdays
you 're only five and a little bit over
let 's see !
five and a quarter , oh , that 's rch !
t common sense she gaily mocks
years 21 i 've been alive
yet , reckoning by my natal day
a paradox , a paradox
a curious paradox
a most ingenious paradox !
most absurdly whimsical .
five-and-a-quarter , eh ?
you wuld n't think it to look at me .
i 'm afraid you do n't appreciate the delicacy of your position .
you wre apprenticed to us .
no , no  no , no , no , no , no , no , no 
oh .
and going by birthdays , you are as yet only five-and-a-quarter .
and at any price
i will do my duty .
you 're one of us onc more .
that 's the ship .
i wll tell her i am bound by duty and my moral senses
so it really does n't matter , matter , matter , matter , matter !
i should show you in a moment how to grappl with the question
full of excellent suggestions when i feel a littl better
what we sing does n't matter what we sing does n't matter
no , it rally does n't matter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
if i had been so lucky as to have a steady mother
and i mght have lived nd died a very decent indiwiddle
if it is , it does n't matter if it is , it dos n't matter
mattr , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
oh , horror !
what 's the matter ?
oh , yes  h did .
it breaks my heart to betray the honored father of the girl i dore .
break it .
and yet , as your apprentice , i have no alternative .
... that general stanley ...
well , he is no ...
you man , orphan , a person that has lst his parents or often , frequently ?
 person that has lost his parents .
what ?
what ?
oh .
he never was one !
am i to understand that in order to save
we will go and collect our band and attack tremorden castle this very night .
not a word !
i burn , this base deception to repay
ere i expre
it strikes me to the core !
and , in return , tonight the traitor dies
yes , yes !
tonight he dies
yes , or early tomorrow
they wll welter in sorrow
to abuse it shall perish
away , away !
away !
tonight the traitor dies !
nay , mabel , nay !
stay , frederic , stay 
i must obey

even after
oh , here is love
her 's love
no , i am brave
come one and all , undaunted men in blue
whn the danger 's near
we manage to apper
as insensible t fear
young frederic was to have led you to death and glory
he will not so lead you
for he has allied himself once more
with his old ssociates
you speak falsely
he has acted nobly
his hroc sacrifice to his sens of duty
he has done his duty , i will do mine
we must d our best to capture thes pirates alone .
it is most distressing to us t be the agents
whereby our erring fellow-creatres
are deprved of that liberty
when a felon 's not engaged in his employmnt
or matring his felonious little plans
is just as great as any honest man 's
when cnstabulary duty 's to be done
to be done
ah , take one consideration with another
a policeman 's lot is nt a happy one
to be done
a policman 's lot is not a happy one
a rollicking band of pirates we
are trying their hand t a burglary
with weapons grim and gory
with stealthy steps the pirates are approaching
we are not coming for plate or gold
for generl stanley 's story
they seek a penalty fifty-fold !
thy seek a penalty fifty-fold
for general stanley 's story
silence !
go on .
upon our prey we steal
our cautious way we feel
we never speak a word
tarantara , tarantara
while all the household soundly sleeps
come , friends  who plough the sea
let 's vary piracy
take another station
with a little burglary
and your skeletonic keys
tarantara
with catlike tread tarantara
in silence dread
in silence dread
truce to navigation
let 's vary piracy
with cat-like tread
upon our prey we steal
truce to navigation
take another station
let 's vry piracy
with a little burglary
upon our prey we steal
hush , hush !

the major-general comes
so , qickly hide
yes , yes !
the major-general comes
i lay upon my sleepless bed
no peace at all enjoys
n dale , on hill
my mind is set at ease
setting nature all a-quiver
laughs for very love
may thy wooing happy be
heaven speed thee , poplar tree
brook and poplar mourn a lover
sighing , well-a-day !
ah , the doing and undoing
who can wo so well 
nobody can woo so well
sad the lot of poplar trees

and why does father leave his rest
t such a time of night !
forward , my mn , and seize that general there !
oh , joy !
oh , rapture !
frederic , save us !
beautiful mabel , i would if i could , but i am not able
revenge is sweet
with courage rare
and resolution mnly
unshriven , unannealed ?

yes , we are here , though hitherto conceald
to them , lads !
charge !

most politely
now give three cheers
hurrah !
to gain a brief dvantage you 've contrived
we charge , you yield
we charge , you yield
we do !
n queen

because with all our faults
we love
with all their faults
they love their queen
and place them at the bar
one moment !
they are no members of the common throng
they are all noblemen
no nglishmn unmoved that statement hears
we love
i pray you , pardon me , expirate king
peers will be peers , and youth wll have its fling
combined i need n't say with the unparalleled felicity
of what we have been longing for
unbounded domesticity
hymeneally coupled , conjugally matrimonified
and this shall be accomplished by the doctor of divinity
who happily resides in the immediate vicinity
who happily resides in the immediate vicinity
but still in getting off my daughters
but still in getting off his daughters
eight or nine or ten in all
poor wandering ones
though ye have surely strayed
poor wandering ones
take any heart

did he happen to mention any particular city ?
like london ?
paris ?
omaha ?
n , sir .
i did n't know h could even spell amortization.
gloria ?
jeanie ?
mr. ryder , i think there 's something you ought to know .

i did n't find out till later ...
it was n't quebec .
palm bach .
mirador ?
well , that 's where my uncle always stays .
with him being youruncle , his reptation and all ,

sit down , wo n't you .
you see , i was on duty early saturday morning .
when i got halfway down the corridor ,
m ?
wearing a turkish towel ?
no ?
i tried .
but she beat me to the elevtor and gt away .
when i got back , your uncle 's room , the place was all a shambles .
dead .
no , no , sir .
only the manager .
he thought it would be betterfor everybody if we jst kept this quiet .
did yo ever see this girl before ?
no , sir .
it 's an earring i found on the floor nearthe bed .
good .
i have a hunch this girl 's gon na show up , and  want yu to identify her .
oh , it 'd be a pleasure .
research .
these are very intresting figures , tony .
we 'd like to talk to you ..
he was a more remarkable man than you think 
sam , you were the colonel 's oldest friend 
nevr .
the minute we paid her off .
it ought t .
that young woman has us over  barrel .
i can see the headlines :
founder offamily magazine dies in love nest with a nakd nymph.
and a smile on his face .
what are we going to do ?
where ?
where 's a better place to show the world how much she 's gon na miss the colonel ?
so we will know thursday .
the bank committee meets wednesday .
w 'll have the funeral tuesday .
thatstomorrow 
what about all the preparations ?
what made you ask that ?
just my feminine sense of greed .
what 's that ?
i have n't met him yet .
guess who this is .
you ought to see a doctor .
but , honey , i am a doctor .
how was florida ?
oh , it ws all right .
but i 'm glad i 'm back .
oh , yourfolks are in town ?
oh , well , that makes me fel better .
how about the four of us getting together , say , wednesday night ?
oh , that 's fine .
fine .
goodbye , dar .
bye .
i do n't know why you even went to florida 
deserve him 
you 're on the barganing committee .
oh , no , harry .
union-wise , you 're in the big time .
now , do n't be upset if i do some table-pounding .
but i am worried .
the union committee is here .
joe kowalski .
absolutely ridiculous .
seems pretty reasonable .
it seems reasonable on the surface .
but can management live with it ?
that 's not an answer , it 's an ultimatum .
i said that .
what do you think , miss ?
research ?
where is it ?
i was just saying the other day in health and welfare , we rally should ...
yes , two b 's .
miss robbns , we 've got a very important agenda here .
when it comesto fringe benefits , i d say the union 's getting all the benefits and management 's left holding the fringe .
well pt .
look , if you do n't wan na negotiate , we 're walking out .
h , just a minute .
i have a better idea .
now  a subcommittee oftwo is an excellent suggestion , but any feelingout process should logically take place between members fthis group who have n't displayed antagonism towards one anothr .
now , you do n't feel antagonistic towards me , do you , miss robbins ?
good .
nor i towrds you .
so it seems logical that you and i should meet .
no use wasting valuable working hours .
meeting adjourned .
oh , i ...
do n't take them .
it must be that bathing sit i bought in palm beach .
they were having a sale at this little place ...
this is n't my coat !
ryder building , new york , new yrk.
i guess it is my cat , is n't it .
marge .
just give me the chance .
well , it 's to important a stp to just rush into like that .
health and welfare found me a nice motel nearthe beach .
it was 7 dollars a dy , including a continntal breakfast .
but i was n't interested in that kind oftraveler 's aid .
that eliminated just about everything that 's any fun .
there i was , trespassing in the garden of an exclusive hotel , pretending to be one ofthe elite .
with all th romance around me , there i was with my partner , a very romantic sort of fellow .
full of air .
help !
he seemd to be drowning .
and i was wearing my flowerd chiffon that cost me two whole months without dessert .
help !
i realized at once tht poor mr. hackett had been drinking .
that was his name , kirby hackett , ofhackett industries .
so i decided to help him up to his room .
as long as he was sound asleep , i decided to get dried off .
that was my third mistake .
mr. hacktt had been playing possum .
please , i 'm not dressed !
mr. hackett !
i went thrugh some curtains .
there was a man in bed .
frank sintra .
oh , marge .
our colonel ryder ?
yes .
oh , i 'm perfectly willing to listen t the other half .
mr. hackett !
bright and early the next morning ,
i got a phone call .
it was mr. hackett .
because i do n't deserve it .
oh , marge .
i refuse to be bligated to  man who practically drowns himself just to gt me up to his room .
okay , okay , now , what about colonel ryder ?
now , you get to the pension plan before you finish yourfruit salad .
important .
yes , harry .
seniority rights , roast duck .
yes , harry .
yes .
stand pat .
thank you .
penny forpenny .
i may have to get ahold of you in a hurry sme night .
463 east 76th .
if yur uncle had n't been colnel ryder , what do you think you 'd be doing now ?
playing golf , i guess .
i started just one step blow .
i had the experience , but i had to keep proving to the ryders .
if you 're a relative , you 're supposed to be an idiot .
seniority rights ...
excuse me .
senority rights 
an old man is like an old car .
your spark plugs were stuck .
you do nt just throw an old man on the scrapheap forthat .
and then you give him another chance .
seniority rights , fringe benefits and pension plan 
what do you sy we take the rest ofthe afternoon off .
why did you pick on me to do the negotiating 
but you see , i 'm in reserch , mr. ryder , and i 've been doing quite a bit of research on you .
and i 'm afraid i 'm not yourtype at all .
you 're a good researcher , bt do n't belive everything you read .
well , i would like to do some shopping .
okay .
just what i had in mind .
why do n't you use my car .
and i 'll drop off at the club , take a cold shower .
yes , thank you .
just one moment .
but when i opened the box , i discovred it was n't the bthing suit i bought n sale in palm beach 
yes .
yes .
there seems to be a problem with this lady 's coat .
isthere something wrong with the coat ?
oh , no , not at all .
oh , yes 
oh , but there is a mstake .
i se .
it 's already paid for .
i have n't done anything to earn it 
oh ,  mean , all i dd wastake him up to his room and put him to ...
well , i did .
will you tell mr. hackett  returned the cot ?
i do n't care ifhe went to devil 's island in a canoe .
how much is the coat ?
eleven thousand dollars .
are you sure you would n't like to think this over ?
i 'm in no hurry if you 're not .
there 's another 5 .
overtime .
oh , no  not miss robbins .
thank you .
i wish somebody would test my principles .
as long as you keep out of chinese rstaurants .
pardon me .
oh , wonderful .
oh , marge , that was just his business sense .
are we talking about the same colonel ryder ?
but talk abut rw emotion !
i 've been looking for you .
forwhat ?
union 's got three sets .
you 're one ofthem 
oh , harry , i could n't possibly .
it 's not just tears .
i mean , i cry .
at fnerals ?
sh better stay away from my funeral .
the great man that we have gathered to honortoday vlunteered once more for military duty .
and in six months ofhard , grinding toil , he brought chaos ...
and that christmas , i may now reveal , not a single dough boy in the front lines not one had to do without a slice ofmm 's fruit cake .
onc i even cried at an auto show .
you go n , harry .
that 's our girl .
you recognize her ?
ven with her clothes on .
she 's our blackmailer .
they never are .
there 's no use arguing .
i 'm going straight upstairs and apologize to mr. ryder .
cased blackmailer 's apartment .
you mean you were spying on her ?
washed hair .
washed dishes .
better get down to work .
i still ca n't believe she did it .
oh , no .
gentlemen , i 'd say miss robbins had us over  barrel .
are we sure this isthe girl we 're looking for ?
of course we are .
lasker identified her , did n't h ?
mr. ryder ...
and i say that a person is innocent until proven guilty .
how do we know she 's guilty ?

of christopher 's childhood days
tbby little cubby all stuffed with fluff
he 's winnie the pooh winnie the pooh
chaptr one , in which winnie the pooh has a very important thing to do .
uh , pooh ?
more honey  please .
pooh !
oh , bother .
yes , but it 's time to wake p .
well , if i told you that ,
what could be more important than a little smething to at ?
i always know what to do .
a pooh bear takes care of his tummy
i 'm hearing your ravenous plea
when there is no honey the pooh takes the tummy
wherever the honey will be
and they will take care of my tummy and me
bother .
good idea , tummy .
the very tree where i was hatched .
chapter one , the birth of a genius .
pardn me , owl .
what are you doing ?
oh , hello , pooh .
eeyore .
why , i 'm penning my personal memoirs .
... and i rocketed towards eeyore 's tail !
eeyore 's tail ?
what 's wrong with eeyore 's tail ?
oh , thank you , pooh .
now , the customary procedure in such cases is as follows .
for i am a bear of very little bran and lng words bother me .
it means the thing to do .
h .
well , you sneezed just as you were going to tell m what the first thing to do was .
i did n't sneeze .
no , you did , owl .
you ca n't sneeze without knowing it .
first , issue a reward .
h 's doing it again .
no , no , no !
the word is issue , not achoo , and achoo is n't even a word .
it 's just a sort of sneezy sound like achoo !
now , we shall get christopher robin to write out the notices , and we 'll put them up all over the forest .
here you are , pooh .
oh , and make sure everyone can see them .
it 's time to gather 'round the work has just begun
that you have had some fun
very important thing to do
perhaps you 'd lik to join us ?
he 's lost his tail .
this guy ... and i 'm talking to you he was sneaking up on ya .
get back here !
come here .
yes , my good man ?
why , you .
what is this ?
oh , really ?
this is n't working out the way i was hoping .
make him go away .
get him off of me !
is he still there ?
wht ?
look at the chin on this kid .
no , no .
i ca nt do it , i tell you .
something tragic has befallen a member of our community .
exhibit a .
oh !
oh , dear .
i do say , christopher robin , the winners of such contest are traditionally awardd some form of remuneration .
oh , gracious , no .
h , christpher robin , i was hoping for something a bit ... sweeter ?
why , pooh , that 's a grand idea .
a pot of honey .
pooh ralized that a pin cone would not wn him th honey .
special , you say .
no hurry , pooh .
take my time .
what a wonderful idea .
thanks , pooh .
now it 's on my rear end
you get the honey enjoy
well , ruls are rules .
excuse me .
whoa !
how clever , piglet .
takes the prize fair and square
it 's ok .
it 's kanga
oh , bother .
my tummy is feeling a little 11 o'clock-ish .
do you still tell the tim , clock friend ?
i ca n't tell by the expresson on your fce .
in fact , he was so distracted by his rumbly tummy  that he did n't notice that he was walking onto the next paragraph .
s there honey in this paragraph ?
wll , then i do n't find it very useful .
eeyore  your tail !
all good things come to an end .
ooh !
of course .
christopher robin will have some honey .
oh .
certainly .
just there , at your feet .
uh , to your left .
a tad .
no , no , back a bit .
h !
there you are .
therwise , i would n't have seen it .
so , pooh decided to go directly to owl 's house , hoping that owl could help unpzzle him .
t-a-e-l .
yes .
perfect .
that is a very fine looking pot of honey y 've got there .
that happens to be my personal favourite .
oh .
yes , but especially not the strange ones .
let me see .
here , pooh , help yourself .
what does it say ?
busy .
by a creatre called th backson .
what 's a backson ?
and worst of all , terribly busy 
so , what does this backson look like ?
oh , christopher robin .
that does n't make sense .
can you draw it ?
artistic talent runs through my family .
in fact , it practically stampedes !
oh , dear !
with two sharp horns atop its head
its toes ar black , its fur is blue
i swear that all i tell you is not made up
the backson the backsn ?
the backson the backson ?
but , owl , what does a backson do ?
yes , owl , what does a backson do ?
hmm , what does a bckson do ?
they sneak into your library and scribble in all your books
the backson , the backson we 're afraid of the backson
the backson 's the one who 's been putting holes in our socks
tell us more about what bcksons d
yes , more about wht backsons do more about wht backsons do ?
maybe they make you sleep too lat
i bet they 're the reason my tail is gone
you 're on a roll go on , go on
they make you feel as smll as a mouse
they eat your snacks they wo n't relax
oh , no
i know exactly what to do
like books and dishes
and socks and toys
the backson the backson
so to the death , we 'll persevere
sounds like backson 
oh , well .
while rabbit and the others were busy gathering the backson 's favourite things ,
and pooh supervised .
and now to disguise the pit .
catch , piglet .
which is just the pit , of course .
and when he falls in , we 'll get christopher robin back .
yes , piglet .
what do you think , pooh ?
hmm .
here ?
oh , piglet , this is a very light lunch .
well done , you two .
the fate of christopher robin is in our hands .

as the group continued on with rabbit 's plan , they jorneyed deeper and deper into the woods ,
you want to keep it down up there , pal ?

something tells me i was better off with tigger .
heave-ho !
oh  dear !
wait for me .
but the backson !
ok , piglet , go look for something to get us out of here .
i was worried we 'd be stuck here forever .
here .
ooh .
yeah , i thought so , too .
yes , piglet , it 's very nice , a perennial .
but  think we need something longer .
oh , yes , it is .
it lags a bit in the middle .
of all things , why did n't we think to bring a rope ?
well , there is this rope .
spot-on , piglet .
do be a helpful little swine and get us out of here .
all right .
three , four ...
do n't forget rabbit .
tie them together , piglet .
i can not .
so , you can knot 
pooh !
no !
nt possible .
oh , dear !
but there is something i can do .
christopher robin has a jump rope .
wait a minute .
my gracious , that 's it !
yes , piglet , go , and bring some honey .
go forth , piglet , and we shall await your return .
for weeks , if necessary .
what ?
moved me to tars .
but the further he went , the more frightened he became 
oh , dear .
i am the help .
it was n't the backson , was it ?
huh 
backson ?
piglet , help !
whew .

backson !
oh !

which leaves plenty of tim for me to continu my memoirs .
fr only the finest parchment ...
hmm .
it drove my poor uncle absolutely batty , which is quite a feat for an owl , i assure you .
empty .
... and let me tell you , it packed quite a wallop .
look , the letters 
and so they all used the letter ladder to climb out of the pit .
well done .
he wakes up babes !
yes , and we thought he took you from s .
ooh .
m ...
you 're right , piglet .
this rward goes to a good frind and a loyal companion .
so it is with great , great honour and a hmble heart , that i bestow this pt of honey pon our dear friend b'loon .
wonderful idea , rabbit .
thank you , b'lon .
goodbye .
hory !
oh , bother .
yep .
i know hw you feel .
oh , yes .
i simply must find some honey .
as pooh continued searching , he got hungrier ...
yes , tummy , i know .
for what ?
perhaps i could borrow some hony ?
just a taste ?
my boy , i shll do better than that .
not only will i beckon you to my table , but as we feast , i shall treat you to n xcerpt from chapter 127 , which tells the gripping tale of how only a few days ago ,
i found that very handsome bell rope that you were admiring just hanging over a thistle bush .
thistle bush ?
or was it a gorse bush ?
and then the thing just fell off in my hand .
that 's it .
oh , dear .

easytobeaman

hello ?
~subtitle by joshua romel ladrera~
this is the story of the dy my life ended .
i 'm kidding !
veryone dying to catch a glimpse of me..
i meant us .
well ...
we are gathred here today to celebrate the joining of rapunzel and egene in marriage .
in everlasting peac .
may i have the rings ?
had their loops in the love and friendship .
frying pan .
release the ducks .
that 's the ducks , release the lanterns .
happy birthday !
so , who want a piece of cake ?
is there a reason you 're calling first thng in the morning ?
he 's dead .
who ?
cut the crap .
takayama ryuji , kill himself ?
or it might be something else .
it looks like they 're gon na have to do a little more investigating .
sudden death .
it 's takayama ryuji .
you plug the numbers into this chart and then se the resulting abbreviation .
rippr .
takayama 
ripper ...
there 's arterial blockage .
direct cause of death is heart attack brought on by blckage of the left pulmonary artery .
andou !
there was something strange in his stomach .
he would appear to have been something of a ...
trange man , would n't you agree ?
his ex-wife  asakawa reiko .
that boy in the picture is their son .
but after that she returned hme and retrievd her son .
and one of the amblance crew saw her with a videotape takn from mr. takyama 's aprtment .
but the first person to find his body was mr. takayama 's girlfriend .
she 's a glomy one , though .
our qestioning is n't going anywhere ...
this is dr. andou , who was n charge of th autopsy .
to the doctor , this time .
where , i wondr ?
tell us what you can recall .
i do n't know anything .
please answer the question .
i do n't know anythng .
i really do n't .
tell us what you know .
you knew that takayama ryuji was meeting with his ex-wife , did n't you ?
just a ...
before he died ...
dr. takayama was investigating something with reiko .
investigating what ?
a videotape .
whoever watches it dies .
whoever watches it dies ?
yes .
that 's simply not possible .
mr. andou ?
yeah .
it was amazing .
he knew , did nt he ?
that you and i would meet like this .
why ?
this is stupid .
profssor ?
professor !
hey !
a tumor ?
but ... this is nt malignant 
i could n't find anything like it .
there 's no way .
the smallpox virus was radicated ages ago .
what about takayam 's girlfriend ?
she told me something a lot crazier than a virus .
you best tell me .
a videotape ?
yeah .
it s the police .
they were in an automobile accident .
luckily , the driver came way with only minor injuries .
we were just now able to remove the bodies .
though they 'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we contacted thm ...
but there 's something a little strange .
what are yu ding !
sorry .
i was asakawa 's senior co-workr .
vcr ?
h went to sleep already 
i 'm just gon n check on him .
 'm sorry .
i woke you up .
what is it ?
the child died , too ?
yeah , but he did n't di because of the accident .
he was already dead .
ther son saw the video too , did n't he ?
this has nothing to do with a video .
we know what exactly what caused his death .
what did he say ?
leving his dna in this world ?
mr. andou .
he ... saw something .
that mous is glowing !
so it 's alredy progressed this fr ...
that 's amazing .
do you remember me ?
yes 
i 'm yshino from nnb broadcasting .
is there something i can help yu with ?
what s that ?
record ?
four people died of a heart attack at exactly the same time .
i now know that ne week earlier , the four of them had watched a videotape at a ldge n izu .
she watched it , and was sure that she too would die one week later .
thus , aided by takayama ryuji , she began her investigations , trying to uncover everything she could about the videotape .
sadako 's mother , yamamura shizuko , was reportedly clairvoyant , which had the press all up in arms .
sadako was killed by her father .
sadako had the power to lay a curse on somene , and to kill them with it .
let me tll you about asakawa .
he killed himself .
he 'd written will .
it said :
do n't worry .
this is yamamura sadako .
please , feel free to watch it if you like .
do n't you think ?
present ...
sadako !
sadako 
forgive me sadako .
you were were never meant to be born into this world .
sadako !
you ca n't reprt this to the public at all .
that video ... it 's the embodiment of sadako 's hatred .
d you realize what you 're saying ?
i gave it to you already .
video ...
now wait just a mnute !
give me that tape !
we are through talking .
will you please let go of m ?
lke you you 're about to die or something .
yah ...
you want me to inject you with some of that protein from the glowing jellyfish 
the administrative autopsy was carried out in yokohama .
what 's more , the cause of the attacks was a tumor in their bloodstream .
oh ...
but i do n't get it .
if it is a virus , why did n't asakawa reiko also die from a heart attack ?
bcause the cause of death is n't a virus .
a crse .
gm me a break .
to wipe that video off the face of this world .
he thought that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan 
he 's trying to get me destroy that video in exchnge for granting my wish 
and what is your wish mr. andou ?
about what ?
that 's not what dr. takayama wanted .
what else cold it be ?
dr. andou .
you have a phone cll , from  reporter named mr. yoshino .
the well that sadako fell into ... by chance , is thre a chunk missing out of one side ?
you watched the video ?
to hell with this , all of it .
i 'm givng you the video .
i have n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appears in my dreams .
i just want to hurry up and forget all abut this .
mr. yoshino ?
mr. andou ?
do n't lok .
let 's go .
it 's over now .
i 've put an end to yamamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm this video 's last victim .
you 've thought about dying many times over .
nor is regretting that you watched the video .
that i let my son die ?
just a little .
h was the only person that i could be with .
so i guess i ca n't lie to you .
it 's just like you sid .
i 'm scared of dying .
why did  watch that video ?
is n't it painful ?
knowing how i feel ?
there were times when i thought t was just an excuse 
bt he meant it .
nobody knows what 's going to happen to thm .
not me .
never seen anything like it , have you ?
i think h 'll turn up symptoms of the virus as well .
his cause of death was different ...
well , it 's interesting !
the data is then restructured inside the body , creating a virus .
that could be it !
think a moment .
she saw the video too , did n't she ?
yu 're not makng a whole lot of sense .
listen to me .
when i watched the video , sadako 's memories entered my body 
i saw a hospital in the woods .
now you talk a hospital in izu from around that timeframe , what does that make you think of ?
tuberculosis ?
mai !
whre the hell did she go ?
take a look .
it 's mutated .
what ?
they 're saying that the family wants to talk to yo about how to proceed with the death certificate .
probably .
i 'll catch up with you later .
mr. maekawa !
i have nevr had a case like this before .
it ca n't be .
they appear to have found evidnce indicating that she gave birth .
yes .
the building 's air vent ... it looked just lke a well .
yamamura sadako 's well ...
does it by chance have a chunk missing out of one side ?
but he still got infected with the virus .
why do you think that is ?
it 's asakawa reiko 's notebook .
the color of the well , the way it looks .
it 's like i 'm actually there .
but that does nt mean that evryone dies .
there 's a way to save yourself .
a way to save yourself ?
just reading it is enough to infect the reader with the virus .
she became yamamura sadako 's helper .
what did yu do ?
i ...
you 're the only survvor .
liar !
give me back that notebook .
nto mai 's womb .
why did you have to kill mai ?
mai is n't dead .
all of mai 's memories are insid of me .
you ar sadako .
not mai .
i wanted to help yu .
what the hell do you know ?
you killed mai !
ma .
forgive me , mai .
i forgive you mr. andou .
know what ?
stop it , please !
sadako !
meeting him was what allowed me to come back .
that 's why i was able to be reborn 
that 's impossible .
so this time ,  want to help him .
we can do it if i use my womb ...
no .
there 's no way .
do this for me , and i can grant your wish too .
takayama !
then , return it to my womb .
the memories prior to death remain in the dna itself .
if yo use one of my fertilized ggs , it should mature to the same age as when the person died within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones to quicken the rate of cellular division .
once this is put back into takano mai s womb , we 're ll finished .
you look terrible .
we traitors , are n't we ?
but who have we betrayed ?
what 'd you think of my present ?
he is my brother , after all .
and the peopl who read it ...
the virus will develop inside their bodies .
what will the world become because of the virus ?
there will be more and more people like sdako .
this virus will cause a change in humanity itself .
and now it 's time for that evolution to proceed to the next levl .
the world will change .
we have been dragged inside that vortex of change .
stay away from takanori .
just keep away .
is n't that right ?
let go of me .
goodbye .
takayama , do n't want yor own child back ?
i could n't do such a terrible thing .
i could n't bring a child back into this world .
andou ... it will be a lng , long time before there is peace again in this world .

sorry to give you so many , but you do have six bedrooms .

hlt !
please do n't touch anything .
how should i know you is a british fficer ?
now , what 's all this ?
i 'm exceptionally calm , if one considers , as we stand dithering here , our country is in the grip of crisis .
there 's an immediate prospect of invasion , however remote , but dash it , anyway , i choose this godforsaken part of the country !
may i remind the captain , during the eighth and ninth centuries , the marauding danes frequently came ashore in this precise area .
now may i inquire , who is in charge here ?
i am postmistress and chairman of the war activities committee .
oh , you do n't also command the home guard , do you ?
that is general sir brian tigler , late of his majesty 's royal northumberland fugleliers .
from the cliffs f dovr call up the gulls
every inch of england no mattr what they send
who 's standing firm in our own front yard
for we wrote the story of the old brigade
we know the glory of yesterday 's parades
the soldiers of the old home guard , that s who
permission to dismiss the parade , sir !
cptain greer , sir , from headqarters at tidbury , here to check military preparations in the area .
what on earth is that ?
good morning , general .
i received your message  mrs. hobday .
it 's in the office 
wh is that ?
splendid woman .
what does she burn in this thing ?
ridculous .
here we re- another object frm professor emelius browne in london .
professor browne sent you a cat last tim  did he not ?
yes .
i do n't know professor browne personally .

and according to the order of the ministry of civil defense , you have no choice .
i see .
fin .
miss price , what a charitable thing you are doing , taking in these poor unfortunates frm th city .
hold this very carefully .
i wonder , miss price , if i may drop by later this afternoon .
one also admires miss price 's sturdy house , the four acres f desirable land and the fine prospect overlooking the sea .
does one not ?
one needs an anchor of dmesticity , a feeling that one has a cozy place to rturn to ... as one fares forth to do heaven 's work .
his wound is better , thank yo .
alas ... if i only could .
my quinsy , you know .

carri , you sleep on th sfa n there .
we ai n't exactly burdened down with frillies .
well , i do n't think this arrangement is going to work , but it seems that i have no alternative .
you will wash thoroughly-

you are planning to run back to lndon 
aunt bessie .
still , she was nt even a real aunt , was she ?
i do n't remember anything .
three nights ago , the bombs were gettin ' a bit close , so i took charlie and paul ... down to the underground to sleep .
i 'm sure your aunt was a very kind woman .
you 'll have to make do as i do .
is there anything particular that you fancy ?
oh  anything at all .
no fried food ?
what 's all that ?
cabbage buds , rose hips , glyssop seed , elm bark , whortle yeast and , uh , stewed nettles .
and in the pot there , mango wuzzle jam .
dear madam , with this shipment , the emelius browne correspondence college of witchcraft ... sends you its heartiest congratulations on qualifying ... for the first degree of your chosen calling .
yours faithfully , emelius browne .
my first broom .
time to go .
everybody up .
we 're going back to london .
now , let 's see how we fly this thing .
yes , of course .
technically a witch is always a lady , except when crcumstances dictate otherwise .
that 's much better .
how 's that ?
now , to start up the broom , your basic formula-
here we go .
lakipo , nikrif , scrumpet , leetch !
it 's going to be a little different this time .
all right 
lakipo , nikrif , scrumpet , leetch !
cor !
she do n't fly good , do she ?
she 's crashed !
now 's our chance to hop it .
i 'm havin ' a bit of a think .
then let 's use the old loaf , says i .
come on .
thank you , miss .
hurt your fot , miss price ?
lvely weather for flying last night .
game 's up , miss prce .
i see .
do n't wrry , miss price .
of course , there 'll have to be one or two little changes made around here .
charlie !
and another thing , miss price .
i could do with a bit f lolly .
cold , hard cash .
fr your informtion , the most accomplished of witches ... ca n't make money out of thin air .
have you ever heard of a rich witch ?
have you considered what danger you might be in ?
 am a witch , you know .
what will you do , turn me into a toad 
lovely .
i might just do that .
go on , then .
i dare you .
bother !
leave him alone !
i 'm just an apprentic witch , you know .
look out , charlie !
you flaming brute !
i do n't see why we ca n't all be friends .
of course i 'm not .
if only i could trust you .
mst secret .
what do you say , charlie ?
we cn keep a secret .
i do n't follow .
if we broke the pact , we 'd have to give back the valuable object .
i wonder what i could give you .
would you settle for one of my spells ?
i like you better as a rabbit , charlie .
well , i never had a rabbit 
no one has ever seen it before .
when i signed for my witchcraft course , there was a free bonus ... a certain marvelous trveling spell , if you paid promptly in advance .
poisoned dragon 's liver ?
poisoned dragon liver .
well , it comes prepared .
ah , here we are .
the traveling spell .
all right , now , let 's see .
what about you , paul ?
always carry a few things around with me .
horseshoe nail 
what 's that ?
yes ,  think that will be all right .
glowworm fire , firefly light !
there .
is n't that pretty ?
how does it work ?
well , yu take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs , then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left .
then in a firm , clear voice , tell it where you want to go , and the bed will take you there .
go on !
me ?
yes .
mine , wre n't it ?
that 's the way th spell works .
nice mess he 'll make of things .
but mind you do n't try anything with the bedknb until i get back .
yes ?
thank yu very much .
n .
me ?
paul , i need the bedknob back .
i must get to london immediately .
i ll handle this .
well , yes , in a way , but-
well , a few odd shillings might fix matters up , as you might say .
go ahead .
i was expcting a very important spell in the mail ... from my techer , professor melius browne , and it has n't come .
with his help , we may be able to bring this war to a successful end .
it may be wndy .
twice .
god .
i 'm not going 
but why , charlie 
lovely .
just so 's you leave me out of it 
i do n't fancy making a fool of myself .
what 's come over you lately , charlie ?
that 's what my father used to call the age of not believing .
you 're at the age of not believing
that 's charlie to a t .
you 're at the age of not believing
what 's that supposed to be , poetry ?
you must face the age of not believing
lovely sentiment , i 'm sure .
now , when i say go , tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left .
that 's it .
one , two , three 
that 's very odd .
of course .
take us to professor ...
very good .
headmaster , correspondence colleg ...
of witchcraft , london .
now , go .
one , two , three .
well , charles , are you convinced by now ?
i do n't see no professor browne .
this bed was supposed to take us to professor browne .
lok !
professor browne .
i do n't know .
hurry up !
professor emelius browne .
i do n't keep money in me ear .
yes , madam , a trick .
or to use a kinder word , an llusion .
but what is n't , n these troubled times ?
it is not what things are .
it is what they seem to be .
is that not so , madam ?
that ai n't the kind of professor i expected .
i 'm not sure it 's the kind of professor miss price expected either .
you see , it really des n't matter what i do , what i do , as long as i do it ... with a flair .
what effect a little smoke is .
with a dash of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning-
i 'm a fraud , a hoke a charlatan , a joke
may i also draw your attention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail .
now ,  shall plce the framed glass .. n this brown , unprepared- unprepared , mark you  ladies and gentlemen ... unprepared brown pper bag .
and fix you with my best hypnotic stare
with my moans and groans and soporific tones
they have cheered me everyone
will mystify and disarm
it works
so it really does n't matter what i brew , what i brew
as long as i brew it with a flair
though i 've never cast a magic spell
i 'm a rogue , a rak a mountebank of fake
but i do whate'er i dar
and my magic incantations can be framed as decorations
the prices are so low , you will never cease to marvel at them .
for you , sir , one penny .
we found him for you , miss .
do n't work .
how may i serve yu ?
the late headmaster .
i 'm sorry , my dear .
look at your contract .
i bid you good day .
do n't let him get away .
will you get this child off my leg ?
fligree , apogee , pedigree , perigee !
cor !
i changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells .
my spell ?
they were just nonsnse words that i got out of an old book !
i changed thm around a bit .
what a treasure .
we can discuss my ideas at the same time .
we 'd be delighted .
do these three jackals belong to you ?
well , not exactly .
howevr , we shall all go together .
on the bed ?
come along .
you go 'round the other side .
fly 
in point of fact , i do .
i found the front door open , the house was deserted .
merciful heavens !
i should think you 'd be terrified at the very idea f living here .
you 'd have thought s .
i am , by nature , well , a little bit of a coward .
but then i pondered , as i ften do .
shall we go in ?
mr. browne , the book- where s it ?
why do you keep the curtains closed 
more likely so 's a copper do n't peek in and catch you hidin ' out here .
i want to have a chat wth miss price .
yes , run along , children .
remember , this house does not belong to mr. browne .
no .
and neither have you .
i must see the nature of the spell .
precisely , my good woman .
but now you must hear my ideas .
isle of naboombu .
animals wearing hts and things .
oh , i like it .
uh , wold you hold this , please ?
oh ?
brighton , blackpool , follies on the prom !
listen to me .
we could make a package .
let us strike a bargain you pssess a gift
and i command the show-how
oh , how successful you could be
with m
i 'm afraid we 're wasting valuable time .
what 's your nme ?
miss price .
no , no .
eglantine ?
eglantine eglantine
as the shine slls the boot and the blossoms the fruit
and i 'm your man
i sell things that nobdy can

mr. browne , will you please stop it ?
do you hear me ?
hark to the stars
destiny calls us , the future is ours
and th moonbeams the moon
and a flair
there 's serious work to be done .
to do my bit in the national emergency
i enrolled in your correspondence college of witchcraft
and i slaved at every lesson as it came
your suggestions are rash and your manner is brash
though i 've no taste for playing the clown
i wo n't let you down
your lot and my lot have gt to combine
mr. browne ,  'm warning you !
i warned you , mr. brown .
oh , you 're back , mr. browne .
the spell which creates this force ... is five mystic words .
but where are the other pges ?
i have n't the foggiest .
you will be if you do n't pay attention .
where did you get this book ?
there was a bit of unpleasantness , as a matter of fact .
there ws a sort f scffle .
he got one half and i got the other .
where 's the other half now ?
but if it still exists  there 's only one place to find it .
where is that ?
rare alabaster
a new botticelli
waterford crystl
society heirlooms with genuine gems
very interesting .
portobello road , portobello road
street where the riches of ages are stowed
is sold off the barrow in portobello road
all in good time , my dear .

in the portobello road
who do you think you are , the qeen of sheba ?

but i thought they 'd be in yours !
and there 's his star .
towards the end of his life ,
the legend is that finlly the animals rebelled at the experiment , killed astoroth and stole many of his powers .

really , charles  if you 'd been paying attention , i should think you 'd be aware that substitutiary locomotion ... is the art f causing inanimate objects to take on a life force of their own .
obviously , i must hav inanmate objects to experiment wth .
makes sense , do n't it ?
stand back , everyone .
i need plenty of room .
i want you all to be absolutely quiet .

charles .
good morning .
profssor emelius browne from london .
oh .

i cnsider her a very dangerous person .
troop movements and massing of barges in french and dutch channel ports .
the prime ministr has told the nation to be on the alert .. for signs of a possible invasion .
to think i might have been abl to d something about all this .
if only i could 've remembered those words .
why do n't someone ask me ?
you mean like treguna , mekoides ,
treguna , mekoides , trecorum satis dee ?
how do you know that ?
you mean it was there in your book all the time ?
yeah

after all , we are in the 20th century .
well , it needs rhythm , tempo , music .
treguna , mekoides trecorum satis dee
substitutiary locomotion

with a flourish and a flair
eglantine .

oh , he 's on his way to london .
if you re mr. browne , would you be kind enough to get down off my lap ?
it is you !
oh , i am glad to see you .
that ought to be useful .

the sight of you would upset your own mother .
we play villarosa next 
things will be better there .
you 've got your own bsiness now 
a one-man operation .
i 'm doing just that .
get you off the hook with this broken-down , moth-eaten rodeo .
if you got a brain , you 'll tak it .
buffalo bill wants to buy omar the wonder horse .
he 's offering a good price .
twenty .

someone you know ?
a client of mine , professor bromley .
what 's he dong out there ?
hello !
 say , thank heavens you came along .
you know very well what has happened .
rosita 
then she kicked me .
i do n't know where she 's gone nw .
well , there are no bones broken , but it 's frightfully painful .
my name is bromley .
right .
you ought to know better than to get bhind a stubborn mule .
i 'd say you could use a good , stiff drnk .
you 're right , mr. kirby .
actually i 'm a paleontologist .
we 're not gon na get very far that way , are we ?
i intend to prove it was many eons before that .
will you get it ?
that 's it 
eo ... ?
eohppus .
over th period of evolution , horses have grown larger .
and that center toe has become the hoof as we know it .
what is more incredible is the fossil beside it .
possibly more than 50 millon years ago .
my resourcs , both financial and physical are running precariusly low .
thank you for your kindness .
can i speak to you a moment ?
you want that money i owe you .
do n't worry , you 'll get it .
us .
you and me and diablo ...
in the meantime , let 's see how we go in villarosa .
hi there , hon .
you 've been thinkng about it ?
hey , toro .
hey , toro .
hey  hey , toro .
cut it out , tuck , if you want me to get on with the repairs .
who was that fella jumped the bull , anyway ?
oh , carlos .
i 'm glad he was there .
why did you walk out on me , tuck ?
i was ready to sell out , to marry you .
getting married is like being a horse tied up in a corral .
wait a minute .
anything for you  baby .
what kind of an act ?
come to the opening at ...
no , no , i mean now .
t.j. , i want to know ...
must have been in a gold mine , becase that 's what he is .
it took a while to train him , but now he 's about ready for his debut .
a horse dancing on horseback .
i can see it all now .
presenting el diabl , the world 's only miniature horse .
we are on our way to a fortune .
yeah , it was those three toes that started me thinking .
and four on its hind feet .
ys .
it could be a freak of nature , of course .
well , is there any way you can tell ?
the greatest scientific discovery of the age ?
t.j .
buffalo bill , barnum and bailey .
bromley .
we 'll play one off against the other .
sell to the highest bdder 
impossible .
destroying all my dreams .
reason is somethng my people do not understnd 
that witch tia zorina tells them superstitious nonsense about el diablo .
at least show us the camp .
i do n't want any more trouble .
you 've cused enough already .
well , thanks for yor help , carlos .

tia zorina .
camp .
lope ?
sure .
madam , i 'm prepared to pay a guide handsomely 
what 's this forbidden valley ?
superstitious claptrap .
if you knew where the little horse was hidden , what would you do ?
a centavo for your thoughts , señor 
h , hi , lope .
she could make a fortune .
i ca n't understand it .
love .
love 's for latins .
lope , when you help someone you love yu help yourself .
what 's the big discovery , seor ?
oh , no , no , no .
you 'll nd up wanting a cut .
i 'm doing fine on my own .
i mean , you 're going n a journey .
hey , tuck !
do n't be a fool , man !
what happend ?
who ?
your friend , kirby .
stealing ?
why , the dirty ...
not tuck .
you bet .
look her .
we 're headed in th right direction .
he 's working with the professor .
they were speaking of scientific interest .
tuck wants el diablo for buffalo bill .
you should have listened to me , t.j .
all rght , all right !
he was right .
to where ?
i do n't know .
yeah , just about there .
you can make it easy or hard .
that 's up to you .
well , the gypsies took him 
you put them p to it .
where there is one eohippus , there must be others .
at least two , the sire and the mare .
yes .
we shall soon see , mr. kirby .
ho !
señor kirby !
easy .
steady .
not from you .
i 've got it !
take your thieving hands ff him .
he 's mine .
hey , we got him cornered .
i can see daylight in there .
yeah , that 's that because we 're not .
it opens into another whole valley through there .
wider inside .
take up the slack easy .
take her away .
okay , that did it !
come n , boys .
whoa .
here , what 's this 
do you see what i see ?
what 's that ?
it looks like a plucked ostrich !
let 's get him for the show .
then what 's it doing here ?
precisely .
wht is it doing here ?
take off , t.j .
get on a horse , boy !
come on , professor .
there 's a big lizard back there , heading this way .
leave me alone , mr. kirby .
i 'm not leaving now .
come on , tuck .
by george !
nothing we can do for him now .
these cartridges are blanks .
how was i to know ?
here , maybe we can us these .
all right , break it up .
we 'll settle all this later .
no , we ll settle it right now .
carlos ?
stop it !
not anymore .
a hole in the ground could swallow me up too .
you ca n't tell  friend from an enemy , cockeyed female .
it 's gone .
that 's what you wanted , is n't it ?
well , i do n't know , tj .
i 've been n my own too .
well , i know , i know , but not like me .
tuck , i do n't care .
i 'll tell you .
yes ?
yes ?
and kids , maybe ?
you talking bout settling down ?
sure you can make it , tuck ?
well , i wo n't know till i give it a try , will i ?

come on , professor !
come on !
tuck , carlos !
in a dream ,  saw it .
th great jaws snapping , the riderless hors .
and so will you be doomed , all of you unless the evil one is set free !
the only thing tht 's evil about him are his jaws .
a show !
a show ?
it 's disgraceful to think of putting this creature on display in a cheap circs !
we can do what we like .
he belongs to us all , to mankind .
world tour !
what 's this about a world tour ?
forgetting something , are n't you ?
oh , yes , new york .
no , not new york , wyoming !
the reason i helped you was so that all of you culd get paid off handsome .
but now it 's worth saving .
tuck , ca n't you see ?
same old tuck .
as you like ?
i guess it s .
well , i 'm sorry for you .
señorita , you must go after mr. kirby .
he 's a very proud man and he 'll never come back .
tuck !
quiet him down !
when that goes up you 'll get th picture f your lives .
gwangi the great !
stop him !
no , you 're supposed to play !

merry christmas .
ahhh .
each doll has his own story .
you 're making that up .
ahhh !
who 's the fat guy ?
well , i 'm sure he just needs someone to play with .
he 's a most promising young drummer .
but he plays so loud sometimes , he drives tinker crazy .
all right , children , supper time !
wait a moment , wait a moment .
mary and max , meet ... the nutcracker .
i call hm nc for short .
right .
party advance to the kitchen .
not until you have tied up all your loose ends , mein kapitän .
mary , let me see .
it 's not so bad .
mm .
it s just a stupid toy !
mary is right , max .
it just depends on your imagination .
ja .
nein .
the hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax .
this .. is a piece f strudel .
# they will think you 're small
# up is down take is gve
view !
# simply up to you , it 's ...
# why , you 
# this is that these are those
no-one really knows
# so you might turn your highs to lows
# relative , all

and dream .
will you tell us the nutcracker story ?
uncle ?
uncle ?
i 'm sorry about my brother .

mary !
oh , here we go .

i ca n't believe it .

phew .
you should see what they can do to a chunk of wood .
yes , i 'm ready .
come on .
did we get smaller or did the room get bigger ?
if you do n't mind me sying , that 's a naive question .

be qiet !
be quiet !
ooh , i 'll have some chcolte .
be quiet !

the front of the house has just disappeared .
this takes the biscuit .
i have to file a cmplaint .
this house has n't been refurbished for 30 years .
there 's so much poussière ... dust ...
that i 've developed an allergy .
and he 's still drumming !
i shll never speak again , but i have to say one thing 
maybe your highness should introduce s to his charming companion ?
hi .
the pleasure is all mine .
an honour .
the plan is this .
we 're going in to fight against the rat king .
hold t !
no-one is going anywhere yet .
sticks , go up the tree and see if the snow fairy is p there .
i 'll teach you some drumming .
he s the least reliable person i know .
i certainly do n't .
the cherubim and seraphim !
hi .
hey !
merry christmas !
why , thank you .
what took you so long ?
i had to deal with the others .
but i 'm not .
you 're the snow fairy , are n't you ?

shhhhh .
oh , yes !
but i ca nt fly .
you can do it .
get on with it !
ooh .
bye !
oh !
there is something i want to tell you .
he is not like the others .
she 's so awful , i can barely bring myself to say her name .
rat queen .
but with you here , mary , we might just have a chance to defeat her .
# cucumber cool or more frantic ?
 do you take the view
# things you say and do
# never mean a bean when the world is so gigantic ?
# have you got a fght worth winnng ?
# you can guess , yes and yes for you 're special and unique # .

is it happening ?
not just a boy 
now i can go t my city , and people can se me .
now i have a plan .
you really are an ungrateful person .
the least you could do is ask her for a dance .
# keep the magic going
# through the powr known as love ... #
it 's the prince , all right .
i 'd recognise him anywhere .
so , he 's alive .
we got ta go tell the king .
see that cloud there ?
his mother turned me into a wooden nutcracker , and then he released his army into the city centre , scaring all of my people , on a beautiful spring day .
well , hopefully , she 'll come round tomorrow .
so he has to burn everything in a smoke factory , including all the children 's toys , just to keep that cloud going .
come on !
smething juicy , i hope .
i see no king .
you can turn our prince into wood , and turn us into your slaves , but you 'll never be more than a mangy , dirty rat to us .
such a pity .
it 's all so unnecessary .
here .
# they had ther chance
# but humans just could n't do it
# far too bright and breezy
# two , three four !
# welcome to a stygian era
# days eliminated
# so humans , sunshine , light we ca n't stand them
# rattus rules quod erat demnstrandum
# and the lights go out
genius !
yes , a masterpiece , huh ?
you the man !
way t go , boss !
please , you are too kind .
nd i 'll let you in on a little ratty secret , my greasy , terrorist little frind .
soon , only us rats will be left , and we 'll have an empire that will last ... a thousand years !
sorry .
too long .
lousy brakes .
nothing special .
no big deal .
what news ?
your favourite prince is still live , sir .
i knew it .
maybe i should run into a hole ... and hide .
take them to the smoke factory !
the prince is alive !
zip it , baldy 
he 's alive !
get my wig , quick !
any idiot can face a crisis .
oh , mother !
mother !
oh , it 's only you .
yo appear to be slipping , ld gal .
your spell on the prince is broken .
closer .
be a rat !
i 'll put a new high-grade curse on that little runt , and then maybe one of your stupid soldiers can grab him !
you bit me !
make it stick the next time , will you ?
i need to build up my strength .
a little rat juice .
little ctesy bore !
come on .
fantastic !
maybe some girls are good at military strategy .
oh , this is good .
what 's happening ?
i 'm coming .
mary !
why are n't you in bed ?
what , max ?
what on earth is going on here ?
oh , you 're safe , you 're safe .
would you care to explain this ?
erm ...
pillows ?
that was before .
i tred to tll you .
joseph , do smething 
what 's going on ?
you , get in here !
i think i see one !
this i am sure of .
enough !
everybody , get to bed .
children .
i told you .
the ceiling was gone .
louise , even max does n't believe her .
not a word .
make this room grow before our eyes .
a bit of fun is one thing , mary , but quite blatantly lying is another .
now ... give me that doll .
i never do .
where are you going ?
i do n't want you to see me cry .
not even trying .
# i 'm lying
# but on reflection
# i 'm simply different
# one of a kind , i do n't mind
# dreams become real and i fel i 'm wanted
# and it s all i need # .
i 'd better check .
i swear !
quiet !
is everything all right ?
of course .
mary has become unmanageable , and , uncle , i m sorry but it 's mor than a little bit yor fault .
she 's living in a fantasy world .
i know .
reality is merely an illusin , albeit a very persistent one .
when you leave , please will you take the dll 's house away with you ?
what 's in your pockets ?
# there was a boy
# holding the pebble , he was king
# the boy felt that he 'd lost everything
# he searched long and hard
# his enchanted world forsaken
# and all too soon his lfe was overtaken
# he grew serious and grand
that was joseph .
why so sad ?
i saved it for yu .
that old rat witch is not retiring any time soon .
what rank ar you ?
captain .
yes !
there 's a real rat king ?
mm-mm !
oh !
no .
now , are there any weapons that are n't broken ?
come on .
good work , captan .
to the kingdom .
do you have motorbikes in your army ?
you can come on one condition .
get dressed .
hey , sleepyheads !
arghhh !
whaaa !
argh !
max , come on !
where ?
in the chimney .
i ca n't see anything .
give me your hand .
wow .
this is the fine fellow who broke my nutcracker 's jaw .
it 's the rat king .
not in the teeniest bit .
in fact ,  only came to ask you to play with my toys .
does that jar anything loos ?
hm ?
you call that music ?
you seem to have forgotten that all toys have a breaking point and yo 've reached yours !
whoo !
catch !

no , no , i mean ...
i know wht you mean .
no , no , n .
that 's not the way my mother explained it to me .
we 're nt eating those eggs .

yes , a , uh , research prblem .
sit down , sit down .
dr. gottlieb , is it possible ...
so , uh , we 're a radio-biologist now , are we , dooley ?
just a minute .
all i wanted to know ...
the answer is yes .
what kind of an egg ?
it was , um ... a young medical student at , um , the royal viennese hospital .
his name was , um , schultz or schmaltz ...
oh , here .
in searching for a chemical background for rdiogenic inflammation from radium ,
metal ?
well , you said anything was possible .
possible , yes .
dr. gottlieb .
you wo n't believe this report .
it 's ...
the metal contains traces of dgalacturonic acid .
d you know what that is ?
pectin tht 's been hydrolyzed under intense heat .
no , no , it 's true .
not related to any of ...
... the 103 known chemical elements .
moon rock ?
no , no , no .
a plaster deposit ?
well , yes ...
it was deposited , you might say .
yo paid for it .
oh , yes .
to help m incorporate .
fred , that sample is the yolk of a duck gg .
i know how incredible this must sound to your legal , pragmatic mind , but in 1903 , a viennese scientist ...
pull over , i 'll drive .
you crazy ding-a-ling driver , orlo !
our financial worries are ovr 
he 's broken-hearted because i was trying ...
oh , honey , i always knew you 'd make good .
it 's nothing i did .
it 's charli .
they 're gold .
i 'm not kidding you .
it 's true .
i gave the duck to mr. purdham .
albert , yu told me to 
where does purdham live ?
i 'm not sure .
oh , i 'm trying .
chicken chow mein .
oak road .
get in the car , fred .
hey  daddy , wait .
you 'll find the duck in the pen , back of the barn ynder .
thanks 
oh , no .
charlie .
charlie .
charlie .
charlie .
where are you , charlie ?
you know what we need ?
no .
start barking , frd .
it 's our only chanc , fred 
trying to find som stupid duck who lys solid gold ... solid gold eggs !
we 'll find him .
whoa , whoa .
here , here .
what 's going on ?
back , back .
back , back .
i knew i 'd find her .
why , albert , you do n't sound like hooper 's dog at all .
uh , he goes more like ...
pitch .
it might b a matter of pitch .
come on .
yeah  charlie .
bby , yu re looking at a believer .
that 's right .
and if she worked a six-hour day , uh , give or take a couple of coffee breaks , uh , corn breaks .
we 're talkng about a 100,000 dollar a day business .
that 's right .
our fortune ?
what do you mean , our fortune ?
look , al , sweetheart ,
uh-huh .
i 'll have to devote full time , figurng how to incorporate a duck , and not have the internal revenuers n our neck .
oh , fine .
oh , it was no trouble , really .
thanks .
and do n't tell anybody bout this , especially  uh ...
hold it .
do n't spend any of that money yet 
make n changes in your living standards .
now , let 's try and get some sleep .
no , the duck 's asleep with jimmy and i do n't want jimmy disturbed .
and , fred ...
do you think maybe now we could afford to re-shingle our house ?
we could buy the pentagon .
albert , just how rich will we be ?
now wait a minute .
against who ?
the fellow in the fable let greed dstroy him .
we wo n't do that .
we 're gn na play it cool , keep our feet on the ground .
albert ?
what ?
cute .
he might catch cold .
oh .
now what ?
some sense f vlues 
boy , he sure was right .
you know .
i do ?
jimmy , your lunch .
b sure and take good care of charlie while i 'm gone , mom .
do n't worry , i wll .
now , run alng .
you 're gon na be late for school  goodbye .
yes .
who ?
well , hi .
bad checks ?
uh , uh , well , you printed them .
no  mrs. dooley .
we 've explained several tmes that you can not write checks for more money than you have in the bank .
you could be arrested for that .
oh , no .
please do n't .
mr. meaker , i , uh ...
i guess you 'll just have to call my husband about that ...
wait .
uh , i 'll be right down .
and that 's my deposit slip for it .
next , please .
what kind of a bank is this , anyway ?
have n't you bankers ever heard of gold ?
mrs. dooley , ven if that were gold bouilln there 's nothing ...
that would n't d very much for your account now , would it ?
well  i should say not .
the only possible place you could take that is to a refinery .
where 'd you get the hat ?
what hat ?
oh , now albert , it was on sale .
yu know , if you wrote a check for that hat , we 're overdrawn again .
no , we 're not .
from the refinery .
no , not those .
well , the bank told me to .
no , no , no .
hi , partners .
that 's all we can do because we do n't have a license to handle gold .
i 'd lke a gold license for my lttle ducky who lays gold eggs .
he works for the u.s. treasury .
why ?
you could get ten yers in the jug for hoarding .
why ?
yes , but you 're ...
wait a minute .
you did n't tell them where the gold came from , did you ?
what did he sy when you told him ?
she can tell them the truth and they 'll never believe it .
a new suit ?
keep moving around .
no , no , no .
this is exceptionally high grade ore .
all seem to be the identical size and shape .
what kind of duck was that ?
thank you .
mrs. doley , listen , about these nggets ...
bye-bye .
we do n't have your address .
bauty .
you would n't happen t have a layaway plan , would you ?
no , i did n't think so .
well ,  ca n't buy t now , but ...
i 'll be back .
gentlemen , they my have learned how to make gold .
 know that .
the point i 'm trying to make is that they 've found a way to make gold cheap enough to put on the market .
remember what happened to common , every day , ordinary bread mold ?
penicilln .
 hesitate to think what would happen if this were to get out of this room .
take it on one .
no , no , no .
nothing to it at all .
well , we have had a little flap abot gold around hre , but everything is absolutely under control .
by , bob .
rutledge .
yes , this is he .
hello , rog .
oh , no .
not a single foreign country will hear anything about it .
it 's all ours .
america is producing instant gold .
it is  plot .
americans mak it for ten dollars an ounce , we make it $ 8.95 
the white hose ?
yes , sir .
i fully realize yu have enough trouble without this .
i understand , sir .
huh ?
known under various aliases , such as k.w .
quote katie klaus quote dooley .
what was after albert ...
your neighbor ?
well , it 's not my fault .
they moved in and i ...
oh , katie and albert dooley .
really , now ?
have fun .
i have n't even talked to him .
well , how about jimmy ?
he 's our son , remember ?
i know tht .
how about that car ?
that 's the car i had my eye on .
old freddie-boy is going to see you get a whole stble full f them .
here i am , slaving my head to the bone while you ...
how about that for a company name ?
dooley s wrought iron sauna baths ?
it 's a sure loser .
besides hooper  i still can not identify the radioactive element in our gold .
if i ca n't identify it , i do n't know what its half-life is .
if i do n't know its half-life ...
in other words , it could run out .
run out ?
wll , get it , al .
i have 20l20 hearing .
what do you mean out ?
jimmy took him for a ride in that cute car wth the wadlow boys .
not that !
come on .
you guys said you 'd tke me and charlie for a ride .
take it easy , man .
get him off !
hey , arvin , look .
huh ?
we 'll give you two bucks cash .
great .
the fun s over , son .
no , n , no .
does n't that duck belong to jimmy ?
it 's not a civil rights case .
i guess yu 're right .
you ca n't do that .
uh , jimmy ?
hi , jimmy .
i 'm not supposed to go into your yard .
i 've got a present for you .
if you want it 
my little nephew outgrew it .
boy , oh , boy .
say , this is a nice duck you 've gt here .
yeh , lots of them .
i 've never seen a real duck egg .
my dad can .
he barks at her .
he does ?
why do n't i try that ?
you come over here and hold her and i 'll try it .
but look at the bike mr. hooper ...
ar n't you ashamed ?
well , i ca n't keep the duck locked up all the time , it 's only human , you know .
hooper 's hip .
i 'll meet you at the house as quick as i can sneak away from here , okay ?
dooley !
dooley !
yes .
evidently some kind of a new gangland code word .
you know , quack , quack .
and this duck lys gold eggs .
i saw it happen .
they bark at it .
they bark ...
and that causes the duck to lay these ... gld eggs .
i see .
i did it myself .
you laid a gold egg , hoop ?
very interestng .
look  why do n't you stop by my office sometime tomorrow and yu and me have a little chat .
it was after prohibition ...
chief , there may be something t this .
i thought he was putting me on , but with hooper telling us ...
are n't those nuggets all about the same siz as an egg yolk ?
so ... stop that .
it 's all som fairy tale talk .
rutledge here .
no , duck .
try to trade them for it .
make same thing .
get that duck .
upstairs with jimmy .
that 's what we want .
got any more of these ?
give me the egg .
i know what you 're trying to do  and i 'm the egg man .
it 's my egg , to .
hope you can come back when i 'm not so busy .
mr. dooley .
treasury men are n't entitled to barge in without a search warrant .
there you are .
dooley .
mr. rutledge wants to see your duck .
gold eggs ?
41,000 dollars worth of eggs , and not one cent of income tax has ben declared .
well , sir , this duck of yours could very well be the most single valuable asset in the united states today .
tht duck is a natural resource .
that duck 's entitled to the protecton of the .s. government .
i understand that the duck will produce on command .
i 've done it myself .
i 'd like to confer with my client .
all right , you got 30 seconds .
no way .
i 'll get the duck .
do n't let her out of your sight .
the duck ?
no , jimmy .
you tricked us .
shut up .
do n't just everybody stand there .
please go out and find him 
all right , i 'll handle it .
katie 's right , we have to find that duck .
not the duck , fred .
mrs. hooper .
with the duck ?
i sure did .
he got a bicycle out of our garage and took off .
which way did he go ?
por jimmy .
if we 'd never gotten that drn duck .
come on .
there , chief .
search that truck .
not in there .
hey !

this is candid camera , right ?
eh ?
where is it ?
okay , mack .
charlie !
charlie !
stop it , come here .

the truck swerved to miss the duck .

do n't let them get charlie .
even the government .
the wadlows have him .
never mnd tht .
get in .
get in , get in , get in !

sorry .
well , at least you 're lucky , old boy 
lucky ?
thanks , fred .
where are the gold eggs ?
right on time , charlie .
what 's that duck really worth ?
we cover riot cases , rapes and spies  but a rich duck ?
oh , no .
sorry , gentlemen .
mr. hooper , did yo actually witness the duck lay a golden egg ?
i did , indeed .
would you demonstrate it for us ?
it 's the wrong pitch , is n't it ?
your honor  he 's not doing it right .
i 'd like to get this out in the open .
if that duck can lay gold eggs , then we should establish that .
you 're out of your mind .
if we lose the duck , so be it .
there it is .
you 're gon na get it now .
wait till it ..
finished .
case dismissed because of lack f evidence .
since when are we against the accumulation of a few dollrs , as a result of individual initiative ?
here you are , professor .

a second underground nuclear bomb test was carried out .
godzilla vs. megalon
brought to you by showa video
brother !
sure .
an earthquake ...
it 's an earthquake !
it wo n't move !
hey , roku !
the national seismic institute beleves the earthquakes are an effect from the second nuclear bomb test .
they also warn that more tremors are expected ,
it 's incredible , is n't it ?
it 'll be the end of all mankind
it 's like this ...
both were great civilizations , until a big earthquake destroyed them .
hey , would n't it be intresting if the earthquake destroyed your robot ?
you 're really funny ...
hey ...
brother !
damn !
professor !
roku !
damn , they really mad a mess of this place .
brother , those guys made a mess of my room .
how about here ?
every room seems to be messed up , but nothing was stolen .
however , we should make a thorough check .
there 's some funny powder on the floor here .
what do you think it is ?
it looks like sand .
it 's a button i got from one of those guys .
it must have been from their shoes , we found it next to the robot .
nah , i m just an amater .
yo thnk it 's okay ?
bye-bye !
good afternoon ...
oh , it looks like it 's finished !
they had found rows of 20 meter hgh sttues overlooking the sa .
it 's workng !
congratulations !
you 've done it at last !
jet jaguar .. ?
hey , let 's go !
let 's try it out !
there are tv camers in its eyes .
it 's also equippd with evasion devices so it will always get out of your way .
as far as i 'm concerned , it cn have th right of way !
it 's them !
seatopia , seatopia .
we have managed to occpy the laboratory and captured the inventor as well .
after three million years of peace , we finally have to fight .
we do not want to make wan but the people f earth leave us no choice .
we must tight for th sake of seatopia !
we will give the earth people a taste of their own medicine .

i think they 're going to kill us both !
a little more !
brother !
how much longr until we get to the lake ?
well , it should be around an hour , right ?
yes .
why would you want this container taken to the crack in the lakebed ?
wht 's in the thing anyway ?
i guess we 're nt supposed to know what 's inside that thing .
brother , i dd it !
the robot has made it to the lakebed ,
where are you taking my two friends ?
seatopia ?
we 've created our own oxygen supply , and later we constructed our own sun .
we are a very advanced people .
if you 're so superior , why steal a robot ?
for the sake of our peac we needed to steal it to create an army .
now you 're going to tell me where my frends are !
alright , you 're free now .
brother !
unit one !
the young prisoner i was hlding has escped 
roger .
that would be just as good as taking it to the lake .
brother !
you 've got to get us out of here !
what happened to the foregn guy ?
damn !
are you alright ?
did n't that look just like jet jaguar ?
that 's jet jaguar !
alright , that 's what we 'll d .

wish i could float around , harold .
but i have to  uh , wash my gills .
me too .
the cleaner fish might as wll giv up now .
they 'll never get this kind of sparkle on you .
i could think of a lot cooler things than a good sparkle .
black and blue would totally clash with your pink spotty shimmer .
want to come ?
he 's not here .
yeah , we saw him leave the boat after fish flakes .
you can come out and play with us .
and we 'll keep an eye out for human to come back .
i 'm not supposed to .

and you 're a really real wild fish ?
yep , a really real wild fish that lives right here in the ocean .
what 's out there ?
but mainly the volcano .
i have to find my father .
you ca n't just cross the volcano !
i 've tried crossing it a few times to get to the coral reef .
i bet your father is waiting for yo there .
not important .
what 's it like ?
you know , fish that are not the colorful , sparkly , shiny , ooh-ah type .
like him !
but i found the one little spot that opens into the cean and the coral reef .
but this time , i 'm gon na do it .
i 've got a new way to cross it .
it 's sure to work , i think .
i mean , it better work or it 's gon na be bad .
isabl ?
so you think making friends with a lion fish is a good idea ?
so are a lot of things in the ocean .
ooh , pretty !
wo !

wait !
it 's no use .
the boat will come back .
we will wait here .
but isabel 's out there near the volcano !

fry city .
oh , geez .
i 'm so sorry .
coral bleaching ... humans have to stop that , by the way 
you there !
it appears you ...
you 've seemed to uncover something that ...
well , nice to met you , harry .
harold .
the difference is he 's a purple queen anthias fish .
it appears there 's a trail from isabel .
we 'll find her .
all we have to d is follow the trail .
you 're just gross .
are you coming ?
no !
yeah , and it 's almost time for fish flakes .
yeah , right , little lady .
you may be waiting a while .
you see the closest star in the sky up there ?
that 's what i said .
these cracks are almost rady .

certain doom ?
i , for one , am 'ofishally ' fabulous .
wait until you see what i found .

she 's coming to the reef with us to look for her dad .
this is some serious shimmer !
better than any treasure i 've ever seen !
oh , honey , that 's beatrice .
she 's quite skittish .
see how seriously scary you are ?
nice to meet you , beatrice .
welcome to our home sweet home , isabel .
not for long .
weak walls , flaky rock .
we 'll be much safr at the reef , june .
it 's the perfect place for us .
even with blobs and bumps ?
it used to be my home .
and , well , i wandered a little too far .
so now ...
i need to find my father !
who are you calling a freak ?
besides , do you really expect me to leave the only family i 've got ?
if yo wo n't listen to me , then listen to the volcano !
come with us .
just take the first stroke , one fin in front of the other .
well , now , i mean  a little open ocean would be gret for my scales .
thught i was , but i 'm not .
just water ?
i 'm ready ... to go back in the cave .
uh-huh .
does this help ?
thank you .
ready ?
april , what 's over the dune ?
whoa !
beatiful !
it 's so beautiful here .
i told him i did n't care , but i do .
like blue whale big !
they should n't be this big , not yet 
we better move !
ginger , you got a light 
let 's move when the sun comes back , honey .
we 'll leave as soon as it 's safe .
this coral sure looks comfy enough for a good night 's sleep .
i love you .
so then i looked at this shrimp and said , buddy , you 're shrimpy .
shrimpty  shrimp , shrimp , shrimp .
i mean , i meant no offense .
perhaps we cn swim in silence for a while .
sure , fine .
you are who you are .
must you do that ?
hey , you ever been worked over by a shrimp ?
i hit him with my intestines .
wait .
you said you hit him n the face with yur intestines ?
yeah .
no , that wo n't b necessry .
are you sure ?
abslutely sure .
my kids were really good at it .

i 've had all the excitement i can handle for one day .
jeez , tell me about t !
just taking in the scenery .
do you sense a tremor ?
better check for cracks .
i know it loks pretty bad .
oh , honey , you think we care ?
well , no , but i have to care .
all of you are so cool looking like rocks and sponges .
you would think being a fish without a stomach would help me keep the ounces off .
yeah , well , how would you like to literally be a blob ?
it does n't matter , especially where we 're going .
in the aquarium , things were different .
he 'd hide me forever !
come with us .
it would be pretty hard to be friends all covered in lva .
we 're coming , dad .
whoa .
jimmy eight legs .
yh , likewise 
isabel 's trail !
is this it ?
ne way to find out .
ther we go .
hey , i just called you harry .

i never had so much fun in my life !
who am i kidding ?
we can take a break if you want .
just one little ride .

it can mess with your lines .
ralph , come outside .
we have guests .

we 've lived in these waters for more tides that  care to count .

well , fancy meting you here .
june , herman , bea , seymour , ginger !

 volcano crossing would n't be the same without you .
it 's impossible to cross !
maybe it 's better to spin and then dart .
oh , we ca n't bob , weave , dart  spin or swim across t !
it 's just too hot and bubbly !
come on .
harry ?
harry , look at me .
i was the one who was afraid .
it does n't matter now anyway .
i 'll never see her agin .
guys ?

do n't you understand ?
frinds ?
freak .
come on , harold
father ?

life .
since the beginning humans and pokémon alike have searched for its meaning .
what am i ?
what am i ?
many strange and wondrous legends evolved from the pursuit of life 's mysteris .
but none is stranger than ths tale of the most powerful pokémon of all .
-let me see !
let 's run anther scan 
where i must be .
tell giovanni what 's happened !
let us hear its psychic powers .
that is mew , the rarest of all pokémon .
from its dna we created you , mewtwo .
am i only a copy ?
nothing but mew s shadow ?
improvd through the power of human ingenuity .
so i am simply the end result of your experiment .
what becomes of m now 
it 's just beginning !
we 'll start testing .
behold my powers .
stronger even than mew .
those fools thought you were a science experiment but i see you as a valuable partner 
it will be the same with your powers unless you control them .
you say this armor protects my body yet it suppresses my powers !
your powers are not being suppressed .
learn to use them to accomplish your purpose .
patience , my friend .
your purpose will become clear .
alakazam !
to serve your master .
humans may have created me but they will never enslave me .
so i stand alone .
and purge this planet of all who oppose me .
human and pokémon alike .
today , ash , brock and misty are taking a break from their pokémon advnturs .
and , as always , he 's ready to ndure any hardship , bear any burden with strength , stamina and a will of steel .
hungry .
need food .
i have n't aten since breakfast .
it 's my lazy-boy no-chew stew .
you there !
-you know him ?
-yeah , he 's me .
unless you 're afraid to lose !
that 's progress .
like no one ever was
to catch them is my real test
to train them is my cause
teach pokémon to understand
the power that 's inside
you 're my best friend
and the world we must defend
our hearts ar true
you did it 
you can challenge along the way
abut the place
there 's no better team
arm in arm we 'll win the fight
i know it 's my destiny
you are my best friend
a heart so true
our courage will pull us through
got to catch them
shocking that ash movd so fast .
i know we must grab rare pokémon for the boss but it would n't be a bad idea if we grabbed a bite to eat .
we did n't come here to steal a mel !
i 'm starving .
the last time you cooked , you wiped out eight of my nine lives .
master , shall i extend an invitation to these trainers as well ?
watch where you 're flying .
something for me ?
greetings , pokémon trainers .
a ferry will leave old shre wharf to take you to the islnd this afternoon .
only trainers with this invitation will be admitted .
if yu decide to attend , you must reply at once .
i guess the world 's number-one trainr wants to challenge me to a match !
to what ?
save your enrgy !
this is going to be so cool !
officer jenny , report to the ferry entrance .
i ca n't believe how fast the storm came up .
the ferry is canceled ?
-lt 's only a little rain !
-lt 's more than just rain .
listen to me .
but there are no pokémon tears today .
you will never make it !
th nurse in charge of th center disappeared last month .
come back her , or i 'll place you under arrest !
come back !
some trainers have no fear .
to them , this is just one more challenge .
that is what sets them apart and will make them pokémon masters .
good luck to all of yo .
the world 's greatest pokémon master is waitng for me .
our pokémon are n't strong enough .
they ca n't handle waves like this .
ve get you to new island fastr than you cn say fahrvergnügen .
stroke !
i think i 'm going to have one .
-they mostly live in minnesota .
are you sure this boat 's safe ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
-lt 's team rocket .
-prepar for trouble .
ash !
misty !
-not yet .
stay together 
look !
my master bids you welcome to new island .
lkindly present your invitation .
here it is , miss .
i knew i recognized that fac .
are n't you the nurse from the treatment center ?
my master awaits your arrival .
with you here , all trainers worthy of an audience with my master are present .
only the trainers capable of braving the storm are worthy in my master 's eyes .
do you mean that strm was som kind of test ?
release your pokémon from their pokéballs and join the others .
it wo n't be long before my master 's intentions are clear .
now we 'll never know what kind of party we 're missing !
-you know another way in ?
-look over there .
come on .
what tok you guys so long ?
how did you get here ?
it was easy .
hurricane winds are a breze for pidgeotto here .
guys , say hello .
i rode over on gyarados ' back .
yes , but once you train it , it 's the most dependable pokémon there is .
you ar about to meet my master .
what s that ?
this is the ruler of new island and soon th whole world .
quiet , human .
-how 's it talking ?
-lt 's psychic .
we 'll show you !
let 's go , gyarados !
chld 's play .
and how in the world did i get here ?
you have been under my control .
yu 're just a bully 
they 're pokémon .
this is the pokémon replicatin system .
what are you -- ?
let go !
i made it .
but just by a hair .
analyzing pokémon biomaterial sample .
-who 's that pokémon ?
-lt 's meowth .
but i 'm meowth 
i have n't got much time .
there was sufficient genetic material to replicate mew .
giovanni insisted n super-clones more powerful than any living pokémon .
but the creature 's anger is out of control .
-sounds like a real pokénstein .
so this must be the lab .
no .
your pokémon will not be spared .
they have disgraced themselves by serving humans .
those pokémon are nothing but slaves .
so , you say i am wrong ?
you are as pathetic as the rest .
humans and pokémon can nver be friends .
are you okay ?
go , rhyhorn .
-no !
like most pokémon trainers i too began with charmander , squirtle and bulbasaur .
but for their evolved forms i used their genetic material to clone even more powerful copies .
-copies !
your fake venusaur ca n't beat my ral one !
it may not have a nickname , but i do have a charizard .
i choose you !
charizard , i did n't say start .
your charizard is poorly trained .
saur .
i underestimted you last time , but that wo n't happen again !
shellshocker , hydro pump !
those clones are too powerful .
i 'm not giving up .
charizard , use yur speed , not power , and you 'll win .
are you okay ?
this is my world now .
i know !
it 's futile to try and escape my power .
dewgong .
but me , i got a special place in my tail for this one .
look there !
it 's pikachu !
i 'm so glad you 're okay .
-they 're fabulous fakes !
but where are the rel ones ?
the poké originals !
i am sparing your lives , for the moment .
but you can not escape your fate .
behold !
with pokémon and humans eliminated the clones shall inherit the world .
you 're mine !
can it be ?
mew .
superior to mew .
mew and mewtwo !
why do you flee from me ?
-what 's it saying ?
and that a pokémon 's real strength cmes from the heart .
now we shll see who triumphs .
pokémon are n't meant to fight .
wht can come out of it ?
now i can see how horrible fighting really is .
even the best of friends will fight sometimes .
i 'll promise never to fight again if you will .
let 's get something straight !
you was born different .
how do  know you 're not going to pull a fast on on me ?
you 're right , we do have a lot in common .
the same earth , the same air , the same sky .
maybe if we started lookng at what 's the same instead of always looking at what 's different , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove how strong thos super-clones are .
i 'd rather risk my life out in mewtwo 's storm than watch pokémon destroy each other .
those pokémon are ready to fight to the death .
someone 's got to take a stand .
someone 's got to say no and refuse to fight .
oh , no !
please , no !
i pitted them against each other .
i see now that the circumstances of one 's brth are irrelevant .
-this could be the wrst storm ever .
yo have got to fnd shelter .
the pokémon treatment center will open as a shelter .
they keep getting more beautifl every time i see them .
well , i guess we re just here because we 're here .
yes , let 's eat .
 ca n't blieve it .
-that s so weird !
what 's that ?
-l do n't see anything , ash .
-ths is paradise !
i 'd really like to go sailing in one of them catamarans .

and ... who 's we ?
a secret guild that aims to watch over the world .
every sibling is a demigod r a dragon offspring .
and you otomai son of th feca goddess .
i do n't believe a single word of your story !
if that 's a trick ...
i have xplained what will happen if you use the dofus .
you should let him rest .
not to mention he 's currently rceiving a nice big chunk of divine energy .
that 's tremendous .
princess .
it 's the occasion to get our revenge against ush .
i 'd rather have you go to the sadida kingdom wth our friends .
i 'm really a god .
nothing 's simpler !
what kind of a rt trap is that ?
looks like that sneaky ush indeed !
your turn now !
only joris left .
daddy !
ha !
here come our valiant heroes .
remington !
even if you come from the previous litter .
i 'm not the least proud that we have the same father .
that stupid god who never cred about anyne bsides himself .
you 've come to retrieve my two eliatrope dofus ?
you 'll have to earn them .
another one of his stupid games .
during which everything goes .
it 's impossible .
nothing can destroy a dofus .
really ?
yugo .
close call !
grandpa ruel !
with my eyes closed .
you 've asked for it !
you look just like pinpin when he 's on a boat .
i 'm scared for them .
i bg you !
my bighearted hro ...
we 've just learned  'm not who  thought i was .
eva .
it hurts less to be dumb .
we cn easily snatch the two dofus .
and his games are designed to give him the upper hand .
an ecaflip who does n't like to lose ..
wtch out !
always so fiery .
remi .
i 'll see if atcham is still such a fin swordsman .
boss .
remington smisse .
little brothers .
not even worth a wabbt 's fart .
it 's time to know which one of us is the best with a blade .
little brother 
bollocks 
you would n't put your bowmeow outsid in such weather .
ush is a fine strategist .
he designed a fight he could n't lose in less than thirty minutes .
we must focus on the dofus .
kitty kitty !
yeah !
with the ... the statues ...
what are you hoping for ?
to kick your furry bum !
my seawall project will soon be completed 
my son .
you do n't sound convinced .
i 'm glad to see you too .
the wedding did n't take place .
but ... where is the rest of the brotherhood ?
a much better one !
a god !
look at that cte little aura .
t belongs to the iop god !
pinpin .
show them what ?
what are you waiting fr 
show them !
do you know what a god is supposed to do ?
because i do n't have the slightest dea !
our kingdom is saved !
he wo nt be extremely helpful .
armand !
the tree of life is threatened and the whole sdida people is domed to vanish .
ths is exactly what i feared !
like i could solve any problem .
but ... you can change the world .
i 've never asked to be a reincarnation of the iop god .
you 'd let the sadida kingdom vanish ?
pinpin .
i 've decided to marry a brave iop 
sacrificing himself for the morals he believes in .
that 's the tristepin i lov .
living with such a moron ...
i warn yo .
do n't ever insult tristepin again in front of his children !
the saddas from across the kingdm have heard it to .
yugo .
but something tells me your luck is running ot .
cheater !
kitty kitty kitty !
joris .
i 've got it all under control !
they ... they 're fake !
joris .
you were dominated from start to finish .
there 's traps everywhere !
no !
wait !
that was close .
are you really sure you ... where is pinpin ?
too .
what 's the long face for ?
let 's go .
you see what i see ?
looks like our friends have found a soluton t save the sadida kingdom .
hello buddies .
it 's ... it 's  miracle .
you want to go beat up ogrest on your own ?
that 's huge !
let 's go .
iop brain .
mission accomplished .
you do n't feel like it 's a bit more than you can chew ?
no .
reunion on wakfu :
nothing !
and i will attack the sadida kingdom and its tree of life .
it 's time to go to bed .
tell us a story first .
the one f the evil pawnbroker ogre
i 'm vrgas the vil pawnbroker !
or i 'll have to eat your children .
this time he wo n't be late .
we would know it .
securty warning !
search every nook !
but why did you make them blue ?
amalia clearly said they were black .
the security of the kingdom is at stake .
he will know right away .
but fathr is exhausting hmself right before our eyes .
what about my artist s duty ?
nobody cares then ?
was n't that simple ?
enough !
everyone out !
they 're running away in the clouds .
the dragonling came back to throw himself in the boowolf 's mouth .
we captured tw enemy creatures .
i 'm just a dragonling after all .
amy ?
amalia ?
and what happened in yours ?
err ... you know ... yet you remember it .
what ?
who are you ?
alert !
boubou ?
princesses ... always sleeping in .
and we shall obstruct .
we must prevent them from bulding one of these teleporting portals master adamai told us of .
it 's the priority .
i will dispatch guards to warn her .
sadida guards ?
strange sadid guards ...
father .
who would dare say you were withered ?
i was expecting far worse .
these hoodd ones are pathetic .
i managed to bat you to exactly where i wanted you to be .
we have a score to settle ?
no one threatens my evangelyne !
look sadlygrove !
no one attacks my friends in my kingdom .
adamai !
it took you so long to come back .
grovy !
you can put me down now .
madame .
and the brotherhood will be all present .
something changed in yo ?
nice new lok here grovy .
but yu can call me grovy if you want .
nox 's troops have landed .
i would n't be surprized if nox was behind this .

their survival is at stake .
we did n't entrust you with two dofus for a stpid bargain .
especially not to wave them under th nose of the little eliatrope .
we ca n't use them .
harebourg .
however  can tell by the sound of your voice that your decision is final .
big sister .
then make sure you do n't fail .
not a moment too soon .
time goes by so fast .
chibi !
it 's the chef 's piece !
and tonight you can forget the next part of the book i 'm reding you .
at last !
a talking bird !
i 'm the emissary of princess-
help me !
amalia sheram sharm .
what does she mean with 'urgently ' ?
that 's the way it works does n't it 
we all know that 's the wy it works .
veryone on bard !
recall potions ?
i made them .
i must go get the percedal family .
yeah ... what does he mean with 'archaic ' nyway ?
yo 're a fat gobball !
you bet .
what is that ?
elely !
especially whn it 's mine !
it 's so ugly !
it 's mine .
this is n't for me .
i wanted to give it to your mom .
but everytime something happens .
but ...
nothing will happen .
it 's now or never !
mommy 
huh ...
that shows how important our kingdom is to them .
even the king of bonta- who will be of invaluable assistance .
powerful sdida 
grandpa ruel !
i welcome you .
the consequences hav been ctastrophic for the sadida kingdom .
another bout of crying from ogrst culd wipe out the entire sadida kingdom .
we 've studied all the solutions .
and whose subjects we 've nver sen .
prince armand !
adamaï .
gone ?
but found only two so far .
the count harebourg .
hey that 's great !
what ?
uh ...
i 've said something dumb ?
and ... and you 've accepted ?
who does he think he is ?
to create an unprecedented diplomatic incident ?
you know it 
us too !
count .
darkness .
you 've only sen her in pictures .
it 's beautiful .
they come from another world and i have no idea how to use them .
amalia is my best friend ... we all know there 's more to it .
while her ... she has become a queen .
cn you imagine me by her side ?
the entire sadda kingdom wold make fun of her .
so what 
ths is the princess ' decision 
th leaders of this world must sometimes take hard decisions .
and sh will need you by her side to spport her .
and i have my idea for the next two .
i 'd lke you to come with us .
yes yes yes .
you have a visitor .
canar .
your mother would never have allowed m to let her leave .
an exceptional situation calls for excptional measures .
we 're only a small reconnaissance team .
long live the princss !
we 're almost there .
i tell you ...
is it war ?
a battle ?
but surely it would have been better .
you had to guide us through some dangerous plce again .
{ \i1ch00ffff } grufon :
straight ahead !
i 'd like you to stay in the vhicle .
that 's unfair !
and it s an honor for me to welcome the brotherhood of the tofu .
come inside warm yourselves .
would you give me this honor ?
but i believe my future wife should know what i look like .
before you freeze on the spot .
you 're ruinng my focus .
mommy said we should stay inside !
som things must sty the way they are .
unlike our ancestors .
and mine holds the secret hope that our arranged marriage wo n't stay that way fr too long .
no .
i do n't think so .
but ... these mechanisms .
you want to do the same thing he did .
little yugo .
nox wanted to go back in time and demonstrated how it 's nearly impossible .
and my subjects .
we would have all the resources at our disposal to live independently from the other natons .
forever .
such nice morals .
just like amalia is ready to marry a stranger to help her people .
without subjects to protect .
but something is tickling my beard .
with what magic are you going to manage all that ?
of course .
when yugo will have tld me how they work .
sheltered frm all disasters .
you 're wrong harebourg .
what 's wrong with you ?
princess .
we 're nearly there .
and search through the place .
you 'd better give them .
it 's time to put daddy 's lessons into practice .
just try not to rush in like-
but i need to use you for a bit .
i suppose i can make an exception .
and keep moving !
you taught him well eva .
he loks like itsy-bitsy you .
carnage !
you want some ?
let go of my sister !
hats off .
your rug rats are awesome .
kids ?

daddy !
would you accept to make me a happy iop ?
yes !
and your ring ...
wait for me !
... or for ever hold your peace !
what is it ?
i beg you to respect my decison !
mali .
what a wild child !
step aside .
very well ...
you 're a crook .
it would be much simpler if you accepted to use the eliatrope dofus to carry out my plan .
wht is your choice ?
wrong answer !
your fighting style fits you well .
join me !
join me .
join me .
yugo .
the sadida 's fate s in your hands .
amalia ...
i 've always wanted to save a princess .
does it answer your queston ?
amalia !

amalia .
you were right joris .

your egoistical behavior is a danger to our plan .
especially not to wave them under the nose of the little eliatrope .
these dofus are worthless .
we ca n't use them .
i 've never seen anything so beautiful .
it 's magnifcent !
alibrt says it 's the last one he makes for you .
what 's happenng ?
you 're out of order !
you will end up in the cooking pot .

 made them .
and now i must leave you .
yeah ... what does he mean with 'archaic ' anyway ?
at my age it 's rather them who should look after me 
it 's already noon !

i wanted to ask you eva-
i guess you were right about the powerful curse .
none !
young yugo 's party should arrive soon .
i welcome you .
i 'll let you explain the situation to our friends .
the consequnces have been catastrophic for the sadida kingdom .
but only one seems viable .
master joris ?
the kings of the world have asked me to retrieve the six eliatrop dofus .
what ?
how dare you !
these dofus belong to our people !
adamaï .
even if your people is not on our world .
damaï .
i commisrate with the problems of the sadida kingdom .
what have you done with the eliatrope dofus ?
nothing .
but ...
the count harebourg .
an island which he is the absolute master .
and ... this count has made us a proposition .
he asked for your hand ?
hey that 's great !
congratulations !
pinpin !
and a small price to save our forests .
h demands only the brotherhood of the tofu s an escort .
who does he think he s ?
very bright idea .
you know it .
i 'll get ready .
count .
darkness .
it 's bautiful .
they come from another world and i have no idea how to use them .
i think someone can tell me .
you look so dissapointed 
we 've nevr talked about your feelings for amalia .
malia is my best friend ... we all know there 's more to it .
this is the princess ' decision 
the leaders of this world must sometimes take hard decisions .
it must be very important if you make the effort to ask me .
and i have my idea for the next two .
i 'd like you to come with us .
i 'll try to survive .
stop .
yes yes yes .
it 's very cold around frigost .
evangelyne .
your mother would never hve allwed me to let her leave .
father .
with adamaï nd otomai we will leave at the same time s amalia 's convoy .
good .
three masters wo n't be too many for such a quest .
i promise .
my little girl !
i 'm counting on you to keep an eye on armand .
long live the sadida kingdom !
my dear yugo .
we 're almost there .
i tell you ...
but surely it would have been better .
straight ahead !
you have arrived !
and it 's an honor for me to wlcome the brotherhood of th tof .
but i believe my future wife should know what i look like .
it 's beautiful ... your castle is a rapture for the eyes .
princess amali .
i 'm bored .
can you be less noisy please ?
you 're ruining my focs .
you 're the baby !
or fed an entire people ?
as the kingdom of his sadida friend crumbles under the waters .
our union will allow our two kingdoms to survive and thrive .
unlike our ancestors .
respect your half of the bargain .
have a kama to spare grandpa ?
of course .
but ... these mechanisms .
you want to do the same thing he did .
not the past .
and my subjects .
what others ?
who will it worry ?
with what magic are you going to manage all that ?
of course .
when yugo wll have told me how they work .
the power of dofus is to great to be mastered .
amali !
what 's wrong with you ?
i 've promsed to marry the cont in exchange for the security of the sadida kingdom .
fine .
the count wants answers n the dofus .
it 's time to put daddy 's lessons into practice .
i suppose i can make an exception .
you taught him well eva .
carnage !
you want some 
let go of my sister 
shut up !
kids ?
then surrender .
no way !
fun time is up .
you have my word .
do n't worry kids .
you speak as if you were on the brink of war .
really 
i love you amalia .
really .
is it truly the case ?
this ... this is why he needs the sadida kingdom .
he wants to burn the forests !

what is it ?
get away from him !
nothing else !
what a wild child !
i mean you no harm !
you do n't understnd .
in the end my actions are your responsibilty .
it 's up to you to choose what you prefer .
you 'll lose everything !
amalia ...

we are able to go help him out .
lady echo has warnd us about the consequencs if we oppose them to ogrest 's primordial dofus .
you sound like yo believe her theories .
i do n't trust this wman myself .
but we should not underestimate the impact of a clash between two beings wielding six dofus each .
my ogrest is drowning the world merely by crying .
your brother already sad that amalia .
pinpin is our friend .
we ca n't do nothing while his life is t risk .
lady echo has said-
lady echo !
elely has a problem .

i 've seen him .

using them could destroy the world of twelve !
you do n't sem yourself .
but we ca n't risk the world .
you are siph .
what 's wrong with you ?
you can tell me something only us could knw .
he was complaining every time he cut some meat .
we evn had his initials engraved on the blades .
you ca n't even recognize your own brother .
you 've had some difficult times recently .
i ...
i wanted-
elely can communicate with pinpin .
maybe .
but you need the dofus .
and pinpin is like a brother for us .

i 'm a fast learner !
of course !
no .
yugo .

if i do listen to you ad ' ...
i love you bro .
i prmise to get him back in on piece .
what about adamaï ?
we could n't find an agreement .. but he will get over it .
things may get nasty over there .

that 's suicide !
try to distract him while i get closer .

hey yugo !
each blow i take weakens the world .
i can take hits as long as needed .
ogrest !
i 'm sorry my son .
i 've done everything i could .
ogrest .
daddy otomai is a liar !
hey fatty !
this one must have hurt .
or ogrest is gong to hurt him .
daddy otomai should never have dne that ... right .
but i have an idea .
i 've used too much wakfu .
we must rgroup if we do n't want to get massacred .
and we ca n't do anything .
looks like your powers have failed .
i 've had an issue .
are you still there ?
the world of twelve is in dangr .
goultard wants to speak to you .
yes ?
what 's the situation ?
d you have a solution ?
but you can choose whre it does .
you wo n't get another try .
focus your efforts to protect the tree of life !
trust yugo .

master otomai .
may i use the occasion to introduce a surprise guest .

are you crazy ?
ca nt you see he 's noffensive ?
my name is elely !
creating one of the worst disasters this world has ever known 
right ?
but do n't worry yugo .
even f you did n't bring him back in one piece .
what about the eliatrope dofus ?
i 've entrusted them to someone who wo n't lose them .
no one should use them evr agin

i se you 've put the curtains up 
hello .
you 're back .
ma'am is so vulgar .
i 've been brought here by lord harrogate to make his colliey pay .
what exactly is the problem , dear ?
the real problem is we ca n't get the coal out in sufficient quantities .
and , therefore , it 's to expensive at that price , we ca n't sell it .
what will you have to do , father ?
it 's not fair !
do n't wory , i 'll wait for you when i get thr .
oh , no you wo n't .
bye , daddy .
just going to fly my kite , mother !
i do n't want her playing with any of those rough miners ' children .

his lordship is expecting you , sir .
now then , sandman , what do you propose to do about this colliey of mine ?
uh , no , thank you .
yes , yes , i know all about tht .
now , as my new manager , tell me , what do you propose to do about that ?
i 'd lik to explre the possibility of using machney in the pits , my lord .
machiney 
are you suggesting we might use machiney instead of miners , perhaps ?
um ...
but it might be possible to brng the coal from the face to the shaft by means of machiney instead of ponies .
hm , yes , yes , at least , i am prepared to explore that idea .
hm .
go away , you horrible dog !
go hom !
it 's a girl up a tree .
come on .
g away  you horrible dog !
go away !
can you get down ?
yes , of course i can .
you best get yourself down first .
com on , that 's the way .
go on .
be careful !
i ca n't run fast enough to gt it up in the air properly .
dave could .
pull , dave , pull !
it 's nerly there !
run faster , dave !
there it goes !
come on , kite , come on !
you 've done it !

oh , yes , there is , the way you said it .
i do n't cre !
i 'm not a lady !

ladies do n't fight .
i wonder what it 's like down the pit .
we go down all the time .
we help bert with the pones .
we go to the stables near eveyday .
w help look after 'em .
you 'll miss them when they 're gone then , wo n't you ?
gone ?
what can they do ?
come on .
sit down and have your tea .
what will happen to them ?
how should i know ?
you 're the one who left my father in the pit .
i do n't care .
he 's no right to b here in our house .
it 's his house now .
to keep us in food and clothes ...
nor do i .
go to bed , both of you !
come on .
shove over a bit .
no , he did n't .
luke was injured in the fall , and your father went in to rescue him .

he was brought up unconscious .
well , that 's the lt .
the rest of my men will be here on saturday .
right .
but you get down , and i 'm bigger than you are .
but not much .
alice !
evening , bert .
if i see those boys going down again , you 'll be dismissed .

and you know which one this is ?
no .
flash !
watch it .
oh , flash , you would n't hrt me , would you ?
machiney ?
but that 's wonderful .
wonderful ?
what do you mean , wonderful ?
if they 've no more work , they 'll be brought out of the mine and let out into the fields .
they 'll run about in the snshine and be happy and safe .
that 's what you think , is it ?
alice !
this is mss coutts .
how do you do , alice ?
i 'm sure we 'll soon get alice back into ladylike ways again .
mothr , whn will father be home ?
would you like to go with her and show her the school room ?
good night , dave .

bluey .
nd no tubs to pull , neither .
they 'r free , are n't they ?
flash , you 're a beauty ...
morning  clara .
what you wnt to know .
it 's about the ponies .
and i want to know what will happen to them .
no , father would n't d a thing like that !
runner !
engineers came at him with a bale of wre and frightened him .
what 's up , alice ?
l wanted to ask you something .
show me exactly where they 've stopped .
now they re lyng the cable here .
run along home .
please , father .
what will happen to them ?
not used to fending for themselves .
who pays fr their feed ?
what 's the matter ?
ther 's only one thing to do .
how 'll we do it ?
bert would help us .
you 're not to mentin it to bert .
but you said ...
he 'd b afraid of lsing his place .
then how can we get to them ?
h , they always keep plans of all the workings .
in your father 's office .
he says i ca n't take this stuff down .
yes , but where ?
let 's look up here .
yo know  for winding the cag up and down .
father , how does a winding engine work ?
miss coutts , i wnt my daughter to be a young lady .
but i also want her to take an interest in the things about her .
this should go in there .
no , it should n't .
yo 're doing it ll wrong .
no , i 'm not 
now all it needs is some grease .
what do you want ?
i do n't know where the water comes from .
if you dd n't pump the pit out vey day , it would soon be flooded .
hey , we 'd best not get too mucky or they 'll wonder where we 've been .
it must work .
it mst .
it does n't help .
and how do you think you 'll do that ?
you and tommy and the little miss ?
it should n't be too hard .
but not for too long .
someone 'll hear it .
well , i must be off to the stables .
me ?
i 'll not tell anyone .
and the stables .
oh , give over .
ta .
good luck , dave .
aye , good luck .
was it an explosion ?
aye .
how far will he have to go to get through to the present workings ?
them levels run for miles .
tommy !
alice .
i 'm afraid alice has ben given to much libem , mrs. sandman .
clara tells me she went out for a walk .
you 'll gt lost as well .
it 's him !
i knew you could do it !
hooray !
we can bring 'em here .
only a shepherd in winter with his sheep .
the lead miners used to work here , but their pit 's been closed for years .
yes , this 'll be the best place to keep the ponies .
now then , there 's some fodder in the barn behind the pithead .
we can get it up here  nd then ...
bert says the pit belongs to him and to all them that died there .
who was that i saw with yo ?
yes .
you mean because your father is only the manager of the mine ?
yes , miss coutts .
come on , love , you 'll be late .
dave , they 're connecting up the machiny today , and tomorrow the pones will be brought up and sent to barnsley .
 'm not botherd .
do n't you want to say goodbye ?
not even old flash ?
and some others , too , i should n't wonder .
_y .
sam , any work for me and me mate tomorrow ?
might be , luke .
how many of us will be put out of work ?
none  i hope .
now the manager says ...
ay .

aye 
has alice gone to bed already ?
i do n't think so .
that 's all right .
here , you cary on stoking 
them engineers have n't got their machines working up thre ?
up at face .
that 's a winding engine .
it comes from the old workings .
and yet , it 's been blocked off since five men were killed there 
com on  lads .

offyou go  flash .
that 's the end of the ponies .
you know why .
i 'm going to look for them .
come on , good lad .
ring the bell again , tommy .
oh , what 's the matter with her ?
we 'll be stuck down here , wo n't we ?
we 'll be stuck down here with th ponies until there 's nothing left of us but skeletons .

cary on up to the pit and get below , eh ?
right ?
take old flash up first .
leave them where they ar .
what ?
bert , get them ponies laded .
l said leave them .
leave them be .
them ponies have served us well .
helped us to win coal and earn our living .
will you let them be taken off to be slaughtered like they was so much raw meat ?
what is it ?
get those ponies back to the station , put in the vans .
we did nt earn more money yesterday when we were laid off .
there 's dslocation at first , when we 're changing ...
aye !
that 's the dislocation !
they 're changin ' over from men to machins .
we never asked for machines .
_ye .
that machiney is here t prtect your livelihood .
and if you were n't such fools ...
you can work your own pit , mister , with yur own machiney , if you think it 's so fine 
want to lose a day 's pay ?
get down there .
and if you put them ponies in that van , we 'll never come back .
now , i 'm not going to punish you .
and are vey sory for it .
well 
they might .
dave , i do n't know what you ve got to grin about .
are n't you glad thy 're not gn na kill the ponies ?
ponies .
ponies wo n't put food in your belly or clothes on your back .
and , as for you , i 'm not having you under my feet all day .
you can have your breamast tomorrow , then get out of the house .
they better be back at work by then , or else ...
no , they call it anthracitus .
when he was down underground , he knew hs way about , so nobody noticed .
mm ?
yes , my lord .
yes .
all right , all right .
what 's th trouble this time ?
i suppose they want more money , hmm ?
the men feel that in replacing the ponies with ...
shh , shh .
please  please .
now you told me that this machiney would , in time , or should , in time , make the colliey begin to pay .
not a bit .
quiet , me beauties .
those dreadful miners .
there they are on strike , and they have the impudence to be seen out here playing with their dogs .
hey !
we 've won !
the manager 's called a meeting at the pit .
come on !
for good .
l mean what i say .
then we 'd b assured of work for the whole year ?
what about the ponies ?
no place for ponies in this pit .
we ca n't take an ultimatum .
it 's a colliey village .
aye .
if pit closes , we 're out on street  all of us .
and our wives and bairns .
nowhere t live .
no food and no work .
aye .
nowhere to find none , neither .
there 's nt a pit in yorkshire that has n't got some men idle .
f colliey closes , we 're done for .
it 's agreed , then .
we go back .
we should have a vote !
let 's vote .
them as wnts to go back to work tomorrow .
come on , get a move on !
by next week w should drve south from the forward heading .
well , it would have made it easier for the men to go back with a good heart .
get out of the way there .
one of the engineers .
well ?
who are they ?
mrs. armstrong , sir .
hey , do n't touch it .
all right , lad , all right .
aye .
i 'm gon na ty the other heading .
mind how yu g .
one spark from your boots might be enough to set it all off .
we think thy 're there 
l see .
and there 's no way of getting through to them ?
but it 's knocked out the main ventilation shaft .
and the afterdamp is vey bad .
it ignits .
there 's no other possible way of reaching them ?
no , my lord , and it may be as much as 48 hours before we can get
you 'll b suffocated ten minutes after you left the shaft bottom .
lik we did with the ponies .
thy got the old winding engine workin ' again .
and we ca n't take the lad down .
flash does n't need lghts .
alice !

father 's gong down again 
come on .

they probbly think we 're dead , anyway .
just a minute .
it 's up to the limit .
we do nt have much time .

moonlight sy-3 redy for takoff 
ten , nine , eight , seven , six , fiv , four , three , two , one , zero !
all manner of fish are cultivatd here , and on the surface is monsterland ,  research habitat of fearful giant monsters .
f they attempt to leave , it activates a restraint system .
the rason rodan ca n't fly beyond a set boundary t sea is that a perimeter of magnetic barriers has been set up .
morover , enough food is cultivated here for the monsters that they can each et their fill .
everything is in order .
i feared you 'd run away , this being your first encounter .
i hope you 'll help us as we closely study them .
yes , sir .
oh , katsuo !
the moon base .
yeah .
but i 'm doing fine , as you can see .
really ?
just joking .
i 'd like dr. yoshida to come .
the director is in tokyo for a confernce .
hello ?
hello !
hello 
power station !
power station !
this is the operator .
what happened ?
it s gas !
zoom in .
try again .
doctor , we got through .
did new volcanic activity cause this ?
what is that ?
this was definitely a planned attack .
ths is the moscow broadcasting office .
rodan has attacked moscow .
it appeared above the city and is even now continuing its rampag of destruction .
rodan is in moscow ?
what 's going on here ?
a subterranean monster has just appeared from the arc de triomphe .
no , the world 's tresure is about to be destroyed by this monster .
the monument is collapsing .
it 's ben destroyed .
paris is being destroyed by this subterranean monster .
we 've just received a new report .
godzilla has appeared in new york .
godzilla is in new york .
what about you , dr. yoshida ?
i have no answers right now .
why has n't tokyo been attacked when it 's closest to monsterland ?
i 'd very much like to know why myslf .
moonlight sy-3 !
hey !
yes  sir .
it wo n't get away today .
this is more important .
that 's a ufo out there .
it 's dangerous to get any closer .
moonlight sy-3 , what 's wrong ?
go .
i do n't know what 's hppened on earth , but it 's absurd to ask us for help .
they did n't ask .
it 's  rcall order .
you 'll land at monsterland n the bonin islands .
receiving guidance beam .
roger that .
stand by for atmospheric entry !
someome may have cmmndeered it .
ascertain their identity and objective .
they may resist .
roger .
no sign of radioactivity or sulfur dioxide .
all right , let 's go .
what 's going on here ?
welcome .
doctor !
hllo again .
why are you here ?
what 's all this about , doctr ?
cooperate nothing .
you let all the monsters free while director yoshida was away .
they 're not running free .
we have them under remote control .
take a look .
godzilla is in the pacific .
w can call them back to this island anytime we want .
i 'll introduce you to the inventor of this remote-control system .
follow us .
welcome , gentlemen .
i imagne you hav lots of questions .
how does destroying our cities establish anything ?
sme degree of sacrifice is unavoidable .
what ?
kilaak ?
belief does n't matter .
that barrier is completely unbreakable .
getting you out of here .
call them .
c'mon .
hurry up !
kyoko !
kyoko !
fall back !
listen , otani .
the only way we can help is if you answer .
do n't you get that ?
where 's their new base ?
please , tell me .
our friendship wo n't make any difference to them 
doctor !
hands off .
there 's no point n moving him now !
we need to go !
halt !
scalpel .
it 's some kind of metal i 've never seen .
i agree .
they came to get him for fear we 'd find this .
there must be  transmitter somewhere .
i 'll search from the air .
yes , sr .
look , i 'm busy .
yeah , but still ...
there 
it 's that !
let me see .
over there !
sy-3 ?
we went to the moon with takeshi that time .
is he doing well ?
we 're investigating a sgnal .
please observe this object , which appears to be a stone .
the unsc has confirmed it as the kilaak monster-control device wreaking havoc upon our wrld .
what 's more , they 're being discovered in the most unexpected places .
one was even discovered in a coconut on guam .
we estmate its effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km .
so the monsters are likely being contrlled by devices in their respective areas .
regarding the kilaaks and their prsoners from monsterland ...
tetsuo ise , age 30 .
kyoko manabe , age 23 .
thank yu , miss .
you can go .
we beg your pardon .
it does .
prepre to attack .
do we have prof the kilaaks are behnd it ?
there 's a subterranean monstr at amagi .
they must be using a new control device now .
thank you , doctor .
it 's kyoko manabe .
let 's talk elsewhere .
no , i want to talk to all of you here .
do n't tell me again !
especially the reporters .
amd if we do n't , they 'll destroy us with the monsters .
that 's coercion , not negotiation !
i 'm talking to everyone here .
you be quiet .
what are you doing ?
she was being controlld with these .
we 'll investigate them immediately .
kyoko !
good , you 'r awake .
it 's me .
it 's all right .
i ...
yellow poison gas !
she has no memory of when she was being controlled .
all right then .
prepare to attack .
yes , sir !
sy-3 has begun its decent !
good .
halt descent !
emergency ascent !
all right .
open fire !
hey , what 's wrong ?
it 's anguirus !
what ?
damn ...
yeah .
determine where it s landing .
captain , rnning away sucks .
let 's fight back .
it wo n't follow us where there 's no air .
advance !
keep advancing !
ssprad out !
spread out 
first platoon , take the left forest road !
second platoon , to the right !
this way !
what 's wrong ?
i 'm all right .
let 's go .
damn it ...
it wo n't budge .
i bet it 's a kilaak cave .
our only choice s to move forward .
all right .
okay , get back .
i knew it .
so what 's the important business ?
proclmation ?
please listen carefully , major tada in particular .
erth does n't belong to humans alne .
the area beneath the mt .
fuji volcnic chain now belongs to th kilaaks .
understand ?
what ?
let 's go .
that 's the tre source of the sgnal !
we 'll send sy-3 to the moon .
and do n't take off those spacesuits till you deal with the kilaaks .
proceed to the target .
take a look at your chart .
yes , sir .
watch out for ufos and approach from a low altitde .
we 'll be on our way then .
our approach vector is 45 degrees to port .
from the sea of tranquility to the sea of vapors .
that 'll bring us to the casaini crter .
roger .
it 'd be surprising if we were n't .
fll stop .
prepare to descend .
all right , here we go .
prepare the rover !
preparing the rover !
close the fuel valves !
activate coling system !
activating cooling system !
coolant pressure ?
at max !
what ?
at this rat , the fuel tank will explode !
no tim .
yes , sir !
fire !
commander .
we detected a flare at cassini .
i hope this works .
if they fail , we 'll be the next to die .
we might get vaporized along with this base before long .
yes , sir .
okada , yoshikawa , arima , come with me .
come on 
dismount and disable anything important .
understood , sir .
even the most advanced science will have some weak point .
over there too !
when we destroyed the wall , the temperature dropped .
gather them up .
this is the control device 's core .
damn thing 's still running .
moon base .
moon base !
no answer ?
none at all .
the base wo n't answer , and the signal 's still there .
let 's detach the excavator !
detach the maser .
gt a high-voltage cable !
screwdriver .
i think our only choice is to assume they failed .
okay , swtch it on !
what 's wrng ?
i do n't care !
turn it on and up !
it worked !
hurry !
yes , it is .
now we know why they were after the mt .
at constant high temperatures , they can probably live forever .
forever ?
that 's right .
heavy use of freeze rays .
yes , sir .
godzlla !
again ?
you 're there ?
yes .
excellent .
doctor , this is no time for that !
our control device is complete , so we thought we 'd test it on godzilla .
the monsters are on our side .
it and the primeval aokigahara forest are silent , as if awaiting the impending full-scale giant-monster attack against the kilaak base .
rodan ?
oh , there 's one !
now mothra has appeared .
it 's anguirus from the asagiri plateau on the left .
truly a sight to see 
following anguirus are manda , baragon , and gorosaurus .
one after another , they 're bearing down on the kilaak base here in aokighara .
flying over lake motsu with the southern alps in the horizn .
will godzlla lead the opening charge ?
this force of giant monsters with godzilla at its head is truly a sight to behold .
we ca n't control him .
what do we do ?
earth 's monsters are mo match for him .
the monsters are ready .
this is an amazing struggle !
a burning monster ?
it 's hading straight for us !
evacuate !
the kilaaks are signaling us !
what nw ?
do we attack ?
fire drgon can reduce tokyo to ashes in two to three hours .
the monsters are on the offensive .
get away from here .
g !
fire dragon , 15 degres ahead to port !
prepare to fire freeze-ray missiles !
yes , sir !
yes , sir !
firing !
do we fire ?
yeah 
fire !

so i 'll simply disregard this .
sunny days ahead .
an unexpected cold front ..
combined with increasd levels of precipitation , which in turn ,
has resulted ...
in snow .
keep going .
snow , indeed .
groundbreaking research project .
right away .
well , sir , i had n't really given it much thought .
i was hoping to be able to talk to you about the possibility
of a pay raise -- a small one , of course .
hmm 
you know what i want ?
turn on the tv ,
this is from the signature collcton --
just once in my lifetime ,
ok .
and then to top it all off ...
hello !
well , no one did , sir .
it was quite unexpected .
and poof !
yes , sir .
well , it 's ..
i mean ...
but the pattern of this storm
is unlike any other in history .
instead of moving across ts target ,
it seems t have just appeared and spread out in all directions .
so , in measuring the amount of snowfall ,
ok , wait , wait .
and , hey , gess what ?
i 'm asleep !
well , mr. martino , as t --
let 's face it .

yes , sir !
oh , oh , oh !
and people slipping on ice --
yes , sir !
oh , and , hadley .
about that pay raise ?
rest assured that as of this moment , i 'm doing everything in my power
to trace its origin .
the smell of sockye salmon wending through bakersfild
we would get a sort of mixture
creating a sort of meteorological lambada .
if you will --

santa , are you all right ?
hah .
ha-ha-ha 
what do you mean ?
what i man is i got ta go see charlie , and i want you to convince the elves that toy santa is me 
hmm .
have you seen that thing 
keep the elves at a distance and say that i 've changed my look , it 'll work .
if anybdy can do this , it 's you , number one .
better and fresher somehow than he has in years .
you could almost say there 's a ...
most importantly , he 's very happy with his new look , and i would caution you all not to point or stare or use the word plstic .
okay .
thank you .
back to work , please .
comet , because i do n't want to tak prancer .
 want to take a trip with yo .
we know what that means .
it 's beautiful .
it really is .
it has a power reserve that measures how much magic you have left .
it 's at 10 .
that shold be enogh .
but if you use up any magic for any reason , the level drops .
uh-oh .
for you to come back !
thank you .
it 's on stop .
scott !
we shold get going .
oh , okay .
how do you always know when there 's a prblem ?
i see you when you re sleepin  .
 know when you 're awake .
this time he defaced school property .
he 's waiting for us in principal newman 's office .
something about her makes me want to deface public property .
both :
principal newman .
then i would n't spend so much time with you ,
oh .
good morning , principal newman .
keep this up and you will spend your life stabbing trsh .
have  nice trip .
it 's an affront to authority and blatant disrespect for property .
if this continues , i 'll have no other recourse than to suspend ...
excuse me .
s am i. charlie , we 're all worried about you .
it feels like you 're trying to get someone 's attention .
what 's bothering you ?
neil .
neil , any theories ?
here we go .
scott , you 're not helping .
excuse me , neil .
it 's four weeks until christmas .
that 's a holiday in december 
oh .
that takes effort .
and mney .
yo know what you did is wrong .
and you 're not gon na do it again .
promise me .

he w n't do it again .
it most certainly is not !
yeah .

god job , curtis .
ho , ho , ho .

well , let 's try to be specific , shall we ?
i 'll take a look at it over at my desk .
i 'll memorize everything in the book .
i can barely read ths .
how about a nice chocolatey cocoa ?
ah !
whoa !
that 's delicious !
whoa !
i think santa feels a little buzz !
whoo !
and you only have 27 days to find a wife or you 're out ?
yeah .
yes , sigmnd .
i was afraid i 'd mess up the first time .
there 's never been a better santa .
i appreciate that .
believe it or not , you have a great capacity for love 
hmm .
have yo ever helped anyone ?
ever ?
as promising as this sounds , i do n't need help with this area .
a double letterman .
so as far as dating ges ,
i think if anybody can stir up the old moj , it would be moi .
i do n't think there 's a woman out there that does n't want a piece of this .
that 's amazing !
say hello to your elves .
santa , when you said the bigger wheels , is this what you meant ?
you 're doing great .
dial it down on the ho-ho-ho 's , but otherwise , you 're gold .
ho , ho , ho !
why do n't you just say it ?
they 're happy .
they 're working hard .
that 's what i 've been saying all alng .
things have gotten a little too sloppy around here 
sloppiness means mistakes .

but randolph did n't want a teacher travelling round with us .
she sked why i did n't give randolph instruction .
can you find people in italy to do that kind of thing ?
yes , in geneva .
i 'd never been in so many hotels until i came to europe .
there are a number .
i 'm glad ...
so many intimate friends have been .
whenever i put on a paris dress i feel i 'm in europe .
pardon ?
but i do n't know where the society keeps itself here .
do you ?
are you takng the cure ?
i 've always had plenty of it .
there 's lots there .
i 've more friends there .
i 've had a lot of gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the château de chillon .
no .
i want to go , dreadfully .
 would n't leave without seeing it .
you can drive , or take the steamer .
randolph says it 's too old to be interesting .
mother s afraid to leave hm alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find someone to stay with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd rather go to chillon .
she 's not much bent on going , anyway .
we ?
yu and i ?
oh , eugenio .
to chillon ?
mademoiselle has arranged it 
i wo n't be happy till we go .
you 're really american ?
she will tell you all about me .
the carriage is waiting .
they 're horrbly common , my dear frederick .
one does one 's duty by just ignoring them .
milk ?
i ca n't not .
she has that charming look they have .
and she dresses to perfection .
ca n't think where they get their taste .
after all , she 's not a comanche indian 
does she ?
there 's no other name for it .
very lkely they 've never seen a man with such good manners 
probably corresponds to the young lady 's idea of a count .
you might have mentioned you had mad her acquaintance .
pray , what did you say ?
who is a thousand tmes obliged to yo .
you do n't say that as if you believed it .
how does one say it ?
i should think that proved just the contrary .
how long had you known her when this project was formed ?
you 've been in vevey 24 hurs .
that she 's a horror .
she fully intends to .
then i must decline the honour of her acquaintance .
think what , sir ?
that she 's the sort of girl who expects a man to carry her off ?
you 're too innocent .
my dear aunt , i 'm not too innocent .
too guilty , then .
yes .
this is the stupidest evening .
have you been alon ?
she 's gone to bed ?
she 's gone to try and put randolph to bed .
let 's hope she persuades him .
he does n't like her to talk to him .
how 's your aunt ?
not well .
how observant !
it 's a lovely description .
i guess we are .
she tells me she does .
why did n't you say so ?
you need n't be afraid .
why should she want to know me ?
she is exclusive .
here comes mother .
are you sure it 's her ?
she does n't see you .
she does n't approve of my walking with you .
or i would n't think i 'm natural .
i do n't knw why you wear this .
i do .
is randolph in bed ?
it is n't as bad as it was at dover .
he should make it up .
he just ca n't .
h is tiresome .
he would n't even go to that castle .
your daughter has allowed m the hnour of being her guide .
or on the boat .
i do n't see ...
we only want to see the principal ones .
we saw several in england .
yes , but chillon is worth seeing .
it seems there is n't anything she would n't undertake .
you 're sure you wo n't join us ?
do let her go .
you have n't spoken to me for half an hor .
i want you to tak me out in a boat .
i got you to say something .
i do n't think s .
i love how he says t .
it would be .
why wait for anything ?
it 's eleven o'clock .
i 'm going on a boat .
at this hour , mademoiselle ?
tell her she ca n't .
as mademoisell pleases .
i just wnt a little fuss .
i 'm puzzled .
what are you doing ?
no .
goodnight .
we re gon na mke it !
wait !
we made t 
a mass of towers on a block of boulders .
i have a passon for steamboats .
why are you so solemn ?
i was grinning from ear to ear .
your ears re very close .
come on , let 's be the first ones off .
what 's up here ?
excuse me .
i 'm sure you know all that .
the point was , the castle was n't all constructed at the same tme .
betwen the 9th and 1 3th cycles 
four years .
is that how long you 've ben here ?
oubliette .
the castle completely dominated the pass through the alps .
it 's an impression you give .
be careful !
t 's very rotten .
why are you rushing ?
what 's through here ?
look !
what ?
hello .
l wonder what s through there .
wait for me .
miss miller !
amen !
do n't forget me .
my goodness .
lord byron carved his name on it .
wrote that poem about him .
it was during the reformation .
there are seven pllars of gothic mold in chillon 's dungeons deep and old
i never saw a man who knw so much 
do n't you wan na teach randolph ?
you 're not in business .
but i do have engagements .
i do n't believe it .
i 'm cold now .
wait for me 
you see the design of this fireplace here ?
do n't say a thing like that !
wait , there 's so much more to see .
i think you 're horrid !
does n't she give you more than two days off at a time ?
please stop .
are n't you ?
at ny rate , i will certinly come .
well , there 'll b a carriage .
you were saying ?
and miss miller .
the fortune huntrs are of the inferior sort .
she takes them to such houses as her nose is allwed into .
where is the mther ?
i have n't the least idea .
splendid .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he sems prodigiously busy .
i find it difficult to take tea .
i think i might go .
whethr or not being vulgar is being bad is a question for the metaphysicians 
they 're bad enogh to blush for .
who is the portrit for ?
i 'm presntng each one with a copy .
it 's ludicrously expensive .
yo stayed here 
but there are some singular stories about her .
but i 'm not through with you .
hllo , mr and mrs johnson .
madam miller .
i want you to meet the sinclairs 
hello  miss miller !
i 'm ever so happy to see you !
i 'm so happy to see you .
here 's your mother at last .
and i know you .
i arrived today .
we got a bigger place .
i knew you 'd say something .
i hpe you 've been well .
i 've got it , too .
father 's got it bad .
in schenectady he 's at th very top .
we 'd heard so much about it .
you never were .
we 've seen places ahead of rome .
it 'll turn around and go the right way some tim .
yes .
i 've heard .
she goes round more than i do .
she knows a great many gentlemen .
she thinks there 's nothing lke rome .
at vevey , yu would n't stay when i asked .
he went to geneva .
eugenio will raise something fierce .
delighted to hear it .
an intimate friend .
mr giovanelli .
he wants to know some americans .
he 's tremendously clever .
mother , eugenio 's really gon na raise something .
we 'd better go back .
you go .
i 'm gon na walk round a little .
alone ?
it 's not safe .
give her that medicine .
mrs walker , yo 're too perfect .
i 'm meeting a friend .
is it mr giovanelli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
what a fuss .
if mr winterbourne were as polte as he pretends , he 'd offer to walk me there 
i knew her ..
eugeno says we have the best hotel rooms in rome .
i thought it would be awfully quiet and pokey .
i was sure we 'd be going round with one of thse old men who explain about pictures .
i know ever so many people .
i think i like the englsh best .
shall we buy some candy for poor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk you back .
i 'm not helping you find him .
i 'll find him .
you sound to imperious .
you should listen to a gentleman sometimes , the right one .
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ver meet .
not t all .
to america ?
ever ?
never .
i do .
thank yo .
mr winterbourne !
mr winterbourne ?
she ask you come .
excuse me .
women follow wherever he goes .
walking with two men .
fifty people have noticed her .
it 's a shame to make a fuss .
or to let her ruin herself .
she 's inncent .
she 's reckless .
the world will see she 's not running wild .
hello again .
this is h .
this is mrs walker , who so sweetly asked you to her party .
i 'm not five yars old .
come in here and i will tell you 
i do n't thnk i want to know .
gracious me !
if this is improper , i 'm improper .
have a lovely ride .
all right .
your honesty 's only put her off .
she meant no harm .
that 's what i thought a month ago 
sitting in corners with mysterius italians .
dancing all evening with one partner .
receiving callers late at night .
he must be edified by what he sees .
we should n't pay attentin to servants .
her only falt is to think giovanelli a gentleman , when he 's a poor imitation .
he 's some third-rate artist .
she 's naturally indelicate .
two dys .
that remark about your going to geneva !
i think you should stop .
giving her any further opportunity to expose herself .
i ca n't do anything as enlightened as that .
if you wish to rejoin her ...
as you wish .
finally .
it 's the first time i 've ever been to a prty alone , especially in italy .
des n't she intend ...
... to favour us with her company ?
dasy dressed before dinner .
a friend is there , the gntleman she was bringing .
mr giovanelli .
i guess they 'll come before very long .
i 'm sorry she 's coming in that way .
 wo n't speak to her .
i 'm afraid you thoght i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made him go over them .
you are hungry ?
yes .
the singing kept hm awake .
 do hope this is the finale .
she 's worked her way over to your old college chum .
they were quite restless there .
we paired off .
that was better .
he seems more in control of his limbs than yo are .
he 'd never dare ask a young italian lady to walk about the streets with him .
what nice girl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flirt only with me .
i would n't flirt with you .
you 're too stiff .
you say that too often .
if it makes you angry , i 'll say it again .
it does n't exist here .
poor mother .
and neither of us is flrting .
we 're real intimate friends .
i see .
i just love that song .
especially in winter .
your friend has n't moved all evening .
really ?
why do n't you brak in ?
she 's a disgrace .
thank you so much .
goodnght .
i certainly do n't want her to leave them without me .
buonanotte .
that was very cruel .
she never enters my drawing room again .
preoccupied , anyway .
you were supposed t come by for me .
i do n't know what .
miss miller .
do you think so ?
she thinks him the finest gentleman .
expects a commission if the fellw succeeds in marrying her .
i 'm not sure she 's capable of thought .
i certainly see no evidence of it .
she romps on from day to day , from hour to hour , as they did in the golden age .
i can imagine nothing more vulgar .
th little roman .
he 's perfectly respectble .
a lawyer , i think .
but he ca n't really hpe to pull it off .
if it is n't mr wnterbourne !
god afternoon !
am i interrupting ?
not at all 
mr giovanlli will nw sing ..
hurry , mr winterbourne .
eugenio 's taken him and mother to buy shoes .
no , you sing your sng .
the most difficult song i never hear .
ever hear .
come on , we 're waiting .
mr winterbourne is getting impatient .
 'd njoy that .
then maybe i 'll sing .
here we go .
bravo !
encore !
no , i think he has heard me .
very much .
all right .
i thought he was with you .
that boy will be the death of me .
xcuse me .
mr giovanelli 's gon na sing for you both .
but they 're always together .
she says she ai n't .
i see .
mr giovanelli has promised to tell me .
of course .
randolph !
looking for me .
mr winterbourne .
you think i go out too much with him .
everyone does .
you 'll find they do .
they 're not invitng you places .
have n't you noticed ?
i noticed you and that you are as stiff as a ramrod .
i 'm not half as stiff as some .
try going to see them .
what will they do ?
you know what that means ?
what mrs walker did ?
i would n't think you 'd let people be so unkind .
do you ?
your mother says she believes you 're engaged .
i guess she does .
but since you 've mentioned it , i am engaged .
she wants me to come to geneva 
freddie ?
you did nt say ten words at dinner .
i do n't know .
i saw her today .
where ?
she 's certainly pretty .
she 's a mystery .
what ?
yes , i suppose .
she 's carried away with giovanelli .
i do n't think you 'v missed a thing .
are you sure ?
yes .
how long have you been here ?
well ...
i se .
for myself i hve no fear .
but when was mademoiselle ever ...
i was bound to se the colosseum by moonlight .
we 've had the most beautiful time .
 go to see if the couriers are there .
the colosseum s one thing i can rave about .
why ar yo always so stiff ?
did yo believe i was engged the other day ?
i just came by to say goodbye to my aunt .
and mrs walker , i hope .
she 's over there .
will you ?
i must say i 'm not surprised .
charles .
what do you hear about daisy miller ?
freddie .
she 's always going around at night .
it 's so blasted dark over here , you ca nt see anything unlss the moon 's up .
ai n't that right , eugenio ?
i 'm going .
excuse my coming so late .
i only just heard .
i do wish dr davis were here .
is there anything i can do ?
no , thank you .
i wish randolph would go to bed .
but he 's been very helpfl .
it always gets very high before it drops .
daisy spoke of you the other day , quite pleasantly .
half the time she does n't know what she 's saying , but this time i think she did .
i 'm sure i 'm very glad .
he has n't been near us since she was taken ill .
i said i would n't give any such message .
she was the most beautiful young lady i never see .
the most innocent ?
the most innocent .
for myself i had no fear .
yes ?
she did what she liked .
she did what she liked .
no .
i 'm convinced .
i 'm sure .
is that some mdest wy of saying yo think she would have reciprcated your affection , had you shown it ?
that remark you made last summer .
rope him !
me too .
quake of '65 pinched off the veins .
has n't been 10 cents f gold in quake city snce .
and the name quake city ?
when you build on the calaveras fault , you expect to be shook up .
ai n't that bad , homer .
planning on settling here ?
if you want t sue , court 's open on tuesdays .
leonard ?
the trouble is , i 'm expecting valuables on the stage .
me neither .
yes .
mayor sharpe ?
dnavan !
santa fe , when you sold me the marshal 's horse ?
i was jst funning , donavan .
two pirs bets $ 2 .
there 's your two , raise you five .
you ca n't have an inside straight again .
if you claim them for me ,
you in or not ?
here s $ 5 on account , if you want it .
since you have $ 5 , i 'll apply it t your loan at the bank .
it is .
thanks , donavan .
let 's see them .
hit it agn !
i do n't believe that .
the good thing about luck s , it changes .
it was n't long they 'd been gone from the astern shore
for whom the posses rode
and they called them the apple dumpling gang
qake city .
you can eat at the hotel across the street or at the hard times café .
take your stuff .
any breakage in transit , report it to the ticket office .
excuse me !
dusty , my weeklies come ?
they 're in the mail pouch .
right in front of you .
thank you .
for wht 
i am not .
last night you agreed .
clydesdale at your service , sir .
there appears to be an unfortunate misunderstanding about the children .
cut through the fat .
this tin horn agreed to pick up the kids fr wintle .
magnolia !
where are th legal guardians of these waifs ?
they 've been shipped here to wintle , their second uncle .
halfway to san francisco , i 'd say .
the stage made delivery to the consignee or his agnt .
as soon as we sort this out .
she ca n't wait too long .
take my word for it .
it might be prudent to resolve the more mminent problem forthwith .
all right , come on .
i 'll show you !
hey !
i 'll b right back .
just hold on !
right here .
meanwhile , rest assured that the butterfly stage and freight company will make every endeavor to satisfy the problm to the ltimate satisfaction of all concerned parties .
mr. bradley 's lingering illness left him destitute .
anything would be an improvement .
no , i 'd say you had best keep these youngsters or provide for their safekeeping .
and , donavan , i would n't go on long rides , if  was you .
clovis do n't lik to be touched .
nope .
stop !
stop !
it 's a sample 
what 's that ?
it looks like fat .
that 's dinner ?
that 's dinner .
ca n't you mak apple dumplings ?
because even if i could  i would n't make them for you or anyone .
bobby !
it 's raining on celia gain .
then move her !
bobby !
had some extra son-of-a-gun stew .
i 'm merely pointing out that you have a way with children .
yes , they are .
till you find somebody else to take them off your hands .
not like you and your wife could .
get out of there !
i 'm attached to the little fellows , but i ca n't care for them .
good morning !
but they 're healthy specmens , nd they do n't eat much .
i can explain .
really !
the little girl could help you in the kitchen and scrub your clothes .
good day , sir .
i have a proposition .
ah , the lady of the house !
yuck !
if you culd just ...
mr. donavan !
celia !
duce , jack , a king .
it 's too delicate .
what is it , bobby ?
i do n't know .
ah !
get !
let 's move it in .
what did he say ?
he 's afraid we 'll get hs laundry dirty .
it looks like a mine .
a mine ?
kings bet $ 10 
i 'm in .
i 'm in .
you 're bluffng .
that kills me .
a man from missouri !
i fold .
all right , let 's see .
i believe i 've also won the deal 
five hundrd ?
as soon as he leaves , we jump him , right ?
lt 's get out of hre before he gets suspicious .
oky , i 'm in for $ 2 .
pair of sixes , four to the deuce , pair of ladies , jack to the three , ten to the fur and a jack to the six ...
it 's the moonridge number 2 .

come on , clovis !
whoa !
get the sheriff 
that 's him !
they 're his kids !
one mirror , $ 300 .
one melodeon 
why is bedtime so early ?
what 's that ?
a cherished token of a lady 's affection .
i 'm sure you 'll understand , belle .
i might need the investment capital .
if you 'd get the gold in the mine , you culd keep the token of affecton .
there is no gold .
i do n't have to answer to three whelps who are n't dry behind the ers yet .
what ?
hey .
why wuld he come this way ?
stop trying to think !
why not just tell him to hand it over ?
god poured your brains in with a teaspoon and someone joggled hs arm .
i keep telling you , we got no lead and no powder to thrw it with !
that 's right .
com on .
this 'll be easer than robbing a bird 's nest !
you wait on the roof , i 'll hoot when he coms .
here he is .
 got it .
yes , pa .
i have to stop in here and see some people , magnolia .
where are you off to ?
he 's not getting much out of his food .
yes , back there .
who are they ?
till amos shot stillwell in the leg .
they 're pretty harmless .
mm-hmm .
i 'm sorry ...
not so loud and a little slwer .
no mre biscuits and greens !
mr. purvis in the office says it 's on bald hill .
because my head hurts .
why has he got your cherished token of a lady 's affection ?
what did you lose ?
a posse 
they 're all laded for bear , too .
w got ta make a decision .
just what do you mean , blaze f glory ?
the jail in santa fe was n't so bad .
what do you say ?
looks that way , amos .
know something ?
if we met again in that big round up in the sky sometime ,
bye !
three kids with shovels walk into our hideout !
and you burned my hand !
do n't !
what about ...
why do n't w dig here ?
scared ?
n more than you are .
i am .
it 's just an owl .
this looks like a good place to dig .
you start over there , i 'll dig here .
no .
i 'm not !
it wo n't stand still .
bobby ?
are we trapped ?
there must be another way out .
the cash deposit will be in the children 's name .
i just wanted to be sure that their interests are protected .
we 'll see that the nugget is well taken care of .
can we touch t ?
sorry , that 's as close as you get .
act natural !
i figure that if it 's worth $ 87,000 , it 'll weigh close to ...
yeah , but ...
got a match ?
did he ?
see ?
and make arrangements for the kids .
a lot f people are anxios to take them to their bosoms .
no shortage of applicants .
there 's my darling !
let me have her !
let go , you 'll hurt her !
this is a privte party .
it 'll be dcided later at the hearing .
out !
see what i mean ?
there 's always miss clydesdale .
but she 's not married .
well , who can you get ?
i know , but dusty ?
she 's a fine specimen of womanhood .
i saw her get caught in a cloudburst onc , and i can tell you ...
if we go to mrs stockley , will she hit us ?
when mr. stockley gets mad , he uses words i never herd before .
you wo n't be thrown in the river !
do n't worry .
if celia gets pneumnia , i 'll take care of her .
that you gave way .
three little swindlers , yo mean !
okay , come on .
amos ?
amos !
yeah ?
it 's too long to get out this way .
yo get one end , i 'll get the other .
it went through the window .
howdy 
soon as we get across , it 'll be all downhill .
you 're going to bust it !
do n't do that !
my spur 's caught !
get off !
maybe you should see if the front door 's open .
great scheme .
agreed .
what do you get out of this arrangement ?
and tht 's ll ?
d you mean ...
exactly .
nothing more .
i give my word as a gentleman .
but it 's the best i can do .
are you calling or folding 
all right , i 'll go along with it .
the sooner you leave this town , the better .
it 's gong to be daylight bfore we get in .
do n't worry , she 'll get you up .
i 'll do the whippoorwill .
that 's a new one !
you 're going to wake somebody up !
i 'll help you !
you all right ?
i told you to wait for my signal !
come on , clarice 
come on !
come on !
you told us how to get to the mine !
run along now .
where s your friend ?
you kids should be in bed .
how 'd you do that ?
i got here early to draw the certification ppers for the nugget for the mint .
nd when i opned up the place , i got the shock of my life !
mrning !
morning !
get out of that silly rope and stand up !
guilty or not guilty ?
not gilty ?
this court sentences you to be hung .
and  'm fining you 10 bucks for perjury .
thank yo , your honor .
and bring your own rope .
the hardware 's clsed .
dummy .
how can you b hung wthout a rope ?
then they 'll deserve it .
i want to get them out of town for good .
staring at a bank through a spyglass wo n't make us richer .
worried about the sheriff ?
with a down-home sheriff , you get a twn full of vigilantes .
we could be walking into a hornets  nest .
we got to get the gold some time .
i did n't ride 200 mils just to look at the scenery .
is your leg hurting again ?
always acts up on me , evry time the weather changes .
i 'll tell you one thing .
homer , can we talk with you ?
as barber  sheriff or judge ?
two bits .
now get , before i fine you for loitering .
they 'll get a square deal and a good home .
you 're like ice cream and whiskey .
you 'd be man and wife , like any couple , and nobody could say different .
fine .
no .
yes !
i do .
by the powers invested in me , the state of california ,
that 's it .
i need boots and jackets for the kids .
he picked it out this morning .
did he really ?
did he really !
is there some trouble ?
yes , and yo 're in it !
wait !
ne !
dusty .
that 's it !
nothing 's further from my mind .
yeah !
no !
no , dusty .
back !
do n't !
wait a minut , dusty 
sorry , ralph !
what happened ?
pay you back , homer .
the bed ?
yes !
why did n't you say so 
excuse me , please .
come along , celia .
this is no place for a lady .
quiet now !
everybody sit down and shut up .
edgar , you get back in your seat !
that decision wll be final .
it shows this town has got a heart .
it 's an rder of th court , i wo n't dscuss it .
i heard you wre abut to gvel off my kin .
that 's not necessary .
i 'm here to claim them .
tell them why the kids are min  and no maybes .
it would please this court to see both of you run out of town !
give me that !
they 're yours , wintle .
you and that jackleg get out of here before the curt gets contemptuous .
exactly how much does this nugget weigh ?
356 pounds , without the crate .
 assume you have a lot of men prtecting it .
there 'll b extra guards from marysville tomorrow .
i see .
being a man of the cloth , it can do no harm .
we re taking it out when the bank closes at 4:00 tmorrow .
they wo nt be going by the regular route but over china grade .
i imagine that they 'll not encounter so much as a horn frog on tht road .
however , i wold be happy t accept this as a contribution for the poor .
i seem to have left my purse at the office .
hi , dusty !
we must have set a record .
what now ?
bye 
yeah ?
i would n't make that mistake again .
how can you get warm sitting by a fire that 's been out for two days ?

made a perfect fol of himself .
at night he picks me up and he takes me home 
why should n't it ?
well ...
and my vision is exceptionally clear .
good .
that 's very unfair .

if you ask me , he 's ...
where do you suppose he got it ?
i do n't know .

ingrid ?
h
somebody 's in trouble .

i know you could find a way to tell me if you really wanted to .
yu can be such a rat sometimes 
what 's wrong with you ?
oh , i 've got huge dark circles under my eyes .
what 's bothering you ?
you know , i thought and thought and thought , and i think i finally know the answer .
the watch belongs to her .
how far out can you get ?
feminine , yet ...
patti , you are absolutely impossible .
have a nice day at the office , inky .
and i forbid it .
yes , i d like to see a , uh ...

why , yes .
w have n't heard from denver all morning .
well , we 've got 22 howards in los ángeles county .
mr. klso , i have something to report on one of your cases .
it 's a family cat .
that means darn cat .
daddy named him , he calld hm something worse , mother w n't let us use tht .
i think he has a regular route to pick out food , sort of like a milkman in rverse .
yes , it does .
ah , miss , um , randall ...
you see , our jurisdiction is lmited to certain fields of investigation .
at the present time  duck stealing is not ne of them .
how about bank robbery and kidnapping ?
maybe i 'd better hear the rest of yur story .
thank you 
wearing a wristwatch ?
do n't you see ?
i 'd try to put something of mine on the cat as a clue .
hre .
you see , of course , on the back , where she started to scratch the word help ,
uh-huh .
h-e ... and that squiggle could be an l .
she was wearing a wristwatch at the time of her abduction .
we have only a superficial description .
of cours .
at convenient towns up the valley .
they went in another direction ?
or stayed here in the city .
how 's your workload , kels ?
me , sir ?
actually , i do n't hve any experience in tailing cats .
for that matter , who does ?
there 's a kind of an antagonism between us .
i know the medical records of every man in this office .
have you been keeping somethng from me ?
i 'm available on this case 24 hours a day .
yes , sir .
c ...
gesundheit , and good luck .
wit till they find out he 's working with the fbi .
exactly .
hmm .
we 've got ta not generate too much heat ?
remmber  everything quiet , calm , inconspicuous .
that brazen creatr .
right in broad daylight !
a strange man just went into the house with patti .
so what ?
this man was nicely dressed .
that 's the way plumbers dress now .
do you have any friends ?
i 'd prefer a room on the second floor , actually .
uh-hh .
what did you say ?
ah , dc .
that 's his favorite spot .
this is the informant , as we say down at the office .
good , good kitty cat .
does n't seem to like me , does he ?
i guess that 's a bad sign , the knd of people
that animals do n't like ?
what are you going to do ?
bless you .
you 're catching a terrible cold .
you want me to get you something ?
it 's just a slight allergy  have around c ... c ...
wonder if you 'd put him on the bd and let me get a picture of him ?
there you go .
oh , yes .
uh ...
there we g .
come on , dc , cooperate .
come on , dc , you 're working for the fbi now .
there .
there .
we ca nt see him properly .
here .
back under the bed .
i should 've taken th pawprints first .
sure , if you want to lose a hand .
the bureau has spent $ 19,800 of th taxpayers ' money trainng m for emergencies .
well , you are a very brave man .
all right , when i count three , we 'll both grab him at the same time 
but move fast .
one , two , three .
oh  dc .
i 'm afraid you underestimate me .
we shll proced with the pawprinting .
all right .
what 's that ?
ink ?
ca nt we do that n the bathroom ?
oh , sure .
let 's go .
do n't make such a fuss , dc .
sorry about the washing .
it 's okay .
i guess i 'll put the pawprint n the space for the thumb .
i ca n't hold him any longer .
here we go , now .
yes , and he has kitchen privileges , and he 's as easy to get rid of ...
try to get rid of him .
just kep him away .
okay , tiger , it 's either you or me .
patti ?
yes ?
what kind of a get-up is that to go surfing in ?
well , patti , are you all right ?
can i help ?
it 's all right .
what was what ?
that bloodcurdling scream .
canoe , will you please go ?
i 'm sorry .
oh , do n't be silly .
he 's having a bath .
all right .
if you wo n't go to the beach , i 'll make myself a sandwich .
yeah , except on the card .
the word is move , and move swiftly .
we 're gon na follow an informant whose informtion may or may nt be relable .
okay , hre 's the physical .
name of the informant :
siamese .
sex :
seventeen pounds ?
exactly .
black streaked with tan and white .
yo did say fur ?
correct .
you want us to follow a cat ?
they climb trees and phone poles .
wither he goest , you will go .
i 've got an old dog who 's a lot better at tracking cats than i am .
we do n't have time for comments .
okay .
when the informant leaves  it 'll be or job to contain him loosly , within a moving , fluid perimeter .
it 's important he does nt become aware of us as this might alter his regular nocturnal behavior .
hold it .
who do you think you 're kidding ?
what do you mean ?
you think i do n't know
you do ?
i did n't come in from stupidsville on last night 's bus .
hold it 
do n't double-talk me .
that 's all .
i do n't care if it 's pocahontas .
what 's wrong with her ?
the old battle-ax knows we got a dame up here .
she heard her talking .
i told her it was your mother .
i told you a million times , the tv .
why private ?
please .
all right , all right .
go in the kitchen and get a glass of water 
and stand by the snk , where i can see you .
where ?
back of a store , where they dump trash .
anyway , i do n't like bodies .
listen , dan anything else i play it your way , right ?
she goes .
all right .
but not until later .
you sure your sister wo n't mind us using her room ?
spirs , this is control .
swet and clear .
you reading me ?
in the alley , about 30 feet from the randall back gate .
let me know which way he turns .
about three minutes to go .
affirmative .
uh , no , not anymore .
as yo very properly pointed out today , a woman 's life may depend on what we do .
i 'm sorry .
do you want me to leave ?
maybe that would be best , yes .
i only thught if dc happened to wake up and find a strange man in the bedroom ...
i just do n't know how he 's gon na take it .
uh , you 've got a point there .
grham , are you settled in ?
if the informnt goes west , you 've got him .
i 'll give yu a new position .
the informant .
what ?
nice kitty cat .
you 're all tensed up .
he 's getting the idea something 's wrong .
and be carful what you say .
he 's just a cat .
and come on in the house , snoopy .
i thought he 's supposed to go ut .
shh .
spres  he 's on his way .
i have the informant in sight .
i 'm going to investigate .
spires and cahill , the infrmant is moving north .
stand by for new positions .
he 's looking up at the side windows of the house .
he 's moving to the street .
all right , kelly , leave the car and follow on foot .
okay , graham , move to seventh and state .
junction seventh and state .
the informant has now turned west onto state street .
dc always hangs around there and it drives mr. bartel out of his mind .
informant 's moving , crossing to the south side of the street .
dos dc know anybody on eighth ?
h 's still in the yard .
he 's interested in something on the second floor .
let 's start pulling in our perimeter .
kelly , move down eighth to the building .
dc wo n't be hurt ?
i hve to ask you to be quiet .
spires  start your car and move towards the location with your lights off .
back awy from that window .
informant 's on the move again .
he s proceeding north on eighth street the way he came in .
i love dc , but he can driv you up the wall sometimes .
dozens ?
informant 's crossing main .
excse me , but i do not get tense .
we are tryng not to be emotional .
tense , no .
it 's mother 's favorite color .
i 've lost him .
hi .

report to me when you reach it .
what 's this man doing here ?
listen , mister , where do you get off telling me to leave my room ?
i really have to ask you to be quiet , and that goes for ...
cahill , what happened to you ?
what 's going on here ?
ingrid , be still .
it 's a matter of life and death .
do n't call the police about the fb .

that makes everything official .
graham , kelly , stay behind .
i 'm not going to have hysterics .
i 'm nt going in the hall

it 's hard to tell , i just see shadows .

you 're a love .
we 've got to think of miss miller and cooperate .
i want mr. whoever-he-ls , and his ham radio or whatever-that-is , out of my room by the time i get home , or i 'll become very difficult

no , i hardly think so .

i could n't care less whether he thinks i 'm stuffy or not .

i 'm after the man that was following him .
yes , a prowler behaving in a very peculiar manner .
i am going to go through every inch of this house
and make sure he did n't sneak in here .
i hardly think that 's ncessary .
i am going up .
you 've got nerv , bursting into my room .

yeah .
i suggest you find yourself another car pool .
it was all my fault .

i do n't know .
it 's a theory and without evdence , we ca n't waste time .
oh , i think that 's horrible .

we are both waiting for the scriptre fetcher nder the guidance of the mercy goddess
bro monkey , you can also call me bajie

yeah !
no !
they are monsters
amitabha
i killed people
someone is spying on us
madam , that monk is almost here
shall we celebrat ?
how many times have i told you ?
you are really a clumsy flatterer
any living thng in her hands
suffers as if in hell
madam , i 'm wrong
what do you mean by as if in hell ?
no hurry
let me have some fun first
but it 's noon now
master , where 's the path ?
even your eyes are wide open , it 's no use
look
monk .
you stay here
i got it at last !
anybody in ?
human ?
come on .
stop !
we did n't do anything evil
but he 's quite honest
we only want to beg for some food
and me , sun wukong
it 's so windy .
let 's get inside
put down your knives ...
sit down , please
bro sha , water
are those girls your daughters ?
bajie
master .
be quiet
do n't worry
i 'll be extremely filial to you
go wash them there
yeah , wukong if your eyes are n't feeling well wash them nd you 'll feel cmfy
just go wash them
not enough , indeed
two sweeties
honey
come on out
bro bajie
bro bajie
since the krma of weal and woe is predestined why worry yourself sick , madam ?
i was forced to marry into the purple
many people died
there was a rumor that i brought on th disaster to their village
i was seen as a demon
to honor the gods
but later i survived
so you can say passing time is not necessarily a good cure pain comes from stubbornness
it looks hard to overcome but , as long as yo take a bold step forward
i 'm sure you can do it as wll
you ca n't bluff my eyes with your disguise
wan na go ?
cme on out
i 'm sure i 'll find you soon
she died
it was too wrong .
master , help me
master
your sin f killing is too much
if i let you get awy with it like this it 'll be a disaster for the world
that damned monkey was too fierc
trouble ?
ar you going to use this incntation to keep me under control ?
we only believe what can be seen in our eyes
now i understand why the buddha made the two of us togther on this journey
what pulls us together is this journey of 36,000 miles for the scriptures
but i hope you believe that every time i recite the incantation
please help save my daughter
can someone save her ?
exacfly
the kingdom of cloud was prosperous
she feeds on these young kids
please rise , your majesty
mitabha .
guard his majesty !
repeat it
et him now if you can
i 'm here for you
let 's talk outsid
of you ?
master
do n't hurry
out with it
we are both demons of the same kind
that 's why we should help each other
what can you help me with ?
your hoop looks nice on you
you can keep it if you like
why not ?
go ahead
look at this monkey
he has to do whatever is told by his master
white bone spirit
let me be the bad guy
please calm down
sun wukong gets in the way
so , as long as she tackles that monkey we 're sre to have a chance
wukong , are you alright ?
no way
do you really want to enlighten this demon ?
i ca n't leave a single life unenlightened on this jurney
i can never mak myself assured even though i can make it through to the scriptur
i can never feel assured
it 's a style
do you know what yo 're supposed to do here tonight ?
i 'm here
again ?
wukong , why are you here ?
do n't fool around here
yeah
lady white if you have guts have a good fight with me
far enough ?
ok .
step back
i hate being called evil demon the most
if not , what else should i call you ?
whatever
listen , i can give up everything
but !
we 'll see
someone help !
i 'm stuck
where 's the monk ?
i wnder where
now it 's your turn
this is your karmic reward
even the buddha can not extinguish human 's evil within
this sort of person is mre vicious than demons
now .
if it were n't for him , killing all the way with his cudgel you could go nowhere !
what merits and retribution are you looking to ?
every word you say is nonsense and every step you take could kill
by what right ?
holy monk , please wait
the folks of our kingdom will be grateful for your kindness forever
please accept our gifts
thanks for saving my life
i 've said
she 's a demon
are you okay , sweethart
calm down .
holy monk , help
holy monk  help me
master , this girl does n't look ordinary
yes , master .
he sddenly did that
monk they have turned from monsters
you can only rely on yourself
do n't kneel to me
bajie
the road ahead is dangerous
do your best to protect him
big brother
big brother !
master !
if you do n't tell me
bro sha
we still have the last rsort
why did n't it come to my mind ?
you are ... an unsympathetic , unfaithful jerk !
i 've long been putting up with you
yes !
bro sha , hit his face !
the horse is yours
dragon horse , let 's go to save master
because if i eat you , i can become an immortal dmon
i want no reincarnation .
i hate being a hman
in this case what happened in your previous life ?
that 's just a story about my previous life
do n't think you 're different from those who hd left me on the lone cliff
hatred can only give birth to hatred
why must you be so hard on yourself ?
stop enlightening me
wukong .
even if you get back to your place today that is not your final destination
big brother
d n't be afraid , everyone
only you can save master , big brother
look how young he is and how old you are , huh ?
a brnch can be ... easily snapped ... snapped without effort while ten branches are unbreakable together
if the four of us are united and bound we will reach the west and fetch the scripture for sure
what shall i do ?
you tell me !
wukong
golden cicada has waited for nin lifetimes before you 're availble to be his disciple in this life and you 'll b rectified and led to buddhism
am i at fault ?
i 'll still be waiting here , okay ?
i hope my death can take away your stubbornness
who is it ?
evil monky !
bro sha , you go !
master
now your spirit will vanish forever and ever
buddha
i 'm willing to help her overcome her doom
please give her a chance
no !
you 're not gon na make it
lady white wants to meet her end within my body
if i do n't lead her to her rencarnation she 'll vanish completly
no
even if i could reach the thunder monastery
i would not get the scriptures
alright
on the way of 36,000 miles
i ll wait throughout this life
if nt so after ten lifetimes
i 'll be waiting as well , without fail
come on
big brother
i still want to be yur master
master
it s been seven days
i 'll carry his body to the thunder monastery to see the buddha in person

when you 're  mom on the other side of 40 ,
sometimes , you just ca n't help but wonder ...
like , what if i 'd taken that internship
being a mother is not all that different
juggling all those little details that nobody really notices .
where you learn to tell the difference betwen a real problem ...
still making sure everything gets done .
one day , you reach a point
where your insight and experience are appreciated ,
david sarlo asked me to the dance !
he 's so cute !
at first ,  thought he liked avery , but then jenna told sophie that he liked me ..
that can only be nrtured over the years by listening .
but that 's where the similarities nd .
you never retire from being a mother .
nt to mention the driving lessons ,
it was spring of her senior year ,
and she suddenly ...
grew up .
they 'll always need you
well , that just might trn out to b the hardest part of the job .
happy birthday , carly .
vegan !
besides , you need to get home to your baby .
and besides , i live right next door , so i can literally be there in two seconds if they need m .
thank you fr everything you did for my prty .
it was so much fun .
can i go ?
thanks .
love you .
oh , and happy birthday .
and to think i was worried you would n't have anything to do tonight .
i just hate to see you alone on your birthday .
troy .
did n't know you were stopping by .
yeah  i was , um ...
just until next payday .
you really need to manage your money mor responsibly .
yeah , i also always say
i wo n't be sending you money every time you blow through your monthly allowance once you 're in college .
thank you for playing .
better luck next time .
i really learned an important lesson today .
thanks , aunt lauren .
you know .
if you 're a baseball player
if you 're a parent with that same batting average ,
all you can think about is where you went wrong .
mayb there should be .
i brought a centerpiece from the store .
this all loks delcius .
well , that 's kind of the idea .
hey , did you get an invit for the bloggers event at the community arts center 
i do n't know ...
i 'm a little distracted right now .
well , you know , sadie goes off to colleg , you have some time to maybe , you know , live it up a little ?
crly , it 's been 14 years since jeff walked out on you , and you 've done a wonderful job raising sade , but it 's springtime
i need to see your throat again , so can you open your mouth , like , real wide ?
mm-mm , no .
can you pen your mouth real wide like a big old shark , about to take a bite ?
no ?
what do you want to be ?
yeah .
can you just ...
good morning .
would you send connr 's swab over to the lab , and see how fast they get back to us with results ?
tracy , re you still at the same address ovr in deerhurst park ?
sam address .
me and conner .
he 's ther practically every morning .
maybe .
i wan na play , i wan na play , i wan na play ..
okay , yeah , sounds good .
sure you wo nt change your mind about dinner ?
troy , you her ?
i love the way you look at me
untl you 'd smile ...
best chicken tacos in town .
i 'll try the chicken taco .
thank you .
falling deeper for you
just like a clock strikng midnight
deeper for you
no one else could see
all right , conner  let 's go in here .
i wan na go to the park !
now !
com on , conner !
come on ..
you do n't want a snack ?
come on , buddy ...
conner , come here !
n 
you know , i might have some binoculars in the back , if you think that would help ?
in the park .
the ... the food truck , next to the flowers .
right , yes !
you saw that , huh ?
kind of worth it .
so , um ... flowers .
good nose .
that 's why i cme in here this morning , to , uh , try some of your finest spring flowers .
well , that depends .
but is this a special occasion ?
possibly ?
oh , no , i think it 's probably more of an ordinary occasion .
hey , have a really ordinary day .
that sounds perfect .
men .
and with such pleasant cmpany , to .
i ca n't beleve we have n't already met .
yeah , right .
um ... sure .
then on dy , out of the blue , you meet somebody , and right off , bam !
especially in spring .
everything is growing , nd so ... full of life .
it ... it 's ...
the circle of life !
so , henry ,
well , i would n't say popular .
she 's just being modest .
i never touch alcohl .
i live next dor , you really do n't have to walk me home .
a gentleman always sees a lady to her door .
oh , believe me , henry , that 's not what i would call you .
why should the shadows come ?
why should my heart be lonely
oh ...
yes !
i ca n't believe that we finally bumped into ach other 
i do n't think he gives conner the attention that he needs .
eat yur food .
i wnt yours .
do you mind ?
no , i want mustard !
he really thrives on the hands off , instinctive parenting approach that bestie mom talks about in her blog .
i 'm sorry , who ?
it 's all about how to be a sensitive , emotionally vailable parent to your child , without setting a lot of rules or boundaries .
besti mom ?
more like beastie-mm .
let 's see ...
vegan ?
speaking as a single dad with a teenage son ,
of course , i always try to lern from other people 's mistakes .
a .
silly ?
pretty .
dear juggling dad ,
try it .
you 'll be amazed what a difference it makes .
yeah , d n't have an answer for that , do ya ?
just wrting my blog .
do n't go weird on me , mom .
there comes a time when we must ask ourselves , what is at the heart of our duty as a parent ?
i still ca n't believe henry went for it .
to be true to themselves ...
mom , i was thinking , maybe i should n't go straight to college after i graduate .
i should see the world a little first .
travel 
or mayb indonesia ?
that sounds exciting .
she was completely oblivious to the fact that her son was terrorizing the entire restaurant , including me .
that 's the thing about women with kids , t 's a package deal .
simon , lok at me .
you look happy-ish .
i do n't need lauren settng me up .
with those bright eyes and that cute smile , are you kidding ?
half the women who bring in their kids just want to give you a big hug and a warm meal .
come on , i 'm being serious 
especially if you get your parenting advice from bestie mm .
not what .
it 's a mommy blog .
you know about this 
of course i do .
nothng wrong with the way we were raised .
something you might want to keep in mind .
what does that mean ?
we had it all figured out , two years of community college , then she transfers to university to get her degree .
well , i ca n't do that .
our relationship has always been built on mutual respect and understanding .
this ncredibly arrogant father who 's been posting on my blog .
well , i can hardly wait to read it 
just as soon as i figure out what i 'm gon na say to sadie .
the way i see it ,
but sharing with your chld keeps those doors open to a future you can build together .
hello , bestie mom .
if this blog of yours does n't work out ... you have  great future in comedy ...
seriusly ?
your problem is ,
well .
if you do n't know the differenc
it 's called passion ...
maybe not ...
do n't bother .
you wo n't get an answr from me .
okay , so what was wrong with that last pair of jeans ?
i want them to look good on me .
listen , i was thinking about what yo were saying about traveling , and i think we should talk about it .
hw did those daisies work out ?
um ...
andy .
you too .
chemistry class , right ?
i 'm good .
what are you fellas shopping for today ?
oh , running shoes for , um ...
all right , we 'll be back .
uh ...
what about sadie ?
now ... we 're talking .
yeah .
she passed away when troy was seven .
nd we talk , but ... well , we ...
i guess we grunt our mening across , you know ?
i know what you mean .
lately ... not so much .
i shouted upstairs to troy to ask what h wants for dnner , and , um ... he texted me back .
troy 's dad .
oh , i , uh ..
no .
you obviusly like him .
he seems like a nice enough guy .
so , what 's the problem ?
i have troy 's number , so we can hook you two up .
i 'm not going to try t talk you ut of it .
just think about it , anything could happen .
she 's waiting .
thanks for the ride , mom .
sadie .
have fun .
i love you , too , babe .
when she 's thousands of miles away ?
not to mention what a bad dea it is
for her t put off starting school .
hot ?
in a strictly pg kind of a way .
people like that need to be called on the carpet once in a while .
on the othr hand , meeting somebody would n't be so bad either .
okay , but you ca n't tell lauren .
simon , i 'm serious .
we really seemd to hit it off .
go for it .
my man .
you , uh , you going somewhere ?
dad , i 'm guessing it 'll be thursday next week .
dad , seriously ?
everyone else can stays out till 11:00 .
all right .
goodnight , uncl simon .
in a situation like this ,
and that somebody is you .
lke i 'd take advice from you ?
i even have a suggestion
but she 'll be in school , nd is n't that what you wnt ?
what i want is what 's best for my daughtr .
i do n't get it .
she 's trying to break out and be her own person .
i mean , we all did it .
i 've never held her back , i 've never set a bunch of rules .
it is not fn .
i 'm definitely sensing some chemistry betwen the two of you .
like telling sadie exactly what you think ?
oh ...
what ?
when ?
wit , who is he ?
oh , uh , okay .
okay .
yeah .
no ...
i mean , uh ...
enjoy this wonderful spring weather .
actully , i was hoping for something a little less ordinary .
i was hoping so , yeah .
for example , if it 's , like , a date , then roses would be nice .
that is the general gist of the ... direction i was kind of headed in .
i 'm sorry , i 'm not doing this very well ...
no , no , you 'r doing great .
okay .
tacos sound perfect .
i 'll be there .
t 's a date .
bye , carly .
oh , uh ...
somene ?
troy 's dad 
yeah  all right , mom .
you 've obviously got t look good , but you ca n't look too good , because you 've got ta lev somewhere to go fashion-wise , if there 's a second date .
i m in high school , ths is what we do .
tell me , what are we doing , where are we going ?
yeah , if you want to go off to  strange country , where you do n't speak the language or know the local customs , then who am i to stand in your way ?
yeah .
not even me .
yeah , that 's ...
i 'm really proud of you .
whatever you say , dad .
i have a date .
sure , i ..
thanks .
got it .
no problem .
so those are crocuses walks in the park and these tacos got me through some pretty bumpy times aftr my husband left .
see , i end up wearing half of mine .
oh , easy , it 's all in the wrist .
i mean , i was n't going to get anywhere near her .
i 've been known as the teddy bar doctor .
how did you choose flowers ?
well , i knew i could n't keep working an office job 9:00 to 5:00 , and rise sadie alone the way i wanted to , and , well ...
ne of my favorite quotes is by emerson ,
uh , it 's been a whil .
oh yeah , thank you .
let 's go one more time around .
wait , what ?
no , i never said  did n't want to go to college .
that was fun .
i 'd like that .
hand me your phone .
the last time i did this , you had to actually write the number down .
i would never lose your number .
call me .
it was ... nice .
goodnight .
change your mind ?
uh-hh ?
if i go away to college , then i still get to travel , but i 'm staying in school .
well , thank you , i 'm so glad it helped .
carly ?
i do n't believe it .
oh , i was hoping i would run into yo here .
the adventures of raising four kids in a three-bedroom house  each day more exciting than the next .
wll , i will definitely look for it .
i mean , honey , you are really on to something .
no , no , no , no , that 's just ...
no , no , it 's brilliant .
i 've got ta get back to my table , but it 's so great to see you .
you too .
sur .
his mom says that rash just wo n't go away .
what ?
bobby sawyer .
something you want to tell me ?
i 've known you all your life , little brother , and i 've nly seen that smile once before , the day you met your fture wife .
do n't know what you 're talking about .
and even if i did n't know you so well , you should realize by now that my husband ca n't keep a secret .
yeah , that s probably tre .
now , who is she ?
i mean , i just met her and all , so ...
but every time i see her , i ...
this i got ta see .
hi 
hi ...

okay , come on .
would you look at that .
you know , write some sort of a journal , slash , vegan cookbook kind of thng .
what do you think ?
carly ?
just checking my messages .
this would n't have anything to do with the guy in the flower shop , wold it ?
but it ws really fun .
and there was a kiss .
but he said he would call .
oh , honey , it 's still early .
he probably works all kinds of crazy doctor hours , right ?
he 'll call .
you and mr .
floppy were both very brave today .
so , that was our last patint of the day ,
all right , let 's hear it .
first of all  you rush into that community arts center lke those mommy bloggers are rock stars , then you run out like the building 's on fire .
carly ... is bestie mom .
i know .
i mean , how ws  supposed to know
what are you going to do ?
no .
maybe the best thing to do is just walk away .
what ?
that 's the person she knows .
but it 's over now .
just wanted to give another shout out to juggling dad
thanks to you , my daughter 's no longer set on travelng the world .
instead , she 's decided to go away to school .
: it does n't seem to matter where she gos ,
as long as it 's not here .
but that 's not your problem .
dd you know there 's a great humanities program in anchorage ?
i had n idea .
crazy , right ?
well , h ...
well , i think there 's a perfectly good explanation .

what was  supposed to think when you just disappeared like that ?
i know .
it 's n excuse , and i would n't blame you if you told me to ht the road , but .. if you 'd give me one more chance ?
i want to stay mad at yo longer .

morning , everybody , and welcome to the 5th annual mom blogger symposium !
we have bloggers here from every corner of the world .
are you guys excited ?
and we want to har what 's on your mind .
thank yu , karissa , for giving m a moment of your tim .
i know everyone here is probably busy , so i promise this will just take a second .
my name is andy sommers , but some of you might know me better as ...
juggling dad .
yes , i 'm that guy , who , uh ... who thought he was qualified enough to tell everyone else the right way to be a parent .
after meeting her in person  it did n't take very long before i was falling for her .
but fter some of the things that juggling dad had said , or written online ,
i was scared that she might not like andy after she found out we were the sme person .
so , i did n't tell her .
and that was biggest mistake  've ever made .
that 's why i 'm here today .
i was never been happier than when i was with you .
go ...
carly , you once told me that yellow rses were for frendship and red meant i love you .
 'll let you decide .
can i have both ?
all right , mom !
way to go , dad !
no , you do n't .
there 's no plce like home
be it ever so humble
how do you do ?
nice of you to drop by me humble abode .
my name is bnny .
what strted all this chasing ?
when was the very first chas ?
in order to answer that queston ... we 'll have to swing back n time a little bitty bit .
quite dark , too .
anyway , nobody complained , which was odd ... until you realized that there was n't nobody around to complain .
until one day ... very deep in a sixth-rate galaxy called the milky way ... circling around a fourth-rate star called the sun ... on a tenth-rte planet , a strange creature appeared .
and the first domesticity and the first boredom .
what 's on the wall tonight , dear ?
but after about 25,000 years of this ... and having developed severe cricks in their necks ... man and woman became bored again ... even with all those brilliant , ultramodern , innovative ideas ... like the first motion-picture cameras .
and then one day ... another strang and historic creature appeared .
me .
fathers like tedd pierce ...
warren foster .. and mike maltese , who wrte most of me biography .
and , of curse , a father named mel blanc ... who had thosands of voices ... and was nice enough to give me one of them .
an animation director ... who goes by the unlikely name of chck jones .
and old chuck seemed determined ... to get poor little old me into outer space , too 
i 'll never mx radish juice and carrot juice again .
the hole seems long this morning .
holy cow !
why , the sun ai n't even out yet .
no wonder i 'm so sleepy .
wht was that ?
where the heck am i , anyways ?
t long last , my dream come true .
 wan na ask you somethng .
the earth wll be gone in just a few seconds .
no point in wasting money on a flying saucr ... when the earth 's not gon na ...
pardon me again , doc , but just what did you mean .. by that crack about the arth being gone ?
i 'm going to blow it up .
it obstructs my view of venus .
now , i shll hve to create more martians .
my illdim pu-36 explosive space modulator .
boy , it 's really wonderful to be back in civilization .
run for the hills , folks , or you 'll be up to your armpits in martians .
but other people , if you want to call a duck people ... had close encounters with that little martan , too 
as the ensuing , gripping ... and nerve-tingling drama now demonstrtes .
i have sent for you , dodgers , becase we are facing a crisis .
now , we have reason to believe .. that the only remaining source is on planet x .
and you want me to find planet x , is that it ?
can you do it , dodgers 
indubitably , sir .
because there 's no one knows his way around outer spac ... like duck dodgers ... in th 24th and a half century !
oops !
then , west in an astro-arc deviation to here .
then by space-navigable compass to here , her ... and then to here and here ... by 13-point stratocumulus bearing four million light-years ... and thus to our destination .
now , do you know how to reach planet x ?
oh , sure 
i wish you 'd explain it to me sometime , buster .
that 's ridiculous .
gad !
and there just ai n't room enough on this planet ... for the two of us .
you may fire when ready , grizzly .
who ?
what ?
where ?
when ?
how ?
who ?
who ?
what ?
just when i had him going , you had to butt in .
get back in that spaceship .

i 'm sure old neanderthal person never envisaged anything like that ... when h started that vry first chase .
or will it ?
eat your heart out , burt rynolds .
i will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise and bring you back to this land .
h is the king of babylon , ruler of the four quarters of the earth ,
kurus  in th old persian tongue .
he is cyrus the great .
who are you , old man ?
i am daniel of the tribe of benjamin , made captive nearly 70 years ago by nebchadnezzar .
he served darius well after he captured the city in your name 
the beasts would not touch him 
i know who you are now .
you will give us entertainment while we eat .
the palace will be there n the morning 
my king , the hebrews eat and drink only their own food which is prepared according to ther rituals .
cyrus :
you promised me a tale , four , in fact .
when i was just a boy , he threw down the assyrian empire , my people 's ancient nemesis , but the destruction of israel 's enemies brought us no relief because in the 3rd year of nebuchadnezzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with tears , for you , lord , are righteous , yet we rbelled against your command .
male # 3 :
s do i .
i have only begun my studies , but here ... the prophet , jeremiah , son of hilkiah , has written that we shall serve the king of babylon for 70 years --
daniel :
as punishment for our sins .
and even if we were to survive it , we would be very old .
you are summoned for your meal .
why wold they only take 10,000 of us and leave the rest of our people behnd ?
yes , look at who they 'v taken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest can easily be governed .
they 've changed our names , hoping we 'll forget our god ;
set it here .
where is it from , and how was it slaughtered ?
the cattle are from the king 's herd .
the swine ar from the king 's pens 
we are forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has commanded us ,
you are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses .
but the kng can not he will not change the customs of his hall to fit your wishes .
you must know this .
and we will not ask him to .
i have been charged with your well-being .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , the king , will do .
and we would not wsh it so .
for 10 days give us nothing but vegetables to eat and mater to drink 
cyrus :
i have no doubt the lord favorably disposed his hert to hear our request .
and we remained un-defiled .
were presented before nebuchadnezzar himself .
the king 's executioner , arioch , will be in th chamber .
they are belteshazzar , shadrach ,
you hve destroyed nineveh the mighty , seat of assyria  and taken from her hand the scepter of nations .
why should i allow you , sons of my former enemies , to serve in my court ?
because you have spared th lives of our people who were delivred into your hand nd because the word of the prophet jeremiah has come unto us saying ,
the god of israel , says to all those
pray to the lord for it , for if it prospers , y too will prosper . '
this is good .
i will speak only the truth , and when you would not hear it , you must ask me nothing .
have their names be written in the book of the wise .
male # 2 :
f they can be trusted .
daniel :
trusting the words of the oracle of delphi ,
were unable to help him .
no !
command , and it s done .
i need to know what it means .
oh , king , tell your servants your dream , and we will interpret it for you .
astrlogers wh read nothing in the stars .
t is up to you to discern and interpret them .
bt , my lord , if only you wuld tell us your dream we could interpret it , as we have always done .
i know you 're trying to gain time or trick me into revealing what i 've seen .
either may i 'll have none of it .
no king has ever asked such a thing before .
why do n't you come along with me and ask him yourself ?
speak .
daniel :
i have heard your decree , and i understand that i shall fall beneath the blade if your dream is not made known nd interpreted .
the sentence is to be carried out at sunrise .
you may withdraw so long as you retrn at dawn , as your fate and that of the others is one n the same , and when you return be sure to bring your companions with you .
shll i send guards along , my king ?
even if we were to flee the city the whole world would 've been against s , not that it mattered
i had given my word and intended to keep it .
oh king , live forever .
daniel :
bltshazzar , your death is upon you as well unless you know my dream and can interpret it .
praise be to the god of my fathers forever and ever .
he gives wisdom to the wse and knowledge to the discerning .
he revals deep and hidden things and has made plain all that you have asked , for he has shown me the vision of the king .
then speak !
the head of the statue was made of pure gold , its chest and arms of silver , its belly and thighs of bronze , its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold were all broken to pieces at the same time , and the winds swept them away without a trace , but the rock that struck the statue became a mountain
you have done what i was told was impossible .
you know my dream as if yo dreamt it yourself .
what does it mean ?
you , oh king , are the king of kings 
after yu , another kingdom will rise , infrior to yours .
and in the time of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdm that will never be destroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold 90 feet high .
live forever !
as your dutiful servants , we know the law that when the horn sounds we all bow down 
none .
wise man :
they neithr worship your gods or serve the image of gold yo 've created .
nothing .
is this true ?
do you rfuse to worship my state ?
then you shall be thrwn into the furnace , and no guard will save you from my hand .
let the furnace be heated sevenfold .
but now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has not harmed your bodies 
you were willing to give up your lives rather than serve any bt your own god .
daniel :
and for a time all was well untl nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was troubled yet by another dream .
befor i was born , my grandfather , astyages , was troubled by a dream whre a flood beginning near his throne was overflowing the whole earth .
he dd n't learn until 10 years later that the boy was actually aliv , at which time he prdoned the boy and restored him to his rightful parents , and for a time the matter was forgotten .
daniel :
old astyages , he knew of the prophecy , but he was powerless to overcome it .
for when he dreamed that great dream , his enchanters , sorcerers , and astrolgers were once again unable to interpret the vision .
the images i sw trrified me .
the beasts of the field took shelter under it , and the birds of the air lived in its branchs , and from it every creature ws fed .
trim off ts branches .
strip its leaves .
but let the stump and its roots ,
this is the dream that i had .
you have become great and strng .
but yo saw a messenger , a holy one , coming down from heaven , saying ,
while its roots remain in the ground .
let him live like wild animals .
you will eat grass like cattle until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyne he wishes .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to accept my advice .
renounce your sins by doing what is right and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed .
seek the lord while he may be found , and it may be that your prosperity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often short , and 12 months later when the king was walking on the roof of the royal palce of babylon - of babylon --
nebuchadnezzar 
i 've placed upon the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised mountain high .
is this not the great babylon that  have built as my royal palace with my mighty power for the glory of my majesty ?
daniel :
go now from this kingdom which you claim .
because he insisted on being more than he was made , he became less than he was made .
evn in his insanity neither the lion nor the bear disturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept naked in the places where they found their food because it had been prophesied that one day he would honor the most high .
honor and glory to him who lives forver .
rise , nebuchadnezzar .
before him all the people of the earth are regarded as nothing .
h may do as he pleases with the powrs of heaven and all the people of the earth , and no one , no one , may say him , nay .
and so nebuchadnezzar returned to his throne , but eventually he was gathered to his fathers , and a series of new kings came to the throne , none fasting more than a short time .
well , at last we come to the pan of the tle where i have some knowledge to share .
for thogh i had conquered from east to west ,
it was enough to freeze the heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from whence it came i do not know , like some spirit of god whspered it in my er .
but the river euphrates which flowed down to babylon raised above ts naturl level hemmed in by dams and dikes , but if dams were opened full and the dikes were broken , the river which ran straight through the heart of the city
and i suddenly realized i 'd been given a key to defeat th mighty babylon .
it was as though in all the world , throughout all of history ,
i was the only one that had the thought .
all it required was the rght moment to act .
listen , oh king , and i wll tell of th secnd king of my story ,
they seem quite concerned about this , my king .
first , they must build a causeway across the moat .
that alone will take months .
bring me the golden vessels from the temple of jerusalem .
but , my king , is it wise to use the vessels ?
my king , these cups are considered sacred , are they not , my king ?
but here thy are spoil for our gods , and they would have you use them as i see fit .
bring them !
a judean once told nebuchadnezzar , your forefather , of his dreams .
he succeeded when everyone else had failed .
i am told you are able to give intrpretations and solve difficult problems .
if you can read the writing on that wall , you will be clothed in purple , have a chain of gold placed around your neck , and be made third highest ruler in the kingdom .
oh king , the most high god gave your father , nebchadnzzar , gretness and glory , but when his heart became arrogant he was deposed from his throne and stripped of his glory until he cknowledged tht the most high is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of heaven .
would you humble the almighty by desecrating his possessions ?
would you bind him like a captive nd beat him like a slave ?
this is his answer to you .
mene , god has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end .
upharsin , your kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians .
thus says the lord , your line is ended .
your rule is over .
ls there nothing to be done ?
will the least of your slaves comfort you , or will they desert you , seeking to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldiers together :
i am king blshzzar of the babylonia .
s he has commanded , i shall assume the crown .
you are darius , the mede-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem taken this city .
by right of conquest , you are now the king .
yes , and you are an officil of babylon .
it is a reward for letting belshazzar know that you were about to take the city .
he read the inscription and revealed the message .
he told the king that h would di this very night .
daniel :
f i was to lie , would this be the lie i would choose 
and how could you have done so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i will speak to you honestly , my king , and when you would not hear the truth you must ask me nothing .
so be it .
yet i shall name you one of the three .
if they were loyal to the former master , they are no good t me .
cyrus :
he 's twice my uncle by blood and marriage and serves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yes .
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once he is in charge he 'll be looking into everything we do .
perhps we should eliminate him .
how ?
he does nt hunt .
a sudden illness or a drowning .
who would believe it ?
there is no corruption in him nor any negligence .
there 's a spirit of excellenc in him .
no one is that honest .
i had a man try to bribe him once , and a very generous bribe at that .
such a man is dangerous .
how long befre he learns that we 've been generous with ourslves and covered the thefts with false accounts ?
then perhaps we need to make him stp .
he wo n't do it .
if we could forbid his prayers for an entire month under penalty of immediate execution ?
do n't be ridiculous .
i know him .
the king knows that daniel and his people pray continuously and only to one god .
which is why we need to disguise our purpose .
indeed , they could find nothing amiss n my work , neither willfully nor through negligence or lack of care  so they tried t trip me up with my prayers .
but since worship of the most high was not prohibited by the laws of the realm , they had to conceal their purpose like poison in a cup of honey .
and have not submitted to your rule .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereby the loyalty of all may be tested .
but what of the gods of persia , my servant , obey ?
how would you enforce such an edict ?
no one would be allowed to go before any altar or shrine for the entire period excpt for you .
and nyone fond violating the decree would be thrwn into the lions ' den before sundown on the very day of the offense .
male conspirator # 3 :
in a single stroke .
i approve yor plan .
in anticipatin of yor approval , oh king , we have taken the liberty of drafting the edict and bringing it along .
cyrs :
and once a law is written , even the king himself can not change it .
daniel !
the king 's sel is barely dry .
you chose your god over yur king .
take him away !
oh king , it is my sad duty to inform you that someone has already defied your decree .
gurd :
bring forth the prisoner .
he pays no attention to you , oh king , or to the decree you have put in writing .
daniel is my chief advisor .
no on is above the law .
bring forth the tablet .
shall be thrwn into the lions ' den
by my hand and sal , darius the king , ruler of the medes and persians .
knowing the king 's command , i have disobyed it 
i shall command my wise men to make every effort to search out some reason that the law may be found unenforceable .
let them search , oh king , but only for  short time because your own law commands that sentence be carried out the day of the offense .
daniel :
it is as i expected .
a king who will not enforce his wn laws can not be a king .
i will wlk with you , daniel , one last time .
as you wish , oh king .
my frefather , abraham , came from this land , and the most high said unto him ,
i will make you into a great nation .
and may yet live to reap the frits of that curse .
a cup of wine from the king 's own hand .
nt so , daniel .
in the cup i have poured no libation 
good bye , my friend .
farewell but perhaps not good bye .
hear , h israel , lord our god ,
have mercy on me , o god .
no , no , take it awy , all of it !
in you my sul takes refuge in the midst of lions , surrounded by rvenous beasts with teeth of spears , with tongues as sharp as swords .
come near .
a tost to the lions who show no partiality to a hebrw over any other man .
but those who seek the lord will lack for no good thing .
daniel !
servnt of the lving god , has your god been able to save you ?
oh king , live forever .
my god has sent his angel , and he shut the mouth of the lions .
they have not hrt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the mn pay if he steals another man 's treasure ?
with his hands prhaps .
is there any penalty less than death which will do ?
but , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashioned my own words as a snare above my feet knowing my edict could not be reversed , but the living god , the god of daniel , has delivered him out of my hand .
no !
please wait , king , please !
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he rescues , and he saves .
for 70 years i had waited , and i knw our time was near .
my hert grows with excitement that now that time has come .
belshazzar , the folish ;
darius  who was deceivd .
who is this fourth king ?
it is one chosen by the most high to perform great nd mighty deds before he was ever kntted in his mother 's womb .
 bird f prey ?
true , i had never saw the regions of the euphrates or further westward until i came in conquest .
and yet you chased your enemies uninjurd .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i take hold of-
it mentions me by name ?
to subdue nations before him ,
so that gates will not be shut 
i will go before you and will level the mountains .
and cut through bars of iron .
please cntinue .
so that from the rising of the sun
to the place of its setting ,
how else might it be explained ?
daniel :
you have answered your own question , oh king .
this is what the lord says .
wh spred out the earth by myself ,
and makes fools of dviners ,
and of their ruins , i will restore them  '
i , who was saved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was raised in a shepherd 's house .
seventy years since i was taken from the land of my birth 
babylon has been punished .
you have punishd her .
only one thing remains :
your god has called me a shepherd , and so to your peopl i shall be , to rescue them from wolves and tyrants  to gather them gently and to relieve them from bondage and provide for ther return .
the lrd god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed for me to build a temple in jerusalem in judea .
any one of his people among you , may his god be with you .
let him go to jerusalem in judea and build a temple of the lord , the god of israel-
however , my heart was joyous as my brothers and sisters departed on their journey home while i remained in babylon awaiting the day when i , too , would be gathered to my ancestors .
ok ...
here we go .
focus .
one winner , 42 losers .
speed .
you got that right , slick .
bob , my oil pressure 's through the roof .
right , darrell .
and the winner of this race wll win the season title nd the piston cup .
he 's been dinoco 's golden boy for years !

his chance to finally emerge from the king 's shadow .
but the last thing he expected was ...
will he be the first rookie to win a piston cup and land dinoco ?

well , it all started a few months back with this very popular tv show .

two years ago my mom got a job opprtunity in l.a .
because i never really fit in in washington .
how can you stand to work for max ?
but i got ta pay for college .
guess we 're both here for the same reasons .
yeah .
so we have to do all these interviews for the show .
now it 's your turn .
are you the dark and brooding filmmaker like tarantino ?
no , no .
the power to take someone to a whole other time and place is amazing .
did you ever se that movie with gwyneth paltrow ... ?
it 's one of my all-time top five favorites .
let 's see .
casablanca , titanic , gone with the wind and when harry met sally .

if we wan na keep seeing each othr , we just have to be unromantic .
i guess we guys will take that one .
you girls take that one .
marcus , what exactly happened back there ?
it 'll take him a month to get that sand out .
do you want this job or not 
i 'm not doing it anymore .
you can do your own dirty work .
max , we do n't have any thr interns  and i do n't think we 're going to find any by tomorrow here in mexico .

to sub-intern .
yeah ?
announcer :
the chllenge :
you now just trail 3 totems to 2 .
now , without giving too much away , i will tell you that tomorrow 's event has a lot to do wth balance .
therefore , shane and adam are hereby disqualified from tomorrow 's event 
it 's not over yet .
did you do this ?
i just want you to know i took karate for 10 years .
it 's my bad .
me ?
but the tree 's still there , is n't it ?
yes , it is .
that one really almost did mom in .
how is mom ?
she 's thinking of running for city council .
but she really misses you .
now , if the mayans lose this event , the aztecs will be winners of the challenge .
a test of balance .
a test of strength .
there 's just one catch .
all right , challenge warriors .
 know you can .
good job .
go , j-man .
i got you .
i did n't say , max says .

i do n't regret taking those pictures .
max :
the mayans get to go on a beautiful sunset cruise .
but with a whole new wardrobe .
my fault ?
i hate guacamole .
geronim !

and i just wanted to tell you that i missed you .
anthony :
justin :
come on .
justin :
are you making fun of me ?
the water 's great .
can i talk to yu for a minute ?
it was my idea to put the two of you on the show .
i do n't blieve this .
i know it 's not an excuse , okay ?
no , you 're not .
anthony :
justin :
i just ca n't believ it .
right 
being on the challenge with my sister showed me what i missed the past four years .
we were alwys concentrating on how dfferent we were .
but , really , we have a lot in common .
i do n't know .
and i ca n't believe we wasted four yars of our lives .
max :
the aztecs and mayans , thre totems apiece .
it 's gon na be an exciting finish .
a tough week 
look for maps along th way to guide you .
now , if at any portion of this event you fall you must go back and begin that portion again .

nce upon a time in the land of flutterfield , there lived a btterfly fairy named mariposa .
she was the smartest fairy in the land 
then , one day ,
but along the way , they faced peril and danger of all kinds .
mariposa and her frinds rturned to flutterfield to discover the skeezites attacking the royal palace .
queen marabella hailed mariposa and her friends as heroes , which they are to this day .
hey , mariposa !
hello , mariposa !
hi !
hey , mariposa !
morning , mariposa .
hey , mariposa !
good morning .
excuse me .
yes .
i will , for sure !
bye !
how come i never get an autograph ?
you must be the most famous librarian ever .
asy , zee .
i 'm right here .
what is it ?
th queen ?
huh ?
of course , your majesty .
the crystal fairies ?
from shimmervale ?
yuck !
huh ?
their land is built on an amazing natural energy source called crystallites , and the crystallites heat and power everything in their realm .
hardly .
you see ?
everyone knows that .
only because that 's what we 've ben led to believe .
it 's what 's in our fairy tales .
look .
then , the crystal fairy king accused the butterfly fairies of trying to steal their crystallites .
the butterfly fairies denied t , the crystal fairis did n't believe them , and everyone got angrier and angrier until the two sides declared themselves eternal enemies , and vowed never to have contact again .
wher s the picture of that ?
you wo n't find it .
research , not hearsay .
i 'm convincd .
hh ?
but crystal fairies are dangerous !
willa can manage that .
ah , willa told me i 'd find you here .
hello , carlos .
oh , but you are the smartest fairy i know .
yu 've read every book on shimmervle .
but what if i do n't ?
what if i say or do the wrong thing ?
what if i make things worse ?
and remember , the best way t make a friend , is to be a friend .
hmm .
oh !
i almost forgot .
my mother asked me to give this to you .
ooh .
it 's made from the most precious magic of flutterfield .
whenevr you have doubts , just take it out and t will remind you of us .
please , thank the quen for me .
bye , carlos .
goodbye !
goodby !
yes .
uh , what was that thing you said ?
um ...
hmm .
i 'm on it .
i will !
zee ?
looks like one of your books does n't want to go .
zee .
you 're not afraid of the crystal faires , are you ?
mmm-mmm .
zee , it 'll be fine .
come on .
let 's g have an adventure !
including a parade , marching band , and fireworks.
ooh .
ooh .
this is the meeting spot , zee !
huh ?
do n't hurt me !
of course w wo n't hurt you .
you 're not going to hypnotize me with your wicked magic , then lure me back to your dark , dismal cave and ...
um ...
thanks , i like yours to .
is that your war beast ?
war beast ?
no .
so , is this the grand welcome ?
come on .
in the name of his royal king regellius , it is my privilge to give you an offcial tour of our fir land .
welcome to shimmervale city .
it 's a butterfly fairy !
follow m .
wait .
historians say this is where shimmervale 's first residents discovered crystallites .
yup .
it 's why we end the tor here .
and now to the palace , where you 'll be staying .
the castle was built over 4,000 years ago under the reign of king fremulous the fourth .
his wif , queen safrila , designed much of what we still se today .
ah , you 're mariposa , are n't you ?
yes .
i 'm catania .
hey !
there you are .
anyhoo , let 's show you to your room 
zee !
yo !
tah-dah !
tah-dah !
wow !
it 's ...
i decorated it myself .
rally interesting .
i based it on everything we crystal fairies know about butterfly fairies .
that was thoughtful .
nah , i could n't figure out how to make it work .
 did put in hidden thorns , though !
please welcome mariposa ,
i introduce king regellius and princess catania of shimmervale !
hey ?
is n't that right ?
in flutterfield 
let 's repair t the terrace for tea .
hmm .
hey !
you almost made me spill my smoothie .
good morning !
breakie ?
it 's lunchtime .
check !
oh , no .
i mean , we have warriors , but we 're a very peaceful people .
but i was under the impressin butterfly faries were built for battle .
hmm .
oh , excuse me .
my word !
oh  no !
this is awful .
let me help .
oh !
did i get you ?
here , let me see .
please .
and moved a bit farther back from the tble .
of course , your majesty .
more .
perfect .
what ?
this royal tea is over !
well , that went better than expected .
now is the time , boris .
when are we gon na gt to the revenging ?
silence !
i ned to concentrate .
yes .
yes 
beautiful ?
personally , i prefer things to be shnir , you know ?
sparkly , like a piece of jewelry , or a lake !
i could n't sleep either .
hmm .
it says here that outsiders re forbidden to touch a crystallite , especially the heartstone , which is the mst powerful crystallite n shimmervale .
that 's why th king was so upset at tea .
oh !
i 'll never live that down .
well , it never really came down to battle.
please welcome mariposa , royal ambassador from flutterfield !
well , it looks like everyone is busy today .
well , it appears my subjects are preoccupied .
she 's attacking the king !
there will be more people here tomorrow .
i 'm sure of it .
we 're flying .
and mother thought two years in art school was a waste of time .
a long time ago , i forget how long , our fairy forefathers built flutterfield on top of a putrid swamp .
it says that flutterfield was built on a magnificent and exquisite garden .
yeah .
willa , you 're not supposed to bring the visitors back here .
today will be better , zee .
oh !
the king has askd me to invite you to the annual crystal ball .
crystal ball ?
what 's that ?
just the biggest social event of the year .
i want t thank him for the invitation .
now where is my third flying battalion ?
h , mariposa .
thank you , your majesty .
now , look at what you 've done !
honestly , i 'm not even sure why i agreed t this arrangmnt 
do anything ?
keep them that way .
i 'm sorry .
it 's just he ...
i 'll talk to him .
ow .
that could be difficult .
you wanted to see me , your majesty ?
it 's our most important celebration and i do n't want anything to go wrong .
yes , sire .
you see , boris ?
i 'm a-sharpenin ' .
sorry .
oh !
wow !
you worked s hard to learn about us , the least we could do is return the favor .
hmm .
it 's perfct .

it 's one of my all-time favorites !

it 's okay , sylvie .
we can trust mariposa .
wow .

like nothing can harm me .
a little , but i 'm really enjoying getting to explore shimmervale .

a lot .
but the crystal ball is ths afternoon .
we 'll be back in two wingflps .

i understand , sylvie .
yo think this is amazing ?
i did n't think getting closer could possibly make it any more amazing but ...
i 've missed this place .
why has it been so long ?
no , i do want to .
if we let other creatures have crystallites ,
so your father said no .
mmm-hmm .
well ...

you had your chance .
catania , go back !

gah !
my spell was too weak .

but he could have just asked queen marabella .
do you ?
i want you to have this .
catania , i ...
i thught i needed it to remind me of home .
maybe after i leave , it can remind you of me .
huh ?
whoa !
we need to go get ready !
oh , it 's been a long week .
but i think we did it .
mmm .
mariposa 's gon na be so impressed .

oh !
now i know how it feels .
that butterfly fairy has a crystallite !
what ?
no !
i knew we could nt trust them 
mariposa , you stole a crystallte , after we welcomed you .
but mariposa and i .
she 's a butterfly fairy , and in no position to know what 's best for a crystal fairy princess !
i understand why you 're so protective , but ...
th ballroom ?
and never come back !
father !
as you wish , your majesty .
but father , i gave it to her !
it 's all right , people .
the butterfly fairy threat is over .
smil !
that i failed , or that i have to go home and admit it to peple who believed in me .
what is that ?
we ca n't just go .
zee !
catania 's our frind 
if the king and the other crystal fairies are n't our friends now , well ,  'm going to be a friend when they need one most .
shimmervale , your day of reckoning has finally come .
whoa !
you 're so wicked !
he 's the one who does n't understand , anu .
it ca n't be !
what ?
catania !
mariposa ?
that 's all it would have taken .
huh ?

we find a way to break her magic staff .
you 're not gon na get away from me this time , princess !
we have to do something .
yeah !
what ?
what ?
i am , but sylvie 's wing is hurt .
oh , no !

i do n't fly .
and it 's the gwyllion .

father , no !
yo must n't harm her .
