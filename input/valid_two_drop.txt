gsh .
yeah 
well , we 'd better hurry .
hope they 're expecting us .
all right , gentlemen , we 've all had our say , and we all agree on this one vital oint , we are clamping a tht secuity lid on professor brainard 's tremendous contribution .
oh , you 'll be recompensed .
goodnss knows , the armed services are never chintzy .
matter of fact , i 'm ptting two o my bravest financial officers on the misson .
professor , you are a fine , unselfish man .
it 's a privilge to know you .
but just relax .
no sweat .
the money is as good as in you hand .
schedule four is going in .
well , professor , i do n't think we need to take up any more of your time .
we have to stockple statistics , build up pressure , deploy our firepower so we hit them from all directions .
well , no , i do n't suppose we do .
do n't let those double-breasted suits fool you .
those boys are tough .
well , the thing i , we do n't need all the moey now .
it 's big .
verything bout it .
everything is going to fall apart all the way down the line , and te free worl loses another battle .
is that what you want ?
no , i would n't want that , sir .
remember , you 're in ashington .
stop trying to b reasonable about money or yo 're going to bollix up the whole thing .
you 'd think those people at the pentagon could at least have given us a couple of $ 100,000 out of petty cash .
what 's n na happen , professor ?
oh , oger .
i 'm srry , biff .
i got ta face it .
the only time my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was when he got me .
is n't it magnificent , gentlemen ?
medfield college has , i believe the saying goes , finally come into the chips .
why do n't you just change the name of the place o brainard college and have done with it ?
a splendid idea , mr. hawk , though i realize it was offered in a spirit of irny .
we 'll b up to our hips in crackpots .
no .
are n't you all getting a little high and mighty ?
oh , splendid .
ask him to come in , please .
gentlemen , wuld you be good enough to ris ?
when prfessor brainard comes in that oor ,
i mean you , uh ..
well , you really should n't .
well , not exactly .
it 's just ...
thy relly sabagged you .
they hung your hide up on the brn oor to dry .
well ...
but i thought they were delighted with your discovey .
it 's just hat ...
number one , the boys in washington latched on to your little discovery , so you ca n't sell it anywhere lse .
number two , they 're not about to give you any money until they think it over .
numr three , meantime , you 'v got no money .
number four , somebody better lay 350,000 clams on the barrelhead , first of the month y 9:00 a.m .
period .
end of sty .
i ca n't believe you 'd do a thing like that , mr. hawk 
well , boys  it looks like i 'm calling the tune again .
i now how badly you must feel , president ggett , but things are n't as bad as they seem .
excuse m .
as a civic leader ...
pearls !
oh , i just lov pearls .
i make it my bsiness to know , mrs. brainard .
and now , little something to keep the chill off .
oh !
oh , yo must n't .
well , you do n't think it 's a little bit too fussy , do you ?
like you 've been wearing it all your life , mrs. brainard .
and her , the finishin touch .
an empress .
i do , do n't i 
this , as you can see , is a check for one million dollars made out to the profesor and yourself .
for a kind wod , mrs. brainard .
you know , in a busines deal , the right word from the littl woman ...
i 'm a great believer in the power of a woman 
you really got something , mr. hurley .
well , i o n't know what ned 's going t say about all this .
for a spce-age scientist , he 's a little bit old-f ...
guess who ?
betsy !
what i 'd like to d ...
betsy , what is all this the dogs an that coat ?
please take it o .
now why do n't we let the little lady enjo herself ?
mr. hurley is a live wire .
professor , when you invented this stuff , i do n't thnk you dreamed what you had .
do n't be so modest , professor .
that s your trouble .
that 's where i come in .
flubbermint um , it chews while ou snooze .
flubberin , bounces away pain agin and again .
hit hem where they liv .
they 'll wonder how they got along without it .
howie , roll the film .
guess what this is ?
but , etsy ...
hi there .
newton and the law of gravity .
watt and the steam engine .
edison and the electric light .
nd , my friends ,
brainard and flubber .
for it was not too long ago , in a smal american city , that the discovery of fluber burst upon a waiting world .
tat was the beginning .
from those first crude basketball shoes cam more shoes , shoes for people in ever alk of life .
he could walk with his head above the crow .
but this was only the springboard , not only to a vast new line of products , but to a happier , safer way of life .
friends , is your home a booby trap jus waiting to snare you the moment you set foot in it ?
i 'm home , dear .
is your kitchen a savage jungl teeming with perils nd pitfalls ?
dear , where 's the first-aid kit !
stop clowning , george .
tansform it from a booy trap into a lve nest .
yes , fbberize you home with hazard-ree flubberoleum floors .
the foamiest , friendiest loor that ever ondled your family 's feet .
hi .
sweetheart !
 got him !
hey live in the house with the flubberolem flors .
i 'm very impressed , mr. hurley , but ..
now if you 'll just sign this letter of agreement .
that million-dollar ceck is th evidene of our good faith .
a rior commitment ?
wth who ?
all right , boys , pck up the gar .
the party 's over 
forget it .
yo 've hurt mr. hurley very deeply .
oh !
now just a minute .
do i have to give this back ?
i wo n't 
now give him his check .
betsy , give me that check .
give it to me .
oh , very nice .
beautiful quality .
how do you do ?
my name is harker 
from washington ?
well , am i glad to see you .
come right in .
how do you do ?
it 's very nice to kow you , mrs. brinard .
may i take your hat nd coat , mr. harker 
you and your discovery have certainly ceated quite a stir down in our natin 's capital .
and you 've come about the payments ?
well , thank you .
oh , but first , of course , we 'd like to pinch off just a tiny bit for ourselves .
just enough to take care of the household bills that have been stacking up for months .
all right , dear ?
internal revenue ?
the figure includes delinquent penalties of $ 12895 at five percent for the first two quarters .
let me explain , mr. hrker .
now they put a top-secret classification on it .
i 'm not even supposed to talk to anybdy about it .
certainly .
excuse me .
we 've been counting on you .
w trusted you .
you do n't build those rockets to the moon with green stamps , you know 
excuse me , dear .
joey 's here to collect for the paper .
i do n't think so .
there 's ten cents .
there 's anoter dime .
he wants his money 
there 's another dime .
that 's all i 've go .
we 're rooting for him all the way .
oh , ned , i cleaned all the loose change out of there .
oh .
but uncle sam has to run his store on current income jus ike everyone else .
when the money he 's countn on does n't come in , he 's very sad .
thank you , mr. hrker .
thank you .
thank you , mrs. brainard .
uh , joey marriano .
and how many customers would you sy he has on is route ?
oh , i 'd say around 30 .
you would nt take money from a child .
we do our part to keep the wheels of democrcy rolling .
funny you should mention that about mom .
we naild er dead to rights .
i missed you .
i missed you , too .
 just could n't help feling sorry for all those people .
now , you take that inome tax man .
we 're citizes .
now sit dow , and hold yur breath .
oh ?
what does tht mean , you got hold of the weather ?
what it means , mrs. brainard , is that fluber was only te key that unlocked a great storehouse of cosmic fores 
i found a gas .
do you realize what tat would mean , bety ?
it would mean that , for the first time , weather would become the slave of man , rather than his aster .
ca n't it be something modet that would bring just a few dollars into this houe ?
r trash can lids that would actually fit the top of trash cans !
trash cans ?
i 'd say i could use a little machine like that right now !
anything can happen .
anything !
i thought yo wee nuts !
right .
and they 're practically national champs , right ?
right .
even my own father could n't close a colege that had just clobbered the national champs , could e ?
what do you think the suit is or ?
i have n't been hangi ' around professor brainard al semester just for kicks , you know .
what 's this thng supposed to do ?
how does that feel ?
oh , hi , prof .
good .
oh , by the way , professor ,
oh .
glad to know ya , humphrey .
hi here .
oh , not exactly .
sir , science needs rilliant young minds like humphrey .
besides , i needed a volunteer .
for what ?
sir , i hoe you wo n't mind , but  'd like very much to borrow a little ubber gas .
humphrey , come on , demonstrate .
ther 's only thing , biff .
i do n't know how much protection those pads are going to give you .
oh , we 're not thinking about protection .
w 're thinking about offensive pwer !
just imagine , sir 
the teams line u .
the ball is snapped .
rutland linemen fall lke ten pin in every direction !
he 's over for a touchdown !
yeah !
waddya think , sir ?
i hink you 'e slightly nuts .
you go ight ahead .
we 'll o on a rash program riht now .
thank you , sir .
no the flubber gas is violent , but we need ven more violence , so we stimulate it electronicaly .
now , let 's see what we 've got .
now let 's see .
you now , biff , this stuff is labeled dangerous .
oh , now , humph boy .
lok , would i get you into a situation unls i knew exactly what i was doing ?
that should do it .
i 've never seen them so worked up .
when i bombard a clod with a bem like this , it just has to lead to clserin .
rain all over the place .
now , for a cloud .
not a cloud in the sky .
ready .
aim .
charlie brainard !
betsy .
etsy .
ad that 's only the beginning .
it 's a result of my fooling arund with the molecular configuration of flubber gas .
all i ask of you is to get dressed for dinner .
whatever you say , dear .
oh , did n't i tell you , dear ?
n , i do n't think you did .
if there 's one thing i 'm certain you 're not , it 's narrow-minded .
it is n't as though he wre coming all by himslf .
we 're adults , you know , not children 
you do n't for one single inute mean ..
i 'll get it .
nuzzie !
i 's wonderful to ...

we 're so different , you and i. i 'm the gay , irrepressible macap flitting from flower to flwer , and you 're the nice , sensile little homemaker .

the wonderful thing about betsy is , she combnes beauty with rains .
i think betsy 's sweet .
i think she 's just as sweet as she can be .

i hd to go through three marriages before i ealized that ned was the kind of man i was looking for all along .

now , le 's have no foolish ride .
just a minute , ned .
if you do 't mind , i 'd like a cance to express myself .
ned i did nt sa i as going to take the position .
that is an bsurdly old-fashioned attitude .
could i have an onion instead of an olve this time ?
excuse me .
oh .
if i 'd married him , i would have just spoiled him rotten .
you should n' take it this wa , brainard .
after all , hat are fends for ?
here we go .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do 't wish to pry , but may i inquire what this marvelous new discovery is ?
t 'll effect people all over the world .
may i ask how it works ?
i bombard the clouds with a technque
i am not at the moment at liberty to divulge .
oh , i see .
biff !
biff !
that is original thnking .
humphrey , are you all right ?
answer or i 'll blast you to ribbons .
nobody in here but us chickens .

come on , humph .
let 's get suited up .
will you stop worrying so much ?

wha 's the big secret ?
you 'll find out soon enough .
rainmakers have always run into that same old snag .
wait a inute , charlie .

poor lamb .
oh , yes .
hug and kisses .
arrivederci .
well , that puts the tin hat on it !
gt , dh .
we ve made our own cloud !

i told you i did n't want that job , but i 'm beginning to change my mind .
bety , are you oing somewhere ?
if it were n't for that , i 'd know exactly what to do .

desiree does n't mean anything to me , betsy .

great !
yeah !
oh , i 'm srry , prof , but the hot water bottles did n't wor , and we had to low every cent we had on the scuba suit .
god , i wish we were invited to one of those halloween paries around here .

betsy !
what in the world ar you doing ere ?
i might ask the same ting of you .
well , i was .
but there is an instinct called elf-preservation , you know .
nder certain conditions even the lowest form f animal life will go sarching for food .
look , neptune , why do n't you just submerge ?
you see , brainrd , you v already spoiled the party for her .
now why do n't you leave betsy alone ?
ashton , if you do n't stay out of thi ...
some kind of a pasant , are n't you ?
wait , betsy ...
come on , nuzzie .
i did n't want to hurt you .
as the poet says , he hurt is not so deep as a well ,
nor so wide as a church door ,
but 't is enough , 'twill serve .
i 'm sorry , shelby .
okay , charlie .
h , say , aptain , we want to thank ou again for this new prowl car .
do n't wry , captain .
officer !
it 's that find , brainard !
he 's p there , somewhere !
bright and early , professor 
mr. hwk !
plate gass in stores , automobile windshieds , bottles , clock faces , glass of every kind and descrition bean to break and shatter in various portions of our community .
as you see , they formed a pattern , a sort of cone-shaped pattern of devastation , as though some unseen force had fanned ou from one beginning oint , at a place on the corner of maple and litchfild .
now , i may be wrong , proessor , but is n't that the precise point on which i 'm standing at thi ery moment ?
but outside of making me feel good all over , what would it get me ?
no , the point is , i 'm not sore at you at all , professor .
while everybody else is busy making things , you com up wih the answer .
you come up with somthing that breaks things 
we replace it with new glass .
it breaks .
mr. hawk , you do n't seem to understand .
how about that united natons building n new york ?
mr. hawk , you o n't for one minute think
i 'd go along with a scheme like that , do you ?
wel , what are you acting so high and mighty about ?
look , professor , why do n't you just settle for what you got here ?
with the money frm this thing we 'll both et fat .
ad there 'll be enough lft over for you to take cae of the medfield problem .
save medfield college ?
that kind of mony would never help medfield college or anyone else , mr. hawk .
well , you know what you 're doing , do n't you ?
and before this day is ove i 'll be back here with te sheriff .
and we 'll have this place tied up tighter than fort knox !
with all your work and all your xpernts !
and as for medfield , a year from now , people will hve fogotten there ever was such a punk littl college .
out of the way , son .
you 're a ittle overdue on my allowance .
why , i 'm just liable to send you off to jil with this criminal here , as a fellow conspirator , a partner in crime !
professor , you mean ou 're gon na help us ?
maybe the colleg wo n't be here next year , but we 're going to see that nobody ever forgets it .
come on , hump !
let 's hustle into it !
will you forget about that ?
the professor 's with us now !
the frst team 's coming into the game !
biff , biff .
let 's take it easy for a minute .
i just think there might be a more effective way f using it .
boy , jut think , 70-yad kicks , 90-yard passes !
are you cracking up ?
so , we never throw just the ball , we throw the player with the ball .
right !
that 's right .
humphrey , it 's just smple logi .
with the flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless , or buoyant , and then we throw ou with the ball .
you do ?
do n't you see the beauty of it ?
even if they intercept , we still have possession of the ball .
right !
right , humphrey ?
uh , right .
poor ld medfield !
see them run !
well , ladies and gentlemen , here we are in the little community of medfield .
say what ou will about their fotball team , at least the weather here is good .
i 'm afrai we ca n't promise ou much .
mighty rutland universty , ntied , unscored upon for the past three seasons , knocking at the door of the national championship pitted tonight agaist puny medfied .
oh !
wait 'll i get my hands on those two !
coach !
oh , good , good .
so go ahead without us .
steady .
est wishes !
oh !

if you 'd just reconsider my idea .
what 's that , humphrey ?
there 's flubber gas n here .
well , so i do n't have to wear this suit .
instead , we give the good ole football a shot of gas , and the zzshhhh !
humphry .
we 've been throuh al that .
with this new valve you have perfect buoyanc control at all times .
we got ta get out of here .
what 's wrong , biff ?
my father .
pop walkd in to get the sheriff who was his dinner there , and i overheard them talking .
then they went over to judge murdock 's .
we 'll hae to fix the suit in the locker room .
lok out !
h 's getting away !
ladies and gentlmen , i 'm afraid it 's going just the way we predicted .
ighty rutland is shredding th little medfiel team to bits .
well , he ust be here someplace .
you two get he rest of th boys and spread out !
look , i do n't mind losing the football game , professor ashton , but spare s your garbled quotations .
you 're not expecting anyone , are you , betsy ?
thank you .
you 're winning .
it 's a massacre , coach .
yeh , ai n't it a shae .
we should have brought along the girls ' volleyball team 
we could have sent them in .

the ball is snapped to humphrey .
now hawk has humphrey .
get off the playing ' field .
take it easy , huh ?
well , it 's a race against time now .
medfield trails rutland by nine points .
with less than fo minutes left to play , the big question is can rutland stop medfield 's brilliant aerial attack ?
oh , it looks as if rutland may have something up their sleev .
i 've never seen 'em use this kind of defense before .
dow !
hut one !
hut two !
now , remember , you guys  he ol lady with a twist on two .

humph !
there may be time fr one more play .
repeat , 98 yards .
too bad .
it 's gaining altitude .
and there goe the final gun as the game ends and medfield wins .
the bll , te ball is sill going up ...
up ...
up ...
george , dd ya see that ?
oh , shut up !
well , the trial of profesor ned branar swung into its third day toay .
professor brainard continued to act as consel in his own behalf 
he was quoted as saying he ws confident in the due processes of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony against him , as te prosecution kept a steady parade of witnesses moving through the witnes box , today , the prosecution ulibered its big guns against the defense .
professor brainard , you seem prou of your job as a teacher .
do you like it because you believe it makes yo important ?
but i believe the work i do is important 
would you care to tell us a little about it ?
maybe plant a bug f discover in their minds , or ...
and you think that 's important ?
one of hose young people might discover something the entire world has been looking for .
he might not , but i like to fel that i had a par in giving him a crack at it .
i see .
now , regardless o whether you are found guity r not ,
wuld you continu as beore ?
ould you recklessly incite the young minds of your class again ?
i put the quesion to you again , professor , and i ask you to mark wel your answer .
wold ou stll persist in these dangerous and maicious follies ?
mr .
far of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , faling hair , even fear of mr. hawk .
e fid our self apologizing , hidig our heads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remember when groundog day ony came once a year in this country .
now , i see a lot of studnts from my science class here in the courtroom .
they may not be the most studious group of young peope in college today , but i 'll say this for them , so far they are unafraid .
i have high hopes for them .
am i to understand , professor , you actually encourage mistake in your class ?
suppose you are returned to your role as a teacher , would you do exctly as you did before ?
yes .
you may step down .
come on .
let 's te this thing up an get out of here .
15 or 20 minutes should do it .
in that case , i will um up briefly .
may i suggest , professor , as defense counsel , you 're not doing much in your own bealf .
i 'm a witness for th defese , your honor .
both objecions overruled .
but , your honor , this is most unusual procedure .
it is also unusual procedure for the defense to have no witesses in his own behalf .
wear in the witness , please .
my time is your time , mr .
do ou solemnly swea to tell the truth , te whole truth and nothin but the truth ?
elizabeth brainard .
wil the defense question the witness ?
no , your honor .
as i was sayin , my name is elizabeth brainard .
he scratched my fender in the paring lot just outside the administration building .
on ocober 30th f this year 
i told him i did n't think i was cut out to be a scientist 's ife .
well , i 'd like to iform the defendnt at this time that i was wrong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
of course , she means it .
oh , betsy .
your hor , will you excuse the witness at this time ?
th defendant always said he loved m in midnight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does all this , uh , foofaraw have any bearing on the disposition of the cae 
you et , your honor .
i do n't believe it .
that is  if you do n't mind wasting the time .
gngway !
gangway , verybody !
i d n't wish to pry , but would you kindl divulge your intentions ?
the court is waiting .
i 'm sorry , your honor .
may i ask that this witness be recalled to testify for me ?
very well .
must we subject ourselves to irrelvant testimony trumped up by the defense ?
the witness is qualified .
but your honor ...
i 'm the county agricultural agent , that 's who i am .
oh , yes , yes 
i certainly did .
and you were very upset .
so much so that you decided to investigate the matter toroughly .
well , i did 't come here to toast marshmallows , you know .
now , mr. allen ...
irst , would you mind telling us about th soil conditions here in medfield county ?
medfield county has the thinnest , rociest , wore-out , farmed-out , pooped-out soil in the whole state .
i 've been so ashamed .
it 's not much good for growing things .
wait , i 'll show you somethin .
that is an ear of corn .
a radish !
if you wat to see something really miserable ...
sombody pt ...
it 's aound here somewhere ...
uh , that 's fine , mr. allen .
why , everywher i look , everything is suddnly all ertiled u !
oh , i do n't ...
he can call it anything he wants .
i think that yo 've invented ...
is it anything like taking a dr bath , or gong for a dry canoe ride ?
you see , professor brainard 's rays must hav combined with massive amounts of nitrogen out in the atmosphere , see ?
why , for all we know , it might be dry-raining right down in this ortroom ths very minute , fertilizing eerything n sight !
you ca n't tell , you know .
do you expect tis court to believe all this mumbo jumbo ?
can you substantite it ?
oh , my goodness !
come on !
that 's right , boys !
look at those crros , judge !
oys !
do n't push !
your wife says to get home riht away .
a smmer squash just roled off the vine next oor and smashed your sports car 
the jurors will please sit down !
thank you vry , very , very much , judge .
you should try some of this walnut .
oh , yes , es .
 eave it to you ..
case dismissed .
do n't take it so hard .
as a matter of fact , i 'm crazy about i , but ...
offhand , can you name one hing that science has n't improved uon , one way or another ?
oh !
i guess i 'll have to go along with that .
this is my home , the great karoo desert .
i 'm not even born yet .

poor bradley .

traumatized .
♫ visualized .
♫ i think i get the picture .
oh , yeah , laugh at m .
some birds are just not ment to be caged , hey , bradley ?

no charge , edward cullen .
you wold n't understand .
ot bad .
so what else is there to know about vampires ?
there 's a couple things .
they 're incapable of singing happy birthday .

tis wole not really being a vampire thing just is n't sticking wih you , is i ?
i am coming down .
bloodsuckr !
ah !
with such speed and agility , how can you claim to not be a vampire ?
i 'm the real deal , and i  real dangerous .
so i 'd advise ou not to challenge me .
give up now .
arm yourself !
okay .
ah !
you know that there 's only one way to render a vampre powerless .
exactly .
and i accet your callege .
on the count of three 
ou fought bravely , human .
i see .
there 's humanity , even in the undead .
i will spare your life .
i wll spare his life !
vi !
i forgot vi !
well , maybe .
but i 'm thinkig you 're probably blaming me for all of this , and that you migt actualy it me .
that 's true .
so cool .
yeah .
you 're not even m type .
both :
you 're welcome .
now this is y scene .
hold on tight
all aboard n this endless ride
so maybe
i 'm not the coolst guy i the world , but who cares .
and they all seem to like the real davis .
that 's pretty cool to me .
and just to treat you fair and square , we 're paying double wage and a bonus , from frisco to shanghai and back , all found .
tel 'em what you saw , bill .
and it came a-bellerin ' out of the night , with one big eye like a lighthouse .
we 're stved into staroard .
and then it com up amidshis .
and broke our backs and sunk us .
and it 's a miracle old billy 's alive today .
tell em about its teeth , billy .
you mind answering a few question ?
monsters interest me .
all kind .
boiled down fr is oi , lds , there 'd be fre grog for all hands , if you can swallow it on top of his tall yarns ...
there !
stop it !
coe on , casey .
this is no place for a clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie !
do n't bother unloadin .
this is idiculous .
we just have to get to saigon .
halfway around the wol from paris  and now this happens .
except pack and unpak .
oh , professor ?
i 'm from the bulletin .
these gentlemen are from the globe and the post .
we 're interested in your opinin of this monster .
professor , ht does the natonal museum in paris think about it ?
i can not answer that .
we heard this expedition of yours was to gathr facts about the monster .
i 'm afraid you wee misinformed .
why do n't you ask  fish ?
do n't you print that .
you do not deny then that suh a monster could exis .
is that correct ?
thank you , professor .
lok at his drawng .
i knew it .
by professor arronx of the paris naional museum .
hy , this is the most far-fetched nonsene yet .
farfetched ?
you 're ot serious , professor ?
oh , i do n't mean flying off with a ship in is mouth .
but the general size ...
i 'm nt a reporter .
may i come in 
thank you .
would you accpt ?
i wuld be interested , yes , naturally .
why..
i think the hnour is ours .
as the foremost authority on the sea and it 's mysteries , you can e an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it concerns the monster .
very much o .
according to the papers , you seem to believe the rumours .
no .
yes , i 'm afraid i was misquoted .
however , i have an pen mind on te subject .
we acept .
good .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like you to come ownstairs ad meet captan farrat .
he 's in command of the warship pon which you 're sailing .
every an aboard was on the lookout , and the watch was kept day and nigt .
capain frragt left nothing o chance .
with traditional thoroughnes , the navy plan was to cut the south pacific into square and searh each square .
fae alarms were common , and they did n't help our morale .
our hopes began to wane .
it came as no surprise ... hen captain farragut on te night of december 8 , 1868 , summoned us to the war room .
gentlemen , i believe my obligation to this legend has been dispatched .
it does n't seem to me we have proved anything one way or the other , captain .
w 'll set you ashore in saigon .
cheer up , professor .
i thought they promised you a onus if you harpooned this monster , mr land .
knwing full well i could n't collect i .
when i get back , i 'm shipping out on the first whaler that 'll take me .
you scare e .
be a good loser , professor .
what a pity , professor .
i know you had visions of that onster mounted in the national museum 
'bout the flapping fih ad the girls i 've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
met her down in madagascar
she would kiss me
got a whale of a tale to tel yu , lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a hale of a ale , and it ' al true
there was typhoon tessie
met her on the coast of java
blow me down and pik me up
se was he captain 's wife
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
on nights ike this with the oon above
a whale of a tae , and it 's all true
there was harpoon hannah
if i kissed her
and held her tenderly
a whale of a tale or two
'bout th flapping ' fish and the girls i 've lovd
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
ahoy !
ship off the starboard bow !
aye aye , sir .
i 'm tinking he went down with ll hands .
what could have set it off , though ?
you meaning the monster , ai n't ya , mate ?
aye !
it might be he moster .
sure , it 's the monter !
it is the monster !
pipe down on deck !
i must insist , rofessor , that you keep these fish stories to yourself .
there 's the monster !
look alive there !
get your ange and fire .
well , hit her in the hels .
aye aye , sir .
ru her out smartly .
she 's turning !
stand by to lower away .
professor !
hey , do n't leave us !
help !
they can not help .
but they must !
help !
 'm getting numb all over .
look , professor .
there 's something over there .
i do n't know .
it looks like te monste .
a submarine boat .
bt , this i incredible .
men have dreamed about such miracles .
you know something ?
i do n't like this at all 
ahoy !
it seems deserted 
i think we are asking for trouble , professor .
maybe somebody will come up .
no .
if we wait , this thing i liable to sink under us .
why , it 's as bright as day .
there is great genis bhind all this .
yes , and great evil .
do n't forget this is an engine of destruction .
is anybody aboard ?
wait .
look at this .
give me a hand with this lie , mate .
anybody else gt off ?
yes , the professor is down below .
well , he realy got his monster , did n't he ?
i 'm not anxious to get in their company myself .
my sentiment exactly .
big .
i 've never seen a barge like this before .
hey , this looks like the galley .
cook 's day off , too .
professor .
professor .
professor .
rofessor , where are you ?
hello .
i 'm in here .
what is it ?
you know , ned land is here with a boat .
that tall one must be the leader .
the 'll be coming back any moment .
get away !
help !
help !
earch the boat .
you are from the warship that attacked me , are you not ?
this is ned land , master harpooner .
you may remain .
i did not invite you here .
you came as an enmy to destroy me .
they 've done no harm .
do n't blame us beause the wrship sheled you .
the sea shall have you back .
easy , mate !
i 'm not what is called a civilised man , profesor .
but i am as guilty as they are .
i will gant you that both of them and me , too , enlisted to track down what we thought to b a monster .
but , in hat case , we are no more guilty tan the rest of the world .
you 've carried your work as far as terrestrial science permits .
the real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off , wonders that defy my powers of description .
the secrets that are mine alon , but which i would be willing to hare with you .
at the expense of my companions ' lives ?
i 'm sorry .
then i can not accept .
professo , i regrt your choice .
take him up !
and secure for sea .
aye , sir .
ll stations ready !
prepare fr diving .
yes , ir .
prepare for diving .
ahead slow .
trim your foward ballast .
what about the other one ?
i found out what i wanted to know .
there .
come in , gentlemen .
be seated , please .
professor .
i 'd like to express our gratitude  capain .
we are grateful to be alive .
i want none of your gratitude .
yu 're all on the strictest pobation , and i 'd advise you not to attempt escape .
you understand your position ?
i guess that makes us a little bit of both .
 tolerate no guests aboard the nautilus , and you aleady know the fate of prisoners .
the food is delicious , is n't it , professor ?
oh , very good .
i 'm indifferent to 'em .
these dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen .
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppos this is n't lab , then .
yes , my cook excels in preparing these various products .
well , just the main course .
the cream is , of course , milk from the giant sperm whale .
saute of nborn octopus .
since we are nearing the islnd of crespo , y 'll have an opportunity of selecting your own food .
for a brief hunting expedition .
well , that suits me ine .
when do we start , mate ...
almost immediately .
dlightful smoke .
havana ?
i am still curious as to the reaon you spared our lives .
i may have use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaed ?
it comforts me to know that your life was not too dear a price to pay for the loe f your fellow man .
at he moment , i do n't intend tha you should .
we 'e almost at the island of crespo .
all this was onc an island .
i knew there 'd be a catch to this .
seems you ca n't do anything on this boat without getting wet .
hey !
wait a minute .
where you goig with this ?
an expdition from the nautilus .
it 's a new experience for them .
they 'll learn quicly .
i 'll introduce them to you .
captain nemo and i were not alone .
an underwater larder filled to overflowing , and all captain emo for the taking .
ballast ?
ballast !
ned , you forget yourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. land .
why did you do it ?
ask him .
that was scientific interest .
i had no idea he was ater treasue .
oh  no ?
we mut n't quarrel among ourseves .
we must stay togeter .
it 's our only chane .
chance ?
you want t play a waiting game , hoping to earn nemo 's secrets .
i believe we owe the world that much , ned .
hav you a better plan ?
i want to get of .
of curse i do n't mind going with my pockets full .
and do n't call it stealing , because that 's the way he got it .
i we could take this thing over , we 'd be rich .
i 'd have a ship of me own , and you would n't have to be starving on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me with those soft-oiled ggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them when that chest busted .
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win he captain 's confidence , bt i need time , ad i need yur help .
all right .
it is the best way , believe me .
trivialties .
nonsense .
that depends on your point of iew .
i just think that ned values his life above scientific achevement .
today we encountered a fearsome sorm .
an ordinary vesel woul have suffered heavy damage .
a whale of a tale that ' true
at my host 's invitation , i inspected the ship .
we went to the very heart of he vessel , the propulsion unit .
this secret alone gav him mastery of the sea .
and in a single stroke , harness power beyond the wildest dreams of science .
or destroy it .
with seeming indifference ,
as i studied him ,
i bcame aware that powerful forces were at ork within this strange man .
think of it .
on the surface , there is hunger and fear .
men still exercise unjust lws .
tey fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few feet beneath the waves , thir reign cease , their evil drowns .
here i am free .
far btter that tey think there 's a monster and hunt me wih harpoons .
after traveling 10,000 leagues under the sea ,
i felt at long last i was to have my answr .
the prisn camp of rorapandi , the white man 's grave .
but i thought it had been abolished .
what is in thse sacks they ae carrying ?
nitrates and phosphate for ammuniion , the seeds of war .
they 're loading a full cargo of dath , and when that ship takes it home , the world will die a little mre .
i as once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there .
lok t it again  professor .
i do n't want you to frget what you 've seen here today .
it sounds remote .
it was there that we built the nautilus .
you will have the privilege of seing all this frsthand .
hen our mission is completed , te nautilus is going home .
they 're getting up steam , sir .
vry god .
that ship tat flies n flag sails with the tide .
you hae your orders 
i said go below !
collision peed , full !
profesor ?
are you al right ?
all those men , they did n't even have a chance .
ned , do n't .
damage report , sir 
we 'll make temporary repairs here .
i asked you to leave , professor .
why ?
you are not only a murderer .
well , i see murde , too !
there are the assassins , the dealers in eath .
 am the avenger .
is murder a right reserved for that hated nation that has taken everything from me ?
they tried .
they cast me into rison , and when they failed ...
what you fail o understan is the power of hate .
i was just trying to tidy up .
about hat ?
well , i believe things hav gone far eough .
murder means nothing to him .
it is not your place to judge .
you do n't know anything about the captain .
now  pleae go out and leave me alone .
what did you call me ?
captain 
yes , i did .
seen enoug ?
did the professor put you up to this ?
you bet i was right .
and i was right about you spying on me .
we may need it .
we ?
since when do i need you ?
i wan na be riends .
i wnt to escape .
so do i , with you .
you once sid you had a plan .
well ?
trouble is , it wo n't work .
i ca n't figure how they navigate this barge .
no courses , no bearings , nothing 
f e could figure where we 're eading , we 'd ave a chance .
that 's n problem .
vulcania !
aye , sir .
keep your eye peeled for the mate .
ned , put them back .
he 's cming .
that was close , mate .
maybe ...
ned , le 's get out of here .

i 've got to do some research .
what kind ?
well , ned , you 've got everything here , from th rarest nudibranchs to oysters .
i want the bottles .
you ca n't do that .
tese are priceless .
why , that went out with robinson cruso .
tat 's for spying ' n me .
do n't let me catch you padding the shadow of my stern again .
remember that .
i do n't like bashing ' anybody , but you had it cmin ' , lad .
and i thought we were friend .

i swallowed it .
there was a flabellina oculina in there .
astern , full !
we seem to have ru aground .
a accident , captain ?
the tide will float s free by evening .

the last time we went ashore , it was a prelude to murder .
aye , sir .
throwin ' away a chance like that .
the professo s losi ' his ballast .

i might have expcted you to say that .

the ony difference is that i would n't have tried .
then it is that difference that gives ned land a human dignity yo no longer possess .
i know you were deeply touhed by ned 's gesture , but yo are ashamed to admit it .
you can not tolerate a faith n humaniy , because if you do , all this , the structure of your very existence , which you built on hate and vengeanc , all this will collapse around the naked lie of your ife .
and you are a very gullible man , profssor .
gullible ?
wat he would do one day , he would gladly undo the next .
to be of benefit , goodness must be constant , forever building .
you will neer find it .
if men and nations had this goodness that i speak of ,
have you considerd sharing it ?
i had hoped hat you would be the key to a plan i had in mn .
i had intended using you as an emissary .
but now i do n't know .
is it that you do n't trust e ?
but you are ever the optimist .
do you really believe they wuld lay down their arms and abolish their slave camps ?
enough energy to lift mankind from the depths of hell into heaven .. or destoy it .

did you ever hear of sour stomach ?
wait 'til toorro .
praise him above ye heavenly host
they trust to nothing but a shadow .
but bear testament .
eath comes unexpectdly !
i intended to take effectul care , but death came unexpectedly ... like a thief , outwitting me , too quick for me .
now the great king of heaven an earth ... will abolish and annihilate this pride 
will rush the hardened wretch ... of te polluted infinite abomination , and rain on him ... a deluge of fire and brimstone !
where re the great leviathans who defied god then ?
where is their courage , these , these , these , hese proud spirits ?
now , isaiah has warned s , on the day of vengeance , the earth shall be laid to waste .
the raven and screech owl shall dwell in it .
yea , he an lay the earth to pieces in one momen ... or shatter the whole universe with one strke of his fier sword 
how dreadful is the state  those who are in daiy dnger of his great wrath , this abyss of death and despair 
there is no securiy for the wicked ... because there are no visble signs of death at han !
the arrows of death fly unsee as noonday .
god has many differnt unsearchable ways of taking te wicked from this world .
calm in your knowledge of healh , secure in yor wellbein .
yes , death comes unexpectedly !
i thought the reerence to jeremiah at the finish was very effective .
did n't you , mrs ford ?
i ca n't deliver the messag with syrup .
your voice is od s instrument and should be used accordingly .
e sure sermonizes something fierce , oes n't he ?
brimstone and damnation on top of ham and eggs !
he one day a week we have off .
ooh , i just hate them !
breakfast still a hot ball in our stomachs , and him chewing our ears ff from that pulpit !

um , i just said ha nobody could own a church .
our social stucture in this small town seems to teeter on  delicate balane , one which i certaily can not in ay way attempt to influence .
then you 're siding with her by not mentioning it !
i 'm staying completely out of it , and that 's all there is to it .
reverend ford , if you 'll just let us say that you 're in favor .
there 's nothing more to discuss .
this is all just impossible .
i 'm afraid you 're riht .

when you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it ,
you surely will .

plank :
zenon :
high five !
someday , we 're actually gon na find out what thse little blips man .
no , no  i ...
i understand fuly .
yeah .
what 's wrong ?
i mean , it 's not like i expected that we 'd b together forever .
i 'm not a mron-majr , but , he dumped me !
i 'm not sur hw , but she 's down there , and i 'm up here , and she 's probably been plotting to get gregory to jettson me and pay attention to her .
i 's just ...
well , look at the upside .
all the time you 'e been spending zap-padding greg can now be used to take further advantage of your free run of the spay-stay .
zenon , i 'msorry , but after your little incident this morning ,
kindlyhandin yourrzrp to my office asap .
and i lost my favorite shoe !
zenon :
yes , i 'm sure you did n't , zenon .
nevertheless !
i firmly believe that the discplie of working down here in the alien atrol lab will be good for you .
and truth be told , you 'll be performing a mission of mercy .
your poor friend orion 's been working down here for five full years .
you know how many signals h 's picked up in all that time ?
none !
to assume we are the only units in space ,
i personally call it rudeicrous .
now , look , in y harly humble opinion , bidirectional telemetry is only a matter of time .
coe in , come in .
you know ?
okay .
zenon s being asigned to a month of three-hour evening shift with a six-hour day on satrdays .
cetus-upeedus , commnder !
you simply need to be here .
but what i today ' silence turns to tomorrow ' thunderous call from the void 
look , no li , just last week , i uncovered evidence of a new planet that may have formed a mere 20 au from gama pictoris .
yeah , see ?
i got ta get back to the command deck .
i expect you to report back down here at 1900 hours tonight .
what ?
oh .
uh , okay , you ready for your tour ?
the fist thing you got ta know about ae these babies .
um , lok , if they ever sart rotating at an accelerated speed , you come over here , and you soun the red aler ...
alien signal ...
alien signal !
alien signal .
alarm cock .
ah , congratulatios , zee , you just survived your first shift .
zenon :
you 're in comprehension-mod-minor , mom !
well , the month wil be over before you know it .
kind of like me ad geg .
do n't worry , i am not so squashed .
protozoa .
butwhatis certain is that since his return frommicrobe 's triumphant concert in space ,
protozoaasnot been seen in public , nr has he been in a recording studio .
cetus-upeedus , he ca n't be ding this !
why s he doig tis ?
he 's on  brea , a vacation , omething .
repeat , allhands to th mess hall for an emergency briefing .
look , tea , i 'm sorry .
me too 
military ?
yeah , what ...
all right , first they 're sending up a squad to asess the condition and conibution of each module .
following that ealation , some space station components could be etached and jettisoned .
plank :
if that occurs , certain personnel might be reassigned to earth , bu any speculation in that direction is ...
are thy considering shutting us down altogeter ?
to the best of my limited knowledge , absolutely not .
wht 
right .
plank :
i know it 's hard , but we 're prfessionals , and if we can just wait for general hammond to arrive ,
i think everything will b explained to you .
zenon  i know your mother has an incredible fear of flying and an even more acute fea of earth , but any decisions regarding who stays and who goes wo n't be up to me .
but you 're gon na have some kind of opinion , right ?
they do n't ven know us .
general hammond and his team have arrived in the transport lounge .
all right , have him report to my ffice .
whenever i hve a vial , formiable mission to assign , i look for the best mn or young woman for the job .
whatever you need , i 'm your girl .
it 's not often someone my age ets t serve her country under the command of such a noble and gifted leader .
you request it , i 'm in .
spacewalking , duct rawling , undecover ops ...
mrgie ?
margi girl .
since you 've hd a ong , grueling flight ,
but , daddy , why ?
i ' not in the least bit tired .
hammond :
all ight , all right , i was just ...
did i mention that gregory said to sy hi ?
are you pancaked ?
i 'll survive .
but up here , you are on my tuf .
if daddy 's the commnder of your ship , and let ' face it ,
i 've ot daddy totally wrapped .
no !
i have n't even worn it yet .
it just arrived from the virtual mall this morning .
so if you 're not mondo nie to me ,
bye-ness !
mework lesson b .
sh only gets under your skin 'cause you let her , zee .
why so she can call up daddy and rder him to send my family packing ?
whoa .
yea , but you know what ?
it 's not gon na happen to us 
zenon 
voice : zum .
plank :
what is it ?
you need to ocket ovr here warp peed .
well , there is a slight spike on the gaph , but thre could be 100 different reasons for that .
yo know , it 's true , zee .
i mean , wih eery country in he world sending up stellites into space , we 're alwys pickng up interference of some kind .
no , it was a very specific and very distinct zum .
loo , zee , i 'm the first one to wan na beeve ou , but there is nothing here .
all right , uh , let 's just go with simple logc .
for as long as this space station has been in orbit , for as long as mankind has monitored the skies , no one has ever gotten even the tiiest indication that there was any sort of intelligent lie out there .
zenon , i asigned you this duty to keep you ut o trouble , and that 's all .
yo believe me , right , mm ?
i believe you believe ou heard something , but it could 've been a bllion thigs , hony , you know , a computer hiccp , a power surge .
do n't get mad at me for saying this , but you 've been having a pretty lousy few days ,
do n't you think it 's possible you could have invented this signal just to put yourself back in the spotlight ?
dad !
i herd a zum !

nebula :
come here , come here !

no zum or zum .
but , commander , i ...
hammond :
you 're not going to believe this !
eve tough the grah spiks clearly indicate nothing more than normal saellite interfeence ?
in fact , i think it would be better if we suspended the rest of your assignment up here .
inanticipationof the tremor-like jolt asociated with the separation , allpersonnelshouldreport to designated secure areas at that time .
where 's my strss helmet ?
as far as i can figure , wyndham and lutz 's sabotage effort knocked our station out of its intended obit .
are we us gon na sit here and take this ?
what do yu ropose we do ?
i do n't now , but i 'll think of something .
when heard from your lips , zee , thoe are the most errifying words in the galaxy .
you se this ?
is n't that more of a reason to fight back ?
this is wher we 'e meant t be .
i 'm stating to onder if we would n't all be better off back on earth .
i could marry judy .
i ould get a normal job .
cetus-lupeedus , this is not you talking , commander plank .

zenon :
how am i gon na survive on earth ?
hey , at least it 's not as gaseous as we used to imagine it to be .
the food ...
the food is lunarious .
the second you get there , you have to order a bacon double-mushroo onion cheeseburger and dedicate it to me .
oh , we understand , believe me .
i wish those military clowns had some idea what they were doing to all of us .
woman : attention !

and that 's my fault ?
zum , zum , zum .
tey 're fully imitating you !
of course the are , love .
wo would n't be ?
she 's fine .

i 've done the space thing , remember ?
proto zoa !
first rock star eer to sing for alien beings from another galaxy .
oy-y-oy !
pack my spacesuit !
all i need to know is when do we leave .
sometimes judy gets so caught up n being the fun aunt , she does n't always use her best judgment .
it s not going to happen , hon .
but if it does ...
this has been our home for so long .
it ' so familiar and protected .
and it 's where we belong .
beig a family is n't about our ddress .
sorry , sir .
i 'm here on ordrs fom general hammond .
you and mrs. kar are under house arrest .
we 're what ?
what ?
we hve to get down to our lab .
we have som very important experiments in progress .
i am sorry , sir .
i 'm actually writng .
i have n't been able to scribble down a single note since i fell into my funk .
t 's like my mom says 
gemma usually does all the cooking in space .
yeah , nd as soon as they land , creepy government official guys with lots of keys woud try to cath them and experient on 'em .
oute sace s a pretty enormous expanse , if i recall .
voice  access denied .
right after they sent the first message directly to me ,
orion said he suspected they also downloade al kinds of information , but i have n't figured out how to get it .
accessganted .
cetus-lupeedus , look !
wdefinitelyknow it 's a map , orion .
ijustdon'tknow how to read it .
okay , an yu upload it to m ?
icantry .
i 'll see if i can match any of their coordinates and get back to you asap .
how does she do it ?
he would have goten all rd-faced mad at me , if he thought i 'd flown off just to have an adventure .
oh , so once again , i 'm the expendable one .
but i thought you had him , oh , so totally wrapped .
about some thins .
lok , you fully have to convince him to let us use the shuttle .
the aliens are waiting , margie , and if we can show the world that our spay-stay 's responsible for contacting other life forms then ...
maybe they 'll stop tearing it apat and lave us alone .
come on , marge .
that 's it .
poto zoa and i will be right here rooting fr you .
thetruenatre of our mission ...
hello , daddy ?
assonas we 'verelocatedall space station personnel to earth by the end of next wee , wewilljettisonthe remaining sectors .
man :
i could hear him .
he just could n't har me .
can you beieve this ?
judy :
i 'm telling you what zenn heard hammond telling hart .
and soon .
suppose couldrustleup a shuttle , and suppose , just for a minute , thati wasinsaneenough to tke off after a pck of proto zoa-loving aliens 
judy :
are you ready for this one ?
thealienssentzennamap .
they what ?
it'strue !
noonedownhre knew how to read it , but we 're hoping that he 'll have the skills and the ools to decipher it .
sweeheart ?
doouhavethe slightest idea how rzy this sounds ?
especially life with zenon .
i simply used their benchmark symbols of the eath and moon to alibrate their distance units .
then i re-plotted those locations to our standard issue navigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in all candor , orion , do you believe this map is legitimate ?
look , sir , if you get on a shuttle nd you fly out to the location indicated here in my hardly humble opinion , you are going to find yourself , face to face with extraterrestrials .
oh , 'cause i was thinking ...
why do yo hate me ?
what are ou talking about ?
you 've been mean and sarcastic to me since the last ime i was on earth .
oh , that .
wait , are you actully saying people listen to me ?
okay .
o you know how many times we 've moved , hw many schools i 've gone to ?
i d n't try to be a jer .
what if i get plank into  lot of trouble for taking that shutte ?
evrybody 's got pressures in ther life , margie .
if you wan na make some real friends , start by learning you 're not the only person i the galaxy with problems .
like what ?
the air is inky brown .
the food tastes like plastic .
captain and wills , united states intergalactic patrol .
to interview your daughter , and find out what she knows about the current whereabouts of zenon kar .
oh , please , come in .
um ,  have ...
i 've been missing her terribly .
would you permi me to pilot the departing transport shuttle this evening ?
i do n't see why that could n't work , commander .
we appreciate this 
listen , i told you everything i now .
she came down here to fnd proto zoa .
precisely how did miss kar intend to discover his whereabouts ?
zenon :
he is actually coming down ?
tat 's a miracle-major !
did you hear that ?
we got a shuttle , nd plank 's going to pilot us to meet the aliens .
where are we hooking up with him ?
yougysneedtogetthere as soon as possible , butmakesurethat you stay out of sight .
what 's up ?
well , nebula calle to ay that hammond has a patrol down here searching for you , checking anywhere and everywhere that you guys might be .
have they shown up at your place ye ?
notyet , buti 'm sure it 's only a matter of time .
evise that .
oh !
did you hear that , guys ?
we 're going to space to meet the aliens !
woo-hoo !
judy :
it does n't see like anybody 's here .
oh , man , yo have zero idea how envy-green i a .
i mean , this is the real deal , commander .
this is the trip i hae spent my whole life cogitating about .
i mean , you 're ctually getting to meet extraterrestrials .
yes , well , i 'm stil very ...
i 'm still very skeptical about this whole thing , orion .
woman :
oh , hang on .
you do n't want to be rocketing off to meet the aliens without your navigational charts .
hank you , orion .
i ca n't tell you how much i appreciate ..
all your help .
now , before your heli-hover arrives i have to ask you one thing .
i 've seen luggage stores with less luggage .
let me remind you ladies that stying as fabulous-looking as i am requires mega atntion
have we heard from zenon yet ?
they 're back from nova linda cove and they 're headed for carlson beach .
befre we go , would you mind terribly if maybe i washed up a little bit ?
come on .
plank is no under full military arrest .
now , asmuchaswewanna support you in this , honey , yourmotherandi are starting to think thatmaybeyououghtto surrender to hammond s patrol andcomehome .
and fully foet about the aliens ?
now , thebottom-line reality is , plank i the only one on our side whohastheability to fly a shuttle .
i ...
not to menton istorical .
why could n't you be th pilot in he family 
i man , you 'd go out there in a heartbeat , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
when did i turn into such a big , f chicken ?
i used to love flying .
zenon does n't get it all rom you , you know ?
i do know .
suddenly , the staes changed .
 mean , she wants me to do this more than anyone .
s , where are they ?
wory-down , aunt judy .
i 'm sure tey 'll be here any minute .
i studied this ship 's navigational charts 100 times .
you sure ?
i 'm capable of flying a shuttle at this point , orion .
i 'm telling you , mrs k. , it 's fine , you wo n't ave to .
what ?
what do you mean ?
um .
i , you guys !
hi .
o , how did edard ever pick this spot to land ?
cetus-lupeedus , unt judy , no one 's told you yet ?
haond threw him into military jail .
hammond 's going on the mega-warpath and if i 'm wrong about this whole ali thing , it could be disaster-extrem .
but , sweat-minor , unt judy , 'cause i 'm fully sure everything 's gon na be just fine .
but , if edward is n't piloting the ship , who is ?
oh , my word , this was a mistake .
i ...
how did i let yself get talked into this ?
look , just relax , okay .
the nly thing more terrifying to me than takng off is landing .
i , uh  i really do n't think i can do it .
look , i do n't wan na be unsupportive or anything , mrs. k  but maybe you should 've thought of that efore e took off .
we 're the united states miltary , wills , she 's a 15-year-old girl !
it'shardertha we thought , sir .
orion :
okay , brace yourself , we 're abound to enter the atmosphere .
oh , dear .
oh , my word , the landin .
look , mrs. k. , i have full confidne in you , but can i suggest this is gon na be easier if you open your eyes !
from yo , dollface .
t 's true .
there it is , it 's almost here !
orion , what if it kept flying right out of m chest ?
okay .
oh .
oh , oh , oh !
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blue-eagle-2 , we are closing n target .
we have visual confirmation .
watchyourflanks , people .
who 's that ?
mom , we have to go !
zenon :
what 's happening ?
what 's going on ?
i ca n't get them to reignite .
engage target .
solder 2 :
orion :
come on .
and your girfriend .
mr. kar :
and since it 's aso a very risky and brave endeavor , and since we all have peopl we love on that ship , sir , aybe instead of assignin blame and punishment , we ought to fous on a way of helping thm achieve a safe retun ?
sir .
i do n't get it , mom .
well , the trouble s , converting their measuements to ours does n't mean the calculations were prcise .
i mean , even a varince of a few degrees on paper cod man thousands of miles out here in space .
we are gon n find them , are n't we ?
i mean , we 'll just fly around out here until they show up ?
we have a finite fuel supply  limited provsions .
it 's okay , they 're gon na be here , i know i .
whatever eds u happening out here , thank you .
for what ?
honey , you shwed me that it 's fine to wan na live a safe and sane life , but sometimes we can get so safe , you practically stop living .
ship console :
fuel tanks in depletion zone .
orion said tha the auxiliary tanks he put in are even large thn the main tanks .
hip console :
now , that 's wrong , it has to be .
please reconnect to main tanks .
auxiliarytanksempty .
orion , did verything appear normal when you refilled the auxiliary tanks ?
i mean , i know they 're not exactly thrilled with us but they ca n't an na leave us up here to die !
i tried calling bt there must be a meteor shower in progress because all i got was static .
tell me one thing , do i look half a hysterical as i feel ?
what , more so than usual , y mean , lve ?
uh , flks , we also have another probem .
before anyone ca reach us , we 're gon na get sucked into the moon 's gravitational field .
is that bad ?
look , everyone irs of all should stay calm .
are you sure ?
i have always known that blastng ito an endless void was bad for one 's helth .
so , how did i end up here ?
zenon :
come on , come on , folks , we ca n't die out here in pce .
look out .
exactly as orion predicted , the moon 's gotten a hod of us .
we 're going down !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
where 're they akng us ?
am i dreaming ?
how can this be happening ?
they 'e not gon n hurt s .
what if they try o come on board ?
do we think it 's ...
i certainly think so .
cetus-lupeedus , did you see that ?
madam , sir ,
i be you got a million quesions for me , ai n't you  you little beastes ?
well , i 'm here .
what if we were wrong ?
apparently , their ship 's navigational computer 's gone into meltdown-ode-major .
it kind of fels like ...
if they 're such highly evolved , intelligent beings why do n't they simpy tap into our space station mainfame and take the charts they need .
what ?
we are telling you exactly what enn zap-padded us .
margie 's with them , they 're all safe , thy 're on their way back and if we stand by , we are gon na witness something that is , and i quote ,
the most astnishing event-major of the 21st century .
lt .
at this point , sir , um , it looks like a flying rainbow .
zenon :
they were real !
but the ac reman , i was not set up here to be some mustache-tiring villan ,
ths space statio ha drifted out of its presribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hammond , i ...
do you dare to argue with me ?
and we gave them the avigational stuff that they needed and the gave us a tow home .
and the whole thing is so macro that the world needs to know about it .
prof , margie .
what no one here seems to be offerig is proof 
uh , actualy , we 're falling back nto orbi .
stellar .
thank you !
thank you , thank you , thank you , ladies and gents .
wel , as my pal zenon kar can testify , when she so cleverly foun me on nova linda cove , i was a mess .
so , he tld me about these space alens , an she told me that they wantd to contact me .
they picked up my transmission of my concert in outer space ad usd that to contact a true believer , zenon .
so what if i 'm not the ceter of te universe ?
i mean , look at me , i wanted new challenges and i 've gotte them .
so , to commander and mrs. edward plank ,
all right , everybody , clap !

of all the planets in our universe , there is only one we know can support life .
it ' been called the lucky plant .
without that crucial tilt , everything would have been different .
all life on earh is built on chance and powered by the sun .
but the delicate balances of our world are falterin , as the planet struggles to upport our growing demands .
january , the high arcic , and there has been no sun for oer a monh .
every living thing is just waiting .
perhaps it 's just to clean her fur , but it looks like sheer joy .
they 're drawn to their mother 's calls , but these slopes are not the easiest place to take your first steps .
the cubs have n't been ed this morning .
the mother has delayed their first meal on this special day .
hunger will draw them to he .
milk i the only food the cubs have know since they were born dea and blind beneath the snow .
every yer at this time , female bears need food desperately .
this is te only place the bears can hut for seals .
if they do n't make it there before the ice breaks up , their families will starve .
it 's unlikely both of her cubs will survive their first year out on the ice .
march , and munch of the north remains snow-bound .
a thousand iles south of the bears , stunted coniers are still locked in ice .
it 's one of the last great wildernesses .
these conifers have needle-shaped leaves virtually inedibl so the forest supports very litle animal life .
this creature is the very essence of wilderness .
as spring creeps up from the south , the taiga is unveiled .
they 've come to make the ms of the brief flush of spring food and to have their young .
if newborn calves are to keep up , they must be on their feet and running the day they 're bor .
but these vast herds do n't travel alone .
the clf may be young but it 's capable of outrunning the olf , if it manges to keep its footing .
by this stage , the odds are even .
april in the rctic , and already the sun never sets .
but further south , the su works is magic in more gradual familiar ways .
the broadlaf woodlands of europe and north america .
more than any other , these hav been crowded out by towns and farmland .
only fragments remain .
summers are longer ere and deciduous trees can flourish .
spring has also come early for the mandarin ducks .
it 's a long way down for a maiden flight .
a few calls of enouragement are needed here .
there are stil two missing .
only two dys old and already one great adventure behind them .
a seasonal cycle that seems increasingly unreiable .
but there are parts of ur orld that have no seasons .
may , in the tropics , but there is no spring .
this is what allows the jungle to grow unchecked and support so munch life .
rainforest now covers a third of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planet 's surface and yet , t contains more than half of all the plants and animals on earth .
he can concentrate on more important tasks , lke tidying up his display area .
this magician has a special trick .
wth the audience in place , the show can begin .
she jst has to have been impressed with tht .
after all that effort , can she still have doubts ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % of its plants and animals nowhere is there more at stake .
deserts cover one third of the land 's surface on planet earth , and they 're getting bgger every year .
and the challenges are becoming greater than ever .
june in the kalahari desert of southern africa .
lt 's the dry season here , and tousands of elephants have started the desperate trek for food and water .
at the moment it is dry , but water should come .
buffalo joi the great trek .
dust storms make the going tough all the way .
they 've become separated from the herd .
this is a dangerous place to lose your way .
hey dre n't res until they reach it .
finally , the stragler emerge from the dust .
the stom has died down .
but not ll the animals have been so lucky .
sand dunes give way to prairies and savannah .
grass is a great unsung hero of our panet .
this is the circle of life that mos of us , in our urban lives , have lost touch with .
perhaps spurred on by a memory from the pst , the matriarch lads the herd to a temporary water hole one that may have saved her life years ago .
the calf and its mother are most at risk .
ln the darkness , an elephant 's vision is little better than our own .
the lions bide their time .
it 's the cales they 're after .
the calves are too well protcted .
as the deserts grow , and traditional migration routes are bloced by farms and fences , elephants must trek ever greater distnces .
the sun that scoches the desert also brings water to th land .
as it beats down on tropical seas , moisture rises from the warming oceans powering our global weather system .
as the air rises , so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scene is set for one of nature 's most challenging migrations .
each year , thousands of demiselle cranes try to escape the harsh winters in mongola  by flying south to the warmr climes of india .
to get there , they have to cross the highest mountain range on earth , the himalayas .
the cranes hit violent turbulence .
the sun ' rays weaken in the afternoon and the turblence fall away , but it 's too late for today .
the adults must guide their young on this hazarous trip .
it 's eary morning and the warm air is already rising fast .
this i the geat unending cycle .
for generations , humans and animals alike come to depend on the great rivers and ther seemingl endles flow .
after months of drought , the rivers begin to flow again i the klahari .
this is an africa we rarely see a lush wter worl totally reliant on a seasonal flood , originating from a tropical ocean thousands of miles away .
many animals are quite at home in the lood , but there are some more apprehensive bathers .
after weeks of marchi , th elepants are exhausted .
after so many weeks , many hundreds of mils , they 've arrived .
the seasonal cycle that drives the lives of elephants on land , is jut as importt in the oceans .
it 's july and the humpback whales are in their breeding grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no more than a few weeks old and as he begins to tire , hs moher supports him close to the surfce , so that he can breathe .
these shallow equtoria waters make good nurseries they 're warm and calm and ther are few redators .
to find food , she will have to lead her calf on an epic 4,000-mile journe to richer feeding grounds at the southen extremes of our planet .
this is the longest migration by any marine mammal , and it depends entirely on a healthy ocean all along the way .
out in the open ocean , the whales meet others searching for food 
they have to cross half the globe , from te equator all the ay to the edge of antarctica .
the tropical sea are a long way behind them now .
they 'r heading for stomy seasonal waters .
grat whites attak whale calves , but they 're not the victims today .
these magnificent predators , at the very top of the food chain , are a vital part of a healthy ocean ... and yet we slaughter almost a hundred million of them very yer .
their opulations are in freefall .
out to sea , the ice is now too hin to support the cubs ' father .
this is  isaster or polar bears .
withot a solid pltform , they struggl to hunt the seal they need to survive .
how will the father make it through the yea now that the ice is almos gone ?
the waters are getting colder and rogher .
so as not to lose track of each other , they slap heir fins on the surface .
the hales have finally reached antarctica in time for the summer .
at last , after their 4,000mile journey , the humpback whales can feed .
now , at ast , the mother can replenish her reserves as she and her calf join the rest of the team .
winter in antarctica and the greatest seasonal change n our planet s uderway .
soon th continent will be plunged back into darknes .
the aurora australia illuminates the southern skies , but these spectacular lights bring no warmth to the wilderness of ice .
our male polar bear is in great danger now .
fter many days at sea , the exhausted bear is drawn by the pungent smells of he coony .
he 's desperate for food , but walrus are munch larger than his unseal prey .
it 's the pups he 'll have to get to .
the poweful dults can do terrible damag with their huge tusks .
e tests the barrier .
and again , in sheer frustration now .
it slips from his grasp .
this one took the gamble ... and lost .
unable to feed , he ca n't survive .
they 've left their moter ... and are thriving .
the polar bear has become an emblem fr the state of our planet and for al the creatures who are struggling to live alogside uns .

captain !
captain !
oh , nurse ...
i 'm from the maritime bureau .
he 's not wll enough to seak with anyone 
i only need two or three minutes .
he has nt regaied consciousness yet .
is he in danger ?
the othrs must have drowned when the boat sank .
how is it ?
the only thing we found was this .
the ship 's too big for everyone to have been washed off ..
the water urge could n't wash away that many people so thoroughly .
it 's notjust a coincidence ?
it 's amazing tht you were the only one to survie .
how many times are you going to say tat ?
enough to hear your response !
i want you to tell us what really happened !
the our other men ...
i called out to them ... before the ship was jostled , and i saw the frankenstein onster ... .
that monster has n't been found !
do n't you have another story ?
i know what attackd our ship !
i know in my heart that it happened !
after that , the four men ... !
i am not lying .
believe me , i am telling the truth ...
cptain , we 've discovered what happened to the four men .
you did ?
we 're sure this is al from the ship .
what could have done this to them ?
tokyo telephone ?
i need th kyoto shinagata institute , frankenstein research unit .
hello ?
yes this is it .
yokosuka ?
hello , this is dr. stewart .
we have n't had a frankenstein here since the one that vanihed at mont fuji .
yes ...
what did he say ?
he said that a frankenstein monster may have eaten some humans .
oh , my ... !
they want to ask yo questions aout the gargantuan , frankestein .
hae a seat .
-it is ?
he would n't be doing things like tipping over boats , or eating humans .
yes , tht 's y opinion .
let 's leave that closed , okay ?
now , this is what we hav next .
ot yet .
now , go ahead .
just before he scaped , he found his way into my apartment .
what 's wron ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
heave !
they 're casing any story that rlates to frankenstein !
i have ...
we just d n't know how much of this is false .
perhaps they just do n't know whre he is currntly livig .
look at this ...
it is ...
doctor , i would like to check it out , if you do t mind .
what did yu find ?
do you know what it is ?
is n't it rom the franenstein ?
no , i ca n say what it is yet .
hey , wait a inte ..
up , over there .
it looks like we 've got a bit of work cut out for us back at the lab .
thank yo .
i 'm afaid that those are from franknstein ...
i d n't believe thse cells could have come from any othe life form .
ut ... hy is it living beneath te sea ?
fight 17 , proceed 180° at 10 knots .
a monster is coming !
a moster is coming !
a monster is coming !
no !
emergency , emergency !
your back !
what was the thing that attacked aneda airport ?
i do nt kno ...
we have n't yet heard any details of what had happened .
did n't you say that the frankenstein you had in custody pose n threat to mankind ?
everyone , please !
please !
we leave for tokyo immediately .
what could make rankenstein live in the sea ?
nothing ...
doctor  can you answer some questions ?
-doctor !
what is the defense plan ?
we plan on sending a powerfl electrical current through tokyo bay .
he ca nt ithstan te light on a clear day .
dr. stewart , what do you say ?
i think you 're right ...
does that mean that you 'd continue yor studies of frankensten , regardless of what happened ?
yes ... yes , i ould .
that is the point of our problem ...
do you know what would hapen if rankenstein appeared in a peaceful cit like this ?
the lights !
is there a doctor here !
is there a doctor ?
the monster is goin away !
go get a stretcher !
-right .
he monste seems to be harned by bright lights .
the monster seems to be harned by bright lihts .
pleae turn on every light in the city area .

thanks ...
let 's go find out ...

grandmother !
-kei !
kyo !

hurry !
let 's go , let 's go !
we 've done all that we can !
halt 
move !
ready the searchlights !
we 're all set !
lights !
here is the latest rept from headquarters .
the creature has proceeded from tokyo to the mountains along the river .
take positions !
command , we are at position 10.95° .
the creature is approximately 300 meters ...
al back !
-fire !
look out !
cease fire !
order all units to stand down for now .
wherever he emerges , we wll be able to engage him wih siz units 
alright , let 's go !
-yes , sir !
right !
we 're ready in this sector !
commander , helicopter unit one ...
you a ordered to lure the monster into the established attack zone .
roger , roger !
the monster has slowed its pace .
w 'l attack soon .
calling base !
roer .
i think we shoud let him go a little further .
first unit is ready !
-right !
third unt is ready !
-switch the units on !
it 's time !
-alright !
converter one is ready !
geneator two is ready !
go !
bing the helicopters ito position !
hurry !
-hurry !
fall back !
fall ba !
all back !
-right !
we 'e all set !
-fire !
calling base !
swich on the electricity !
-switching on !
alright !
commander !
calling the comander !
doctor !
that one has to be the frankenstein we know !
then it seems your unch was correct .
well , it proves that there are two of them .
now , i have to convince them that one is innocent .
that is all ...
it 's incredible ...
what 's sanda got to do wit this ?
maye , f we do n't ask so many questions and try to find some clues , we 'll know that answer .
mr. yokosuka !
good find , akemi .
oh , thank you !
thank you for coming .
have you found the mnsters ?
you may want to check the lakes and steas around here .
i see ...
notify headquarters .
shall we continue on our way and see wht we can dig up o gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like his hair and tissue ...
the cells are identical .
this means that the frankenstein 's are brothers .
maybe ot ...
he could have torn f some flesh on a rock that made its way to the ocean .
once there , on protein-rich plankton , another fankenstein could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the other .
doctor , if tat i the case , would n't an eplosion create even more frankenstein 's ?
we 'll do what we can o avoid using them .
we can use npalm !
it 's strange ...
whenever there is a strong evl force around , youth seems to blossom .
are n't we gilty of doing the same thing ?
i do n't feel any guilt .
le 's go for a walk .
efore this mist gets any thicker ...
run away !
help me !
akmi !
listen to me and do n't panc !
doctor !
kemi !
hold on !
are you okay ?
you remember who we are !
wait !
gira is the one tht 's dangerous !
they are north at 135.10° and appear to be running away !
orders !
we will attack with every available eapon at our dsposal until they are fiished .
we will deal with tat after we have competed the task at hand !
all uits  retreat !
retreat !
at the moment , he 's still moving .
sand is inocent , general ...
to save , not destroy ...
i agree with him .
a plain nd simple fact that has already ee proven .
if you hi tem with your heavy artillery , yo will scatter their cells halfway to china .
then you wll be facd with a thousad franketein 's .
how can you be sure of your theory when it is n't proven ?
doctor , could you do that ?
they hae the same cells , the same genetic structure and the same blood .
what could that mean , doctor ?
gaira !
that 's just what we needed .
doctor , you 're turning off the lights ?
ge me the defense agency 
ys , and hrry !
yes .
he now knows that where there 's light , he 'll find food .
turn of your lights !
please !
hurry !
hurr !
hury !
what 's going on here ?
hurry !
hurry !
turn off your headlights !
you 'll have to leave your car here 
-damn !
help me out !
where is he now ?
-where is he now ?
hello ?
sanda 's in tokyo ?
i 'm positive he has n't come to help gaira !
doctor .
this is dr. stewat .
there 's nothing we can do .
sanda is entering tokyo .
i 'll be down there right away 
akemi .
where are you going ?
we hav t convince him t turn back .
you ca n't .
it 's too late now .
this time i 'm going to save his ife 
halt !
go on 
you illy nut !
come on now ...
for your ow safety , pease evacuate a once !
we 're all set to open fire !
for your own safety , please evacuate at once !
you 're ordered to clear the streets immediately !
this way .
akemi !
akemi !
-what happened ?
head for the secondary ommand !
akemi ...
are yo alright ?
-yes .
by the way , snda came to your rescu again .
i think he has a crush on you .
thirty minutes , then ...
but how do you know he will destroy gaira ?
two minutes to attack .
hello !
i 'm sorr , akemi .

the only thing we can do now is hope their cells do n't multiply .
they 've made their ay to the docks .
more , more , more , more , more ..

annabel :

annabel !

why should n't i ?
annabel , where ar ou going ?
i do n't go for that eggs and bacon stuff .

all due to the extraordinary efforts of this brlliant ...
rvolting .
i 'm afraid that 's not complimentary enough to the developer , my dear 
nothing very complimentary could be said about annabel .
no wonder they call it the terrible teens .
have you seen how she dresses lately ?
to see mr. dilk , the principal at school .
he 's asked for a conference to discuss annabel 's lack of academic progress .
what do you think of that ?
i 'm sure you can hndle it , dear .
i 'm up to my neck in this .
thank you .
she says she knows all we do there is kissing games .
she 's lso on my back to get my hair trimmed .
last time it was trimmed , they hacked 6 inches off .
pents seem to be immune to it .
sometimes i blow my to .
yesterday i said to her ,
hange my image ?
that 's funny .
irginia :
last night we had it out .
listen !
how come nobody ever gets to tell you what to do ?
annabel , i aid .
when you 're rown-p , people do n't tell you what to do 
which is sometimes more diffiult .
and do the laundry , i reminded her .
and the shopping and the cooking .
make tings nice for everybody .
together :
something really freak .
that 's no my voice .
wht m i doing here ?
that 's not my vice .

today i want her to enjoy every minute .

may cases tha people that are , you know , have lost somebody , los a child so dear to them the they can not get out with the fact of havng los the child and become addicted to these ...
okay , this a lady who is tryig to connect with someody at the front of ...
deren brown is a celebrated illusionist but also a skeptic
he makes clear his performances depend simly on mental tricks
she looks very , very elegant and there 's guilt on her part
he gives me the insde intellience on how a psychic medium migt exploit entirely earthly trae secrets
well , the aying was you 're constanly supplying the meanng yourself but it can be really convincing
charles ...
the psychic will , it 's a group hroughout names ,
you know it really coud be anything so omebody just pck up on it and tell you into what they ant to depict
he 's saying something about a hat that you used to like or something with the hat
and he asks me back
no , and i just ut another pictue , i put a picture in th hallway of the family or something
and we ask that w can now build a bridge between this world and th next so that we can once again go some way to proving that we survive death and the our loved ones in te spirit are forev wih us .
okay  i expect most of you are familiar with spiritualism but those that ...
but i thought i could hear and it culd be dave , devon or davenport something like that
no  but i have a home in davenort
you have a home in avenort ?
well , it depends on what you call cold reaing or somethin got a lot of the rations that come up sayig that what you do or yu say something can eople basicaly make it fit
now , see if i can find the harles in a minute bu let me ... give ou a few things i can feel about you
has that been a few problems with the stomach condition around you
and i feel with this lady i want someoe that 's a fairly comfortable build i would say a bigger build lady not the sight build lady that 's given me this , yes ?
i hate you when i ca n't find the link let me see if ...
i think if i wer talkig to someone in the spirit world
i 'd say things like 'what 's it like being dead ?
i blieve i 's a blending of thoughts between myself and the spirit communicator but if only it could be just like a telephon line
let me jst say what we can get a little more inormation from her firs
if you 've convinced the person that as their grandmother to the point that they 're actually crying
i mean surely those tears enough are perhaps proof hat they had proved that really i their randmother that 's making the communication
it could indicate ust deperate wishful thinkin perhaps
now , i do n't fit on with  steve bennet for i ve got those things i want to bring together somehow with particularly a car crash
my friend ben died in a car crash and he 's ... on school 's da
your friend ben passes and so there ' not bnnet as i said it was en
beyond whether it 's rue or false what concern me as well is the exloitation of often vulnerabe eople
can i ay when you were buying the nw shoes have you been on yur mind at that time ?
it was on my mid , i know i reall buy , yeah
and you know his messages eally in a whiny sorry , because he ca n't ...
he gives me the feelng tht ...
but do people move forard ?
he actually had a tire on the left hand ...
okay  well , i ca n't remember that
serously yo believe it ?
i have personal proof it 's true to me but as wth religion if it hangs on rivate feelings that ca n't be proved or disproved by science then in what way an it be valid or meaninful t the rest of us
next i want to find out what happens when hose who claim mysterios owers do allow themselvs to be tested
now , i think it 's fase so shall we see how well you have done ?
i want to show how scientific reason is always the best way to look at the world and explain the dangers of superstition
i 'm often ased how i know that there is n't a spirit orld or psychic clairvoyance
it seems iprobable but unlike the fixed world views of mstical faith science i always open to new possibilities
until quite recently scientists did n't know how bats fly around in ttal darkness
could hey have paranomal xtra-sensory percepton ?
but the more scientits tested the evidnce , the more robust the theory became
everything about it added up to a complete pictue of mutually supporting evidence that this really was a fact
he more we look at it , the weaker it becomes
the alleged detection of water through dowsing is not obviusly ridiculous it might work but does it ?
the only way to tell is rough a rigorous experiment
how does dowsing work ?
1 question and nobody can answer you
i think of the question and i expect god respnd in a way that i understand
i expect the right hand one point t the camera and the left hand one straight forward , i wan na ...
have you one the test yet in the tent ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 righ , 100 %
so what do you make that then ?
the psychologist chris french thinks there may be a simpler explanation
he has devoted his career to investigating claims of the paranormal
but there 're aways the possible explanations there , what we 're trying t do it a set of conditions which rule out any of those explanatons then we get down to the very fundamental baic issue ca n't the dowsers actually do what they think they can do .
i think it 's false
so shall we see how ar you done ?
this is sand .
in that case i ca n' do this
this is the water in no .
3
well , you got one rigt and , that was 6 which is what we expect by chance
three .
hat 's intresting is it does n't actually tend to dent their confidence at al
i think they are completely incere and they are ypicaly very , very surprised when we run them through seres of trils and actually say at the end of the day where your performance is n beter than what we would expet just on the bases f a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has happened but i dd say from the outset could n't we just sort out some grey block an some scaffold boards , so then i can work about it which is what i would routinely do and i 've done for 40 years
who knows where or what bottles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole point
this state of denia s extraordinary .
even wen confronted with hard fact these dowsers prefer not to face up to truth but retain their delusion
irratioal belief from dowsing to psychic clairvoyance has roots in earl mankind 's habit of attributing spirit and intention to natural phenomena uch as water , the sun , a rock or te sea
in 480 bc , king xerxes of he persian built a pontoon bridge across the hellespont and te rough sea came and wrcked it
i wonder whether thre 's something of king xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't want to believe that things just happen we want to believe that there 're some kind of eliberate intention behind eveything even when inanimate objects are concerned
and perhaps that is the ey to humanity s beief in the supernatural
even in the 21st century , despite all that science has revealed aout th indifferent vastness of the universe the human mind remans a wanton storyteller creating intention in te randomness of reality
the delivery of rewards by a ne-armed bandit is determind at random but many gamblers want to think that what they do can increase their chances of winning the jackpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
tere 're two kinds of mstakes they can make they an either fail to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detect pattern when ere is n't any and that 's superstition
60 years ago , the american psychologist b.f. skinner investigated the bhavior of pigeons ewarding them with food when they learned to peck a ke in the eeding apparatus
but then skinner set the apparatus to reward the birds at random now the pigeons just have t sit back and wait , but that is n't what they did
when an individual pigeon , for example , happened to lok over its left shoulder and the reward mechanism just happened to click in at tht point
by seer luck s t happened the reward mechanism dlivered food at the same time again and so the pigeon was reinforcd in its idea that looking over the left shoulder was what got it the reward
and it went on and on and turned into a maniac for looking over the left shoulder
humans can be no better than pigeons
spiritual self help guides do a roaring trade in the material world utnumbering science books by 3-1
but what does spirituality actually mean ?
so pleas take your sea and lease come slowly and gently and so that we ca start the proceeeding withou losing time
so could you please ...
and he counts amonst his many fans price charles and dalai lama
i as present in the beginning , in te first big bang and i 'll be here for billions f years to come
but is n't satish 's spiritualty just about impsing yet anoher superstitious force posiive ?
world is made of two elements .
there the spirit is very big , and very holitic , and very inclusive world
it is not defined in a one particular way so whe you go in a room you can say the tree has a spirt
nature without spirit an not eist like tree can not exist without the sun .
light , it can ot exist witout rain , .. can not exist without soil also it can not exist without a teeness .
the treeness is the spiritual quality
or the rockness
when you talk about the rocknes or the quality of a rock
it all souds very poetic , but it 's not reality like priests , mullas , and rabbis , new-age mystics ceaselessly attempt to fl gaps in human understadin with aricated meaning
science and rationality are often accused to having a cod bleak outlok but why is it bleak to face up to the eidec of wat we know
the word mundane has come to mean boring and dull , it really should n't , t should mean the opposite because it coes from the latin mundus , meaning the wrld , and the world is anything but dull
thre 's eal poetry in the real world .
science is the poetry of reality
next i want to look at the dangers tha poses
why do i have to trus , you know , the gp , why do i have to trust the royal society
i think you 're so close to being righ , but yet you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 years , science has put a man on the moon , cloned a sheep , decoded the human genme
and yet , sadly , te white eat of the 1970s seems to be treated as whte elephant today
anything yellow close is okay..
the fudamental problem i think lies with he fashion throughout our educational system to teac students to value private feeling more highly than evidence based reasn
for relativists , scientific truth is just a patriarchal western orthodoxy tha like the old roman catholic church stands in the way of other qually valid outlooks on the world
with things like paranormal , the drive for alternative medicine , all these kinds of movements away from the orthodox in science
in terms of different kinds of treatments and hings like that and in a way , not trusting the experts any me
i think you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wron , you 're asolutely wrong
we want to question authorit .
we do n't want to say because this prson is the president of royal society herefoe what he says is right
we 've got to o back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but the imprsonal algorithms of internet search engines do not weed ou robust evidence from unsourced , uncorroborated assertion
paranoia conspiracy theoies circulate unchallenged
sometmes they 're relatively harmless like the rumor tat nasa faked the moon landings which is  bit o a joke because the evidence for going to the moon is so stong
but how about the malicious and utterl unfounded rumor tht 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agents not to go to work in the world trade center on 9/11
as evidence is devalued even medical progress has become a target .. through vomiting .
hundreds of families blame m .
an innuendo circulated that the establishment was conspirng to risk our children 's health
it led to hundreds of thusands of parents failing to protect their ffspring from the threat of measles a serious disease that in afghanistan kills 35,000 people  year
reason has built the modern world , it is a precious but also a fragile thing which can be corroded by apparently harmless irrationality
next week , i look at ho health has become one of he fiercest battlegrounds betwen reason and superstition

well , i have to take i in 2 or 3 times a week .
hich is somewhat inconvenient , but the car is well worth it .
how ofen do you drive it ?
2 or 3 times a week .
i have to take it in evey ime i drive it .
yes .
my own mechanic has not been very helpful .
ever .
and thre 's a lot of carbon on the vlves .
yes , there lways is .
usually needs  tune-up every few weeks .
your attorney , m beckett , as been rying to reach you .
he 's been calling the superintendent 's office all week .
i do n't care to discuss it .
... an he told me there was carbon on the valves ... wich was no news to me 'case there 's always carbon on te valves .
ha ha , i told you a ferrar was ueless in the city .
what a day .
that 's a perfectly isane ...
wha is it ?
a mr beckett on the phone !
beckett ?
has an urgent messae .
half the time is spent taking off and the other half is spent on landing .
very time i bring her out she has t have repairs .
my mecani says it 's carbon on th valves 
this is long island tower .
roger .
i 'll just get out here , thank yu .
oh , jerry !
mr von rensaeller ?
he 's in the lounge ith mr beaumont 
bt i sprayed and the crown gall is gone .
really ?
ah , those idiot .
i was prevailed upon as honorry secretary to bring it to your atention ... so you cn stir it up at the bank .
nw , listen to me very carefully , please .
you see , when you have cpital ... you are able to derive ...
i will attend to the check in a moment , mr graham .
i understand about the check .
i 'm trying to explain something to you ... that is terribly iportant .
when we spend more , per month or per year .. than we have in income , you mut then dip into the capital ... eventually ehausting the capital and o course , therefore , the income .
do you see what i mean ?
mr beckett .
i 'm trying to explai to you that it is imposibe to pay the check ... bcause your expenses have exceeded your income ... to such a point that you have exhausted your capital .
do n't treat me as though i were a child , mr beckett .
now , what about this check ?
in other words , you do 't have $ 60 .
come to te point , beckett .
te point , mr graham , is that you d n't have any mney .
what could i ... ?
how could i put it ?
that money ...
you have no mney .
there 's no other way to put it .
you have no mony .
and what of my stocks , my att , my general motos ?
y-yes , i know ...
my emeralda peat ?
yes , yes , i know about emeralda peat .
let me show you something .
i did not !
tat is beside the point .
do you realize that this check has bouned , mr beckett ?
i mean , bounced !
it is not the first check that you 've had bounced , mr graham .
i 'd like to show you this chec of $ 550 .
you mean to say that i 'm now in th position of owing you $ 550 ?
no , no , n , do n't , do n't , please , do n't think of it as a loan , mr graham .
disliking you as intensely as i do , i wanted to be absolutely certain .. that when i looked back upon your financial downfall ...
i could absolve myself completely of any responsibility for it .
i do n't think he 'll give you a nickel , mr graham .
and considering your gift fr close personal relationship ..
than you very much , mr becket .
this will cover the overdraft of $ 550 that i owe you .
smoke them in good health .
goodbye .
goodbye .
goodbye .
nice to see you .
thank you .
i was looking ... fr omeone .
good afternoon , mr graham .

good afternoon , mr graham .
were you expecting some mail ?
cetanly , sir .
i knew i could count on a straight nswer from you .
thank you , sir .
it 's the best suit you can find in ready-to-wear .
the racket club does not keep those members on a trust tat worry missing their ues .
oh , no !
i was just about to ring for it .
arold , i have something o tell you .
is it about yur money , sir ?
in any case , it 's gone .
yes , it was my first thought .
my attorney advised me against it on the grounds that it would be useless .
see , the thing of it is , harol ... that i have no hoe of eer repaying him , or anyone .
all i am , or was , is rich .
i was so happy .
what will i do ?
what any gentleman of similar breeding ... and temperament would d in your position , sir .
no , sir .
i was n't going to suggest suicide .
you mean to a woman ?
that is what i had in mind .
it 's the only way to acquire property withut labor .
i could n't ...
i mean , she 'd be there ... asking me where i 've been ... talkin to me ... talking .
well , it was only a suggestion , sr .
bt the alternatives ... are very limited and unseakably depressing , sir .
if you do not commit suicide , sir , you will be poor .
poor ?
hardly any , sir .
you 've already receivd your third notice ... fro both con edison and the bell telephone company , sir .
thank you .
do it , get married , sir .
borrow enouh money from your uncle to keep u appearances .
you have managed in your own lifetime , mr graham ... to keep alive traditions that were dea befo you ere born .
yes .
thank you  sir .
no , no 
that 's a goo idea .
i 'm going to do it , harold .

i 'd love to read it somime .
i do n't know wht my dream is .
ell , i any way , that is my work and y hope , except for my dreams which i 'm not certain of .
oh , like parkinson 's disease being named after jes parkinson 
tat 's right .
or the bouainvillea being named after louis de bougainville .
brussels sprouts .
ys , i guess it is .
this sems rather presumptuous , does n't it , to ope for mmortality ?
not to me .
if you ca n't be immortal , why bother ?
self-assured .
yo 're so positive .
it almost gives me cofidene just to be with you .

i intend to be with you a great dea of he time .
oh , yes .
oh , heavens !
yes .

collective appraisl has never appealed to me .
ooh !
is there any cold water ?
no , no , never mind .
enrietta , please .
nonsense .
i 've ruined another carpet .
top that 
can you possibly believe , for one moment ... that what happens to this foolish , hairy foor covering matters to me ... when i have you sitting beside m ?
looking at me with your beautifully soft ... yet highly intelligent , well-informd eyes ?
you must think me ver superficial .
would you care for some more wine ?
oh yes ,  would love some .
it 's ... erm ... it ' , oh , it 's 10 o'clock and then we have to leave pretty soon ... 'cause i have to get up tomorrow very early for a class .
we are both of the same division :
vertebrata ... the same clas : mammalia ... the same order : primate ... the same family : hominide the same genus : homo ... the same species : sapiens ... and the same variety f a clas .
i do n't thin there 's a class of variety ...
keep quiet , henr- !
i 'm very sorry .
in fact the only fference beween us is that i am a man and you are a woman .
y-yes .
oh , henrietta , if you care for me at all .
learn to car for me at al ... in a reasonable amount of time , please say yes .
there is often a tidy profit in pecuation .
henrieta .

ueemly ?
did i say she was priitive ?
i retract that .
she 's fral .
i am nauseated .
i limp .
and i can feel my teeth rotting away rom an excess of sugar ... that n amount of toothpaste can dislodg .
tat woman is a menace not only o health ... but to western civilization as we know it .
she does n't deserve to live .
forget i said that .
oh , get off my lap , you little ingrae !
get off !
he did it .
he really , really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who henrietta lowell 's attorney is .
in fact , he has an office somewhere in this biding .
he does n't seem to have a very active practice .
well , what i mean is ... he ma not be exactly overjoyed ... at the idea of sharin her affections with henry .
no ...
andrew .
no , i wo n't accept it .
nonsense .
who is he ?
that little wino who went with you on one of your field trips to the canary islands ?
no , it is not .
well then , who is it ?
a forigner ?
some little wop with a fancy tte ?
really , andrew .
of course , henritta .
custom-made ... ha .
you will find ...
andrew , you will find some wonderful woman who deerves you .
what 's wrong ?
henrietta , darling ...
andrew , i 'm going now .
i m leaving , in order to met hery ... who , it just so happens , is an american citizen of english extraction ... with a vry large fortun of his own .
what 's henry 's last name ?
graham .
alright , alright .
you wo n't get away with it , henry graham .
let me see .
no , i have to do something .
very well , put him on .
mr graham .
one day efore the ceremony that will uite you as man and wife .
let me explain .
as enretta 's friend and attorney , it behooves me to take on the ever unpleaant role of the devil 's advocate .
and despite her assurances that you are a man of means ...
excuse me , ir .
tea will e delayed by 7 mintes .
andrew  you had no right to do that .
i have nothing to hide .
the grhams have be with the same bank or six generations .. as mr mcperson has undobtely discovered 
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you can substantiate his hearsay , beause i intend to sue you for slander .
i would n't be here if i could n't .
henrietta , here 's a photstt of the original note .
now take a good loo at it .
you 're still on na sue me for slander , mr graham ?
yes , mr mcpherson .
i am still gong to sue you for slander 
alright .
now , let 's put in this way , graha .
agreed .
let 's hear the reason .
i was going o use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affairs ... ad then immediately afterwards ... kill myself .
yes , henrietta .
my life was over .
heny , why did n't yu tell me ?
i would ave married you the very first day .
you do n't believe that garbage , do you ?
any sex-starved half-wit would know that 's just a line .
what 's the mater with yu ?
you have been unbelievably cruel .
thank you for keeping me alive , henrietta .
you 're welcome , henry .
i ca n't believe thi !
get off .
i beg of you , henrietta ...
i beg of you , henrietta .
do n't get carried away .
if he 's ot really interested in your money , make him prove it !
i would do anything in the world to prove to you , henrietta ... that i have n't the slightest interest at all in your money ... but there is absolutey no way i can o it .
thre is no way .
i have a way .
but there is no way .
do 't listen to him , henrietta .
that way , people wo n't get the wrong impression from hs uncle the way i did .
you would like ... you would ...
are you crazy ?
have you goe totally out of your mind ?
my idea was for him to disclaim all your money , no to share  .
it 's very naive of you .
and then people really wuld think ... that he was marrying me for my money .
this way he 'll already have all my money .
you nincompoop !
how dare you call my fiancee  nincompoop ?
harold !
i thought you were going to play the bach .
this is what he told me to pla .
that litle woman .
oh no .
she 's ...
harold , se 's unscrewing y montrosini .
i 'll screw it back when she leaves .
she 's destroying my livig room .
why did i get into this ?
well , it 's not !
oh , sir , get a hold of yourself .
no , sir .
you will share things .
mcphersn sent you in here to find out what was going on ?
is he the groo ?
i 'll ask the questions from here on in .
henrietta , if i could just talk to ou ...
who are you really ?
and i want real names or else you 'll regret it .
i 'm dodi heinrich .
sir , you are hysterical .
you ar due at the altar now .
i wo n't move until she leves .
get her out .
miss heinrich , i will ecort you to the bathroom .
and she will not touch my things .
it 's time .
what are you doing up there ?
frank , i think one o my egs is shorter than the other .
it 'll get ... longer again after the ceremony .
henrietta , it ' ot too late .
o , henrietta , i just talked to his uncle ...
i 'll kil myself , henrietta ...
dearly beloved .
i 'll be leaving now .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay .
thak you .
erm , henrietta , i will use this chest and you can use that one .
and i will unpack my wn things .
yes , henry .
then hal we unpack ?
it 's probably been classified for years .. but i might as well just try it nyway .
why not ?
this is really incredible .
commonly foud in gardening sheds .
spreading and emulsifying agents .
soap , saponins , glatin ...
get poison rom gardening shed .
toxides  arsenic acid , soium arsenite , boron compounds , cyanides ... cyo-cyenates and related compounds ...
this one or that one ?
either one is fine for me .
and when we oth use the same bed , we 'll use this one .
champagne ?
henrietta , where is your other arm ?
it fits over one shoulder and the other one goes inside .
it 's very uncomfortable .
ine ...

i think ...
n , not that one .

so we stayed in the house , in the air conitioning .
we just hung around , my sister and me and wathed countless hurs of daytime tv .
too hot to g out .
we 'd melt in th sun .
that kaboom shook the room .
we turned , and into our house something slid .
the first slly thing we can do ...
we 'll make a big mess .
but our parents were out .
they were gone for a week .
as for playing with glue , my sis said :
kids need to have fun .
he does n't seem well .
hey , woodchuck , calm down .
jus relax .
it 's you who smells bad .
said the kid in the lid .
as the water got deeper , the woodchuck went :
blub !
it 's okay .
said the kid .
i 'll pull on this chain so the water goes down .
it filled up the kitchen and bedrooms , and then ... it splashed out the door and into the sreet , where it provided relief from the afternoon heat .
kids ame from al over o splash in the lake , not knowing the ource was ou potty break .
they 're swimming in water straight out of our toilet .
think we should tell 'em ?
you 're rude , and you 're naughty .
to make matters wors , i 'm stuck in this potty .
perhaps you should ap .
said the kid .
i 've returned .
it would 've bee sooner , ut i neede a shower .
he pene the top and shouted :

then out sprang two kids , who responded :
they gae us a kiss ...
mwah .

hi .

kid 2 looked at mary , then whispered :
then they ran all around , doing impossible fats , acting like ids who 've had to many sweets .
i 'm hungry .
he shot out he room and ran nto the kitchen .
the san francisco treat .
hey , that was delicious .
i 'm hypoglycemic .
oh , no , you must stop this .
said sis to kid 2 .
then the walls tarted cracking .
both :
we said it again .
they stod thee , dumbfounded .
as they looked at the damage , we knew we 'd be groundd .
give us a call , and we 'll come back to play .
we 'll rebuild your hous and then paint it with glidden .
and that 's what they did , and in less thn a jiffy , the house was rebuilt , and it looked really spiffy .

the landlord 's tale .
of the midnigh ride of paul revere
n the 18th of ail in '75
if the british mrch
ready to rde ad spread the alarm
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swinging wide at her moorings lay
the somerset , british man-of-war
a phantom ship with each mast and spar
wanders and waches with eager ears
on the sober rafters that round him made
a moment on the roofs of the town
beneath , in the churchyard lay the dead
in their night encampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear like a sentinl 's tread
a moment only he feels te spell
of th onely belfry and the dead
were the rive widens to meet the bay .
a line of lack that bends and floats
oh , my gosh !
on he opposite shore walked paul revere .
then impetuous stamped the arth
the belfry tower of the old north church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the addle the bridle he turns
one if  land r two if by sea .
and beneath , from the pebble in passig , a spark
struck out by a steed flyng fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he has left the village and mounted the steep
d beneath him tranquil and broad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its edge
now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge
and the barking of the farmer 's dog
that rises after the sun goes down .
te british are coming !
he saw the gilded weathercock
gaze at him with a spectral glare
at th boody work they would look upon .
the british are coming !
the british are coming 
the british are coming 
the british are coing !
the british are coming !
in the books you have read
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the redcoat down the ane
the britih are cmig 
the british are coming !
and the midnight message of paul revere .
we 're finished .
te landlord 's tal just does n't cut it 
pal revere 's ride .
perfect !

i guess it was the kind of age when you do n't want to do things with your parents .
i also remember my father dragging me out by my ears , saying that i spent too much money .
a cowd hung around the machine and you had to wait to play .
i started playing at the local café .
took my boos to study there .
sometimes it replaced studying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highest amount it could win , which was about 15 games .
sell the 12 ames .
if you say inball , peole are like , what ?
there are many kids today that do n't know what a pinball machine is .
and they come in here and thy see something that they have n't seen in 25 years .
something that was a major part of their yout .
kids today do n't realy understand pinball .
the kids today , between the computer games and the hoe gmes , and the nintendos and the sega systems and gameboys , they jut wo n't play pinball .
 can remember when i was growing up we used to eat all our meal at home .
and we sed to go out for entertainment .
and now everybody eats out .
everybody always goes to restaurants .
they do n't cook at home much .
public places of amusemet have been falling by the ayside in america like crazy .
you ca n't find a pinball mchine .
there 's n more arcades in malls .
the bars today have a megatouch , a jukebox and a pool tale .
pinball is finished in frace .
i englnd it 's finished long time ago .
in italy you ca n't find one pinball .
in germany no one pinball .
even in belium , it was a pinball paradise .
it 's finih .
they said pinball was dead .
it tarts with one .
then anothe one .
i was outrowing the family room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 games .
it was a very rapid decline into obsession , i think .
once you get he lure of the silver ball in you it 's like an addiction and you ca n't stop and i just kep , you kow .
you remember buying every one , where you got it from .
and just as i 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon na do this ,
pinball wizar comes on the radio and i think , no  i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm finally home  exhausted .
they really do n't seem to be machines .
and the way they talk to you , you find yourself talking to it .
extra ball !
you just come in and admire them .
shine a light
all my lif it as pinball .
it 's my life .
like soe people .
 like pinball .
pinball and girls .
but girls is inished .
e , look at these guys !
they 'll all come over and have a big party every week .
steve 's still kind of te centre .
1972 , my dad bought one for my room .
from there n , it just got pretty wicked .
i 've got them in every room in my huse .
the pinball dungeon .
the things i lke i 'm very obsessive .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect something , wether it be pinball machines , jaws memorabilia  i got ta have it all .
like it says , i wan na rock and roll all night and party every day .
it was during the depths o the depressin , the late 20 , arly 30s , where the coin-operated amusement game idusty kind of got birth .
it literally was a name because there were various pins that were hammered into a wood surface .
the games were evolving in the 1930s .
we have to outaw it .
w ca n't control it .
but th ajority of product that was out there was for amusement only .
in the case of new york city , chicago and los angels , being three maor metropolitan areas , as well as other area around the unted states , pinball was banned .
it was this one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i got ta do something like that .
before that it was nothing but chance .
gottlieb ruled in the '50s and '60s .
before the city council in april of 1976
as well as a demonstration of pinball being a game of skill  as opposed to a game of chance .
business was booming .
profit margins were huge 
when we started solid state electronics o pinball machines w were on the lading edge of technology .
managers from the diffrent resaurants and the broadway crowd .
kids always want some pace to go , something to do 
i think hat 's what ave growth to the arcade business .
naughty or whatever .
you culd kind of o what you wanted .
it was more like hangng out with your friends .
wasting time .
proud to have in a french bstro n paris an american machine .
game over .
special target .
what s it that makes you stop and play one machine ?
it ' somethig that 's pitched towards young males .
there 's not really a lot of female-friendly iages on these .
any violent misogynist thing you want is there on pinball .
a lot of these machines have love scenes on them .
i 'm not in the supposing business .
what do you hink ?
you 'd have those centrefold imags of young , rther buxom ladies , usually blonde , staring out of the machine at you , to ispire you .
but you beieve it is ?
no question about it .
sexually frustrated people play pinball a lot .
guy has a hot al and it 's just flying .
you 're getting ready to become ruler of the universe .
says williams perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been in my blood sine i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
shoud have knwn i was going to be a collector nd i did n't start collecting until i bought this hose in 1976 .
and the firt game in my colection is my favourite game of all time .
i always copy down serial numbers and i have a binder that i 've hand-typed since i do n't do computers yet .
to me i think it would be interesting ,
i have 300 games , whee they were at one time .
were they in joe 's bar and grill or somewhere down the street or at a show ?
i have a column for the date .
note .
i worked in the bowling industry for a lot of years .
and the last owling alley i worked at closed down 12 years ago .
that 's hy i collect flyers .
that 's why i collect what they call press photos .
they 're chronolgical .
there 's a lot of games are missig sorecards .
how they get lost over the yers , it 's hard to beliee , but they do .
in the front closet , ther 's lots of binders in there also .
i was blessed wth an unbelievable memory .
jokes .
is nt that good ?
i do n't think about what it 's worth cos i do n't wat to sell it .
lot of work and when you 're done and you turn it o and it does n't low up , you feel real good .
i 'm a people person , i like peole .
i loked forward to seeing people on monday , tuesday , wednesday .
i never had any brothers or sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got maried and divorced twice .
and they say it 's kind of hereditary but my real dad smoked and drank and he was n alcoholic but i never did drink or smoke .
the rush of being able to play any game you have at any givn time by pushing the button , you ca n't xplain it t people .
i wake up and do it every single day .
like an extension of my hand or somethng , i guess .
they 'll be in a bar , wit their friend .
we just smile .
chicag is the pinball cpital of the world .
we live here .
we need to have that fast turnaround .
each peson does a little part of it and passes it along .
today , we 're the onl company making piball machines and we strve to have 10 % of what that mrket once was .
it 's a modern car that has some of he look and feel and coolness of it and it 's retro .
we 're the only pinball manufacturer .
gee , if i had just one more shot ,
i know i would have gotten it this tie .
i had two blls locked and i just got that last ball locked cos i did it last time .
we build working models of things and then we play with i .
but it tells us whether what we 're ding is going to work or not work or be fun or not fun .
this is what the final version of the game looks like when it 's finally producd .
it 's just you and the track now !
it 's what people said i was going to be .
and that 's what i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothng .
a nice sound .
being a programmer by tade
i mean , for me this is like a little mini world .
so when the ball s bouncing around inide , it 's having fun inside its own little world and you 're helping it along .
little fish in the tank havin fun .
from displas to alpha numerics .
pinball lost  market of players because of teir technologically enhanced games .
i love strategy .
it 's about achievement , it 's about goals .
and you go , oh , i see , if i o this and this , i get one of those .
piece of cake .
and then you play it ten times in a row and you do n't do it .
and you 're like , oh , i can do that .
for intance , in pirates a very obvious strategy is to get time lock lit .
the bll wil bounce around for three seconds while the post is up .
the post comes down and it still may bounce around .
and all the while yo complete thse lights .
so then i get the ship multiball , which is the ship .
so you shoot th ship , you shoot he ship .
i fin that very satisfing .
it just happens to come n a bx .
lie a slot machine .
an oprator comes alng and collects the money .
he can win a free game .
even with a little glory .
the knocker goes off in a crowded bar .
i did that , i made that go of , ok ?
hen you hear them cussin sometimes , or trying to kick the game to get some action , you know you 're getting th results that you want , you know .
and you see them putting more coins in and you say , i made it .
pt another quarter in the pinball
everyone jokes about there 's some sickness , there 's some insanity .
but it 's kind f like a geeky ting is probably the wa pinball 's perceived by the outsides .
how do yo perceive pinball ?
we are rom tokyo , japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and then now it seems almost like a definition of a nerd or a weird and marginal person to be caught playing pinball .
but maybe there 's something attractive about that .
i 'm the jim morrison of pinball .
i think it 's great for pinball .
i tink the pingeek is goo .
i have n't met anybdy like him before .
i wan na start with this one because it s ver hard to find .
i 've got it .
 love pinball .
i wan na show this one .
96 % of my ideas an out to money .
i 'm hre t save a hobby that saved my life .
i love music .
i was pretty much raised in arcades , because of divorce issues and jus a mes .
and say , hey , i 've arrive for the show .
and guess who my ride is ?
she drops me off .
elton john was th ultimate shoman in the '70s .
i want to be a shomn .
an maybe that 's not the coolest thing .
everybody tells me to take these drugs , i sould be in a institution .
i get so much crap advice that i 'd be dead and bankrupt if i listened o it .
talk to each other and there might not be all this fighting and shooting .
whatever happened to just going into a bar lik john wayne .
and then yu have a drink ovr it later .
i 'm definitely misunderstood , you know .
but  tended to back away and aid it 's not really ma against machine .
if i can sense the rhythm of that game , the tempo of that game , i wan na be working in tandem with it .
i 'm not figting it .
 'm workin with it .
i guarantee you it 's chemically similar to that of athletes .
when athletes get in the zone , they feel as though they 're watching temselves run the ball down the field .
inbll reminds me of like dreaming .
beause like when i m playing the game i 's like er ..
i 'm not really with like reality .
but yet you 'r watching what you 're doing and tryin to concntrate .
it really is a unique feeling to become one wh the machine .
it 's sort of a zen where you 'r sort of meditaing and that 's all you 're concentrated on s th pinall .
you forget everyting else .
you ca n't lose the ball out the middle .
and you stretch it out and you embellsh it and you let all the people watching know tha look at this prson , this person 's just done a very difficult thing .
when you get to put your initials n it 's lie , there i am .
i own this game .
i put a lot of play time in on this mahine .
i try to defed it .
that 's my home terrtory .
i was just simply ahead of the machine .
i ws accumulating so many free games .
and eventualy after about three or four hours i had to go 
so in a sense there is a possibility you have the illusion that yu 've won .
there is something inevitable about losing at pinbll .
because ther is a feeling often when you 're playing pinball that the machine decides when you need to go home 
the object of play in pinball is a high score .
when you see a truly skilled pinball player , yu realise it is a game of skill , not a game of chance .
it 's pure adrenaline .
now what you have are layers who control the temp of the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honety .
there are times when i stand back and mrvel at the fact that they have the ability hat they have .
i look at a game , i try to find a weakness and exploit that weaknss fo my own game .
this is a sport .
to stand and stay focused for that lng , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sor in my sholders .
i 've always wanted to be champion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnyvale , californa .
i started playing when i was ten yars old .
yeah , t 's the whoe thing .
pinbll 's gotten a lot more coplcated nowadays .
it 's becoming more and more unclear to me how people re getting big scores .
yeah , sometimes you see it all hen ou 'r playing really well .
i can see a ball ging towards the ut lane at 12 inchs away and know to do something right away .
i 'll nudge the machine and when the ball gets there it just does this thing off th post and rols in .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off with whatever 
h 's got this routine that ' only his 
i wan na do what he 's doing .
and i could be like on one hand and one heel .
you know , what i really wanted to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mom told me that i shoud get a career .
because i hae pinbal as my on world .
a diamon in the rough that i have personally shined .
pinball 's something that 's done smeting for me tha i hd to discover for myself .
ht was already there in a world tht gives us all kinds of input aout stuff that we do n't even want to hear other people 's input about .
and i knew that all that input was mistaken .
pinball is a world of special rules and unique opportunities .
i woud even go as far as say i am special because of pinball .
i 've always playe pinball .
you 'd choke , you would n't do well , an you 'd have to wait a year to try again 
but pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mental component o remain calm and in contrl .
the best players never do somethig that affects the ball unles they do it for a purpose .
and ball control does n't man always caching the ball , it means putting the ball here you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , not just where it is right now .
my mother lives with me in new jersey .
when i tell hr i 'm going , she said , go ahead and enjoy yourself .
you 've got ta ave some fun o go enjoy yourself .
six million !
basiclly i 'm a sntheic organic chems actually working on trying to find a treatment for alzheimer 's disease .
i really have n't mad it to final in a major tournament in a while .
i did it once in '99 , but i got elminated unfortunately .
surprising villages , flooding cities and towns ...
th storm is my nickname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so pinbal and  kin of grew up tgethe .
and i want to beat the best .
it makes it much easier to live thinking that i 'm the best and i just have n't had my momen .
what 's really important when you play pinball at the world championship level is to get your mentlity stright .
because everyone is so good that you need the menta edge .
and if you ca balnce those two things you 'll be unbatable .
and i feel like an outsider .
i fee kind of like ... someone that they all think they 're bettr than .
and i now for a fact that i can beat them .
one of the gentlemen here , neil shat , has been in the finals three or four times .
and it ' like if her is a pinball god maybe they 'e cursing him because he 's second or third place , and he 's so great he deserves to win finally and so if i were to pick someone to win ,
but sure , yeah , it s tough but i enjoy just the thrill of competition .
what can we expect this morning , guys ?
absolutely i think those guy are simply tter players .
lyman sheats .
lyman sheats .
best player in the world .
i programme pinball machins .
i work with designers and basically mae the game do all of what it does .
i as in college , it was around 1986 .
it was about five years after that that i starte competing .
the easiest thing is to hit the flippers individally .
i do n't know ...
you know , when they first play .
multiball here .
going to try and get one f te balls over the other flipper t make a shot .
score some pints .
and i watched this person mthodicall o a passing shot ove , make the sot , kick down , go up , passig shot , over .
so i bounce the all over to the other flipper  now it 's under control .
i never thought of playin pinball that way .
you say  pinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are .
world pinball championships .
and within one week there was a hurricane named ivan that came up the east coast and th little creek in front of her overflowed its banks .
and there wa nothing to be done .
everything we had just finished was washed away .
i was jut frustraed and wanted t get the plae lened up so i could decide if i wanted to try agin .
it id prove possible to clean up and rebuild .
you can have a reat game .
there are a couple of pople who re high-quality layers .
very focused when they play , tough to beat .
one slip and the ball goes .
and that 's it .
it certainly presented an entertainment ption that was awfully compelling .
n 1980 you could not possibly build enugh video gmes to saturate th market .
and all of a sudden our income doubld and tripled overnight .
it just blew me away .
and the the pinball sat there almost forlorn-lookig .
you ca n't se anything except th screen .
when you play pinball you 're playing a pice of equipment that you can move aroud and control .
pinball machines you ca n't do that .
it 's a pinball machine .
there 's a beinning ut it 's endlss .
i finished it .
the real backbreaker came when home video finally hit the marketplace .
of either myself playing at home o me and my buddy playing at home 
but it really spelled the end of certainly the pinball era .
it was widly believed at the time that vdeo games had uurped pinball and there was no longer a need for pinball whatsoever .
pinbll was back on the map again .
aftr a dcade of decline , flippers are flapping .
bumpers are thumping .
pinball is bouncing back .
i had a lot of life tied up in it .
it was really a presence and just the daily interaction of the world that i had at my doorstop that i new i was neve gon na have agin 
it was a life-defining moment tat saddens me and still sadden me actually .
i go out now and i see some of my old friends and i play pinball and that 's nce .
that 's just never gon na happen for me again .
so if ou look at the downside of it all , pinball deserve a better fate than what it currently has .
in truth it is n't a big part of our culture any more .
but i 'm nt sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball not to survive , the world wuld continue but a little bit of the fabric of life would be gone .
i hink that there is a fleeting sense of one 's naiveté and innocence that game bring out .
and as we get older , for many of us , w step away from doing those things that gave us joy when we were younger .
and i think that that loss of innocence is tough .
and everybody should try it at some point i time .
you have a universe in a box .
under glass .
it 's very strange , very strange .

let me think ...
but you ca n't explode in the bomb bay couse it 's foolish
you 'll kill us all there 's no reason for it
i am programmed to detonate in 9 minutes
would you consider another course of action
bomb !
oh , yes
talk o the bomb
bu i have been talking to it , sir and pinback is talking to it right now .
doolittle 
ix miutes to detonation !
doolittle , what the hell are you doing ?
are you with me ?
how do you know you exit ?
what the hell is he doin ' ?
it is intuitively obvious
intution is no roof
this is fun .
now listen , here is the bi question
ow d you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct ?
the gun !
gun !
gun !
no , boiler , you out of your mind
you 'll hit the bomb doolittle is talking to the bomb
you are bad shot , he 'll save us you can shoot at
what i 'm getting at i this
and this sensory data is merely a stream of eletical impulses
in other word , all that i really know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
no , now give me the gun
to elode , of course .
tha is correct .
of coure not .
well then
so if you detonate in ...
nine seconds ...
you could be doing so on the basis of false data .
you have o proof that it was correct data .
attention , attention he bomb has returned to the bomb bay
the destrucion sequence is aborted
pinback ?
hell ?
hello , anybody !
i 'm coming in now i 'm don by te emergency air lock
you ae now leaving the emergency air lock
hak you for observing all safety precautions
hello , pinback ?
what 's up doolittle ?
tur on his helmet radio so i can contact him
what 's wrong , i did n' hear ...
talby , can you read me ?
help , doolittle , help me !
alright , bomb
therefore , i shall ignore you .
false data can act only as a distraction
therefore i shall refuse to perceive you .
hey , bomb
doolittle !
calm down , i 'm coming .
and in addition to the darkness there was also me
an i saw that i was alone .
ey , bomb ?
doolittle , whee are you ?
here i am
i 'm spinnng
e re falling i opposite directions away from each oter
what happened , doolittle ?
the ship blew up ?
what ?
funny , i thought i have the damn thing convinced
oiler ?
maybe not maybe there is a way
it looks like the skipper he made it .
talby , looks like i 'm heded for the planet going right toward it .
what a beautiful wy to die ...
guess you 're right .
doolittle , i 'm heding right toward something it 's behind me , in th distane
something that glows .
i 'm going into them i 'm going to hit them
doolittle
yeah ?
you were my favorite
to circle the universe..
foever
i 'm with them now ...
be bck thi way again some day
i think i 've figured out a way !
so , what 's the story 
the story is abou ... a girl of about 14 or 15 ,
who 's out riding her bike .
and i 'm in a rolls ...
i 'm not prince charming , that would be pushing it ...
i take her to a rather unusl hotel .
then she wants to see ngland again , she 's englih , and the plane crashes .
you 'll hve to explain that a bit .
in new guinea , there 's an indenous people , th papuans , who practice this airplane worship  the cargo cult .
the see these things flying ver their heads without ever seeing them land , and they want to benefit from them .
so they ant the planes to crash to get ther hands on the freight .
i draw a parallel with melody 's death , who was killed in a plane crash .
and i hope that one of these cargo planes will fall wit melody in it .
bring her back .
the trnsposition of eternl love .
i 'm not a cynic , as others maitain .
and my candour .
they confused candor with cyncism .
in fact , what you call ... ugliness is something you made into a stye through your desire for perpetual candour .
i wrote somewhere that when i ' caled ugly , i augh quietly so you do n't awake 
i 've had retty women , i have the most beautiful now , so my ugliness ... those who are bothered by it ...
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah !
hey thee , baby .
eah , whatever .
not now , kid .
i hope you do n't take this the wrong way or nything , but there 's just too big of a generation gap between the two of us .
but all i want to kow s hat time it is .
how about a kiss there , missy ?
ooh !
oh !
baby !
uhh !

stephen house of the london exchange telegraph 
narrator :
long before orders were drawn before te reign of gnghis khan nomadic tribes have roamed the remote altai mountains of asia .
and for countless generations , this precious skill has typically been hnded down from father to so .
but this reltonship between man and bird is finite 
custom dictates that after even years of loyal service an eagle must be returned to the wild to continue the ircle of life .
my dear eagle .
we have been together for a ong time .
and you have only brougt good things to me .
aisholpan :
my name is aisholpan .
i was born in the altai mountains .
there it is .
nrgaiv :
there it is .
i love my dad .
y dad and my randpa are eagle hunters .
nurgaiv :
it is not a choice .
it 's a calling that has to be in your blood .
the hrses the lothing , the equipment .
aisholpan :
lease hold it gently .
but i do n't rsent that .
great .
nurgaiv :
she holds the eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her lod as well .
aisholpan :
because all the me in my family have been agle hunters my drem is to become th irst eagle huntress in mongolia .
narrator :
irls do not eale-hunt .
they get cold .
but i think girls and boys are equal .
girls can o anything boys can if they try .
my father taugt me ..
... and i do n't wat to let her down .
nurgaiv :
yeah .
nurgaiv :
raise your arm 
that 's good !
launch it this way .
pay attenion .
are you tired ?
e go to school by he syr river because there is no school in our area .
let s play again !
i 'e been living here since the 2nd grade .
aisholpan :
we are at school for only 5 days .
i take care of them .
all :
i feel good .
aisholpan :
but right now , all i can think about is becoming an eagle huntress .
is dinner ready ?
place the spoons .
ma god bless you .
nurgaiv :
quik , fed this tough child .
until now aiholpan has been using he father 's ird to learn the basics .
since she is seious i figure , let her bring up her own eagle and train it .
toay , there 's the rare opportunity to seize a 3-month-old eaglet from a nearby mountain .
may we be so lucky !
do you see , my child ?
we 're going to have to climb up hat side and then descend from the top .
do not be afraid , okay ?
it 's a strong knot !
hold on tihtly .
i the name of god 
give me soe more rope , dad .
back , back .
do n't be scared .
aisholpan :
hold tight i sai .
aisholpan :
yeah , yeah .
go slowly .
no more slip-ups !
yes .
look !
ther are two egles nesting side by side .
nurgaiv :
yep !
you got it ?
bring it over this way .
this way .
let it go a little bit more .
that 's it .
pull t .
aisholpan :
here you go .
nurgaiv :
hurry !
do nt pull .
give me some slack on this other rope .
let it out more !
aisholpan :
should i eel it in now ?
e did it !
nurgaiv :
this eaglet is a sign of good luck 
i 'm exhausted !
nurgaiv :
you proved yourself today .
thanks .
woman :
wind speed will be from 3 to 8 meters per second .
ai temperature will be 8 to 13 degrees celsius .
let me compete in the festival his year !
nurgai :
aisholpan :
please ?
do n't worry !
we would freak out like crazy !
asholpan :
yes .
aisholpan :
yes .
do you call , hey , eagle , cme bak here , please ?
huukaa !
huukaa !
is it afraid of other people ?
of course !
ow !
aiholpan is going to be an eagle hunter .
grandpa :
really ?
this is an important task .
both are young .
can yu give your blessing to aisholpan ?
aisholpan !
may god elp you pursue the hunter 's path .
may you grw old like me wih yellow teeth .
i entrust that eagle to you .
this will be a beast atching bird .
let it get old with you .
eagle hunters will train their daughters to ride horses then hold a bird .
it is a shame to do so for the bir .
they do nt know how to properly aproach the eagle .
th eagle is ver picky about people .
i demands respect and courage .
anyhow , she will have to get married at one point or another .
nurgaiv :
it 's ll we 've ever known .
woman :
good mornng , dear radio listeners .
nurgaiv :
narraor :
as their relationship deepens , the eagle learns to lsten for her call .
as they start to work as a team , the response times improve .
woman :
as the festival daws near , the excitement buid across the region .
let 's go .

ruth ?
ny , dear master , my mnd has long been gnawed by the cankeing tooth of mystery 
when frederic was a little lad
to take and bin the promising boy
a life not bad for a hardy lad
though surely not a high lot
i was a stupid nursery maid
a sa mistake it was to make
i bound him to a pirate , you
individually , i love you all with affection npeakable .
i look upon you with a disgust that amounts to absolute detestation .
oh , pity me , beloved friends .
no , no , no , no  frederic .
aye !

and knw what it is like !
and what s he consequence ?
everyone we capture says he 's an orphan !

oh , was ever a man placed in so delicate a situation .
frederic .
but i 've been constatly at ea since i as eight years old .
i think it is a sweet fac .
i just may be mistaken .
excuse me .
what a terrible thing it would be if i were to marry this innocent person , to find out that she is , on the whole plain .

here are the remains of a fine woman about ruth .
oh .
no !

well , it 's the top of the tide and we must be off ourselves .
hoist the mainsail .
hoist the jibsail .
frederic !
and wen your process of extermination begins , let our deaths e as swift and painless
as you can conveniently make them .
i do n't think much of our profession .
than play a sanctimonious part
with a pirate hea and a pirate heart
away to the cheatng world go you
and it is , it is a glorious thing t be a pirate king

cimbing over rocky mountan
passing where the willows quiver
by the ever rolling river
swollen with the summer rain , the summer rin
climb the hardy little lassies
let us gaily tread the measure
make the most of fleeting leiure
hail it as a true ally
as they fly
make the most of fleeing leisure
though it perish by-and-by
let us gaily tread the measure
except for the mermaids , it 's the very place for mermaids .
and who ca n't be said strictly to set foot anywhere .
i 'm going to take of my stocking .
stop , ladies , pra
a man !
but under these peculiar circumstances
i feel it is my bounden duty to inform you
a pirate !
horror !
oh , blushing buds o ever-blooming beauty
how pitiful his tale
how pitiful his tale
oh , is there not oe maiden breast
which does not feel the moral beauty
of making worldly interest
subordinate to sense of duty ?
all matrimoial ambtion
to rescue sch a one as

and father is a ajor-general
ye , ye , i am a major-general

hurrah for the major-gneral
to be a major-eneral
i m the very model of a modern majo-gneral
i 'm very wel acquated , too , with matters mathematical
i understand equations , oth the simple and quadratical
i 'm very good at integral and dfferentia calculus
in short , i matters vegetable , aimal , and mineal
in fact , when i know what is meant
b mamelon and ravein
when such affair as sorties and surprises i 'm more wary at
and whn i now prcisely what is meant by commissariat
when i have learnt what prgress has been made in moden gunnery
when i know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery
in short  when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy
strategy ?
oh , my word .
wait a minue .
cup of tea .
has only been brought down to the beginning of the century
but stll , in matters vegetable , animal , and mineral
enore !
can yu do it one more time ?
and can you do it really fast ?
in fact , when i know what is eant by mamelon and ravelin
when i have leant what progress has been made in modern gunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental trategy
oh , you must n't do that !
oo !
what are you ?
i gather hat .
anything else ?
no , nothing else .
we object to major-generals as fathes-in-law .
but we waive that point .

an orphan boy ?
these children whom you see
poor fellow
see , at ou feet thy kneel
our hearts we can not steel
orphan boy
indulged in an innocent fiction
which is not in he sam category as telling a regular terrile story
which will tend to diminish his glory
it is easy , in elegant iction
to call it an innocent fiction
but it comes in the same category
it 's easy , in elegant diction
although our dark career
we rather think that we 're
we 're always sorry to egin it
fo wha , we ask
is life
without a touch
hail , poetry
thou heaven-born maid
thou gildet even
all hail
mollient !
you may g  for you 're at liberty
and honorary membrs of our band

well , be comforted , sir .
i tell you , frederic , such is the anguish and remorse i feel at the abominable falsehood by which i escaped these easily delue pirates , that i would go to their siple-minded cief this very night and confess all .
but did i not feel that the consequencs would be oh , h , oh , no , oh , no , no , most disastrous , most disastrous to myself .
at 11:00 .

with her tears your grave shall water
hese attentions are well meant
taantara
calculated men to cheer
in a highly nervous state
and before all links , we sever
we will say farewell forever
all in vain their mercy crave
we observe too great a stress
on the risks tat on us press
to our chance of coming bak
still perhaps it would be wis
not to carp or criticize

hear us , ere you slaghter
yet , mrcy should aloy our stern resentment
we tried to raise ur spirits faint
bu all in vain the quips we heard
oh .
until to somebody occurred
a startling paradox
a most ingenious paradox
the paradox
to which , however , i ve no desire to be disloyal
who ?
i do n't know who
very ikely the astronomer royal
has decided that
if it wee oing to the agency of an il-naturd fairy
you 'll aily discover
that though you 've lived 21 years
yet , if we go by birthdays
you 're only five and a little bit over
let 's see !
five and a quarter , oh , that 's rich !
t common sense she gaily mocks
years 21 i 've been alive
yet , reckoning by my natal day
a paradox , a paradox
a curious paradox
a mos ngenious paraox !
most absurdly whimsical .
five-and-a-quarter , eh ?
you ould n't think it t look at me .
i 'm afraid you do n't appreciate the delicay of your position 
you were apprnticed to us .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no 
oh .
and going by birthdays , you are as yet only five-and-a-quarter .
and at any price
i will do my duty .
you 're one of us once more .
that 's the ship .
i will tel her i am bound by duty and m moral senses
so it really does n't matter , matter , matter , matter , mater !
i should show you in a moment how to grapple with the question
full of excllent suggestions when i feel a little bter
what we sing does n't matter what we sing does n't mater
no , it really does 't mtter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
if i had been so lucky as to have a stead mother
and i might hav lived and died a vry decet indiwiddle
if it is , t does n't matter if t is , it does n't matter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
oh , horror !
what 's the matter ?
oh , yes , he did .
it breaks my heart to beray the honore father of the girl i adore .
break it .
and yet , as your apprentice , i have no alternative .
... that gneral stanley ...
well , he is o ...
you mean , orphan , a erso that has lost his parents or often , frequently ?
a person that has lost his parents .
what ?
what ?
oh .
he neer was one !
am i to understand that in order to save
we will go and ollect our band and attack tremorden castle tis very night .
not a word !
i burn , this base deception to repay
ere i expire
it strikes me o the core !
and , in return , tonight the traior dies
yes , yes !
tonight e dies
yes , or early tomorrow
the will welter in srrow
to abuse it shall perish
away , away !
away !
tonigt the traitor dies !

no , i am brave
come one and all , undaunted men in blue
when the dager 's near
we manage to appear
a insensible to fear
young frederic as to have led you to death and glory
he will not so lead you
for he has alled himself once more
with his old associates
you spek falsely
he hs acted nobly
his heroic sacrifce to his sen of duty
he has one his dut , i wil do mine
we must do our est to captre thse pirates alone .
it is most distressing to us to be the agents
whereby our erring fellocreatures
are deprived of that liberty
when a felo 's not engaged in his employment
or maturing his felonious little plans
is just as reat as ay honst ma 's
when constabulry duty 's to be done
to be done
ah , take one consideratin with another
a policeman 's lot is no a hapy one
to be doe
a policeman 's lot is not a happy one
a rollicking and of pirates we
are trying their an at a burglary
with weapons grim and ory
with stealthy teps the pirtes are approaching
we are not coming for plate or gold
for general stanley 's story
they seek a penalty fifty-fold !
they seek a penalty fifty-fold
for general stanley 's story
silence !
go on .
upon our prey we steal
our cautious way we feel
we never speak a word
tarantara , tarantara
while all the ousehold soundly sleeps
come , friends , who pough the sea
let 's vry piracy
take another station
with a litle burgary
and your skeletonic keys

with catlike tread tarantara

good .
i have a hunch this gil 's gon na show up , and i ant you to identify her .
oh , it 'd be a pleasure .
research .
these ae very nteresting figure , tony .
we 'd like to talk to you ...
he was a more rearkable man than you think .
sam , you were the colonel ' oldest friend .
never .
the minue we paid her off .
it ought to 
tha yung oman has us over a barrel .
i can see the headlines :
founder offamily magazine dies in love nest with a nked nymph.
and a smile on his ace .
hat are we going to do ?
where ?
where 's a better place to show the world how much she 's gon na miss the colnel ?
so we wil know thursday .
the bank committee meets wednesday .
we 'll have the funeral uesday .
that'stomorrow .
what abut all he preparations ?
what made yo ask that ?
just my feminine sense of greed .
what 's that ?
i have n't met him yet .
guess who this is .
you ought to see a doctor .
but , honey , i am a doctor .
how was florida ?
oh , it was all right .
but i 'm glad i 'm back .
oh , yourfolks are in town ?
oh , well , that makes me feel better .
how about the four of us geting together , say , wednesday night ?
oh , that 's fne .
fine .
goodbye , dear .
bye .
 do nt know why you even wnt to florida .
deserve him .
you 're on the bargainig committee .
oh  no , harry .
union-wise , yu 're in the big time .
now , do n't be upset if i do some table-pounding .
but i am wrried .
he union committee is here .
joe kowalski .
absolutely ridiulous .
seems pretty reasonable .
it seems reasnable on the surface .
but can management live with it ?
that 's not an anser , it 's an ultimatum .
i said that .
what do you think , miss ?
research ?
where is it ?
i was jut saying the other day in health and welfare , we really shold ...
yes , two b 's .
miss robbins , w 've got a very important agenda here .
when it comesto fringe benefits , i ' say he unin 's getting all the benefits and management 's lft holding the frnge .
well put 
look , if you o n't wan na negotiate , we 're walking out .
oh , just a miute .
i have a better idea .
now , a subcommittee oftwo is an excellent suggestion , but any feeling-out process should logically take place between members oftis group who have n't displayed antagonism towards one another .
now , you do n't feel antagonistic towards me , do you , miss robbins ?
good .
nor i towards you .
so it seems logical that you and i should meet .
no use wastg valuble working hors .
meeting adjourned .
oh , i ...
do n't take them .
it must be that bathing suit i bought in palm beach .
they ere having a sale at this little place ...

ryder building , new york , new york.
i guss it is my coat , is n't it .
marge .
just give me the chance .
well , t 's too imortant a step to just rush into like that .
health and welfare found me a nice motel nearthe beach .
i was 7 dollars a day , including a continental breakfast .
but i was n't interested in tha kind oftraveler 's aid .
that eliminated just about everything that 's any fun .
there i was  trespassing in te garden of an exclusive hotel , pretending to be one ofthe elite .
with al the romance around me , there i was with my partner , a very romantic sort of fellow .
full of air .
help !
he seemed to be drowning .
and i as wearing my floweed chiffon that cost me two whole months without dessert .
elp !
i reaied at once that poor mr. hackett had been inking .
tat was his name , irby hackett , ofhackett industries .
so i decided to help him up to his room .
as long as he was sound asleep , i decided to ge dried off .
that was m third mistake .
mr. hackett had been laying possum .
please , i 'm not drssed 
mr. hackett !
 went through some curtains .
thee was a man in bed .
fank sinatra .
oh , marg .

yes .
oh , i ' perfectly willing to listen to the ther half .
mr. hackett !
bright and arly the next moring ,
i ot a phoe call .
it was mr. hakett .
because i do n't deserve it .
oh , marge .
i refuse to be obligated to a man who practically drowns himself just to get me up to his room .

plying golf , i guess .
i sarted just one step below .
i had the experience , but i ad to keep provin to the ryders .
if you 're a relative , you 're suppose to be an idiot .
seniority rights ...
excuse me .
seniority rights .
an old man is like an old car .
your spark plgs were stuck .
you do n't just throw an old man on the scrapheap forthat .
and then you give him another chance .
seniority ights , fringe benefits and pension plan .
what do you say we take the rest ofthe afternoon off .
hy id you pick on me to do the negoiaing ?
but you see , i m in research , mr. ryder , and i 've been doing quite a bit of research on ou .
and i 'm afraid i 'm not yourtype at all .
you 're a good researcher , bu do n't believ everythng you read .

okay .
jst what i had in mind .
why do n't yo use my car .
and i 'll drop off at te club , take a cold shower .

isthere something wrong with the coat 
o , no , not at al .
oh , yes .
oh , but there i a mitake .
i see .

i have n't done anything to earn it .

i do n't care ifhe went to devil 's island in a canoe .

the great man that we have gathered to hnortoday volunteere once more for military duty .
and in six months ofhad , grinding toil , he brought chaos ...
and that christmas ,  may now reveal  not a single dough boy in the ront lines not one had to do without a slice ofmom 's fruit cake .
once i even cried at an auto sow .

~subtit by joshua romel ladrera~
this is the story of the day my life nde .
i 'm kidding !
everyone dying to catch a glimse of me..
i mant us .
well ...
we ar gathered here today to celebrate the joining of rapunzel and eugene in marriage .
in everlasting peace .
may i have the rings ?
had their loops in the love and friendship .
frying pan .
releae the duck .
that 's the ducks , release the lanterns .
happy birthday !
so , who want a piece of cake ?
s tere a reason you 're caling first thing in the mornig ?
he 's dead .
who ?
cut the rap .
takayama ryuji , kill himself ?
or it might be something ese .
it looks like they 're gon na have o do a little mo investigating .
sdden dath ...
it 's takayama ryuji .
you plug the numbers into this chart and then use the resulting abbreviatin .
riper .
takayama ?
ripper ...
there 's arterial blockage .
diret cause of death is heart attack brought on by blockage of the left pulmonary artery .
andou !
there was something strange in his stomach .
he would ppear to have been something of a ...
trange man , would n't you agree ?
his ex-wife , asakawa reiko .
that boy in the picture is their son .
but after that she returned home and retrieved her sn .
and one of the ambulance crew saw her with a videotape taken from mr. tkayama 's aprtment .
but the first person to find his body was mr. takayama 's girlfriend .
she 's a glomy one , though .
our questioning is n't going anywhere ...
this is dr. andou , who was in charge of the autopsy .
to the doctor , this time .
where , i wonder ?
tell us what you can ecall .
i do n't know anything .
plase aswer the question .
i do n't know anytin .
i really do n't .
tell us what you know .
you knew that takayama ryuji was meeting with his ex-wife , did n't you ?
just a ...
before he died ...
dr takayama was investigating something with reiko .
nvestigating what ?
a videotape .
whoever watches it dies .
whoever watches it dies ?
yes .
that 's simply not possible .
mr. andou ?
yea .
it was amazing .
he knew , did 't he ?
that you and  would meet like thi .
why ?
this is stupid .
professor ?
profssor !
hey !
a tumor ?
but ... thi is n't malignant .
i could n't find anything like it .
here 's no way .
te smallpox virus was eraicated ages ago .
what about takayama 's girlfriend ?
se told me something a lot crazier than a virus .
you best tell e .
a videoape ?
eah .
it 's the police .
they were in an autombile accident .
luckily , the driver came away with only minr injuries .
we were just now able to remove the bodies .
though they 'd denied any knowledge of her whereabuts when we contacted them ...
but there 's something a little strange .
what are you doing !
sorry .
i was asakawa 's senior co-worker .
vcr ?
he went to seep already .
i 'm just gon na check on him 
i 'm sorry .
i woe you up .
what is it ?
the child died  too ?
yeah , but he did n't die because of the accident .
he was already dead .
their son saw the video too , did n't he ?
this has nothing to do with a vide 
we know hat exactly what caused his death .
what did he ay ?
leaving his dna in this world ?
mr. andou .
e ... saw something .
that mouse is glowing !
so it 's alreay progrssed this far ...
that 's amazing .
do you remember me ?
yes .
i 'm yoshino from nnb broadcasting .
is there something i can help you with ?
what 's tha ?
record ?
four people died of a hear attack at exactly the same time .
i now know that one week earlier , the four of them had watched a videotape at a lodge in izu .
she watched it , and was sure that she too would di one wek lter .
thus , aided by takaama ryuji , she began her investigations , trying o uncover everything she could about the videotape .
sadako 's mother , yamamura shizuko , was rportedly clairvoyant , which had the pres all up in arms .
sadko was killed  her father .
sadako had he power to lay a curse on someone , and to ill them with it .
let me tell you abo asakawa .
h killed himself .
he 'd written will .
it sad :
do n't worry .
this is yamamura sdako .
plase , eel free to watch it if you like .
do n't you think ?
present ...
sadako !
sadako !
forgive me sadako .
you were were never meant to be born into this world .
sadako !
you ca n't report this to the ublic at all .
that video ... it 's the embodiment of sadako ' htred .
do you realize what you 're saying ?
i gave it to you already .
video ...
now ait just a minute !
give me tha tape !
we are through talking .
will you please let go of me ?
lke you you 're about to die or something .
yeah ...
you want me to inject you with some of that protein from the glowing jellyfish ?
the dministative autopsy was arried out in yokohama .
what 's more , the cause of the attacks was a tumor in their bloodstream .
oh ...
but i do 't get it .
if it is a virus , why did n't asakawa reiko also die from a hart attack ?
ecause te cause of death is n't a virus .
a curse .
gim me a break .
to wipe that video ff the face of this world .
he though that he could use me to stp yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan .
he 's trying to get me destroy that vieo in exchange or granting my wish .
and what is your wish mr. andou ?
about what ?
tat 's not what dr. takayama wanted .
what else could it be ?
dr. andou .
you have a phone call , from a reportr named mr. yoshino .
the well that sdako fell into ... by chance , is there a chunk missing out of one side ?
you watched te video ?
to hell with this , ll of it .
i 'm giving yu the video .
i hae n' watched it .
yamamura sadako appears in my dreams .
i just want to hurry up and forget all about this .
mr yohino ?
mr. andou ?
do n't look .
let 's go .
it 's over nw .
i 've put a end to yaamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm this video 's last victim .
you 've thought about dying many times over .
nor is regretting tat you watchd the video .
that i let my son die ?
just a little .
he was the nly person tht i could be with .
so i guess i ca n't lie to you .
it 's just like you said .
i 'm scared of dying .
why did i watch that video ?
is n't it panful ?
knowing ow i feel ?
there were times when i hought it was just an excuse .
but he meant it .
nobody knows wht s going to happen to them .
not me .
nevr seen anything like it , have you ?
i think he 'll turn up symptoms f the virus as well .
his cause of death was different ...
well , it 's interesting !
the data is then restrucred inside the body , creating a virus .
that could be it !
think a moment .
she saw the video too , did n't she ?
you 're not making a whole lot of sense .
listen to me .
wen i watched the video , saako 's memories entered my body .
i saw a hospital in the woods .
now you talk a hospital in izu from around that timeframe , what does that make you think of ?
tuberculosis ?
mai !
where the hell did she go ?
tak a look .
it 's mutated .
what 
they 're saying that the family wants o talk to you about how to proceed with the dah certificate .
prbaby .
i 'll catch up with you later .
mr. maekawa !
i have never had a case like thi beore .
it ca n't be .
they appear to have found evidence ndicating that she gave birth .
yes .
the bulding 's air ent ... it looked just like a well .
yamaura sadako 's well ...
does it by chanc have a chunk missing out of one sde ?
but he still got infeced with the irus .
why do you think that is ?
it 's asakwa reiko 's notebook .
th color o th well , the way it looks .
it 's like i 'm actually thee .
but that does n't mean that everyone dies .
there 's a way to save yourself .
a wa to save yourself ?
just reading it is enough to infect th reader wih the virus .
she became yamamura sadako 's helper .
wha did you do ?
i ...
you 're the onl survivor .
liar !
give me back that notebook .
into mai 's womb .
why did you have to kill mai ?
mai is n't dea .
ll of mai 's memories are inside of me .
you are sadako .
ot mai .
i wanted to elp you .
what th hell do you know ?
you killed mai !
mai .
forgive me , mai .
i forge you mr. andou .
know what ?
stop it , please !
sadako !
meeting him was what allowed me to come back .
that 's why i was able to be reborn .
that 's impossible 
so this time , i want to help him .
we ca do it if i use my womb ...
no .
there 's no wy .
o this for m , and i can grant your wish too .
takayama !
then , return it to my womb .
the memories prior to death remain in the dna itself .
f you use one of my fertilized eggs , it should mature to the same age as when the person died within 2-3 weks if you use horones to quicken the rte of cellular division .
once thi is put bak into takano mai 's womb , we 're all finished .
you look terrible .
we traitors , are n't we ?
bu who have we betrayed ?
what 'd you think of my prese ?
he is my brother , after all .
and the peple who read it ...
the virus will develop inside their bodies .
what will the world become because of the virus ?
there will e more and more people like sadako .
this virus will cause a change in humanity itself .
and now it 's time for that evolution to proceed to the next level .
the world will change .
we have een dragged inside that vortex of change .
stay away from takaori .
jut keep away .
is n't that right ?
let go of me .
goodbye .
takayama , do n't want your own child back ?
i could n't do such a terrible thing .
i could n't bring a child back into this world .
anou ... it will be a long , log time before there is peace again in this world .

what kind of a bank is thi , anyway ?
have n't you bankers ever heard of gold ?
mrs. dooley , even if that were gold bouillon there 's nothing ..
that would n't do very much for your account now , would i ?
well , i should say not .
the onl possible place you could take that is to a refinery .
where 'd you get the hat ?
what hat ?
oh , now albert , it was on sale .
yo know , if you wroe a check for that ha , we 're overdrawn again .
no , we 're not .
from the refinery .
no , not those .
well , the bank told me o .
no , no , no .
hi , partners .
that 's all we can do because we do n't have a license to handle gold .
i 'd like a gold license for m little ducky who lays gold eggs .
he orks for the u.s. treasury .
why ?
you could get ten years in the jug for hoarding .
why ?
yes , but you 'e ...
wait a minute .
you did n't tell them where th gold came from , id you ?
what did he sy when you told him ?
she can tell them the truth and the 'll never believe i .
a new suit ?
keep moving around .
no , no , no .
this is exceptionally high grade ore .
all seem to be the identical size and shape .
what kind of duck was ta ?
thank you .
mrs. doley , listen , about these nuggets ...
bye-bye .
we do n' have your addess .
beauy .
you would nt happen to have a layaway plan , would you ?
no , i did n't think so .
well , i ca n't buy it now , but ...
i 'll be back .
gentlemen , they may have learned how to make gold .
i knw that .
the point i 'm trying to make is that they 've found a way to mke gold cheap enough to put on the market .
remember what happened to common , every day , ordinary bread mol ?
penicillin .
i hesitate to think what would happn if ths wre to get out of ths room .
take it on oe .
no , no  no .
nothing to it at all .

life .
since the beginning humans and pémon alie have searched or its meaning .
what m i ?
what am i ?
many strange and wondrous legends eolved from the pursuit of life 's myteries .
but none is stranger than this tale of the most powerul pokémon of all .
-let me see !
-let 's run another scan .
where i must be .
tell giovanni what 's happened !
let us hear its pschic powers .
that is mew , the rarest of all pokémon .
from ts dna we created you , mewtwo .
am i onl a copy ?
nothing but mew 's shadow ?
improved through the power o human ingenuity .
so i am smply the ed result of your experiment .
what becomes of me now ?
it s just beginning !
we 'll start testing .
behol my powers .
stronger even than mew .
those fools thought you were a science experiment but i see you as a valuable partner .
it will be the same with your powers unss you control them .
you say this amor protecs my body yet it suppresses my powers !
your powers are not being suppressed .
learn to use them to accomplish your purpose .
patience , my friend .
your purpose will become clear .
alakazam !
to sere your master .
humans may have created me but they will never enslave me .
so i tand alone .
and purge this planet of all who oppose me .
human and okémon alike .
today , ash , brock and misty re taking a break from their pokémon adventures .
and , a always , he 's ready to endure any hardship , bear any burden with strengh , stamina and a will of steel .
hungry .
need food .
i have n't eaten since breakfast .
it 's my lazy-by nochew stew .
you there !
-you know him ?
-yeah , he 's me .
unles you 're afraid to lose !
that 's progrss .
like no one ever was
to catch thm is my real test
to train them is my cause
teach pokémon to understand
the power that 's inside
ou 're my best friend
and the word we must defend
our hearts are true
you d it !
you cn challenge along the way
about the plce
there 's no better tam
arm in arm we 'll win the fight
i know it 's my desiny
you are my best riend
a heart so true
our courage will pull us through
got to catch them
shocking that ash moved so fast .
i know we must grab rare pkémon for the boss but it would n't be a bad idea if we grabbed a bite to eat .
we did n't come her to steal a mea !
i 'm staving .
the last time you cooked , you wiped out eight of my nine lives .
master , shall i extend an invitation to these trainers s well ?
watch where you 're flying .
something for me ?
greetings , pokémon trainers .
a ferry will leave old shore wharf o take you to the island this afternoon .
only trainers with this invitatin will be admitted .
i you decide to attend , you must reply at once .
i guess the world 's number-one trainer wants to challenge me to a matc !
t what ?
save your energy !
this is ging to be so cool 
officer jenny , report to the fery entrance .
i ca n't believe how fast the storm came up .
the ferry is canceled ?
-lt 's only a little rain !
-lt 's more than just rain .
listen to me .
but there are no pokémon tear today .
you will never make it !
the nurse in charge of the center disappeared lst month .
come back here , or i 'll place you under arrest !
come back !
some trainers have no fear .
o them , this is just one more challenge .
that is what sets them apart and il make them pokémon masters .
good luck to all of you .
the world 's greatest pokémon master is waiting for me .
our pokémon are n't strong enough .
they ca n't handle waves like this .
ve get you to nw island faster than you can say fahrvergnüen .
stroke !
i think i 'm going to have one .
-they motly live in minnesota .
are yu sure this boat 's safe ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
-lt 's team rocet .
-prepare for trouble .
ash !
misty !
-not yet .
stay toether .
look !
my master bids you welcome to new islan .
lkindly present your invitaton .
here it is , miss .
i knew i recognize that face .
are n't you the nurse from the treatment center 
my maste awais your arrival .
with you here , all trainers worthy of a audience with my master are present .
only the trainers capable of braving the storm are worthy in my master 's eyes .
do you mean that storm was sme kind of test ?
release your pokémon from their pokéballs and join the others .
it wo n't be long before my mster 's intentions are clear .
now we 'll never know what kind of party we 're missing !
-you know another way in ?
look over there .
come on .
what tok yo guys so log ?
how did you get here ?
it was easy .
hurricae winds are a breeze fo pidgeotto here .
guys , say hello .
i rode over on gyarados ' back .
yes , but once you train it , it 's the most dependable pokémon there is 
you are about to meet my master .
what 's that ?
this is the ruler of new island and son the hole world .
quiet , human .
-hw 's it taking 
-lt 's psychic .
we 'll show you !
let 's go , yarads !
hild 's play .
and how n the world did i get here ?
you have been under my control .
you 're us a bully !
they 're pokémon .
this is the pokémon replication system .
what are you -- ?
let go !
i made it .
but just by a hair .
analyzing pokémon biomaterial sample .
-who 's that pokémon ?
-lt 's mowth .
but i 'm meowth .
i have n't got much time .
there was sufficient genetic material to replicate mew .
ovanni insisted on super-clones more powerfl than any living pokémon .
but the creature 's anger is out of control .
-sounds like a real pokénstein .
so this must be the lab .
no .
your pokémon will not be spared .
they ave disgrced themselves by serving humans .
those pokémon are nothin but slaves .
so , you say i am wron ?
you are as pathetic as the rest .
humans and pokémon can never be friends .
are you okay ?
go , rhyhorn .
-no !
like most pokémon traines i too began with charmander , squirtle and bulbasaur .
but for their evolved forms i used teir genetic materia to clone even more powerful copies .
-copies !
your fake venusaur ca n't beat my ral one !
it may not have a nicknae  bt i do have a charizard .
i choose you !
harizard , i did n't say start .
your charizard is oorly tained .
saur .
i underestimated you last time , but tat wo n't happen again !
shellshoker , hydro pump !
those clones are too powerful .
i 'm not giving up .
charizard , use our speed , not power , and you 'll win .
are you okay ?
this is my world now .
i know !
it 's futile to tr and escape my power .
dewgong .
but me , i got a special pac in my tail for tis one .
look there !
it 's pikachu !
i 'm so glad you 're okay .
-they 're fabulous fakes !
but where re the real ones ?
the poké originals !
i am sparing your lives , for the moment .
but you can not escape you fate .
behold !
with pokémon and humans eliminated the clones shall inherit te worl .
you 're in !
can it be ?
mew .
upeior to mew .
mew and mewtwo !
why do you flee from me ?
-what 's it sayin 
and that a pokémon 's real srengh comes from the heart .
now we shall see wh triumphs .
pokémon are n't meant to fight .
what can come out of it ?
now i can see how horrible fighting really is 
even the best of friends will fight sometimes .
i 'll promise never to fight agan if you wil .
let s get something straight !
you was born different .
how do i know you 're not going to pull a fast one on me ?
you 'r ight , we do have a lt in common .
the same earth , the same air , the ame sky .
maybe if we starte looking at what 's the same instead of always looking at what 's different , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove how strong those super-clones are .
i 'd rather risk my life out in mewtwo 's storm than watch pkémon destroy each other .
those pokémon are read to fight to the death .
someone 's got to take a stnd .
someone 's got to say no and refuse to fight .
oh , no !
pleae , no !
i pitted them againt each oher .
i see nw that the circumstaces of one 's birth are irrelevant .
-thi could be the worst storm ver .
you have got to find shelter .
the pokémon treatment center will open as a shelter .
they keep getting more beautiful every time i see them .
wel , i guess we 're just here because we 're here .
yes , let 's eat .
i ca n't believe it .
-tat 's so weird !
what 's that ?
-l do n't se anything , ash .
-this is paradise !
i 'd really like to go sailing in one of tem catamarans .

as you could see yugo ... hi little idea was to add us to his frozen heroes cllctio .
why did he take adamaï along ?

the ... the iop god ?
for my people .
i would n't call tat egoistical .
harebourg .

usally gods can live for quite a while 
extreme emotional shock .
nw you must take back your place .
... in your hands ... we 're not interested .
maybe .
so what ?
littl dragon ?
it would be very violent !
and .. who 's we ?
a secet guild that aims to watch over the world .
every sibling is a demigod or a dragon offspring .
and you otomai sn of the feca goddess .
i do n't believe a single word of your stor !
if tat 's a trick ...
i have explained what will happen if you use the dofus .
you should let him rest .
not to mention he 's currently receiving a nice big chunk of divine energy .
that 's tremendous .
princess .
it s the occasion to get our revenge against ush .
i 'd rather have you go to the sadida kingdom with our friends .
i 'm really a god .

however i can tell by te sound of your voice that your decision is final .
big sister .

that 's the way it works does n't it ?
we all know that 's the way it works .
everyone on board !

powerful sadida .
randpa ruel

amalia is my best friend ... we all know there 's more to it .
whil her ... sh has become a queen .
can you imagine me by her side ?
the entire sdid kingdom would make fun f her .

the leaders of this world must sometimes take hard decisions .
and she will need you by her side t support her .
and i have my idea for the next two .
i 'd like you to come with us .
yes yes yes .

an exceptional situation calls for exceptional measures .
we 're only a small reconnaissance team .

no .
i do 't think so .
but ... these mechanisms .
you want to do the same thing he did .
little yugo 
nox wante to go back in time and demonstrated how it 's nearly impossible .

we would have all the resources at our dispoal to live indepndently from the other nations .

just like amaia is ready to marry a stranger to help her people .
without sbjects to prott .
but something is tickling y beard .

please observe this object  which appears to be a stone .
the unsc has confirmed it as he kilaak monster-contrl device wakin havoc upon our world .
what 's more , they 'e being discovred in the most unexpected paces .
one was even discoered in a cconut on guam .
we estimate is effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km .
so the monsters are ikely being controlled by devices in their respective area 
regarding the kilaaks and their prisoners fro monsterland ...
tetsuo ise , age 30 .
kyoko manabe , age 23 .
thank you , miss .
you can go .
we beg your pardon .

prepare to attack .
do we have poof the kilaks are behind it ?
there 's a subterranean monster at amagi .
they must be using a new control device now .
thnk you , doctor .
it 's kyoko anabe .
let 's talk elsewhere .
no , i want to talk o all of you here .
do n't tell me again !
especialy the reporters .
amd if we do n't , they 'll destroy u with the monsters .

i bet it 's a kilaak cave .
our only choice is to move forward .
all right .
okay , get back .
i knew it .
so what 's the important businss ?
proclaation ?
pleas isten carefully  major tada n particular .
earth does n' belong to humans alone .
the area beneath the mt .
fuji volcanic chain now belongs to the kilaas .
understand ?
what ?
let 's go .
that 's the true source of the signal !
we 'll send sy-3 to the moon .
and do n't take off those spacesuits till you deal with the kilaaks .
proceed to the target .
take a look at your chart .
yes , sir .
watch out fr ufos and pproach from a low altitude .
we 'll be on our way then .
our approach vector is 45 degrees to port 
from the sea of tranquility to he sea of vapors .
that 'll bring us to the casaini crater .
roger .
it 'd be surprising if we were n't .
full stop .
prepare to descend .
all right , here we go .
prepare the rover !
preparing the rover !

whe e destroyed the wall , the temperature dropped .
gather them up .
this is the control dvice 's core .
damn thing 's still running .
moon base .
moon base !
no answer ?
none at all .
the base wo n't anwer , and the signal 's till ther .
let 's detach he excavator !
deach the maser .
get a high-voltge able !
screwdriver .
i think our only choice is to assume they failed .
okay , switch it on !
what 's wrong ?
i do n't care !
turn it on and up 
it worked !
hurry !

doctor , this is no time for that !
our control device is complete , so we thought we 'd tes it on godzilla .
the monsters are on our side .
it and the primeval aokigahara forest are silent , as if awaitig the impending ful-scale giant-monster attack against the kilaak base .
rodan ?
oh , there 's one !
now othr ha appeared .
it 's anguirus frm the asagiri lateau on the left .
truly a sight to see .
following anguirus are manda , baragon , and gorosaurus .
one fter another , they 're bearing down on he kilaak base here in aokigahara .
flying over lake motsu with the southern alps in the horizon .
will godzill lead the opening charge ?
this force of giant monsters with odzilla at its head is truly a sight o behold .
we ca n't control him .
what do we do ?
earth s monsters are mo match for him .
the monstes are ready .
this is an azing struggle !
a burning moster ?
it 's heading straight for us !
evacuate !
the kilaks are signaling us !

mother ounted last night and one came out .
these hotes .
i thought you were germa .
well , she 's my aunt .
yes , i like her .
randolp , you try that and i 'll fix you .
how do you lik that ?
she 's rigt .
what ae yu doing ?
i 'm going up the alps .
that 's th y ou come down .
your brother and i hae ade acquaintance .
you 'd better leave it somewhere .
taly ?
why , going ovr .
i wan na go t america !
d thy hav candy ?
you can jus see the dents du midi .
it 's not a very good one .
i like just hanging round .
he 's american .
we 're from new york state .
were i want to be .
you have n't told me our name .
randolph c miller .
my father is ezra b miller .
he 's in scenectady .
i 'm gon na climb that tree .
he does n't like me , either .
well , one , but he goes round with a teacher .
your brother has no eacher ?
mother thought of getting oe .
an american lady .
but randolph did n't want a teacher travelling round with us .
she asked why i did n't give randolph instruction .
ca yo find people in italy to d that kind of thing ?
yes , in geneva .
i 'd never bee in so many hotels until i came to euroe .
there are a number .
i 'm glad ...
s many intiate friends have been .
whenever i put n a paris dess i feel i 'm in europe 
pardon ?
but i do n't know where the society keeps itself here .
do you ?
are you takig the cure ?
 've always had plenty of it .
there 's lots there .
i 've more friends there .
i 've had a lot f gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the hâteau de chillon .
no 
i want to go , dreadfully .
i would n't leave without seeing it .
you an drie , or take the steamer .
radolph says it 's too old to be interesting .
mother 's afrid to leave him alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find someone to stay with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd rather go to chillon .
he 's not much bent on going , anyway .
we ?
you and i ?
oh , ugenio 
to chillon ?
mademoiselle has arranged it ?
i wo n't be happy till we go .
you 're really american ?
se will tell you all about me .
the carriage is waiting .
they 're horribly common , my dear frederick .
one des one 's duty by just ignoring them .
mil ?
i ca n't not .
sh has that charming loo they have 
and she dresses o perfectio .
ca n' think where they get their taste 
after all , she 's not a comanche indian .
does she ?
there 's no ther name for it .
very likely they 've never seen a man with such good mannrs .
probably corresponds to the yong lady 's idea f a count .
you might hav mentioed yu had made her acquaintance .
pray , what did you say ?
who is a thousand times obliged to you .
you do n't say that as if you beleved it .
how does one say it ?
i should think that proved just the contrary .
how long had you known her wen ths project was formed ?
you 've been in vevey 24 hours .
that she 's a hrror .
she fully intends to .
then i must decline the honour f her acquaintance .
think what , sir ?
that she 's the sort of gir who expects a man to carry her off ?
you 're too innocent .
my dear aunt  i 'm not too innocent .
too guilty , then .
yes .
thi is the stupidest evening .
have you been alone 
she 's gone to bed ?
she 's gne to try and put randolph to bed .
let 's hope she persuades him .
he does n' like her to tlk to him .
ow 's your aunt ?
not well .
how observant !
it 's a lovely decription .
i guess we are .
she tells me she does 
why did 't you say so ?
you need n't be afraid .
why shoul she want to know e 
she is xclusive .
here comes mother .
are you sure it 's her ?
she does n't see you .
she does n't approve of my walking with you .
or i would n't tink i 'm natural .
i do n't know why you wear this .
i do .
is randolph in bed ?
it is n't as bd as it was at dover .
he should make it up .
he just ca n't .
he is tiresome .
he would 't even go to that castle .
your daughter has alowed me the honour of being her guide .
or on the boat .
i d 't see ...
we oly want to see the princpal ones .
we saw several in england .
yes , but hillon is worth seeing .
it seems there is n't anythin she would n't undertake .
you 're sure you wo n't join us ?
do let her go .
you have n't spoken to me for half an hour .
i want you to tke me ut in a boat .
i got you to say something .
i do n't hink so .
i love ho he says it .
it woud b .
why wait for anything ?
it 's eleven o'cock .
i 'm gong on a boat .
at this hour , mademoiselle ?
tell her she ca n't .
as mademoiselle pleases .
i just want a little fuss .
i 'm puzzled .
what are you doing ?
no .
goodnight .
we 're gon na make it !
wait !
we made it !
 mass of towers on a block of boulders .
i have a passon for steamboats .
why are you so solemn ?
i was grinning from ear o ear .
yur ears are ver close .
come on , et 's be the first ones off .
what 's up here ?
excuse me .
i 'm sre you know all that .
the point wa , the castle was n't all constructed at the sme time .
between th 9th and 1 3th cycles .
four yeas .
is tht ho long you 'e been here ?
oubliette .
the castle completely dominated the ass through the alps .
it 's an impression you give 
be careul !
it 's very rotten .
wy re you rushing ?
what 's through here ?
look !
hat ?
hello .
l onder what 's throgh there .
wait for me .
miss miller !
amen !
do n't forget me .
my goodness .
lord byron carved his name on it .
wrote that poem about him .
it was during the reformation .
there are seven pillars of gothic mould in chillon 's dungeons deep and old
i never saw a man who knew so much !
do n't you wan na teach randolph ?
you 're not in business .
but i do have engagements .
i do n't believe it .
i 'm cold now .
wait for me .
you see the design of this fireplace re ?
do n't sa a thing like that !
wait , there 's so much moe to see .
i think you 're horrid !
does n't she give you more than two days off at a time ?
please stop .
are n't you ?
at any ate , i will certainly come .
well , tere 'll be a carriage .
yo were saying ?
and miss miller .
the fortune hunters are of the inferior sort .
she takes them to such houses as her ose is alowed into .
where is the mother ?
i have n't the least idea .
splendi .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he seems prodigiously busy .
i find it ifficul to take tea .
i think i might go .
whether or not being vulgar is being bad is a question fr th metaphysicians .
they 're bad enough to blush for .
who is the portrait for ?
i 'm presentig each one with a copy .
it 's ludirously expensive .
you stayed here ?
but there are some singular stories about her .
but i 'm not trugh with you .
hello , mr nd mrs jonson .
madame miller .
i want you to meet the sinclairs .
hello , miss miller !
i 'm ever so happy to see you 
i 'm o happy to see you .
here 's your mother at lat .
and i know you 
i arrived today .
we got a bigger place .
i knew you 'd sy somthing .
i hope you 've been well .
i 've got it , too .
father 's got it bad .
in schenectady he 's at the ery top .
we 'd heard so much about it .
you nver were .
we 've een places ahead of rome .
it 'll turn around and go th right way some time .
yes .
i 've heard .
she goes round mor than i do .
she knows a great many gentlemen .
she thinks thee 's nothing like rome .
at vevey , you would n' stay when i asked .
he went to geneva .
eugenio will raise something ierce .
delighted to hear it .
an intimate friend .
mr giovanelli .
he wants to knw some americans .
he 's tremendously cleer .
moter , eugenio 's raly gon na raise something .
we d better go back .
you go .
i 'm gon na walk round a little .
aloe ?
it 's no safe .
give her that medicine .
mrs alker , you 're too perfect .
i 'm meeting  friend .
is it mr giovaelli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
hat a fuss .
if mr winterbourne wer as polie as he pretends , he 'd offer to walk me ther .
i kew her ...
eugenio says we have the best hote rooms in rme .
i thought i would be awfully quiet and pokey .
i was sure w 'd be going round with one of those old men who explain about pictures .
i kow ever so many people .
i think i like the english best .
shall e buy soe candy for poor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk you back .
i 'm not helping yu find him .
i 'll find him .
you sound too imperious .
you should listen to a gentleman sometimes , the rigt one .
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ever meet .
not at all .
to ameica ?
ever ?
ever .
i do .
thank you .
mr winterbourne !
mr winterbourne ?
she ask you come .
excuse me .
women follw wherever he goes .
walking with two men .
fifty people have noticed her .
it 's a shame to make a fuss .
or to et her ruin herself 
she 's innocent .
she 's reckless .
the world will see he 's not running wild .
hell again .
this is he .
this is mrs walker , who so sweetly sked you to hr party .
i 'm not five years old .
come in here and i will tell you .
i do n't think i want to know .
gracious me !
if this is improper , i 'm improper .
have a lovely ride .
all right .
your honesty 's only pu her off .
she meant no harm .
that 's what i thought a month ago .
sittng in corners with mysterious italians .
dancing ll evening with one prtner .
receiving callers late at night .
he must be edified by what he sees .
we should n't pay attention to servants .
her only fault is to think giovaneli a gentleman , when he 's a poor iitation .
he 's soe third-rte artit .
she 's naturally indelcate .
two days .
that remark abot your going to geneva !
i think you should stp .
giving her any furher opportunit to expose hersef .
i ca 't do anythin as enlightened as tat .
if you wish to rejoin her ...
as you wish .
finally .
it 's the first time i 've ever been to a party alone , especially in italy .
does n't she intend ...
... to favour us with her company ?
daisy dressed before dinner .
a friend is thee , the gentleman she was bringing .
mr giovanelli .
i guess thy 'll coe before very long .
i 'm sory she 's coming in that way 
i wo n't speak to her .
i 'm afraid you thought i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made him go over them .
you are hungry ?
yes .
the singing kept him awake .
i do ope this is the finale .
she 's worked her way over to your old colege chm .
they were quite restless there .
we paired off .
that was better .
he seems more in ontrol of his limbs than yo are .
he 'd never are ask a young italian lady to walk about the streets with him .
what nice irl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flirt only with e .
i would n't flirt it yo .
you 're too stiff .
you ay that too often .
if it makes you angry , i 'll say it again .
it does n't exit here .
poor mother .
and neither of s is flirting .
we 're eal inimate friends .
i see .
i just love that song .
especally n winter .
your friend has n't moved al evening .
really ?
why do n't you break in ?
she 's a disgrace .
thank you so much .
goodnight 
i certainly do n't want her to leave tem without me .
buonanotte .
that was very cruel .
she never enters my drawing rom again .
preoccupied , anyway .
you were sppose to come by for me .
i do n't knw what .
miss miller .
do you think so ?
she thinks him the finest gentleman .
expects a commission if the fellow succeeds in marrying her 
i 'm not sure she 's cpable of tought .
i certainly see no evidenc of it .
she romps on from day to a , from hour to hour , as tey did in the golden age .
i can imagine nothing more vulgar .
the little roman .
he 's perfectl respectable .
a lawyer , i think .
but he ca n't really hope to pull it off .
if it is n't mr winterbourne !
good afteroon !
am i interrupting ?
not at all .
mr giovanelli will now sing ...
hurry , mr winterbourne .
eugenio 's taken him and moter to bu hoes .
no , yu sing your song 
the most difficult song i never her .
ever hear .
come on , we re waiting .
mr winterborne is getting impatient .
i 'd ejoy that .
then maybe i 'll sing .
hre we go .
bravo !
encore !
no , i think he has heard me .
very much .
all right .
i thought he was with you .
that boy wil be the death of me .
xcuse me .
mr giovanelli 's gon na sing for you both .
but they 're always together .
she says she ai n't .
i see .
mr giovanelli ha promised o tell me .
of course .
randolph !
looking for me .
mr winterbourne .
you think i go out too much with him .
everyone dos .
you 'll find they do .
they 're not inviting you places .
have n't you noticed ?
 noticed you and that you are as stiff as a ramod .
i ' not half as stiff as some .
try going to see them .
what will they do ?
you know what that means ?
what mrs walker did ?
i would 't think you 'd let people be s unkind .
do you ?
your mther says she believes you 're engaged .
i guess she does .
but since you 'v mentioned it , i am engaged .
she wants me to come to geneva .
feddie ?
yu did n't say ten words t dinner .
i do n't know .
i saw her tday .
where ?
she 's certainly pretty 
e 's a mystery .
what ?
yes , i suppose .
she 's carried away with giovanelli .
i d n't tnk you 've missed a thing .
are you sure ?
yes 
how long have you een here ?
ell ...
i see .
for myself i have no fear .
but when was mademoiselle ever ...
i was boun to se th colosseum by moonlight .
we 've had the most beautiful time .
i go to see if the couriers are thre .
the colosseum is oe thing i can rave about .
why are you always so stiff 
did you believe i was engaged the other day ?
i just came by to say goodbye to my aunt .
and mrs walker , i hope .
she 's ovr there .
will you ?
i must say i 'm not surprse .
charles .
what do you her about daisy miller ?
freddie .
she 's always going around at night .
it 's o blastd dark over here , you ca n't see anything unless th moon 's up .
ai n't that right , ugenio ?
i 'm going .
excuse my coming so ate .
i only just heard .
i do wish dr davis were ere .
is here anything i can do ?
no , thank yo .
 is randolph would go to bed .
but he 's been very helpful 
it always gts very high before it drops .
dais spoke of you the other day , ite pleasantly .
half the time she does n't knw what she 's saying , but thi time i think she did .
i 'm sre i 'm very glad .
he has 't been near us since she was taken ill .
i said i would n't give any such mesage .
she was the most beautiful youn lady i never see .
the most innocent ?
the most innocen .
for myself i had no fear .
yes ?
she did wht she liked .
she did what she lked .
no .
i 'm convinced .
i 'm sure .
is that some modest way of saying you think she would have reciprocated your affection , had you shown it ?
that remark you ade last ummer .
rope him !

they 've been shipped here to wintle , their second uncle .
halfwy to san francisco , i 'd say .
the stage ade delivery to the consignee or his agent .
as soon as w sort this out .
he ca n' wait too long .
take my word for it .
it might be prudent to resolve the more imminent problem forthwith .
all right , come on .
i 'll show you !
hey !
i 'll be right back .
just hold on !
right here .
meanwhile , rest assured that the butterfly stage and freight company will make every endeavor to satisfy the problem to the ultimate satisfaction of all concerned parties .
mr. bradley 's lingering ilness left him destitute .
anything ould be an improvement .
no , i 'd say you had best keep these youngsters or provide for their safekeeping .

clovis do n't like o be touche .

there is no gold .
i do n't have to answer to three whelps who are n't dry behind the ears yet .

i think he has a regular route to pick out food , sort of like a milkman in reverse .
yes , it does .
ah , miss , um , randall ...

at the present time , duck stealing is not one of them .

i 'd try to put something of mine on the cat as a clue .
here .

she was wearig a wristwatch at the time of her abduction .

they went in anothr direction ?
or stayed here in the city .
how 's your workload , kelso ?

for that matter , who does ?
there 's a kind of an antagonism between us .
i know he medical records of every man in this office .

i 'm available on this case 24 hours a day .
yes , sir .
c ...
gesundeit , and good luck .

this mn was nicely ressed .
that 's the way plmbes dress now .
do you have any friends ?
i 'd prefer a room on the second floor , actually .
uh-huh .
what did you say ?
ah , dc 
that 's his favorite spot .
this is the informant , as we say down at the office .
good , good kity cat .

that animals do n't like ?

the bureau has spent $ 19,800 of the taxpayer ' moey training me for emergencies .

they climb trees and phone poles .
wiher he goest , you will go .
i 've got an old dog who ' a lot better at tracking cats than i am .
we do n't have time for comments .
okay .
when the informant leaves , it 'll be our job to contain him loosely , within a moving , fluid perimeter .
it 's important he does n't become aware of us as this might alter his regular nocturnal behavior .
hold it .
who do you think yo 're kidding ?

i did n't come in from stupidsvlle on last night 's bus .

bro bajie
since the karma of weal and woe is prdstined why worry yourself sick , madam ?
i was forced to marry into the purple
many people died
there was a rumor that i brought on the disaster to their village
i was seen as a demon
to honor the gods
but later i survived
so you can say passng time is not necessarily  good cure pain comes from stubbornness
it looks hard to overcome bu , as long as you take a bold step forward
i 'm sure you ca do it as wel
you ca 't bluff my eyes with your disguise
wan na go ?
come on out
i 'm sure i 'll find you soon
she died
it was too wrong .
master , help me
master
your sin of killing is too much
if i let you get way with it like this it 'll be a disaste for the world
that damned monkey was too fierce
trouble ?
are you goin to use this incantation to keep me under control ?
we only believe what can b seen in our eyes
now i understand why the buddha made the two of s together on this journey
what pulls us tgether is this journey of 36,000 miles fo the scriptures
but i hope you believe that every time i recite the ncantation
please help save my daughter
can somone save her ?
exacfly
the kingdo of coud was rosperou
she feds on these young kids
please ise , your majesty
amitabha .
guard his majesty !
repeat it
eat him now if you can
i 'm here for you
let 's talk outside
of yo ?
master
do n't hurry
out with it
we are both demons of the same kind
that 's why we should help each other
what can yu help me with 
your hoop ooks nice on you
you can keep it i yo like
why not ?
go ahead
look at this monkey
he has to do whatever is told by his master
white bone spiri
let me be the bad guy
please calm down
sun wukong gets in the way
so , as long as she tackles that monkey we 're sure to have a chance
wukong , are you alright ?
no way
o you really want to enlighten this demon ?
i ca n't leave a single life unnlightened on this journey
i can never make myself assure een thouh i can make it through to the scripture
i can never feel assured
it 's a style
do you know what you 're supposed to do here tonight ?
i 'm here
again ?
wukong , why are you her ?
do n't fool around here
yeah
lady white if you have guts have a good fight with me
fair enough ?
ok .
step back
i hate being called evil demon the most
if not , what else should i call you ?
whateve
listen , i can give up everything
but !
we 'll see
someone help !
i 'm stuck
where 's the monk ?
i wonder here
now it 's your turn
this is your karmic reward
even the buddha can not extingush humn 's evil within
thi sort of person is more vicious than demons
now .
if it were n't for him , killing all the way with is cudgel you could go nwhere !
what merits and retribution re you looking to ?
every word you say is nosense and every step you take could kill
by what right ?
holy monk , please wait
the folks of our kingdom will be grateful for your kindness forever
please accept our gifts
thanks for saving my life
i 've said
she 's a demon

where your insight and experience are appreciated ,
david sarlo asked me to the dance !
h 's so cute !
at first , i thought e likd avery , but then jenna told sphie that he liked me ...
that can only be nurtured over te years by listening .
bu that 's where the similarities end .
you never retire from being a mother .
not to mention the driing lessons ,
it was spring of her senor year ,
and she suddenly ...
grew up .
they 'll always need you
well , that just might turn out to be the hardest part o the job .

travel ?
or maybe indonesia ?
that sounds exciting .
she was completely oblivious to the fact that her son was terrorizing the entire restaurant , including me .
that 's the thing about women with kid , it 's a package del .
simon , look at me .
you ook happy-ih .
i do n't need auren setting m up .
with those bright eye and that cute smile , are you kidding 
half the women who bring in their kids just want t give you a big u and a warm meal .
come on , i 'm being serious .
specially if you get your prenting advice from bstie mom .
not what .
it 's a mommy blog .
you know out this ?
f course  do .
nothing wrong with the way we were raised .
something you might want to keep in mind .
what does that mean ?
we had it all figured out , two years of community college , then she transfers to universit to get her egree .
wll , i ca n' do that .
our relationship has always been built on mutual respect and understanding .
this incredibly arrogan father who 's been postin on my blog .
well , i can hardly wait to read it .
just a soon as i figure out hat i 'm gon na say to sadie .
the way i see it ,
but sharing wit your child keps those doors open to a future you can build togther .
hello , bestie mom .
if this blog of yours does n't wor out ... you have a great future in cmedy ...
serousl ?
your problem is ,
well .
if you do n't know the difference
it 's called passion ...
maybe not ...
do n't bothe .
you wo n't get an answer from me .
okay , s what was wrong with that last pair of jeans ?
i want them to look good on me .
listen , i was thinking bout what you were saying about traveling , and i think we should alk bout it .
how did those aisies work out ?
um ...
andy 
you too .
chemistry class , right ?
i 'm good .
what are you fllas shopping for today ?
oh , running shoes for , um ...

uh ...
wha about sadie ?
now ... we 're talking .
yeah .
she passed away when troy ws seven .
and e talk , but ... well , we ..
i guess we grunt our meaning across , you kno ?
i know what you mean .
lately ... not so much .
i shouted upstirs to troy to ask hat he wants for dinner , and , um ... he texted me back .
troy 's ad .
oh , i , uh ...
no .
you obviously like him .
he seems like a nice enough guy .
so , what 's the problem ?
i have troy 's number , so we can hook you two up .
i ' not going to try to talk you out o it .
just think about it , anything could happe .
she 's waiting .
thanks for the rde , mom .
sadie ...

i love you , too  bae .
when she 's thousands of miles awy ?
not to mention what a ad idea it is
for her to put off starting school .

on the other hand , meeting somebody wold n't be so bad either .

but she 'll be i school , and is n't that what you want ?
what i want is what 's best for my daughter .
i do n't get it .
she 's trying to break ou and be her own person .
i mean , we all did it .
i 've never held her back , i 've never set a bunch of rules .

morning , everybody , and welcome to the 5th annual mom blogger symposium !
we have bloggrs here from evey corner of the world .
are you guys excited ?
and we want to hear wat 's on your mind .
thank ou , karissa , fr giving me a moment of your time .
i know everyoe here is probably busy , so i promise this will ust tae a second .
my name is andy sommers , but some of you might know me better as ...
juggling dad .
yes , i 'm that guy , who , u ... who thought he was qualified enough to tell everyone ese the right way to be a parent .
after meeting her n person , it i n't take very long before i was falling for her .
but after some of the things that juggig dad had said , or written online ,
i was scar that she might not like andy after she found ot we were the same person .
so , i did n't tell her .
and that was biggest mistake  've ever made .
that 's why i 'm here today .
i was never been happier than when i was with you .
go ..
carly , you once told me that yllow rose were for friendship and red meant i love you .
i 'll let you decide 
an i hve both ?
all right , mom 
way to go , dad !
no  you do n't .
there 's no place like home
be it ever o humble
how do you d ?
nice of you to drop by me humble abode .
m name is buny .
what started all this hasing ?
when was the very first chase ?
in order to answer that question ... we 'l have to swing back in time a little bitty bit .
quite dark , too .
anyay , nobody complained  which was odd ... until you realized hat there was n't nobody arund to complain .
until one day .. very deep n a sixth-rate galxy called the milky way ... circling around a fourthrate star called he sun ... on a tenth-rate lanet , a strange creature appeared 
nd he frst domesticity and the first boredm .
what 's on the all tonight , dear ?
but after about 25,000 years of this ... and having developed evere cricks in their necks .. man and woman becam bored again ... even with all those brilliant , ultramodern , innovative ideas ... like the first motion-pictre cameras .
and then one day .. another strange and historic creature appared .
me .
fathers like tedd pierce ...
warren foster ... and mie altese , who wrote ost of me biography .
and  of course , a father named mel blanc ... who had thousands of voices ... and was nice enough to give me one of the .
an animatin director ... who gos by the unlikely name of chuck jones .
and old chuck seemed determined ... to gt poor litle old me into outer space , too .
i 'll neer mix radish juice and carrot juice again .
the hole eems long this morning .
holy cow !
why , the sun ai n't even out yet .
no wonder i 'm so slepy .
what was that ?
here the heck am i , anyways 
at long last , my dram come true .
i wan na ask you something .
the earth will be gone in just a few seconds .
no point in wasting money on a flying saucer ... when the earth 's not gon na ...
pardon me agan , doc , but jus what did you mean ... by that crack about the earh being gone ?
i 'm going to blow it up .
i obsructs my view of venus .
now , i shall have to create more martians .
my illudium u-36 explosive space modulator .
boy , it 's really wonderful to be back in civilization .
run for th hills  folks , or you 'll be up to your armpits in martians .
but oter people , if you want to call a duck people .. had clse encounters ith that little martian , too .
as the ensuing , gripping ... and nerve-tingling drama now demonstrates .
i have sent for you , dodgers , bcause we are facing a crisis .
now , we have reason to believe ... that the only remaining source is on panet x .
and you want e to find planet x , is that it ?
can you do it , dodgers ?
indubitably , sir .
because there 's no one knows his way around outer space .. like duck dodgers ... in the 24th nd a half century !
ops !
then , west in an astro-arc deviation to here .
then by space-navigable ompas to here , here ... and then to here and here ... by 13-point stratocumuls bearig our million light-years .. and thus to our destination .
now , do you know how to reach planet x ?
oh , sure .
i wish you 'd explan it to me sotime , buser .
that 's ridiclos .
gd !
and there just ai n't room enough on this planet ... for the to of us .
you may fire when ready , grizzly .
who ?
what ?
where ?
when ?
how ?
who ?
who ?
what ?
jst when i hd him going , you had to butt in .
get back in that spaceship .
now , i use my secret weapon !
i remember well the first time he tried to sell himself ... as the logical successor to errol .
join up with me , so jyous and free
for i 'm robin hood , and i 'm very good
to trip it , trip it , trip it , trip it
trip it up and down
whoops !
so trp it up and own

the beasts woul not touch him .
i knw who you are now .
you will give us entertainment while we eat .
the palace will be there in the morning .
my king , the hebrews at and drink only their own food which is prepared according to their rituals .
cyrus :
you promised me a tae , four , in fact .
when i was just a boy , he hrew down the assyran empire , my people 's ancient nemesis , but the destructon of israel 's enemies brought us no relief because in the 3rd year of nebuchadnezzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with tears , for you , lord , are rihteous , yet we rebelled against your commn .
male # 3 :
as do i .
i have only begun my sudies , but here ... the prophet , jeremiah , son of hlkiah , has writen that we shall serve the king of babylon for 70 years --
daniel :
s punishmet for our sins .
ad even if we were to srvive it , we would e very old .
you are summond for your meal 
why would they only take 10,000 of s and leave the rest of our people behind ?
yes , look at who they 've taken .
you take away the leaders  and the rest cn esily be governed .
they 've changed our nms  hoping we 'll forget or god ;
set it here .
where is it from , and how was it slaughtered ?
the cattle are from the king 's herd .
the swine are from the king 's pens .
we ar forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has commaded us ,
you are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses .
but the king can not he will not chnge the customs of his hall to fit your wishes .
you mst know his 
and we will not ask him to .
i have bee charged wit our wel-being .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , te king , will do .
ad we would not wish it so .
for 10 days give us nothing but vegetables to eat ad mter to drink 
cyrus :
i have no doubt the lord favoraby disposed his heart to hear our request .
and we remained un-defiled .
were presented before nebuchadnezzar himself .
the king 's executioner , arioch , will be in the chamber .
tey are belteshazzar , shadrach ,
you have destroyed neveh the mighty , seat of ssyia , and taken from he hand the scepter of nations .
hy should i allow you , sons of my former enemies , to serve in my court ?
because you have spared the lives of our people who were delivered nto your hand and because the word of the pophet jeremiah has come unto us saying ,
the god of israel , says to all those
pry to the lord for it , or if it prospers , you too wll prosper . '
this is good .
i will speak only the truh , and when you would not hear it , you must ask me nothing .
have their names be written in he book of the wise 
male  2 :
if they can be trusted .
daniel :
trusting the words of the oracle of delphi ,
were unable to help him .
n !
command , and it is done .
i ne to know what it means .
oh , king , tell your servants your dream , and we will interpret it for ou .
astrologers who read nothing in the stars .
t is up to you to dscern and interpret them .
bt , my lord , if only you would tell us your dream e could interpre it , as we have always done 
i kno you 're trying to gain time or trick me into revealing wat i 've seen .
ither ay i 'll have none of it .
no king has evr asked such a thing before .
why do n't you come along with me and sk him yourself ?
speak .
daniel :
i have heard your decree , and i understand tat i shall fall beneath the blad if your dream is not made known and interpreted .
the sentence is to be carried out at sunrise .
you may withdraw so long as you return at dawn , as your fate and that of the other is one in the same , and when you return be sure o bring your companions ith you .
shall i send guards along , my king ?
even if we were to flee te city th whle world would 've been against us , not that t attered
i had give my word and itened to keep it .
oh king , live frever .
dnil :
belteshazzar , your death is upon you as well unless you know my deam and can interpret it .
praise be to the god of my fathers forver and ever .
he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the disernin .
he reveals deep and hidden tings and has made plain all that you hae asked , for he ha shown me the vision of the king .
then peak !
the head of the statue was mad of pure gold , its chest and ars of silver , its belly and thighs of bronze , it legs of ron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked cly 
then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold were all broken to pieces at the same time , and the winds sept them away without a trace , but the rock that struck the statue became a mountain
you have done what i was told was impossible .
you know my dream as if you dreamt it yourself .
wat does it mean ?
you , oh king , are the king of king .
after you  another kingdom will ie , inferior to yours .
and n the time of those kings the god of heaven will et up a ingdo that will never be destroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold 90 feet high .
live orever !
as your dutiful servnts , we know the law that when the horn sounds we all bow down .
nne .
wise man :
they neiter worship your gods or serve the image of gold you 've creaed .
nothing .
is this true ?
do you refuse to worship my state ?
then you shall be thrown into the furnace , and no guard will save you from my hand .
lt the furnace be heated sevenfold .
but now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has not harmed your bodies .
you were willing to give up your lives rather than serve ny but your own god .
dniel :
and for a time all was well until nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was troubled yet by another dream .
before i was born , my grandfater , astyages , was troubled by a dream where a flood begining near his throne was overflowing the whole earth .
he did n't learn util 10 yers later that the boy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned h boy and restored him to his rightful parents , and for a tim the matter was forgotten .
daniel 
old astyages , he knew of the prophecy , but he as poerless to overcome it .
fo when he dreamed hat great dream , his enchanters , sorcerers , and astrologer were once again nable to intrpret the vision .
he images i saw terified me 
the basts of the field took shelter under it , and the birds of the air lived in its branches , and from it every creature was fed .
tim off its branches .
strip its leaves .
but let the stump and its roots ,
this is the dream that i had .
you have become great and strong .
but you saw a messengr , a holy one , comig down from heaven , saying ,
while its roots remai in the ground .
let hm live like wild animals .
you will eat grass lke cattle unti you acknowledge that the most hgh is sovereign over the ingdoms of men and gies them to anyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , e pleased to accept my advice .
renounce your sins by doin what is right and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed .
seek the lord while he may be found , and it may be hat your prosperity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often short , and 12 months later when the king was walki on the roof of the royal palace f babylo -- of babylon -
nebuchadnezzar :
i ve placed upon the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised mountain high .
is this not the geat babylon that i have buil a my royal palace with my mighty power for the glor of my ajesty ?
daniel 
go now from this kingdom which ou lim .
because he insisted on being more than he was made , he becme less than he was made .
even in his insanity neither the lion nor the bea disturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept naked in the places where they found their food because it had been prohesied that one day he would honor the most high .
honor and glory to him who lives forever .
rise , nebuchadneza .
before him all he pople of the earth are regaded as nohing .
he may do as he pleases with the powers of heaven and all the people of the earth , and no ne , no one , may say him , nay .
and so nebucadnezzar returned to his throne , but eventually he was gathered to his fathers , and a seies of new kings came to te throne , none fasting or than a short time .
wel , t last we come to the pan of te tale whee i have some knowledge to share .
for thogh i ad cnquered from east to west ,
it was enogh to freeze the heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from whence it came i do not know , like some spirit of god whispere it in my ear .
but the river euphrates which flowed down o babylon rased above it natural level hemmed in by dms and dikes , but if dams were opened full and the diks were broken , the river which ran straigh through the heat of the city
and i suddenly realized i ' been gven a key to defeat the mighty babylon .
it was as hough in all the world , throughout all of history ,
i was the only one that had the thought .
all i required was te right moment to act .
listen , oh king , and i will tell of the second king of my stor ,
thy seem quite concerned about this , my king .
first , they must build a causeway across the moat .
that alone will take months .
bring me the golden vessels from the temple of jerusalem .
but , my king , is it wis to use the vessels ?
my king , these cups are considered sacred , are they not , my king ?
but here they are spoil for our gos , and they would have you use thm as i see fit .
bring the !
a judan once told nebuchadnezzar , your forefather , o his dreams .
he succeeded when everyone else had failed .
 am tod you are able to giv interpretations and solve difficult problems .
if ou can read the writing on tht wll , you will be cothed in purple , have a chain of gold placed around your neck , and be made third hghest rler in the kingdom .
oh kng , the most high god gave yur father , nebuchadnezzar , reatness and glory , but when his heart became arrogan he was deposed from his throne and strippe of his glory until he acknowledged that the most high is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of heaven .
would you humble the amighty by desecrating his possessions ?
wuld you bind him like a captive and beat him like a slave ?
this is his answer to you .
mene , god has numbered the days of your rign and brought it to an end .
upharsin , your kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians .
thus says the lord , your line i ended .
your rule is ovr .
ls there nothing to be done ?
ill the last of your slaves comfort you , or will they desert you , seeking to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldiers together :
i am king belshazzar of the bablonia .
as he has commanded , i hall assume the crown .
you are darius , the mede-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem taken this city .
by right of conquest , you are now the king .
yes , and you are an official of babylon .
it is a reward for letting belshazzar know that you were about to take the city .
he read the iscription and revealed the message .
he told the king that he would die this very night .
daniel :
if i was to lie , would this be the lie i would choose ?
and how could you have done so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i wil speak to yu honesly , my king , and when you would not hear the truth yo must ask me nothing .
so be it .
yet i shall name you one of the three .
if they were loyal to the former master , they are no good to me .
cyrus :
he 's twice my ucle by blood and marriage and serves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yes .
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once he is in charge he 'll be looking into everything we do .
perhaps we hould elminate him .
how ?
he does n't hunt .
a sudden illness or a drowning .
who would believe it ?
there is n corruption in him nor any negligence .
there 's a spirit of excellence in him .
no one is that honest .
i had a man tr to bribe him once , an a very generous bribe at that .
such a man is dngerous .
hw long before he learns tat we 'v been geerous with ourselves and covered the thefts wit false accounts ?
then perhaps we need to make hm stop .
he wo n't do it .
if we coul forbid hi prayers for an entire month under penalty of immediate execution ?
do n't be ridiculous .
i knw him .
the king knows that daniel an his people pray continuously and only to one god .
which is why we ned to disguise our purpose .
ndeed , they could find nothing amiss in my work , neither willully nor through negligence or lack of care , so they trie to trip me up with my prayers .
but since worship of the most high was not prohibited by the laws of the realm , they had to conceal their purpose like poison in a cup of honey .
and have not submitted to your rule .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereby the loyalty of all may be tested .
but what of the gods of peria , m servant , obey ?
how would you enfoc such an edic ?
no ne would be allowed t go before any altar or shrine for the entire period except or you .
and anyone found violating the decre would be thrown into e lions ' den befoe sundown on the very dy of the offense .
ale conspirato # 3 :
in a single stroke .
i approve yur pan .
in anticipation of your approval , oh king , we have tken the liberty of drafting the edict and bringing it along .
cyrus :
and once a law is written , even the king himself can not change it .
aniel !
the kig 's seal is barely dry .
you chose your god over your kig .
take him away !
oh king , it is my sad duty to inform you that someone has alreay defied yur decree .
guard :
brig forth the prisoner .
he pays no atetion to you , oh king , or to te decree you have put i writing .
daniel is my chief advisor .
no on is above the law .
brig forth the tblet .
shall be thrown into the lions ' den
by my hand and seal , darius the kin , ruler of the medes and pesians .
knowing the king 's command , i have disobeyed it .
i shall command my wise men to make every effort to search out some reason that the la ma be found unenforceable .
let them search , oh king , but only for a short time becase your own law commands that sentene be carried out he ay of the offese .
danel :
it is as i expected .
a king who will not nforce his own laws can not be a king .
i will walk with you , daniel , one last time .
as you wish , o king .
my forefather , abraham , came from this lnd , and the most high said unto him ,
i will make yo into a great nation .
and may yet live to rap the fruits of that curse .
a cp of wine from the king 's on hand .
not so , daniel .
in the cup i hav poured no libatin .
good bye  my friend .
farewell but perhaps not good bye .
ear , oh israel , lord or god ,
have mercy on me , o god .
no , no , take it away , all of it !
in you my soul takes refuge in the midst o lions , surrounded by ravenous beasts with teeth of spears , with tongues as sharp as sword .
come near .
a toast to the lions who show no partiality o a hebrew over ny other man .
but those who seek the lord will lack for no good thing .
aniel !
servant of the lving god , has your god been able to save you ?
oh king , live forever .
my god has sen his angel , and he shut th mouth of the lions .
they have not urt me because i as found inncet in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the man pay if he steals another man 's treasure ?
with his hands perhaps .
is there any pealty lss than death which will do ?
but , h king , he is a hbrew .
you fashioned my own words as a snare above my feet nowing my edict could not be reversed , but the liing god , the god of daniel , has delivered him out of my hand .
no !
please wait , king , pleas !
hi kingdom will ot be estroyed .
he rescues , and he saves .
for 70 yes i had waited , and i knew our time was near .
my heart gows with excitement that now that time has come .
belshazzr , th foolish ;
darius , ho was deceived .
who is this fourth king ?
it is one chosen by te most high to perform great and mighty deeds before he was ver knitted in his mothr 's womb .
a bird of prey ?
true , i had never saw te regions o the euphrates or further westwar until i came in conquest .
nd yet you chased your enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointed .
cyus , whose right hand i take hold of-
it mentions me y name ?
to subue nations before him ,
so that gates will not be shut .
i will go before you and will level the ountains 
n cu through bas of iron .
please continue .
so that from the rising of the su
to he place of its setting ,
how else might it be explined ?
daniel :
you have answered your own question , oh king .
this is what the lord says .
ho spread out the earth by myself ,
nd makes fools of diviners ,
nd of their ruins , i will restore them . 
i , who was saved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was raied in a shepherd 's house .
seventy years since i wa taken from the land o my birth .
babylon has ben punished .
you have punished her .
only one thing remains :
your god has called me a shpherd , and so to your people i shall be , t rescue them from wolves and trants , to gather them gently and to relive them from bondage nd provide for their return .
the lod go o heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed for me to build a temple in jerusalem in judea .
any one of his people among you , may his god be with you .
et him go to jerusalem in judea and buid a temple of the lord , the god of israel-
however  my heart was joyous as my brothrs and sisters dparted on their journey home while i reained in babylo awaiting te day when i , too , would be gathred to my ancestors .

once upon a time in he land of flutterfield , there lived a butterfly fairy named mariposa .
she was the smartest fairy in the land .
then , one day ,
but along the way , they faced peril and danger of all kinds .
mariposa and her friends returned to flutterfield to discover the skeezites attacking the oyal palace .
queen marabella hailed mriposa and her friends  heroe , which they are to this day .
hey , maripsa !
hello , mariposa !

easy , zee .
i 'm right here .
what is it ?
the queen ?
huh ?
of course , your majesty .
the crystal fairies ?
from shimmervale ?
yuck !
huh ?
their land is built on an amazing ntural enery source called crystallites , nd the crystallites heat and power everything in their realm .
hardly .
you see ?
everyne knows that .
only because that 's what we 've been led to believe .
it 's what 's in our fairy tales .
lok .
then , the crysta fairy kig accused the butterfly fairies of trying to steal their crystallites .
te butterfly fairies denied it , the crystal faries did n't believe them , and everyone got angrier and angrier until the two side declared themselves eternal enemis , and vowed never t have contact again .
where 's the picture of that ?
you wo n't find i .
research , not hearsay .
i 'm convinced .
huh ?
but crystal fairies are dagerous !
wlla can manage that 
ah , willa told me i 'd fin you here .

hmm .
oh !
i almost forgot .
my mother asked me to give this to ou .
ooh .

whenever you have doubts , just take it out and it will remind you of us .

follow me .
wait .
historians say this i were shimmervale 's first residents discovered crystallites .
yup .
it 's why we end the tour here .
and ow to the palace , where you 'll be staying .
the castle was built over 4,000 years ago under the reign of king fremulous the fourth .
his wife , quee safrila , designed much of what we still see today .
ah , you 're mariposa , are n't you ?
yes .
i 'm cataia .

i did put in hidden thorns , though !
please welcome maripsa ,
i introduce king regellius and princess catania of shimmervale !
hey ?

sparkly , like a piece of jewelry , or a lake !
i could n't sleep either 
hm .
it says here that outsidrs are forbidden to touch a crystallite , especially the heartsone , which is the most powerful crystallite in shimmervale .
that 's why the king was so upset at tea .
oh !

well  it never really came down to battle.

and mother thought two years in art school was a waste of time .
a long time ago , i forget how long , our fairy forefathers built flutterfield on top of a putrid swamp .
it sas that flutterfield was built on a magnificent an exquisite garden .
yeah .
wila , you 're nt supposed to bring the visitos back here .
