yu say this is our lord 's wish ?

this is a comet .
i 's all ice nd rock 
its 10 miles wide , and t 's headed fr the earth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth that we kow , not really .
at this time the masters of the earth are dinsaurs .
this is pataona 
a vast regio of agentnean suth america as it s toay .
and there was nly one immese ocean ,
 ar nrth  the south american pate , in the sea tt wll grow o be the atlantic ocean .
sme species of ichthyosaurus rew up to 75 ft 
extreme orm of life also appeared on land uring the inosaur ea 
i many lacs tere , on waks today on the very grund thse giants walked on a 100 mili years ago .
this phenomenon seems to depend on anther pculir tws of eoltion .
regions that roduce reat dinosaur also tn to produce great paaeonologists 
many doctorl students coe to prue thei research .
sometimes yur pople , like my dugher ludil , ju come to siy their criosit .
i love taking about dinosaurs wih everyoe , whther they are experts or not .
i s a busy lfe , and it wou av ben plety fo most pople , bu early in my carer new hoizons ened up or me 
thgs bcame uh lrger than lif .
a ranchr ad sumbled upon a surprisingly lare bone .
after ral digging seasos we ende up facing h largs dinosaur ever foun

on a peonal leel , t took a big lace in my ife  say the east .
yet it start its lfe in eggs just a little biger than grapefrut .
preators and hards abond .
only  few will reach adulthod .
it cers mor than 15 miles and t is appoximatel 80 mllion years old .
w beiev tha it was choen as a neting site by geneation upo generation of thse dinosars .
the nests are so close toher , that the emales culd n wlk between them .
it was warmer than toda .
a great pat f the dinosau era  the wee no broad leaf tees and no flower earig plnts 
during the dinosaur era hee i no arcic ice cas , and antrctia is sub-troicl .
for tens of millions of year sesons barely changed .
te wate of the ocean is also much warer 
urricanes r frequent .
the mgetic oles changes positon ntinuoly .
professr cria has cotributd to he discovery f more than a dozen of new dinosaus .
as a sienis  he insists that each new find is impotant , no matter ho big or mall .
nd soetimes he says hat plays t bigest art i siml no n our hnds .
i lik to think that  a luck , jst incrediy lucky .
many paleontlogical dscoverie are not m b professionls 
ht 's what happened wit the arentosaurus , and it happeed agan with ye another inosau .
tey re relatively big , so at fist , e thoht that tey boged to a erbivore  beause in gnera these inosaur tend to be larger .
but instead  the boes proved to be those f a redator 
a vey arge one .
rofesso coria ' tem ad unveiled a firs species of a rou of firce redators called gigantosaurus .
the 3 species i ths roup surpasd he fmos t. rex  terms of size 
althouh rare for repiles , caing fo the young has be bserved among rocodie for instan .
in nosaurs , this arig beaviour eolve enugh to rmnd us of bird .
tis by fema is named og tooth .
hwever sall and vulerable , and cute she may appear ow se is geticaly programe t rapdly become a 45 foot lng , eiht tonne pedato ike er mother .
in atagonia  you have the lrgest herbivore and te largest predator  livi at roughly the same perio ad in he ame territor .
here is no easy anwer .
evolution followd a number of partclar paths .
but a simpler interpretation rest on a warm clmate nd he frtile ld , with all th vegetation you cn eat .
yet anther thery els us that large hebivores hd to grow bi eou , to accmmodate a arge smach required to digest high in fibre , low n proein egeatin .
inlly  large spans of flat space oul have led aturally to argentinosaurus , as the vast seas have led to whas .
the hiest branc elog to ths who can rac hm  and may predators are oo small to b threatening in thse siuation .
she is growing fs too .
her pimitive feathes hav almost ll disapeaed .
they thrived for 180 ilon years .
this is a msae for us here .
by the way  t is more hn tie to introduce harp feathers .
h is unenlagia  a 6 foot  50 pnd ale raptor .

n pecent of these dinosaurs were found i argentina , mst of them in the lst 30 years .
through technology ou knowledge grws fster every day .
ossilisaton is a process at equires xtreml rare coditns , and even then very littl o an oganis s preserved .
we could easily conclude ta a trmdos number o species jut diappered without a race .
of couse , science fiction can e fun , but y also need  e very cefl beoe propsing a new ay of lookng at dinosaurs .
 wish  could travel in time to see these amazig creare alve .

ad at 22 years of ae , she is fl grwn .

tearing off pieces of kn and letting the large prey bed o deat  or die fro nfecton is a strateg more liely to suceed .

e 'd lost track of otis now , and h was driting farther ad farther from home .
by th tie te moon rose , t river had carried mio dep to he foest .
and he hed msterious hoots and growls an cries in th night .
he began to wish he 'd never jumped into this box and he begn to ws he was home .
it seeed to be remblin as much as he was n the chilly , misty night .
he driftd n thrugh the dakness , hpg o fin he moning waiti just aound the bend .

n my nxt amphlet i wil expose this esector of ours .
the crowning gloy of hi opus was their remarable use of static elcricity to ause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to t french roluinaris of 1790 ,

prhap you 'd ike e t tel ou what you have missed i letures thi ee ?
he woud ursue his fasinations ith just incedile derminaton .
we know from his etes hat einstein , even from the age of 16 , was literally obsesed with the nture of light .
everyon he could peak to ...
what ?
a beam o light ?
by what method do you propose to ride  ths beam f ligh ?
th method is not importat 
let us just imagine w two e youn ...
ridcule ou ?
i merely wat o t elp me t understand .
wat ould we see , do yo thin ...
with ligt he would reinvet t univse and find a hidden hway tha oul unite eerg and mass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long befoe th 19th century , scentists had ompued te spee of ligt , bt n one knew ha light actually was .
inisible lines tat can emnate fom electriity in  wre , fom  magnet or ... evn from te sun .
fo it s y cotention tht lig iself is just one frm of these ibrating lines o electroagnetism .
maxwl nd te ing faraday becme cose friend .

do n't get old .
o ,  'm ine .
oh , yes , yes .
pledid .
now  as that manetc charge moes , i crete a ttle pice of elctricy .
electricity .
lecticity and magnetism ae terwoven , like a .. a never-edng brad .
so it is lwys pusng orward .

670 milion miles per hour 
that s th peed of light !
well , at mens you re right all alng .

come with m , we 'll read mxwell nd think about the elctromagetic theory of ight !
she 's ey retty .
te sad yo ould nev cach up to a beam of light .
even if you were trveling at 670 millin miles an hour , you would still see light squiggle away from o at 670 millin mis a hour .
ye .
you see how fr her it is static 
yes .
se and te wave are tveling a h sam speed .
but rative to h , it just sits here .
so is lght ike ha ?
ommon sense would say hat f you aught up to a light eam , tere would be a wave of lght jut sittng there 
maybe it would be shimering , a b of electriciy and  bit of magntism .
 if she wa tavelin longide the light wve , it would nt be ming .
t would be static 
bt mxwell says you c n' have static liht .
mabe axw is wrng .
h lght travels frm my face t the mirror an i see my fac .
tha does n't make sense .

she was 23 wn she discovered advanced maematics .
she ethussticlly tok lesons from o of the greatest mthematicians of the day ,

i hn  hae found a connetion wen enery and mass .
if i am right , ten energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be coverted into one aoher .
einstein se hi fifth great 1905 pae for pblication .
in three aes he simply stated that energy nd mass wer connecte by the quar f the sped of light ..

i 'll aide by their fndings .
havin convened in sece session t th request of the prsident , the ommision makes th following intrm reommendations -
te public shul be nformd
that the apes  after thir arduou spac voyage

there is jusifiable cause for uspecting

m destrys man .
all we want t nd out is how apes rse .

of corse  for man , this was intolerable .
so humas took rimitive apes as pets .
