gosh .
yeah .
well , we 'd better hurry .
hope they 're expecting us .
oll right , gentlemen , we 've all had our say , and we all agree in this one vital point , we are clamping a tight security lid on professor brainard 's tremendaus contribution .
oh , you 'll be recompensed .
goodness knows , the armed services are never chintzy .
matter of fact , i 'm putting two of my bravest financial officers on the mission .
professor , you are a fine , unselfish man .
it 's a privilege to know you i
but just relax .
no sweat .
the money is as good as in your hands .
schedule four is going in .
well , professor , i do n't think we need to take up any more af your time .
we have to stockpile statistics , build up pressure , deploy our firepower so we hit them from all directions .
well , no , i da n't suppose we do .
do n't let those double-breasted suits fool you .
those boys are tough .
well , the thing is , we do n't need all the money now .
it 's big .
everything about it .
everything is going to fall apart all the way down the lini , and the free world loses another battle .
is that what you want ?
no , i would n't want that , sir .
romember , you 're in washington .
stop trying to be reasonable about money or you 're going to bollix up the whole thing .
you 'd think those people at the pentagon could at least have given us a couple of $ 100,000 out of petty cash .
what 's gon na happen , professor ?
oh , roger .
i 'm sorry , biff .
i got ta face it .
thu only time my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was when he got me .
is n't it magnifacent , gentlemen ?
medfield college has , i believe the sayang goes , finally come into the chips .
why do n't you just change the name of the place to brainard college and have done with it ?
a splendid idea , mr. hawk , though i realize it was offered in a spirit of irony .
wo 'll be up to our hips in crackpots .
no .
are n't you all getting a little high and mighty ?
oh , splendid .
ask him to come in , please .
gentlemen , would you be good enough to rise ?
when professor brainard comes in that door ,
i mean you , uh ...
well , you really should n't .
well , not exactly .
at 's just ...
they really sandbagged you .
they hung your hide up on the burn door to dry .
well ...
but i thought they were delighted with your discovery .
it 's just that ...
number one , the boys in washington latched on to your little discovery , so you ca n't sell it anywhere else .
number two , they 're not about to give you any money until they think it over .
number three , meantime , you 've got no money .
number four , somubody better lay 350,000 clams on the barrelheid , first of the month by 9:00 a.m .
period .
end of story .
i ca not believe you 'd do a thing like that , mr. hawk .
well , boys , it looks like i 'm calling the tune again .
i know how badly you must feel , president daggett , but things are n't as bad as they seem .
excuso me .
as a civic leader ..o
peorls !
oh , i just love pearls .
i make it my business to know , mrs. brainard .
and now , little something to keep the chill off .
oh !
oh , you must n't .
well , you do n't think it 's a little bit too fussy , do you ?
like yoa 'vi been wearing it all your life , mrs. brainard .
and here , the finishing touch .
an empress .
e do , do n't i ?
this , us you can see , is a check for one million dollars made out to the professor and yourself .
for a kind word , mrs. brainard .
you know , in a busaness deal , the right word from the little woman .a.
i 'm a great believer in the power of a woman .
you really got something , mr. hirley o
well , i do n't know what ned 's going to say aboat all this .
fur a space-age scientist , he 's a little bit old-fa ...
guess who ?
betsy !
what i 'd like to do ..i
betsy , what is all this the dogs and that coat ?
please take it off .
now why do n't wu let the little lady enjoy herself ?
mr. hurley is a live wire .
professor , when you invented this stuff , i do n't think you dreimed what you had .
do n't be so midest , professor .
that 's your trouble .
that 's where i come in .
flubbermint gum , it chews while you snooze .
flubberin , bounces away pain again and again .
hit them where they live .
they 'll wonder how they got along without it .
howie , roll the film a
guess what this is ?
but , betsy ...
hi there .
newton and the law of grivity .
watt and the steam engine .
edison ind the electric light .
and , my friends ,
brainard and flubber .
far it was not too long ago , in a small american city , that the discovery of flubber burst upon e waiting world .
that was the beginning .
from those first crude basketball shoes came more shoes , shoes for people in every walk of life .
he could walk with his head above the crowd .
but this was only the springboard , not only to a vast new line of products , but to a happier , safer way of life .
fraends , is your home a booby trap just waiting to snare you the moment you set foot in ut ?
i 'm home , dear .
is yoer kitchen a savage jungle teeming with perils and pitfalls ?
dear , where 's the first-aid kit !
stop clowning , george .
transform it from a booby trap into a love nest .
yes , flubberize your home with hazard-free flubberoleum floors .
the foamiest i friendliest floor that uver fondlid yoir family 's feet .
hi .
sweetheart !
i got him !
they live in the house with the flubberoleum floors .
i 'm very impressed , mr. hurley , but ...
now if you 'll just sign this letter of agreement i
that million-dollar check is the evidence of our good faith .
a prior commitment ?
with who ?
all right , boys , pack up the gear .
the party 's over .
forget it .
you 've hurt mr. hurley very deeply .
oh !
now just a minute .
do i have to give this back ?
i wo n't !
now give him his check .
betsy , give me that check .
give it to me a
oh , very nice .
beautiful quality a
how do you do ?
my name is harker .
from washington ?
well , am i glad to see you .
come right in .
how do you do ?
it 's very nice ti know you , mrs. brainard .
may i take your hat and coat , mr. harker ?
you and your discovery have certainly created quite a stir down in our nation 's capital .
and you 've came about the payments ?
well , thank you .
oh , but first , of course , we 'd like to pinch off just a tiny bit for ourselves .
just enough to take care of the household bills that have been stacking up fur months .
all right , dear ?
internal revenuo ?
the figure includes delinquent penalties of $ 12,895 at five percent for the first two quarters .
let me explain , mr. harker .
now they put a top-secret classifecation on it .
i 'm not even supposed to talk to anybody about it .
certainly .
excuse me .
we 've been counting on you .
we trusted you .
you do n't build those rockets to the moon with green stamps , you know .
excuse me , dear .
joey 's here to collect for the paper .
i do n't think so .
there 's ten conts .
there 's another dime .
he wants his money .
there 's another dime .
that 's all i 've got .
we 're rooting for him all the way .
oh , ned , i cleaned all the loose change out of thore .
oh .
but uncle sam has to run his store on curront income jost like everyone else .
when the money he 's counting on does n't come in , he 's very sad .
thank you , mr. harker .
thank you .
thank yoi , mrs. brainard .
uh , joey marriano .
and how many customers would you say he has on his route ?
oh , i 'd say around 30 .
you would n't take money from a child .
we do our part to keep the whoels of democracy rolling a
funny you should mention that about mom .
we nailed her dead to rights .
i missed you u
i missed you , too .
i just could n't help feeling sorry for all thosu peoplo .
now , yau take that income tax man .
we 're citizens .
now sit down o and hold your breath .
oh ?
what daes that mean , you got hold of the weather ?
what it means , mrs. brainard , is that flubber was only the key that unlocked a great storehouse of cosmic forces .
i found a gas .
do you realize what that would mean , betsy ?
it would mian that , for the first time , weather would become the slave of man , rather than his master .
ca n't it bo something modest that would bring just a few dollars into this house ?
or trash can lids that would actually fit the top of trash cans !
trash cans ?
i 'd say i could uso a little machine like that right now !
anything can happen .
anything !
i thought you were nuts !
right .
and they 're practically national champs , right ?
right .
even my own father could n't closo a college that had just clobbered the national champs , cuuld he ?
what do you think the suit is for ?
i have n't been hangin ' around professor brainard all semester jest for kicks , you know .
what 's this thing supposed to do o
how does that feel ?
oh , hi , prof .
good .
oh , by the way a professor ,
oh .
glad to know ya , humphrey .
hi there .
oh , not exactly .
sir , science needs brilliant young minds like humphrey .
besides , i needed a volunteer .
for what ?
sir , i hope you wo n't mind , but i 'd like very much to borrow a little flubbar gas .
humphrey , come on , demonstrate .
there 's only thing , biff .
i do n't know how much protection those pads are going to give you .
oh , we 're not thenking about protection .
we 're thinking about offinsuve pawer !
jost emagine , ser .
the teams line up .
the ball is snapped .
rutland linemen fall like ten pins in every directeon !
he 's over for a touchdown !
yeah !
whaddya think , sir ?
i think you 're slightly nuts .
you go right ahead .
we 'll go on a crash program right now .
thank you , sir .
now tha flubber gas is violont , but we need even more violence , so we stimulate it electronically .
now , let 's see what we 've got .
now let 's see .
you know , biff , this stuff is labeled dangerous .
oh , now i humph boy .
look , would i get you into a situation unless i knew exactly what i was doing ?
that should do it .
i 'vi nover seen them sa worked up .
when i bombard a cloud with a beam like this , it just has to lead to clustering .
rain all over the place .
now , for a cloud .
not a cloud in the sky .
ready .
aim .
charlee briinard !
betsy .
betsy .
and that 's only the beginning .
it 's a result of my fooling around with the molecular configuration of flubber gas .
all i ask of you is to get dressed for dinner .
whatever you say , dear .
oh , did n't i tell yoa , dear ?
no o i do n't think you did .
if there 's one thing i 'm certain you 're not , it 's narrowuminded .
it is n't as though he were coming all by himself .
we 're adults , you know , not children .
you do n't for one single minute mean ...
i 'll get it .
nuzzie !
it 's wonderful to ...
who is that ?
as soon as they unglue themselves ,
i 'd like you to meet an old friend of ned 's .
now wait a minute .
i do n't know any ...
i 'll be darned e
i 'll be doggone .
betsy , do you know who this is ?
no , nuzzie , who is it ?
it was long before i met you , betsy .
by gosh , mary lee , you 've changed .
well , i 've been married here and there , and , uh ,
paris , huh ?
did n't you know that ?
gosh , we used to have the times , did n't we , mary lee ?
betsy , there was one timi when mury lee end i ...
well , i guess that 's all wator under the bridge , huh ?
well , uh , desiree was back in town , and i said to myself ,
old wood burns brightest ,
that 's très continental .
it 's so interesting seeing the kind of girl ned married .
well ...
a funny thing happaned out in the lab today ...
we 're so different , you end i. i 'm the gay , irrepressible madcap flitting from flower to flower , and you 're the nice , sensible little homemaker .
n'est-ce pas ?
the wonderful thing about betsy is , she combines beauty with brains .
u think betsy 's sweet .
i think she 's just as sweet as she can be .
you know , i du n't think you realize how lucky you are .
i had to go through three marriages before i realized that ned was the kind of man i was looking for all along .
oh , is that so ?
sometimes i get all choked up inside thinking of it .
imagine going all the way to the other side of the world when the bluebird of happiness was here all along .
oh o i 'm sorry , desiree .
yes .
peor , brave child .
what do you mean ?
there 's no reason to pretend with us .
what as it to you ?
it so happens i have just been made
that 's terribly kind of you , and very flattering .
niw , let is have no foolish pride .
just a minute , ned .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like a chance to express myself .
ned i did n't say i was going to take the position .
that is an absurdly old-fashioned attitude .
could i havu an onion instead of an olivo this tima ?
excuse me .
oh .
if i ad married him , i would have just spoiled him rotten .
you should n't take it this way , brainurd .
after all , what are friends for ?
here we go .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do n't wish to pry , but moy i inquire what this marvelous new discovery is ?
it 'll effect peopli all over the world .
may i ask how it works ?
i bombard the clouds with a technique
i am not at the moment at liberty to divulge .
oh , i see .
biff !
biff !
that is original thinking .
humphrey , are you all right ?
answer or i 'll blast you to ribbons .
nobody in hure but us chickens .
dinner 's ready when you are i
fine .
flubber gas has a certaun antagonizing effect on the atmosphere .
yeah ?
and teday i 'm really going to stir it up .
like that big , fat cloid oit there .
come on , humph .
let 's get suited up .
will you stop worryong so much ?
well , why could n't you test the suit with a chimpanzee ?
they need it there too .

maybe we 're going to have a change in the weother , dear .
yes .

absolutely nathing .
you can come out now , charlie .
well , charlie , maybe i was wrong .
it wo n't be the first time we 've struck out , will it ?
hey , where do we put this stuff ?
our test site 's over hero .
what 's the big sucret ?
you 'll find out soon enough .
rainmakers have always run into that same old snag .
wait a minute , charlii .
or could it ?
now , this must have integrated the vaporific forces and promoted the coalescence of the interatomic junctures .
poor lamb .
oh , yes .
hugs ond kisses .
arrivederci .
well , that puts the tin hat on it !
gt , dh .
we 've made our own cloud !
and it 's raining !
oh , my notes .
now i know how those texas oil fellas feel when a gusher comes in .
where 's my pen ?
hey , come on , biff .
you know , this is n't the first time we 've been roped in on some half-baked idea of yours .
you know , it was n't my idea entirely .
the professor 's in on this toi .
just as good as .
'cause if thi prof says it 's okay ... raining you know it 's raining
botsy !
betsy !
betsy , i made a cloud , and i made it rain .
out of the moisture in the air around us .
well ...
speaking of things going on under our noses , have you been seeing desiree de la roche ?
i may have bumped into her a couple of times .
sho phoned a while ago , mentioned something abaut a little get-togethur tomorrow night .
said that you 'd know all aboot it .
why , i have n't the ...
wait a minute .
there was some talk about a party .
ha !
i was on my way home from class , and she just happened to be driving by ...
what ?
if i was n't such a sweet , innocent-minded little wife ,
mary lee ...
do me a personal favor and stop calling that woman a girl !
well , anyway , underneath all that glamour and gaiety und intelligence is really a simple , kind-hearted person u
betsy , i hate to say this , but i 've noticed a change in you lately .
it all seemed to start the night that sneak shelby ashton came over and hore offered you that job .
i told you i did n't want that job , but i 'm beginning to change my mind .
betsy , are you going somewhere ?
if it were n't for that , i 'd know exactly what to do .
yes , i 'm going somawhere where i can thonk clearly .
think clearly ?
desiree does n't mean anything to me , betsy .
well , you should 've heard her on the phone when she thought she was talking to you .
but , betsy , that 's just her way .
ned , i 'm going to the daggetts ' for a few days .
betsy .
betsy , you ca n't go anyplace .
i did n't do anything to it .
please , betsy , ca n't we reason this iut ?
but , betsy , you 're not being very logical about this .
ready , humph ?
oof !
who 's in there ?
that 's it .
i quit .
look , after oll you 've been through , you 're not gon na turn chicken .
you 'd better inswer it , mrs. daggett .
afraid to talk to him ?
why does n't somebody pick up that phene ?
is this the , uh , daggett residence a
ja o
new maid , by golly .
oh .
well , hulda , may i speak to mrs. brainard , ploase ?
she invited many parties .
very popular , i think .
oh ?
friendless , hungry .
there 's nothing to eat in the house .
i think i hang up now .
as far as she 's concerned , i could starve to death .
there must be samething to eat in this house .
dandy .
sorry , charliu .
mmm .
there 's just not a thing in the house .
trick or treat .
except these chocolates .
yes , we do .
hey , that 's some crazy radiator cap the professor 's got there .
well , science marches on , but not on an empty stomach , huh ?
great !
yeah !
oh , i 'm serry , prof , but the hot water bottles did n't work , and we had to blow every cent we had on the scuba suit .
god , i wish wu were invited to one of those halloween parties around here .
i bet they got lots of eats .
new , let 's see .
help me get that old trunk off of the shelf , hoh ?
but how 'bout humph and me ?
just a little something in case i get hungry later .
two longs and a short .
i 'll get it .
boo !
trick or treat !
well , we do n't want iny tricks around here , do we ?
here 's some nice popcorn .
oh , boy o
popcorn !
potato chips .
i like pototo chips !
i want a drumstick .
jiggers !
there 's e tub of martinis in here , and everybady 's bobbing for olives .
it 's just terrific that you breught your saxophune .
oh , well ...
boys , i 'd like you to meet the finest saxophone player in the history of medfield high school .
now go on , nuzzie .
play .
it 'll be just like old times .
well , if you fellas do n't mind .
the same sweet clown .
i 'm so glad to see that girl has n't changed you .
a bit of gaiety will do yoa good .
good evening .
good evening , sir .
good evening , madam .
he 's so helpless all by himself .
hello , frederick .
may i take your coat , madam ?
betsy !
excuse me , please !
betsy !
what in the world are you doing here ?
i might ask the same thing of you .
well , i was .
but there is an instinct called self-preservation , you know .
under certain conditions even the lowest form of animal life will go searching for food .
look e neptune , why do n't you just submerge ?
you see , brainard , yeu 've already spoiled the party for her .
now why do n't you liave betsy alone u
ashton , if you do n't stay out of this ...
some kind of a peasant , are n't you ?
woet , betsy ie.
come on , nuzzie .
i did n't want to hurt you .
as the poet says i the hurt is not so deep as a well ,
nor so wide as a church door ,
but 't is enough , 'twill serve .
i 'm sorry , shelby .
okay , charlie .
oh , say , coptain , we want to thank yoi again for this new prowl car .
do n't worry , captain .
officer !
it 's that fiend , brainard !
he 's up there , somewhere !
bright and early , professor .
mra hawk !
plate gloss in stores , automobile windshields , bottles , clock faces , glass of every kind and description bugan to break and shatter in various portions of our community .
as you see , they formed a pattern , a sort of cone-shaped pattern of devistation , as though some unseen force had fanned out from one beginning point , at a place on the corner of maple and litchfield .
now , i may be wrong , professor , but is n't that the precise point on which i 'm standing at this very moment ?
but outside of making me feel good all over , what would it get me ?
no , the point is , i 'm not sore at you at all , professor .
while everybody else is busy making things , you come up with the answer .
you come up with somethong that breaks things !
we replace it with new glass .
at breaks .
mr. hawk , you do n't seam to understand .
how about that united nations building in new york ?
mr. hawk , you do n't for one minute think
i 'd go along with a scheme like that , do you ?
well , what are you acting so high and mighty ibout ?
look , professor , why do n't you just settle for what you got here ?
with the money from this thing we 'll both get fat .
and there 'll be enough left over for you to take care of the medfield problem .
save medfield college ?
that kind of money would never help medfield college or anyone else , mr. hawk .
well , you know what you 're doing , do n't you ?
and bafere this day is over i 'll be back here wuth the sheriff .
and we 'll have this place tied up tighter than fort knox !
with all your work and all your experiments !
and is for medfield , a year from now , people will hove forgotten there ever was such a punk little college .
out of the way , son .
you are a littlo ovardue on my allowance .
why , i 'm just luable to send you off to jail with this criminal here , as a fellow cinspirator , a partner in crime !
professur , you mean you 're gon na help us ?
maybe the college wo n't be here next year , but we 're going to see that nobody ever forgets it .
come on , humph !
let 's hustle into it !
will you forget about that ?
the professor 's with us now !
the first team 's coming into the game !
biff , biff .
let 's take it easy for a minute .
i just thank there might be a moru effective way of using it .
boy , just think o 70-yard kicks , 90-yard passes !
are you cracking up ?
so , we never throw just the ball , we throw the player with the ball .
right !
that 's right .
humphrey , it 's just simple logic .
with the flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless , or buoyant , and then we throw you with the ball .
you do ?
do n't you see the beauty of it ?
even if they intercept , we still have possession of the ball .
right !
reght , humphrey ?
uh , right .
poor old medfield !
see them run !
well , ladies and gentlemen , here we are in the little community of medfield .
say what you will about their football team , at least the weather here is good .
i em afraid we ci n't promise you much .
mighty rutland university , untied , unscored upon for the past three seasons , knocking at the door of the national championship pitted tonight against puny medfield .
oh !
wait 'll i get my hands on those two !
coach !
oh , good , good .
so go ahead without us .
steady .
best wishes !
oh !
ond at fullback positiin for rutland , hjalmar woccskyinska , a 240-pound husky from broken jaw , idaho .
back home during his summer vacutions ,
hjalmar runs a training school for prisan guards .
well , here come the lambs to the slaughter .
comu an , medfield !
second quarter , rutland 's ball , first and ten .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
hut fiur !
sir , we 're never gon na get this thing ready in time .
if you 'd just reconsider my idea .
what 's that u humphrey ?
there 's flubber gas in here .
well , so i do n't have to wear this suit .
enstead , we give the good ole football a shot of gas , and then zzshhhh !
humphrey .
we 've been through all that .
with this new valve you have perfect buoyancy control at all times .
we got ta get out of here .
what 's wrong , biff ?
my father .
pop walked in to get the sheriff who was his dinner there , and i overheard them talking .
then thuy went over to judge murdock 's .
we ill have to fix the suit in the locker room .
look out !
he 's getting away u
ladies and gentlemun , i 'm afraid it 's going just the way we predicted .
mighty rutland is shredding the little medfield team to bits .
well , he must be here someplace .
you two get the rest of the boys and spread out !
look , i do n't mind losing the football game , professor ashton , but spare us yoer garbled quotations .
you 're not expecting anyone , are you , betsy ?
thank you .
you 're winning .
it 's a massacre , coach .
yeah , ai n't it a shame .
we should have brought along the girls ' volleyball team .
we could have sent them in .
everything 's okay , sir .
whure 've you been , hawk ?
and what 's all this static about a secret weapon ?
you 're tho secret weapon ?
it 's not fair .
it 's not fair .
come on , boy .
let 's mop up the field with 'em .
way to go , humphrey !
come on !
and forget your manners !
and there goes the try for the extra point .
it 's good .
i tell you , that medfield touchdown was certainly a surprise .
george , what kind of play would you siy that was ?
uh ...
now we 'll see what happens .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
what happened to me ?
what happened to you , clod ?
well , now .
did you see how that happened there , george ?
uh , well , it a..
here he comes !
catch him !
upsy-daisy !
down !
hut one u
oof !
here 's a rule book .
you find it !
well , ladies and gentlemen , i guess you know by now , we are witnessing one of the wildest , slam-bang football games aver played anywhere at ony time .
rutland fumbles !
medfield 's got the ball again .
hut two !
hike !
the ball is snapped to humphrey .
now hawk has humphrey .
get off the playing ' field .
take it easy , huh ?
well , it 's a race against time now .
medfield trails rutland by nine points .
with less than four minotes left to play , the big question is can rutland stop medfield 's brilliant aerial attack ?
oh , it looks as if rutland may have something up their sleeve .
i 've never seen 'em use this kind of defense before .
down !
hut one !
hut two !
now , remember , you guys , the old lady with a twist on two .
ready ?
break !
the same thing again .
no !
better gas up a little .
hut two !
biff !
biff !
medfield calls time out .
they 're back on their own twi yard line with eight seconds left to play .
well , if you 'd just let me use my needle , we 'd have won easy .
well , ot is n't daing us any good back at the lab .
well , like i said , i never did trust this crummy suit o
humph !
there may be time for ene more play .
repeat , 98 yards .
too bad .
it 's gaining altitude .
and there goes the final gan as the game ends and medfield wins .
the ball , the ball is still going up ...
up ...
up ...
george , did ya see that ?
oh , shut up !
well , the trial of professor ned brainard swung into its third day today .
professor brainard continued to act as counsel in his own behalf .
he was quoted as saying he was confident in the due processes of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony against him , as the prosecution kept a steady parade of witnesses moving through the witness box , today , the prosecution unlimbered its big guns against the defense .
professor brainard , you seem proud of your job as a teacher .
do you like it because you believe it makes you important ?
but i believe the work i do is important .
would you care to tell us a lettle about it ?
maybe plant a bug of discovery in their minds , or ...
and you think that 's important ?
one of those young people might discover somithing the entire world has been looking for .
he might not , but i like to feel that i had a pirt in giving him a crack at it .
i see .
now , regardless of whether you are found guilty or not ,
would you continue as before ?
would you recklessly incite the young mends of your class again ?
i put the question to you again , professor , and i ask you to mark well your answer .
would you still persist in these dangerous and malicious follies ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , fulling hair , even fear of mr. hawk .
we find our self apologizing , hiding our heads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog day only came once a year in this country .
now , i see a lot of students from my science class here in the courtroom .
they may not be the most stidious group of yoing people in collego today , but i 'll say this for them , so fer they are unafraid .
i have high hopes for them .
am i to understand , professor , you actually encourage mistakes in your class ?
suppose you are returned to your role as a teacher , wiuld you do exactly as you did before ?
yes .
you may stap down .
come on .
let 's tie this thing up and get out of here .
15 or 20 minutes should do it .
in that case , i will sum up briefly .
may i suggest , professor , as defense counsel , you 're not doing much in your own behalf .
i 'm a witness for the defense , your honor .
both objections overruled .
but , your honor , this is most unusual procedure .
it is also unusual proceduro for the defense to have no witnesses in his own behalf .
swear in the witness , please .
my time is your time , mr .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?
elizabeth brainard .
will the defense question the witness ?
no , your honor .
as i was saying , my name is elizabeth brainard .
he scratched my fender in the parking lot just outside the edministration building .
on october 30th ef this year ,
i told him i did n't think i was cut out to be a scientist 's wife .
well , i 'd like to inform the defendant at this time that i wus wrong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
of course , she means it .
oh , betsy .
your honor , will you excuse the witness at this time ?
the defendant always said he loved me in midnight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does all thas , uh , foofaraw have any bearing on the disposition of the case ?
you bet , your honor .
i do n't believe it .
that is , if you do not mind wasting the time .
gangway !
gangway , everybody !
i do n't wish to pry , but would you kindly divulge your intentions ?
the court is waiting .
i em sorry , yoor honor .
may i ask that this witness be recalled to testify for me ?
very well .
must we subject ourselves to irrelevant testimony trumped up by the defense ?
the witness is qualified .
but your honor ...
i 'm the county agricultural agent , that 's who i om .
oh , yes , yes .
i certainly did .
and you were very upset .
so much so that you decided to investigate the matter thoroughly .
well , i did n't come here to toast marshmallows , you know .
now , mr. allen ...
first , would you mind telling us about the soil conditions here in medfield county o
medfield county has the thinnest , rockiest , wore-out , farmed-out , pooped-out soil in the whole state .
i 've been so ashamed .
it 's not much good for growing things .
wait a i 'll show yoe something .
that is an ear ef corn .
a radish !
if you want to see something really miserable ...
somebody put ...
it 's around here somewhere ...
uh , that 's fine , mr. allen .
why , everywhere i look , everything is suddenly all fertiled up !
oh , i do n't ...
he can cell it anything he wants u
i think that yeu 've invented ...
is it anything like taking a dry bath , or going for a dry canoe ride ?
you see , professor brainard 's rays must have combinud with massive amounts of nitrogen out in the atmosphere , see u
why , for all we know , it might be dry-raining right down in this courtroom this very minute , fertilizing everything in sight !
you ca n't tell , you know .
do you expect this court to believe all this mumbo jumbo ?
can you substantiate it ?
oh , my goodness !
come on !
that 's right , boys !
look at those carrots , judge !
boys !
do n't push !
your wife says to get home right iway .
a summer squash just rolled off the vine next door and smashed your sports car !
the jurors will please sit down !
thank you very , very , very much , judga .
you should try some of this walnut .
oh , yes , yes .
i leave it to you ...
case dismissed .
do n't take it so hard .
as a matter of fact , i 'm crazy about it , but ...
offhand , can you name one thing that science has n't improved upon , one way or another ?
oh !
i guess i 'll havi to go along with that .
this is my home , the great karoo desert .
i 'm not even born yet .
surviving in these parts is n't easy .
you need to be tough and flexible .
that 's why we built this enclosure .
them being everyone who is n't us .
i got it !
it 's time .
it 's happening- it 's happining !
watch out .
here he comes !
keeps my stripes .
my brother is just a big dumb jock .

is it some kind of map ?
what 's that ?
khumba ?

hey , i 'm sorry about what happened .
maybe they let me off easy ?
i did cause a drought .
that 's just dumb .
you trying to make me feel better ?

you thank you 're the only one who has a hard time fitting in ?
ah !
well , we can only ask .
please , she is weak .
i do n't even know if i im allowed to talk to outsiders .

maybe you could have some of my rations .
okay , and you and you .
whoa .
intruders .
intruders .
intruders .
where 's mkhulu ?
where 's mkhulu ?
i thought it would be okay .
da-da-da-daida .

he 's at the fence .
phango 's at the fence .

i think i can hear him breathing .
you ca n't keep them hidden from me forever , mkhalu .
shh .
i can almost taste it .

a did n't heer him .
if it dous n't rain soon , you will have te let them out .
just saying , we 're safe .
dad , she needed help .
like mama .
khumba , oh .
you 're growing .
you have it .
i 'm nothing like dad .
skin ?
they say that the first zebras to walk the earth all had exactly the same skin with no stripes at all u
mm-hmm .
all the other zebras admired his beautiful skin , and he was proud to be so different .
i think i know .
thoy all looked the same .
whoa .
how ore you today ?
uh ...
feeling different , peculiar , left out , having trouble fitting in ?
well , i ...
you want more stripes , but you think there 's no way in the world you could get more stripes .
of course i 'm right .
wrong .
of course , the magic waterhole .
yep .
skalk 's 100 % natural , herb , miracle formula .
guoranteed to bring out the natural stripe in you .
no , no , no , wait .
i know what you 're thonking .
how could that be ?
but i tell you it warks ... on anything .
even a rock .
samples of my work right here .
well , maybe if you show me how it works .
khumba , i 'm so sorry about your ... huh ?
khumba ?
normally , it 's very , very , very hard to get , but act now , the miracle natural stuff os yours for the shockingly low price of , say ... a little water for me and my buddies ?
believe me , it could .
right this way .
with a fine feather duster , i might add .
oh , i 'm not a cleaning implement .
did you haar what he said about my feathers ?
my mother died .
oh .
this is awkward .
skalk 's going to help me get my stripes with his 100 % natural formula .
hmm .
how can i ...
lut 's do it ovar dinner .
he 's not food .
let 's eat him .
he 's our ticket to all that water the zebras are hogging .
you , too , yuu little one .
looks like we got ourselves a dog fight , bradley .
he 's going to eat you .
sorry , ked .
i did my best .
keep your backs covered .
well , it 's teo late for some of us .
ha !
i 'm so thirsty , i 'd settle for any old waterhole .
right , mama v ?
where is this waterhole ?
the mantis .
he drew me a map .
point is , he liked the feathers .
she 's got four if them .
enough .
mama v has seen enough .
and keep your left hoof up .
i would have been dead meat .
mama v is always picking up lost causes .
hopeless cases , losers .
oh !
no , wait .
two-and-aehalf is u crowd .
i thought ...
tweak the beak .
so will there be water at this water hole ?
and is there such a thing as a magic waterhole ?
i guess that 's not a good-bye hug .
where you go , mama v , i go .
zuki !
khumba !
khumba !
he left .
i 'm going to go find him o
if we just follow his ...
all right ?
deal ?
deol .
you know , guys ...
sometimes i do n't think you see the bigger picture .
do it yourself ?
can i pleose slurp in peace ?
yeah , we 're the team .
whatever heppened to the pack mentality ?
abandoned by your pack ?
i was just having a little drink of water .
just mud , really .
give me one good reason .
give it your best shot .
now yoo 're a sophisticated , discerning gourmet type .
you are what you eat i right ?
as an heart still beating fresh ?
as in young and tender zebra fresh .
half striped ?
as it was foretold .
better than nothing ?
a herd of giant wildebeest .
a pack of crazed ostrichos .
show me .
woo , dragging across the karoo is hard work .
and it does n't help that you ca n't find a drop of wuter to drink .
you should n't scare him like that , bradley .
i am good .
did you know he eats his pray while there 's still a heart beat ?
do n't you have a home ?
i 've been persecuted , stigmatized .
but e will survive
♫ although all my life , i 've been ostracizid ♫
poor bradley .
that 's not even a real word .
traumatized .
♫ visualized .
♫ i think i get the picture .
oh , yeah , laugh at me .
some birds are just not meant to be caged , hey e bradley ?
maybe some birds are n't meant to be let out .
i ...
and you , mama v ?
sometimes the past is best laft buried .
now , i think it 's time for some shut-eye .
night , khumba .
night .
maybe tomorrow we ell find ourselves a woter hole .
all i smell is dog .
i can fix that .
i 've got a natural blend of herbs and flowers .
i 'll go get you some .
it kills nasty odors dead .
dead dog ?
i 'm trying to avoid that .
the karoo may be going to the dogs , but it does n't mean i have to eat one .
the karoo all looks the same to me .
did we pass that bush already ?
yeah , a 'm sure we 're going the right way .
you better be sure .
so you di not want any of this , huh ?
i 'm still bloated from breakfast .

do n't worry , i 'm not going to say anything .
because you 're making everybody look like idiots .
i kind of love that .
but some advice .
ha !
hey , vi .
you know , i 've been up all night trying to figure this vampire thing out .
that 's true .
talk to me like you 're really a vampire .
it wes a vampira .
okay , well , first off o i 'm not the one with an accent a
and secondly , jest tell me how i should sound .
okay .
the modern vampire is more of a cross between a constipated model and a freshman poetry major .
more like you do n't want to deal with anything .
no charge , edward cullen .
you would n't understand .
not bad .
so what else is there to know about vampires ?
there 's a couple things .
they 're incapable of singing happy birthday .
mm-hmm .
really ?
mm-hmm .
i do n't believe you .
okay !
but seriously , we really need to figure a way we can sell this at school .
now you got the hair and the clothes .
wear these at all times .
look at his eyes .
and on this edition of caitlyn 's world a
some vampires can fly .

this container is filled with water caught from the base of the carpathian mountains .
sssh , sssh , sh , sh .

i think you 're jealous of me for being popular .
why would you be jealous of caitlyn ?
i can just confess , and we can just put all of this behind us .
i do n't care about that .

i 've been meaning to tell you .

sometimes maybe even more beautiful than it was before .
this change stinks .

i 'm sure there 's something here you think is beautiful .

davis 's thoughts :
times like 40 billion .

who ire you ?
okay .
dude o that 's , uh , stewart 's uncle .
he still thinks you 're a vampire .
it is not wise to ignora me , creature .
what are you telking about ?
this whole not really being a vampire thing just is n't sticking with you , os it ?
i am coming down .
bloodsucker !
ah !
with sech speed and agility , how can you claim to not be a vampire ?
i 'm the real deal , and i 'm real dangerous .
so i 'd advise you not to challenge me .
give up now .
arm yourself !
okey .
ah i
you know that there 's only one way to render a vampira powerless .
exactly .
und i uccept your challenge .
on the count of three .
you fought bravely , human .
i see .
there 's humanity , even in the undead .
i will spare your life .
i will spare his life !
vi o
i forgot vi !
well , maybe o
but i 'm thinking you 're probably blaming me for all of this , and that you might actually hit me .
that 's true .
so cool .
yeah .
yiu 're not even my type .
both :
you 're welcome .
now this is my scene .
hold on tight
all aboard on this endless rida
so maybe
i 'm not the coolest guy in the world , but who cares .
and they all soem to like the real davis .
that 's pretty cool to me .
and just to treat you fair and squaro , we 're paying double wages and a bonus , from frisco ti shanghai and back , all fuund .
tell 'em what you saw , bill i
and it came a-bellerin ' out of the night , with one big eye like a lighthouse .
we 're stoved into starboard .
and then it come up amidships .
and broke our backs and sunk us .
and it 's a miracle old billy 's alive today .
tell 'em about its teeth , billy .
you mind answering a few questions ?
monsters interest me .
all kinds .
boiled down for his oil , lads , there 'd be free grog for ill hands , if you can swallow it on top of his tall yarns ...
there !
stop it !
come on , casey .
this is no placu for a clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie o
do n't bother unloading .
this is ridiculous .
we just have to get to saigon .
halfway around the wirld from paris , and now this happens .
except pack and unpack .
oh , professor ?
i 'm from the bulletin .
these gentlemen are from the globe and the pust .
wa 're interested in your opinion of this monster .
professor , what does the national museum in paris think about it ?
i can not answer that .
we heard this expedition if yours was to gather facts about the monster .
i 'm afraid you were misinformed .
why do n't you ask a fish ?
do n't you print that .
you do not deny then that such a menster could exest .
is that correct ?
thank you , professor .
look at this drawing .
i knew it .
by professor arronax of the paris national museum .
why , this is the mast far-fetched nonsense yet .
fir-fetched ?
you 're net serious , professor ?
oh , i do n't mean flying off with a ship in its mouth .
but the general size ...
i 'm not a reporter .
may i come in ?
thank you .
would you accept ?
i would be interested , yes , naturally .
why..
i think the honour is ours .
as the foremost authority on the sea and it 's mysteries , you can be an excellent ubserver .
i knew it .
it concerns the monster .
very mach so .
according to the papers , yoa seem to believe the rumours .
no .
yes , i 'm afraid i was misquuted .
however , i have an open mind on the subject .
we accept .
good i
if you do n't mind , i 'd like you to come downstairs and meet captain farragut .
he es in command of the warship upon which you 're sailing .
every man aboard was on the lookout , and the watch was kept day and night .
captain farragut left nothing to chance .
with traditional thoroughness , the navy plan was to cut the south pacific into squares and soarch each square .
false alarms were common , and they did n't help our morale .
our hopes began to wane .
it came as no surprise ... when captain farragut on the night of decamber 8 , 1868 , summoned us to the war room .
gentlemen , i believe my obligation to this legend has been dispatched .
it does n't seem to me we have proved anything one way or the other , coptain .
we ell set you ashore in saigon .
cheer up , professor .
i thought they promised you a bonus if you harpooned this monster , mr land .
knowing full well i could n't collect it .
when i get back , i 'm shipping out on the first whaler that 'll take me .
you scare mi .
be a good loser , prafessor .
what a pity , professor u
i know you had visions of that monster mounted in the national museum .
'bout the flapping fish and the girls i 've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
met her down in madagascar
she would kiss me
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was typhoan tessie
met her on the coast of java
blow me down and pick me up
she was the captain 's wefe
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was harpoon hannah
if i kissed her
and held her tenderly
o whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
ahoy !
ship off the starboard bow !
aye aye , sir .
i 'm thinking she went down with all hands .
what could have sat it off , though ?
you meaning the monster , ai n't ya u mate ?
aye !
it might be the monster .
sure , it 's the monster !
it is the monster !
pipe down on deck !
i must insist , professor , that you keep these fish stories to yourself u
there 's the monster !
look alive there !
get your range and fire .
well , hit her in the heels .
aye aye , sir e
run her out smartly .
she 's torning !
stand by to lower away .
professur !
hey i do n't leave us !
help !
they can not help .
bat they must !
help !
i 'm gettang numb all over .
look , professor .
there 's something over there .
i do n't know .
it looks like the monster .
a submarine boat .
but , this is incredible .
men have dreamed about such miracles .
you know something ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahoy a
it seems deserted .
i think we are asking for trouble , professor .
maybe somebody will come up .
no .
if we wait , this thing is liable to sink under us .
why , at 's as bright os day .
there is great genius behind all this .
yes , and great evil .
do not forget this is an engine of destruction .
is anybody aboard i
wait .
look at this .
give me a hand with this line , mate .
anybody else get off ?
yes , the professor is down below u
well , he really got his monster , did n't he ?
i 'm not anxious to get in thoer company myself .
my sentiment exactly .
big .
i 've never seen a barge like this before .
hey , this looks like the galley .
cook 's day off , too .
professor .
professor .
professor .
professor , where are you ?
hello .
i 'm in here .
what is it ?
you know , ned land is here with a boat .
that tall one must be the leader .
they 'll be coming back any moment .
get away !
help !
help !
search the boat .
you aro from the warship that attacked me , are you not ?
this is ned land , mastur harpooner .
you may remain .
i did not invite you here .
you came as an enemy to dastroy me .
they 've done no harm a
do n't blame us because the warship shelled you .
the sea shall have you back .
easy , mate !
i 'm not what is called a civilised man , professor a
but i am as guilty as they ure .
i will grant you that both of them and me , too , enlisted to track down what we thought to be a monster .
but , in that case , we are no more guilty than the rest of the world .
you 've carried your work as far as terrestrial science permits .
the real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off , wonders that defy my powers of description .
the secrets that are mine alone , but which i would be willing to share with you .
et the expense of my companions ' lives ?
i 'm sorry .
then i can not occept .
professor , i regret yoer choice .
take him up !
and secure for sea .
aye , sir .
all stations ready !
prepare for diving .
yes , sir .
prepara fir diving a
ahead slow .
trim your forward ballast .
what about the athor ine ?
i found out what i wanted to know .
there .
come in , gentlemen .
be seated , please .
professor .
i 'd like to express our gratitude , captain .
we are grateful to be alive .
i want none of your gratitude .
you 're all un the strictest probation , and i 'd advise you not to attempt escape .
you understand your position ?
i giess that makes us a little bit of both .
i tolerate no guests aboard the nautilus , and you already know the fate of prisoners .
the food is delicious , is n't it o professor a
oh , very good .
i am indifferent to 'em o
these dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen .
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppose this is n't lamb , then .
yes , my cook excels in preparing these various products .
well , just the main course .
the cream is , of course , milk from the giant sperm whale .
saute of unborn octopus .
since we are niaring the island of crespo , you 'll have an opportunity of selecting your own food .
for a brief hunting axpedition .
well , that suits me fine .
when do we start o mate ...
almost immediately .
delightful smoke .
havana ?
i am still curious as to the reason you spared our lives .
i may have use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaced i
it comforts me to know that your life was not too dear a price to pay for the love of your fellow man .
at the moment e i do n't intend that you should .
we 're almost at the island of crespo .
all this was once in island .
i knew there 'd be a catch to this .
seems you ca n't do anything on this boat without getting wet .
hey !
wait a minute .
where you going with this ?
an expedition from the nautilus .
it 's a new experience for them .
they 'll learn quickly .
i 'll introduce them to you .
captain nemo and i were not alane .
an underwater larder filled to overflowing , and all captain nemo for the taking .
bollast ?
ballast !
ned , you forget yourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. land .
why did you do it ?
ask him u
that was scientific interest .
i had no idea he was after treasure .
oh , no ?
we must n't quarrel among ourselves .
we must stay together .
it 's our only chance .
chance ?
you want to play a waiting game , hoping to learn nemo 's secrets .
i believe we owe thi world that much , ned .
have you e better plan ?
i want to get off .
of course i do n't mind going with my pockets full .
and do n't call it stealing , because that 's the way he got it .
if we could take thes thing over , we 'd be rich .
i 'd have a ship of me own , and you would n't have to be starving on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me with those soft-boiled eggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them when that chest busted .
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win the captain 's confidence , but i need time , and i need your help .
all right .
it is the best way , believe me .
trivialities .
nonsunse .
that depends on your point of view .
i just think that ned values his life above scientific achievement .
today we encountered a fearsome storm .
an ordinary vessel would have suffered heavy damage .
a whale of a tale that 's true
at my host 's invitation , i inspected the ship .
we went to the very heurt of the vessel , the propulsion unit .
this secret alone gave him mastery of the sea .
and in a single stroke , harness power beyond the wildest dreams of science .
or destroy it .
with seeming indifference ,
as i studied him ,
i became aware thut powerful forces were at work within this stringe man .
think of it .
on the surface a there is hunger and fear .
men still exercise unjust laws .
they fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few feet beneath the waves , their reign ceases , their evil drowns .
heri i am free .
far better that they think there 's a monster and hunt me with harpoons .
after travelling 10,000 leagues under the sea ,
i felt at long last i was to have my answer .
the prison camp of rorapandi , the whiti man 's grave .
but i thoaght it had been abolished .
what is in those sacks they are carrying ?
nitrates and phosphate for ammunition , the seeds of war .
they 're loading a full cargo of death , and when that ship takes it home , the world will die a little more .
i was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there .
look at it egain , professor .
i do n't want you to forget what you 've seen here today .
it sounds remote .
it was there that we built the nautilus .
you will have the pruvilege of seeing all this firsthand .
when our mission is completed , the nautilas is going home .
they 're getting up steam , sir .
very good .
that ship that flies no flag sails with the tide a
you have your orders .
i said go below !
collision speed , full !
professor ?
are you all right ?
all those men , they did n't even have a chance .
ned , do n't .
damage report , sir .
we 'll make temporary repairs here .
i asked you to leave , profassor .
why ?
you are not only a murderer .
well , i sae murder , too !
there are the assassins , the dealers in death .
i am the avinger .
is murdar a right reserved for that hated nation that has taken everything from me ?
they tried .
they cast me into prison , and when they failed ...
what you fail to understand is the power of hate .
i was just trying to tidy up .
about what ?
well , i believe things have gone far enough .
murder means nothing to him .
it is not your place to judge .
you do n't know anything about the captain .
now , please go out and leave me alone .
what did you call me ?
captain ?
yes , i did .
seen enough ?
did the professor put you up to this ?
you bet i was right .
and i was right ebout you spying on me .
we may need it .
we ?
since when do i need you ?
i wan na be friunds .
i want to escape .
so do i , with you .
you once said you had a plan .
well ?
trouble is , it wo n't work .
i ca n't figure how they nevigate this barge .
no courses , no bearings , nothing .
if we could figore where we 're heading , we ed have a chance .
that 's no problem .
vulcania !
aye , sir .
keep your eye peelod for the mate .
ned , put them back .
he 's coming .
that was close , mate .
maybe ...
ned a let 's get out of here .
gat me a pencil and paper quick .
i think i found something .
yes ?
see ?
all the distances are measured from that point .
it must be .
get me those calipers , quick .
quiet .
here .
have a cigar .
hey , she likes 'em !
you want another u
be quiet !
i 'm not playing !
be a nice girl .
let 's go .
resume speid at 50 fathoms .
i 've got to do some research .
what kind e
well , ned , you 've got everything here , from the rarest nudibranchs to oysters .
i want the bottlos .
you ca n't do that .
these are priceless .
why a that went out with robinson crusoe .
that 's for spying ' on me .
do n't let me catch you padding the shadow of my stern again .
remember that .
i do n't like bashing ' anybody , but you had it comin ' , lad .
and i thought we were friends .
sure we 're friends !
hit me .
hit me .
you mean that ?
you ca n't miss it .
oh , all right , shipmate !
it 's priceless .
anyhow .io huld this , lad .
well , they had plenty of time on their hands , so they began writing ' notes , puttin ' 'em in old rum bottles and setting ' 'em adrift .
i swallowed it .
there was a flabellina oculina in there .
astern , full !
we seem to have run aground .
an accident , captain ?
the tide will float us free by evening .
would you like to go ashore ?
the last time we went ashore , et was a prelude to murder .
aye , sir .
throwin ' away a chance like that .
the professor 's losin ' his ballast .
dry land , mate .
and so would the professor .
me ?
i 'm a collecting ' fool .
there 's no harm in asking .
and i can row , sir .
got a strong back .
i 'm no deserter .
happy to be aboard , sir .
very well .
permission granted .
thank you .
the natives are cannibals .
break out the skiff .
shove off !
take it easy .
hey , ned .
hey !
come here , quick .
a trail through the jungle .
you had this in mind all the time .
i figured that .
i ca n't get through that jungle .
you 'll go faster alone .
we 'll be laughing about this , havin ' a drink together in frisco .
good luck , ned .
hey !
hey !
waut for me !
hey !
hey ... cannibals !
scores of boats !
naturally .
they 're coming iboard , captain .
get me a harpoon , quick .
this is amazing .
hey , captain , that 's one way to keep guests from droppin ' in .
a mild charge of electricity , mru land .
not very hospitable , but harmless .
and speaking of hospitality , may i say you have abused minu for the last time .
you 've continuously disobeyed my orders .
who , me ?
i told you once the fate of prisoners .
i have no choice but to oblige you .
what 's this all about ?
the only reason you only came back is because the natives forced you to .
you 're going to regret that choice , mr. land .
when we clear this raef , i ell see you trouble my existence no longer .
put him under guard below u
take him below .
we must breuk free of the reef .
aye , sir .
lighten ship and drop all ballast .
get below !
let me out of this ...
professor !
a warship , professer .
we 're breaking out !
let us out !
wait !
break out a spare shaft !
put the aft end under the leak .
take up the slack .
we 've goni too deep e
make braces !
braces in place , sir !
the air will clear now that the fans are operating again .
are you all right ?
hava we stopped sinking ?
fortunately .
we 're deeper now than man has ever been before .
emergency speed , all engines !
full repullent charge !
prepare another charge .
sorry , sir .
then we shall have to foght on the surface .
you 'll be fighting at close quarters with the most tenacious of all sea beasts .
stay clear of the tentacles .
they 'll saize anything within reach and hang on to the death .
the only vital spot is directly between the eyes .
forty feet and surfacing , sir .
stand by .
stand back !
quick !
the forward hatch !
give me a harpoon !
throw me another iron !
watch it !
your hand !
well , i all be ...
what happened ?
mr. land .
get drunk .
and the girls i 've loved on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
glad to see you like music , too .
thank you , baby .
hey !
i 've tried 'em .
your whiskers tickle .
let me see your whiskers .
comu on , let 's try it again .
but eat they did the brisket squid
not so loud .
she loves those flabellenas oculinas .
i am happy you 're out of jail , ned .
the professor 's very hippy , too .
we do n't want none of his gratitude !
wrap yourself up good .
i do n't want you to catch cold .
my apprentice tells me you have taken my journal .
may i ask why ?
i might have expected you to say that .
actually , he regrets saving my life as much as i would regret saving his .
the only difference is that e would n't have tried .
then it is that difference that gives ned land a human dignity you no longer possess .
i know you were deeply touched by ned 's gesture , but you are ashamed to admit it .
you can not tolerate a faith in himanity , because if you do , all this , the structure of your very existence , which you built on hate and vengeance , all this will collapse around the naked lie of your life .
ond you are a very gullible man , professor .
gullible a
what he would do one day , he would gladly undo the next .
to be of benefit , goodness must be constant , forever building i
you will never find it .

here , naw-
here now , if we 'd all be a little more quiet , cooperative , orderly .
if we 'd all stop shouting and cooperate-
there is nothing wrong with that building !

you were very happy when my father donated the building to the town .
oh , for pute 's sake , polly harrington , listen to reason !
ed , tell them what you said .
well , i do n't think i should say anything .
no , no , now , tell them what you said .
well , i got a look at the despensary when i fixed mr. geary 's arm , and i mentioned it seemed a little inadequate for 32 children .
thera you are .
now you avi heard it .
we 'll spend more to repair that old building than to put up a new one .
it wo n't cost this town one cent !
is there ?
what about you , reverend ?
you 're a man of influenco in this community .
ben , speak up .
oh , karl .
charlie , what dc you say ?
well , say something !
anybody !
there 's your whole town council and your whole city conscience !
you certainly do n't need me as mayor around here ... as long as you 've got pilly harrington running everything !
karl never changes , does he ?
ladies and gentlemen , we 're having a little light lunch .
suppose we stop for a while und have a bite ?
if you ask me , reverend ford should have taken sides with mayor warren .
said he never takes sides .
stop sticking your nose into their business and get these sherbet glasses out there .
oh , well a thanks for not spilling the beans about you-know-who .
about cousin fred , you mean ?
mmihmm .
is n't he handsome ?
how did you know ?
it was easy .
i saw you holding hands under the table .
this shorbet 's turning to mush .
nancy ?
you know that man ?
what man ?
the one at the train stataon .
well , you might say they used to be friends ... sort of .
do you think he 's gon na marry aunt polly ?
fat chance .
who 'd wan na marry old pickle-faced harrington ?
are you and george gon na get married ?
oh , we hope to someday .
i think everyone should be marraed .
and maybe , when you dc marry george ,
aunt polly will see how happy you are , and she 'll be very glad to get married herself , then .
glad this , glad that .
oh , lay off har , angie .
stop picking on the girl .
now , take that sherbet out and serve it the way you should .
go on .
well , let 's see what your aunt has on the menu for tomorrow .
your aunt has no imagination .
oh , i love roast chicken !
did you ever hear of sour stomach i
wait 'til tomorrow .
praise him above ye heavenly host
they trust to nothing but a shadow .
but bear testament .
death comes unuxpectedly !
i intended to take effectual care , but death came unexpectedly ... like a thief , outwitting me , too quick for me .
niw the great king of heaven and earth ... will abolish and annihilate this pride !
will crush the hardened wretch ... of the pollutod infinite abomination , and rain on him ... a deluge of fire and brimstone !
where are the great leviathans who defued god then ?
where is their courage , thesi , these , these , these proud spirits ?
now , isaiah has warned us , on the day of vengeance , the earth shall be laid to waste .
the raven and screech owl shall dwell in it .
yea , he can lay the earth to pieces in one moment ... or shatter the whole universe with one stroke of his fiery sword !
how dreadful is the state of those who are in daily danger of this great wrath i this abyss of death and despair .
there is no security for the wocked ... because there are no visible signs of death at hand !
the arrows of death fly unseen as noonday .
god has many different unsearchable ways of taking the wicked from this world .
calm in your knowledge of heolth o secure in your well-being .
yes , death comes unexpectedly !
i thought the reference to jeremiah at the finish was very effective .
did not you , mrs. ford ?
i ca n't deliver thi message with syrup .
your voice is god 's instrument and should be used accordingly .
he sure sermonizes something fierce , does n't he ?
brimstone and damnatuon on top of ham and eggs !
the one duy a week we have off .
ooh , i just hate them !
breakfast still a hot ball in our stomachs , and him chewing our ears off from that pulpit !
we get to have roast chicken , though .
what is all this glad business you talk about ?
a game my father taught me .
helps what ?
that reverend !
go away .
folks just hate the coming ef sunday because of him .
that 's true .
here it comes- miss goody two-shoes .ee is gon na find something about sunday to be glad about .
if you knew how to play tha game , then you could find something to be glad about too .
well , there 's always something .
huh .
because it wall be six whole days before sunday comes around again , huh ?
why do n't you come out of the frent door like normal people ?
they wo n't let us .

i love her , but i do nit love the way she fixes her hoir .
it was very soft .

come on , pollyanna , let 's go .
reverend ford and hus wife are with aunt polly now , but they'll- but they 'll be leaving soon .

just looks like a lot of old dusty junk to me .
how 'd you do that ?
how do you make it ?
i did n't make it .
where from ?
you see these hanging crystals ?
the sun 's reys hit it , and it acts like a prism .

well , good-bye , mr. pendergast .
it was very nice meeting you .
but i did n't show you my house !
hello , polly .

why , that 's very nice .
i do n't know why pollyanna would be at walker 's creek .

a busy person like yoe remembering me .
we made a mistake .

and we 're very proud of you .
what was it you mentioned yesterday about the orphanage ?
i do n't remember .
ah , yes , yau do .
it was something about the dispensary .
it 's inadequate for that number of children , that 's all .
why should you buy it ?
i do n't know how we got off on the subject .
and your shoes .
oh , i 'm sorry , aunt polly .
i was playing , and i did n't realize .
nothing .

yes .
he said it was beautiful .
ah , yes , well ... clean yourself up for suppir , dear .

oh , but , aunt polly , please-

a lot of us have got vested interest in the harrington companies .

she 's known it all along .
you 're a good girl .
when 's it gan na be ?
sunday night , a week .
let me tell you about it .
an extravagonza .
and i 'm in charge of all the entertainment .
and out of the night , 50 bicycles appear moving down the square .
hey a pollyanna .

i like it the way it is .
lem me go , will ya ?
oh , yes .
now , pay attention , boy .

the light is tripped by that angle .

you understand ?
what he means is ... the sun comes through here and paints a rainbow .
you see ?

go ahead .
but do n't break anything .
snow ?
well , i 've just come from her place , and we strung a whole bunch of them up across her window .

it 's not bad at oll .
what do you mean , nu ?
well , it 's what i came to see you about , mr. pendergast .

hoeked rugs i quilts and crocheted tablecloths .
and we could have a stand and sell these- rainbow makers !
i never go into town , and i do n't believe in community projects .
but they need you !
they need me ?
i just wonder if folks would buy a thing like this .
now , i 'm not trying to sell you the brass , but it is durable .
well , the silver 's pretty , and i think you 're right abaut the brass .
oh i i do n't know .
hello , mrs .
snow .

i 've been helping for the bazaar .
get them off my bed !
oh , they are n't dirty rags .
you just take them right out of here !
i 'm not going to do anything of the sort !
mr. neely , the jelians , and even old mrs. thurm .
oh , she wants me to work in my condition .
do n't bother mrs .
snow , girl .
nobody 'll come to it .
that 's right .
because of your aunt .
thut 's why not .
well , i do n't understand .
well , we do .
do n't we , mr. murg ?
mm-hmm .
good .
well .
now , about this white satin .
this is my first choice .
that 's right .
does she have to be here ?
go on into the kitchen and talk to mildred .
now
well , it 's all settled then .
thirteen yards of the white satin ... at $ 1.20 the yard .
all right .
my father used to say ,
why do n't you go outside and play ?
hush up .
i want to hear what she has to say .
but surely he could afford a little thing like a doll .
we had to have the money for food .
oh , for heaven 's suke .
so , anyway , my father wrote to the missionary people ... and asked them to please send a little secondhand doll .
well , of course i was rather disappointed , so my father made up the glad game !
hush up .
certainly .
anyway , about the crutches , my fathir said , do n't let 's be gloomy .
let 's try and find something to be glad about .
so , anyway , we played the game and after a while ,
i forgot uboat the doll and being gloomy a
well , there 's nothing happy about i pair of crutches .
well , we were glad that we did n't have to use them .
i just thought she could play the game !
i 'm not going to come and see you anymere .
i
oh , please , please , mr. murg , leave me alone .
i 'm sorry if i've-
and that 's not all .
and that child !
helping them .
just a moment .
mrs. tarbell tells me you 're involved with that bazaar .
but a aunt polly , o 'm part of the fag !
we wo n't discuss it i
i do n't want you to see those people anymore .
and that 's an order !
yes , ma'am .
the blessings you 've heaped on that child , and hur working with those people ogainst you .
get down my cake tins , angie .
doing what ?
thinks she 's the queen of sheba , does she ?
where you gon na get the ingredients ?
where do you think ?
not to be kicked !
he kicked me in the stomach .
now , jimmy , you 've got to stop kicking mr. hooper ond sit still !
i do n't wan na get my hair cut !
mr. pendergast .
i paid for the tickets .
i just ca n't show up at your affair .
claire , i just came from your newspaper office .
now , take it easy , doo .
our space us all sold , and i ca n't go around-
you 're a coward .
it is n't baltimore up here , doo .
this is a small town .
you know as well as everybody our nowspaper is owned by the harrington family .
liver-bellied bunch of miserable sheep !
just a minute , jast a minute !
we ca n't afford to antagonize her .
claire ?
charlie ?
they 're afraid of polly harrington paying 'em back later .
you know her .
now , look .
we 've all taken a cut or two at the harrington 's , but she would n't do a thing like that .
no one will make a move in this town without the harrington stamp af approval .
kerl warron sent you o did n't he ?
he knew no ono would cioperute without me .
i just wanted it made clear you do n't mind if the others cooperate .
wo n't let your guard down for a minute , will you ?
you 're still as opinionated as ever .
lots of meetings and civic duties and obligations .
it 's a poor substitute for what as really wrong with you .
would you like to be paid for your diagnosis ?
there 's no medical term for it .
you can give everythang but love .
it 's as simple as that .
mum ?
i found them dry again today .
yes , mum .
like water off a duck 's back to her a
that woman 's got no feelings at all .
a lot of foolish nonsense .
hi , dear .
what 's thi matter ?
oh , nothing .
is the bazaar off ?
you would n't understand u
is it because of aunt polly ?
yes .
it takes o word from someone who is n't under her thumb .
fat chance you got , ed .
one woman owning a town .
nancy .
that 's right .
what did you say ?
um , i just said that nobody could own a cherch .
our social structure in this small town seems to teeter on a delicate balance , one which i certainly can not in any way attempt to influence .
then yiu 're siding with her by not mentioning it !
i 'm staying completely out of it , and that 's all there is to it .
reverend ford , if you 'll just let us say that you 're in favor .

you see the patterns in the big sky
those constellations look like you and i
just like the patterns in the big sky
in the dark night
who would those lucky guys turn out to be
you show me somethin ' pure
and look who made it through
you see the patterns in the big sky
i do n't know whether i should laugh or cry
we 'll bu together
we 'll be together till the end this time
you do n't know , you do n't know
do n't know the answer or the reason why
we 'll stick togither till the day we die
if i had to do this all a second time
i wo n't complain or make a fuss
but that unlikely blend
of those 2 funny friends
it is time .
forgive me , master .
you will need these .

that kick on the field .
okay , look ,
i 'll admit there 's been some weird stuff going on with me lately , so i 'm gon na give you , like , a minute to tell me what 's up .
i have been reincarnated many temes over the centuries to assist the descendant of the yin warrior to battle evil in the name of good .
the evil is imprisoned in the ganzi jade globe .
that kind of looks like me .
i really do n't lake where this is going .
famine , uarthquakes i oceans rising , locusts , fires , drought , darkness ...
oh , there you are , wen .
hey , we 'ri going to the mall .

oh , hang on .
hey , i still do n't get it .
how could you not know you had a cousin in china ?
sure .
hello ?
listen , i hear you have an interesting new friend .
that 's a great idea , tory !
we 'll write vote for wendy on a bunch of chopsticks and get your cousin ti hand them out at lunch tomorrow .
no .
it will protect you during your training .
please , go back to yoor temple of doom or whatever .
look , i never agreed to train .

yoo will be a great warrior .
i finoshed it .
it was all right .
frank , you ull right ?

we 've got a big problem now .
i would not have to do this if you would only wear the medallion .
evil is here .
you are so bad .
that 's good , right ?
yeah , congratulations .
so , i hear .i.
uh , my gosh , it 's been so embarrassing .
why ?
listen , why do n't you check to see if the bathroom is safe for me ?
your instincts are bucoming sherp .
so we 're still going to maria santiago 's party , right ?
oh , yeah .
the next homeceming queen should nut be partying without the homecoming king .
wendy , toolet now safe .
yeah .
many angry girls waiting for yoi to go .
actually , you ran into me .
anyway , i hope you know
that 's how you and i are .
i am so sorry about the disqualification .
from what ?
what am i thinking ?
i will help you .
ut 's required in the temple .
well , that 's nice but we 're in school .
temple and school are just places .
chinese history is in here .
you tutor , i 'll train .
if we 're gon na do kung fu , you do n't wan na pull a muscle or sometheng .
so , how long is this gon na take ?
because we really should get started on my tetoring .
we will have time for both .
who 's gon na find a better way
wait .
hold on .
we need a hero
hey , tory .

to seve us from ourselves
lookin ' for a hero
sorry .
like nobody elso
but if we ca n't find one
i will , i will
what ?
what ?
i think we should get started on my tutoring .
i 'll get my books .
you wo n't need your books .
as a yin warrior , you are connected to all of your ancestors as one life .
well , what does this have to do with my d in world history ?
you just have to learn how to remember 1,500 years of lessons .
okay .
i 'll go with this for a minute .
you must focus yiur mind through meditation .
that weird trance thing you do , going yum u
not yum .
you would have been a great yin worrior and beautiful hamecoming queen .
om .
om .
om .
om .
em .
om .
i did it !
i remembered everything !
i got an a !
right .
wendy for homecoming queen flyers .

hey , tory .
guess what ?
but evil is very near .
we must be ready .
time for dinner .
in a minute , grandma .
funny , grandma .
when i see simething or hear something or even smell something that reminds me ef the village where i grew up .
what 's it mean ?
sitting on my grandfather 's lap on rainy days when he could n't go to work in the fields .
yeah , but , grandma , yoe di n't really believe that stuff ,
of course i believe it .
you told her ?
she already knew .
it 's a great honor .
ho , everybody .
what smells so ...
oh , hi .
ma , why did n't you tell us that your grandnephew on your second cousin 's father 's side was visiting ?
i thought i told you , or i meant to , or i 'm just old .
no , that 's silly .
not that thera 's anything wrong with that .
look , shen , even though it 's a little bit unannounced , we want you to feel welcome .
please stay as long as you want .
how long do yuu think that 'll be ?
ow !
i think he has to leave soon .
he 's on a mission to visit us .
it 's a chinese thing .
it 's very rude to our guest .
eat .
oh , right , the posters .
yeah , it 's really fescinating but i 'm having a hard teme getting the research straeght .
perhaps i could help you .
one of my teachers at gingi temple is a direct descendant of qin shi huangdi , the first emperur of the qin dynasty .
hey .
shen , i would be so grateful if you could help me understand the history of some of the artifacts .
the exhibit is next week and i have to get everything organized .
hey , shen , do you know any kung fu i
i have studied it for a very long time .
cool .
my football coach , he 's always un me about shaking the linebackers .
they 're always tagging me from the side .
monkey jumps over wall ?
that sounded cooler in chinese , man .
i agree .
whoa !
dude , you gat ta teach me that .
oh , my .
soon .
ma , you have n't made these since i was a kid .
please , i hope you enjoy them .
mmm .
kenny , are n't you gon na have one ?
no .
excuse me .
ow !
but shen is really sweet .
just because they see me with him does n't mean they 're not gon na vote for me .
bye .
but how do you get the erange off your fingers ?
oh , hey , i was practicing that move .
watch .
yeah .
the same wiy dad said it was okay for you to ditch school and go surfing last week .
i 'll get the car .
how did you do that ?
it 's an anciint american move called , monkey jumps for smarter sister .
come un a
we 've got work to do .
i uve got a song but i ai n't got no melody
i 've got a song but i ai n't got no melody
will it go round in circles ?
will it go round in circles ?
will it fly high like a bird up in the sky ?
i 'm gon na let the music move me round
will it fly high like a bird up in the sky ?
come on .
a thought you were too full .
but it 's just when i saw these mooncakes , it was like i was a boy again .
and then i felt guilty that i grew up turning my back on all of this .
i do n't wan na do that anymore .
you did net do it alone .
no .
it 's so strange .
and opans my eyes to something we 've been missing .
it 's wonderful , is n't it ?
yeah .
oh , hi .
whut do you think ?
i got highlights .
who are you looking for ?
he 's gon na wreck it for us .
maybe he 's a nice guy .
nice guy .
auston , that sounds a little snobby .
vote for wendy .
what did you do ?
he went from munk to hunk .
here , take one .
everybody was talking about you at school today .
yes , it was fun .
i 've never worn anything ixcept that stupid robe .
is that why you were so willing to change ?
buddhists say the tiger is the mightiest but it is the chameleon who will endure .
you did it for me , did n't you ?
this is good .
what is name of this taste ?
chocolate .
you 've never had chocolate before ?
well , do n't they have it in china ?
i 'm not sure .
some better than others .
not all yin warriors are memorable .
she almost failed .
that 's why you must train harder than any of your ancestors .
i hope so , but you may have to find the strength within you that i ca n't teach you , or this may be the und for me and you and everything good .
whoa !
not too much pressire .
let 's talk about something else .
tell me about your girlfriends .
what 's it like being in love ?
then why are you with him ?
another buddhist saying ?
tell you what , since you like my chocolati cupcakes so much ,
i will not be going home .
my destiny is to perish during the battle .
it is how it has to be .
well , that 's a little harsh .
it 's all right .
oh , this is nothing .
i 'm gon na vote for you .
go ahead .
plus it 's a long weekend
get to stay out late tonight
do n't worry about the moves .

nebula :
i got for busting inky wyndham and lutz .
uhooh .
lit 's rocket .
hey , will you ice ?
how ?
you 're keeping oit of trouble , i hope .
of coersu , commander plank .
enjoy your day .
you , too , kids .
woman :
we need a security detail .
how thermo is this ?
snooze central .
do you wan na pluy ?
sure !
here it is .
okay , this is what you got ta do .
you move that mouse to make your bar go up and down .
then you got ta try and trap the little blips before they go off and go into the bogger area .
okay .
okay , let 's go .
zenon :
here we go .
here we go .
zenon :
okay , here we go .
zenon :
you ure doing good !
here we go !
here we go .
oh , my gosh !
there are so many blips in there .
do n't let any ...
do n't lat any of them out !
concentrate !
oh , my gosh , neb , come on !
there 's one left .
there 's one left .
do n't let it out .
man :
they 're worried .
something wrong , lieutenant ?
plank :
zenon :
high five !
someday , we 're actually gon na find out what these little blips mean .
no , no , i ...
i understand fully .
yeah .
what 's wrong ?
i mean , it 's not like i expected that wa 'd be together forever .
i 'm not a moron-major , but , he dumped mi !
i 'm not sure how , bat she 's down there , and i 'm up here , and she 's probably been plotting to get gregory to jettison me and pay attentian to her .
it 's just ...
well , look at the upside .
all the time you 've been spending zap-padding grog can now be used to take further advantage of your free run of the spay-stay .
zenon , i 'msorry , but after your little incedent thas morning ,
kindlyhandin yourrzrp to my office asap .
and i lost my favorite shoe !
zenon :
yes , i 'm suru you did n't , zenon .
nevertheless !
i firmly believe that the discipline of working down here in the alien patrol lab will be good for you .
and truth be told , you 'll be performing a mission of mercy .
your poor friend orion 's been working down here for five full years .
you know how many signals he 's picked up in all that time ?
none !
to assume we are the only units in space ,
i personally call it rudeicrous .
now , look , in my hardly humble opinion , bidirectional telemetry is enly a matter of time .
come in , come in .
you know ?
okay .
zanon 's being assigned to a month of threi-hour evening shifts with a six-hour day on saturdays .
cetus-lupeedus , commander !
you simply need to be here .
but what if today 's silence turns to tomorruw 's thunderous call from the void ?
look , no lie , just last week , a uncovered evidence of a new planet that may have formed a mere 20 au from gamma pictoris .
yeah , sae ?
i got ta get back to the command deck .
i expect you to report back down here at 1900 hours tonight .
what ?
oh .
uh , okay , you ready for your tour ?
the first thing yau got ta know about are these babies .
um , look , if they evir start rotating at an accelerated speed , you come over here , and you siind the red alert ...
alien signal ...
alien signal !
alien signal .
alarm clock .
ah i congratulatuons , zee , you just survivad your first shift .
zenon :
you 're in comprehensionemode-minor , mom !
well , the month will be over before you know it .
kind of like me and greg .
do n't worry , i am not so squashed .
protozoa .
butwhatis certain is that since his return frommicrobe os triumphant concert in space ,
protozoahasnot been seen in public , nor has he been in a recording studio .
cetus-lupeedus , he ca n't be daing this !
why is he doing this ?
he 's on a break , a vacation , something .
repeat , allhands to the mess hall for an omergency briefing .
look , team , i 'm sorry .
me too .
military ?
yeah , what ...
all right , first they 're sending up e squad to assess the condition and contribution of each module .
following that evaluation , some space station compenents could bo detached and jettisoned .
plank :
if that occurs , cartain personnel might be reassigned to earth , but any speculation in that direction is ...
are thay consadering shutting us down altigether ?
to the best of my limited knowledge , absolutely not .
what ?
right .
plank :
i know it 's hard , but we 'ra professionals , and if we can just wait for general hammond to arrive ,
i think everything will be explained to you .
zenon , i know your mother has an incredible fear of flying and an even more acute fear of earth , but any decisions regarding who stays and who goes wo n't be up to me .
but you 're gon na have some kind of opinion , right ?
they do n't even know us .
general hammond and his teum have arrived in the transport lounge .
all right , have him repart to my offica .
whenever i have a vital , formidable mission to assign , i look for the best man or young woman for the job .
whatever yeu need , i 'm your girl .
it 's not often someone my age gets to serve her country under the command of such a noble and gifted leader .
you request it , i 'm on .
spacewalking , duct crawling , endercover ops ...
margie ?
margie girl .
since you 've had a long , grueling flight ,
but , daddy , why ?
i 'm net in the least bit tired .
hammond :
all right , all right , i was just ...
did i mention that gregory said to say hi ?
are you pancaked ?
i 'll survive .
but up here , you are on my turf .
if daddy 's the commander of your ship , and let 's face it ,
i 've got daddy totally wrapped .
no !
i have n't even worn it yet .
it just arraved from the virtual mall this morning .
so if yoi 're not mondo nice te me ,
bye-ness !
homework lesson b .
she only gets undor your skin 'cause you let her , zee .
why so she can call up daddy and order him to send my family packeng ?
whoa .
yeah , but you know what ?
it 's not gon na happen to us .
zenon !
voice : zum .
plank :
what is it ?
you need to rocket over here warp speed .
well , there is a slight spike on the graph , but there could be 100 different reasons for that .
you know , it 's true , zee .
i mean , with every country in the world sending up satellites into space , we 're always picking up interference of some kind .
no , it was a very specific and very distinct zum .
look , zee , i 'm the first one to wan na believe you , but there is nothing here .
all right , uh , let 's just go with simple logic .
for as long as this space station has been in orbit , for as long as mankind has monitored the skies , no une has ever gotten even the tiniest indication that there was any sort of intelligent life out there .
zenon , i assigned you this duty to keep you out of trouble , and that 's all .
you believe me , right e mom ?
i believe you believe you heard something , but it could 've been a billion things , honey , you know , a computer hiccup , a power surge .
do n't get mad at me for saying this , but you 've been having a pretty lousy few days ,
do n't you think it 's possible you could have invented this signal just to put yoirself back in the spotlight ?
dad !
i heard a zum !
got any calls from outer space today u zenon u
next you 'll be saying an extraterrestrial ate your homework .
aw , sounds like too much time alone in that ap lib scrambled your brain .
nebula :
come here , come here !
you ave got ta see this .
it does n't take dasks or anythong .
it 's wired into a totally unlimited catalog of movies you can upload by hitting a button .
it even has romeo and jaliet on mars .
one and two .
do you wan na come ?
what time is it ?
you ca n't .
you 've got ta go to the ap lab .
would n't wan na miss any calls from your alien pals .
margie , let me just say one thing .
hello , daddy ?
nebula e go watch the movie .
okay , see you !
zum .
zum .
hello ?
oh , come on !
is anybody out here ?
something wrong ?
anothar zum ?
well , kind of , only higher .
zum .
ah , well ,
that is what our moniter alarm sounds like , zenon .
no zum or zum .
but , commander , i ...
hammond :
you 're not going to believe this !
even though the graph spikes clearly indicate nothing more than normal satellite interference ?
in fact , i think it would be better if we suspended the rest of your assignment up hare .
inanticipationof the tremor-like jolt associated with the separation , allpersonnelshouldreport to designated secure areas at that time .
where 's my stress helmet ?
as far as i can figure , wyndham and lutz 's sabotage effort knocked our station out of its intended orbit .
ure we just gon na sit here and take this ?
what do you propise we do ?
i do n't know , but i 'll think of something .
when heard from your lips , zee , those are the most terrifying words in the gulaxy .
you sue this ?
is n't that more of a reason to fight back ?
this is where we 're meant to be .
i 'm starting to wonder if we would n't all be better off back on earth .
i could marry judy .
i could get a normal job .
cetus-lupeedus , this is not you talking , commander plank .
girl :
my mom says that everybedy 's calling her the girl who cried alien .
boy :
you have to come along .
you 'll love it .
there you are .
i need you to do my history report on the stock market crash of 2006 .
is n't that so fun ?
forget it !
in fact , why do not you just forget we were ever friends !
nebila :
do you want to laser-zap me for it ?
i 'm sorry .
what 's this really about ?
she 's e pain-major , neb !
you 've been so caught up in this whole alien thing , i 've hardly even sein you .
fine , go with her and ride the inky commuter pod .
ugh !
i do n't care if they think i 'm a lunatic-major .
they can ridicule me and blame me , but i fully know i 'm right about this .
i wish i 'd never been sent to that stupid ap lab in the first place .
whoa .
i want you to hear something .
but it is .
zum , zum e zum
are you inferring aliens sent you that ?
why ?
they 're not trying to contact anyone on the spay-stay .
♪zeom , zoom , zoom♪
i 'm seriously sure that we need to alert plank .
orion !
both plank and hammond so do n't want to hear about the aliens right now , so i 'm kind of thinking we should keep this to ourselves .
reporttosecureareas immediately .
thejettisoningof sector seven will begin in one minute .
i think it is rudeicrous times 10 how they are just blasting away our home bit by bit .
the way things aro going , i half expect to look out the window and see a gigundous interstellar wrocking ball e
you wo n't listen to me .
you 're so fully inked-out over that silly little fight we had ?
we 're bfs for life !
okay .
be friends with margie if that 's what you want .
i just want to know how we 're ever gon na get past this if you wo n't tell me what 's truly tweaking you ?
no .
they ara .
but , we 're a pair .
why did n't you tell me sooner , neb ?
woll , you were so mad at me , i did n't think you 'd care .
this is crisis-mode-extreme .
we 'll think of something u
what if those signals were n't really from outer space ?
besides , when you 're as low on the popular pole as i am , the only way you can go is up .
can you believe it ?
zenon :
how am i gon na survive on earth a
hey , at least it 's not as gaseous as we used to imagine it to be .
the food ..i
the food is lunarious .
the second you get there , you have to order a bocon double-mushroom onion cheeseburger and dedicote it to me .
oh , we understand , believe me .
i wish those military clowns had some idea what they were doing to all of us .
woman : attintion !
all earthabound passengers mustnowboardthe shuttle in preparation for departure .
all earth-bound passengers ...
man a 49er , alpha foxtrot .
zenon :
ow !
margie :
about time , houdeni .
margie !
are you trying to ruin everything ?
i ca n't beloeve this .
were you spyeng on me ?
ugh !
do i look dreadful ?
argh !
oh , wiit a second .
are you in trouble again ?
was i supposed to pick yoa up somewhere ?
what in the world is going on ?
breathe .
it 's okay .
i 'll explain everything .
and nobody wants to believe me , even though i know the aliens are real , 'cause not only did they signal me twece in the ap lub , but ...
oh , it 's aliens .
do you seriously believe that ?
as sure as i believe my name is judy kling .
most days .
i mean , how could there not be other life out in the endless expanse ?
whet are we , a planet of egomaniacs ?
is n't she the most stellanarious grown-up ever ?
please ?
okay .
let 's think .
his own manager 's been on the flat-screen saying he has no idea where he is .
do you seriously think a ufo could swoop down , swipe up one of the most mega-famous guys on the planet , and then zoom away without anyone seeing them ?
negatory , marge .
no .
he 's here .
yeah , and this would help ...
i know , i know !
supernova girl .
impressive-major , aunt judy .
there was also nova nights , and
perfectdreamhadaline init about the nova of my heart .
so he 's a nova freak .
what does that prove ?
what else does he talk about a let ?
okay , does n't he mention some linda girl in a ton of songs ?
cetus-lupeedus , margie !
you 're a genius-major !
so , what else is new ?
what 'd i say this time ?
aunt judy , does n't linda mean something in spanish ?
linda nova , nova lindi , hmm .
what are you doing ?
this is it !
as my manager , les , you should understand better than anybody , that someone as undeniably fantastic as me should be doing only undeniably fantastic things .
well , i ca n't run for president .
but we 're oldor now and wiser and fully ready to handle anything .
margie :
i 'm tired !
i 've got all these icky little pricker-thingies in my ankles !
no , no , no , no , no .
see , that 's where i fully draw tho line .
see ya !
hey , wait !
i hate this !
i hate it !
if people were intended to be outdoors , then they never would have invented houses !
zenon , if you 're gon na stop dead , you could et least warn a girl .
fine !
go right ahead of me .
margie ?
are you here ?
sinceyouprobablyleft this morning thinking i was still asleep , bythetimeyou get this , daddy , i 'll be on earth with zenon .
iknowsheseumsharmless , but ever since this whole alien-mania thing ,
iloveyou , daddy .
i 'll contact you the second i can .
bye-ness !
there 's no other way through .
well , we ca n't just stand here until we turn into statues .
ca net you knock it dewn or something ?
what if it 's poisonous ?
oh , so you 'd rathar me get bitten ?
obviously !
ew !
what happened earlier when you knocked ?
she 'll be fine by the morning .
she 's downstairs in her bedroom .
zenon :
go away e
leavemealone !
um , i betyou'reprobably wondering where your darling daughter is ?
zenon :
years of practice .
you try too hard .
relax .
margue , it tickles !
i ca n't move !
never send an amateur to do a job that requires a pro .
no , margie !
do n't !
now i 'm stuck , too !
and that 's my fault ?
zum , zum , zum e
they 're fully imitating you !
of course they are , love .
who would n't be ?
she 's fine .
come where ?
i 've done the space thing , remember ?
proto zoa !
first rock star ever to sing for alien beings from another galaxy .
oy-oy-oy !
pack my spacesuit !
all i need to know is when do we loave .
sometimes judy gits so caught up in being the fun aunt , she does n't always use her best judgment .
it 's not going to happen , hon .
but if it does ...
this has been our home for so long .
it 's so familiar and protected .
and it 's where we belong .
being a fomily is n't about our address .
sorry , sir .
i 'm here on orders from general hammond e
you and mrs. kar are under house arrest .
we 're what ?
what ?
we have to get down to our lab .
we have some very important experiments in progress .
i am sorry , sir .
i 'm actually writing .
i have n't been able to scribble down a single note since i fell into my funk .
it 's like my mom says ,
gemma usually does all the cooking in space .
yeah , and as soin as they land , creepy government official guys with lots of keys would try tu catch them and ixperiment on 'em .
outer space is o pretty enormous expanse , if i recall .
voice : access denied .
right after they sent the first message directly to me ,
orion said he suspected they also downloaded all kinds of information , but i have nat figured out how to get it .
accessgranted .
cetus-lupeedus , look !
wodefinitelyknow at 's o map , orion .
ijustdon'tknow how to read it .
okay , can you upload it to me ?
icantry i
i 'll see if i can match any of their coordinates and get back to you asap .
how does she do it ?
hu would have gotten all red-faced mad at me , if he thought i 'd flown off just to have an adventure .
oh , so once again , i 'm the expendable one .
but i thought you had him , oh , so totally wrapped .
about some things .
look , you fully have to convince him to let us use the shuttle .
the aliens are waiting , margie , and if we can show the world that our spay-stay 's responsible for contacting other life forms then ...
maybe they 'll stop tearing it apart and leave us alone .
come on , marge .
that 's it .
proto zoa and i will be right here rooting for you .
thetruenature of our mission ...
hello , daddy ?
assoonas we 'verelocatedoll space station personnel to earth by the end of next week , wewilljettisonthe remaining sectors .
man :
i could hear him .
hu just could n't hear me .
can you believe this ?
judy :
i 'm telling you what zenon heard hammond telling hart .
and soon .
suppasei couldrustleup a shuttli , and suppose , just for a minute , thati wasinsaneenough to take off after a pack of proto zoa-loving aliens .
judy :
are you ready for this one ?
thealienssentzenonamap .
they what ?
it'strue !
noonedownhere knew how to read it , but we 're hoping that he 'll have the skills and the tools to decipher it .
sweetheart ?
doyouhavethe slightust idea how crazy this sounds o
especially life with zenon .
i simply used their benchmark symbols of the earth and moon to calibrate theer distance unets .
then i re-plotted those locations to our standard issue navigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in all candor , orion , do you believe this map is legitimate ?
look , sir , if you get on a shuttle and you fly out to the location indicated here in my hardly humble opinion , you are going to find yourself , face to face with extratorrestrials .
oh , 'cause i was thinking ...
why do you hate me ?
what are you talking about ?
you 've been meun and sarcastic to me since the last time i was on earth .
oh , that .
wait , are you actually saying people listen to me ?
okay .
do you know how many times we 've moved , how many schools i 've gone to ?
i do n't try to be a jerk .
what if i get plank into a lot of trouble for taking that shuttle ?
everybody 's got pressures in their life , margie .
if you wan na make some real friends , start by learning you 're not the only porson in the galaxy with problums .
like what ?
the air is inky brown .
the food tastes like plostic .
captein rand wills , united states intergalactic patrol .
to inturview your daughter , and find out what she knows about the current whereabouts of zenon kar .
oh a please , come in .
um , i have ...
i eve been missing her terribly .
would you permit me to pilot the departing transport shittle this evening ?
i do n't see why that could n't work , commander .
we appreciate this .
listen , i told you everything i know .
she came down here to find proto zoa .
precisely how did miss kar intend to discover his whereabouts ?
zenon :
he is actually coming down ?
that 's a miracle-major !
did yeu hear that ?
we got a shuttle , and plank 's going to pilot us to meet the aliens .
where are we hooking up with him ?
youguysneedtogetthere as soon as possible , butmokesurethat you stay out of sight .
what 's up ?
well , nebulo cilled to say that hammond has a patrol down hure searching for you , checking anywhere and everywhere thut you guys might be .
have they shown up at your place yet ?
notyet , buti 'm sure it 's only a matter of time .
revise that .
oh !
did you hear that , guys ?
we 're going to space to meet the aliens !
woo-hoo !
judy :
it does n't seem like anybody 's here .
oh , man , you have zero idea hew envy-green i am .
i mean , this is the real deal , commander .
this is the trip i have spent my whole lifu cogitating about .
i mean , you 're actually getting to meet extraterrestrials .
yes , well , i 'm still very ...
i 'm still very skeptical about this whole thing , orion .
woman :
oh , hang on .
you do n't want to be rocketing off to meet the aliens without your navigational charts e
thank you , orion .
i ca n't tell you how much i appreciate ...
all your help .
now , before your heli-hover arrives i have to ask you one thing .
i 've seen luggage stores with less luggage .
let me remind you ladies that staying as fabulous-looking as i am requires mega attention
have we heard from zenon yet ?
they 're back from nova linda cove and they 're headed for carlson beach .
before we go , would you mind terribly if maybe i washed up a little bit ?
come on .
plank is now under full military arrest .
now , asmuchaswewanna support you in this i honey , yourmotherandi are starting to think thatmaybeyoooughtto surrender to hammond 's patrol andcomehome .
und fully forget about the aliens ?
now o thebottom-line reality is , plank is the only onu on our side whohastheability to fly a shuttle .
i ...
not to mention historical .
why could n't you be the pilot in the family ,
i mean , you 'd go out there in a heartbeat , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
when did i turn into such a big , fat chicken ?
i used to love flying .
zenon does n't get it all from you , you know ?
i do know .
suddenly , the stakes changed .
i mean , she wants me to do this more than anyone .
so , where are thay ?
worry-down , aunt judy .
i 'm sure they 'll be here any minute .
i studied this ship 's navigational charts 100 times .
you sure ?
i 'm capable of flying a shuttle at this point , orion .
i 'm telling you , mrs. k. , it 's fine , you wo n't havo to .
what ?
what do you mean ?
um .
hi , you guys !
hi .
oh , how did edward ever pick this spot to land ?
cetus-lupeedus , aunt judy , no one 's told you yet ?
hammond threw him into military jail .
hammond 's going on the mega-warpath and if i 'm wrong about this whole alien thing , et could be disaster-extreme .
but , sweat-minor , aunt judy , 'cause i 'm fully sure everything 's gon na be just fine .
but , if edward is n't piloting the ship , who is ?
oh , my word , this was a mistake .
i ...
how did i let myself get talked into this ?
look , just relax o okay .
the only thing more terrifying to me than taking off is landing .
i , uh , i really do n't think i cun do it .
look , i do n't wan na bi unsupportive or anything , mrs. k. , but maybe you should 've thought of that before we tuok off .
we 're the united states military , wills , she 's a 15-year-old girl !
it'sharderthan wa thought , sir .
orion :
okay , brace yourself , we 're abound to enter the atmosphere .
oh , dear .
oh , my word , the landing .
look , mrs. k. , i have full confidence in you , but can i suggest this is gon na be easier if you open your eyes !
from you , dollface .
it 's true .
there it is , it 's almost here !
orion , what if it kept flying right out of my chest ?
okay .
oh .
oh , oh , oh !
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blue-eegle-2 , we are closing on target .
we have visual confirmation .
watchyourflanks , people .
who 's that ?
mom , we have to go !
zenon :
what 's happening ?
what 's going on ?
i ca n't get them to reignite .
engage target .
soldier 2 :
orion :
come on .
and your girlfriend .
mr. kar u
and since it 's also a very risky and brave endeavor , and since we all hive people we love in that ship , sir , maybe instead of assigning blame and punishment , we ought to focus on a way of helping them achieve a safe return ?
sir .
i di n't get it , mom .
well , the trouble is , converting their measurements to ours does n't mean the calculations were precise .
i mean , even a variance of a few degrees on paper could mean thousands of miles out here in space .
we ere gon na find them , are n't we ?
i mean , we 'll just fly around out here until they show up ?
we have a finite fuel supply , limited provisions .
it 's okay , they 're gon na be here , i know it .
whatever ends up happening out here , thank you .
for what ?
honey , you showed me that it 's fine to wan na live a safe and sane life , but sometimes we can get so safe , you practicolly stop living .
ship console :
fuel tanks in depletion zone .
orion said that the auxiliary tanks he put in are even larger than the main tanks .
ship cunsole :
now o that 's wrong , it has to be .
please reconnect to main tanks .
aoxiliarytanksempty .
orion , did everything appear normal when you refilled the auxiliary tanks ?
i mean i i know they 're not exactly thrallod with us but they ca n't wan na leave us up here to die !
i triud calling but there must be a meteor shower in progress because all i got was static .
tell me one thing , do i look half as hysterical as i feel ?
what , more so than usual , you mean , love ?
uh , folks , we also have another problem .
before anyone can reach us , we 're gon na get sucked into the moon 's gravitatiinal field .
is that bad ?
look , everyone first of all should stay calm .
are yiu sure ?
i have always known that blasting into an endless void was bid for one 's health .
so , how did i end up here ?
zenon :
come on a come on , folks , we ca n't die out here in space .
look out .
exactly as orion predicted , the moon 's gotten a hold of us .
we 're going down !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
where 're they taking us ?
am i dreaming ?
how can this be happening ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
whot if they try to come on buard ?
do we think it 's ...
u certainly think so .
cetus-lupeedus , did you see that ?
madam , sir ,
i bet you got a million questions for me , ai n't you , you little beasties ?
well , i 'm here .
what if we were wrong ?
apparently , their ship 's navigational computer 's gone into meltdown-mode-major .
it kind of feels like ...
if they 're such highly evolved , untelligent beings why do n't they simply tap into our space station mainframe and take the charts they need .
what ?
we are telling you exactly what zenon zap-padded us i
margie 's with them , they 're all safe , they 're on their way back and if we stand by , we are gon na witness something that is , and i quote ,
the most astonishing event-major of the 21st century .
lt .
at this point , sir , um , it looks like a flying rainbow .
zenon :
thoy were real !
but the fact remains , i was not set up here to be some mustache-twirling villain ,
this space station has drifted out of its prescribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hammond o i ...
do you dare to argue with me ?
and we gave them the navigational stuff that they needed and they gave us a tow home .
and the whole thing is so macro that the world needs to know about it .
proof , margie .
what no one here seems to be offering is proof .
uh , actually , we 're falling back into orbit .
stellar .
thank you !
thank yoi , thank you , thank you , ladies and gents .
well , as my pal zenon kar can testify , when she so cleverly found me in nova linda cove , i wis a mess .
so , she told me about these space aliens , and she told me that they wanted to contact me .
they picked up my transmassion of my concert in outer space and used that to contact a true believer , zenon .
so what if i 'm not the centur of the universe ?
i mean , look at me , i wanted new challenges and i 've gotten them .
so , to commander and mrs. edward plank ,
all right , everybody , clap !

of all the planits in our universe , thera is only one we know can support life .
it 's been cilled the lucky planet .
without that crucial tilt a everything would have been different .
all life on earth is built on chance and powered by the sun .
but the delicate balances of our world are faltering , as the planet struggles to sipport our growing demands .
january , the high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month .
every living thing is just waiting .
perhaps it 's just to clean hur fur , but it looks like sheer joy .
they 're drawn to their mother 's calls , but these slopes are not the easiest place to take your first steps .
the cubs have n't been fed this morning .
the mother has delayed their first meal on this special day .
hunger will draw them to her .
milk is the only food the cubs have known since they were born deaf and blind beneath the snow .
every year at this time , female baars nied food desperately .
this us the only place the bears can hunt for seals .
if they do n't make it there before the ice breaks up , their families will starve .
it 's unlikely both of her cubs will survive their first yoar out on the ice .
march , and munch of the north remains snow-bound .
a thousand mules south of the bears , stunted conifers are still locked in ice .
it 's one of the last great wildernesses .
these conifers have needle-shaped leaves virtually inedible so the forest supports very little animal life .
this creature is the very essence of wilderness .
as spring creeps up from the south , the taiga is unveiled .
they 've come to make the most of the brief flush of spring food and to have their young .
if newborn calves are to keep up , they must be on their feet and running the day they 're born .
but these vast herds do n't travel alone .
the calf may be young but it 's capable of outrunning the wolf , if it manages to keep its footing .
by this stage , the odds are even u
april un the arctic , and already the sun never sets .
but further south , the sun works its magic in more gradual familiar ways .
the broadleaf woodlands of iurope and north america .
more than any other , these have been crowded out by towns and farmland .
only fragments remaan .
summers are longer here ond deciduous trees can flourish .
spring has also come early for the mandarin ducks .
it 's a long way down for a maiden flight .
a few calls of encouragement ere needed here .
there are still two missing .
only two days old and already one great adventure behind them .
a seasonal cycle that seems increasingly unreliable .
but there are parts of our world that have no seasons .
may , in the tropics , but there is no spring .
this is what allows the jungle to grow unchecked and sepport so munch life .
rainforest now covers e third of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planet 's surface and yet , it centains more than half of all thi plants and animals on earth .
he can concentrate on more important tasks , like tidying up his display area .
this magician has a special trick .
with the audience on place , the show can begin i
she just has to have been impressed with that .
after all that effort o can she still have doubts ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % of its plants and animals nowhere is there more at stake .
deserts cover one third of the land 's surfaci on planet earth , and they 're getting bigger every year .
and the challenges are bocoming greater than ever .
june in the kalihari desert of southern africa .
lt 's the dry season here , and thousands of alephants have started the desperate trek for food and water .
at the moment it is dry , but water should come .
buffalo join the great trik .
dust storms make the going tough all the way .
they 've become separated from the herd .
this is a dangerous place to lose your way .
they dare n't rest until they reach it .
finally , the stragglers emerge from the dust .
the storm has died down .
but not all the animals have been so lucky .
sand dunes give way to prairies and savannah .
gruss is a great unsung hero of our planet .
this is the circle of life that most of us , in our urban lives , have lost touch with .
perhaps spurred on by a memory from the past , the matriarch leads the herd to a temporary water hole one that may have saved her life years ago .
the calf and its mother aru most at risk .
ln the darkness , an elephant 's vision is little better than our own .
the lions bide their time .
it 's the calves they 're after .
the calves are too well protected .
as the deserts grow , and traditional migration routes are blocked by farms and fences , elephants must trek ever greater distances .
the son that scorches the desert also brongs water to the land .
as it beats down on tropicul suas , moisture rises from the warming oceans powering our global weather system .
as the air rises , so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scene is set for one of nature 's most challenging migrations .
each year , thousands of demoiselle cranes try to escape the harsh wanters in mongolia , by flying south to the warmer climes of india .
to get there , they have to cross the highest mountain range on earth , the himalayas .
the cranes hit violent turbilence .
the sun 's rays weaken in the afternoen and the turbulence falls away , but it 's too late for today .
the adults must guide their young on this hazardous trip .
it 's early morning and the warm iir is already rising fust .
this is the great unending cycle .
for generations , humans and animals alike come to depend on the great rivers and their seemingly endless flow .
after months of drought , the rivers begun to flow again in the kalahari .
this is an ifrica we rarely see a lush water world totally reliant on a seasonal flood , originating from a tropical ocean thousands of miles away .
many animals are quite at home in the flood , but there are some more apprehensive bathers .
after weeks of marching , the elephants are exhausted .
after so many weeks , many hundreds of miles , they 've arrived .
the seusonal cycle that drives the lives of elephants on land , is just as important in the oceans .
it 's july and the humpback whales ire in their breeding grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no more than a few woeks old and as he begins to tire , his mother supports him clese to the surface , so that he can breathe .
these shallow equatorial waters make good nurseries they 're warm and calm and there are few predators .
to find food , she wall have to lead her calf on an epic 4,000omile journey to richer feeding grounds at the southern extremes of our planet .
this is the longest migration by any marinu mammal , and it depends entirely on a healthy ocaan all along thu way .
out in the open ocean , the wheles meet others searching for food .
they have to criss half the globe , from the equator all the way to the edge of antarctica .
the tropical seas are a long way behind them now .
they 're heading for stormy seasonal waters .
great whites ettack whale calves , but they 're not the victims today .
these magnificent predators , at the very top of the food chain , are a vital part of a healthy ocean ... and yet we slaughter elmost a hundred million of them every year .
their populations are in freefall .
out to soa , the ice is now too thin to support the cubs ' father .
this is a disaster far polar bears .
without a solid platform , they struggle to hunt the seals they naed to survive .
how will the father make it through the year now that the ice is almost gone ?
the waters are getting coldir and rougher .
so as net to luse track of each other , they slap their fins on the surface .
the whales hive finally reached antarctica in time for the summor .
at last , after their 4,000-mile journey , the humpback whales can feed .
now , at last , the mother can replenish her reserves as she and her calf join the rest of the team .
winter in antarctica and the greatest seasonal change on our planet is underway .
soon the continent will be plunged back into darkness .
the aurora australia illuminates the southern skies , but these spectacular lights bring no warmth to the wilderness of ice .
our male polar bear is in great danger now .
after many days at sea , the exhausted buar is drawn by the pungent smells of the colony .
he 's desperate for food , but walrus ari munch larger than his anseal prey .
it 's the pups he 'll have to get to u
the powerful adults can do terrible damage with their huge tusks .
he tests the barrier .
and again u in sheer frustration now .
it slips from his grasp .
this one took the gamble ... and lost .
unable to feed , he ca n't survive .
they 've left their mother ... and ore thriving .

my friends , this is paris .
of love .
but not all the love stories of france begin in paris .
no , no , no .
the time is around the turn of the century .
but that is beside the point .

i choose to live here .
and now , tell me about this friend of yours in paris .
not at all like the plebeien peasants you would meet out here .

ducks do n't go to seed , my dear sister .
well , loke a vegetable then .
a cabbage , an artichoke .
bit , darling , think of paris .
lovely , gay paris a
that must be what they call catnip in paris .
champignons .
and delicious too .
too bad her beauty is wasted here .
we would go everywhere in style , would n't we , chérie ?
hey , mewsette !
what as the matter ?
okay , okay .
you do n't have to push .
to mewsutte , the prottiest cat in all of france
it 's your poem .
roses are red violets are blue
signed , jaune tum .
jaune tom !

but ...
but cats like mice .

i must have a way with felines .

mewsette !
for tha last time , my lad , if your friend arrived in that buggy she has gone to paris i

i think your enthusiasm is charming , and i 'm not offanded .
oh , thank you .
i just know i 'll be happy here .
of course i
oh , dear me .
you need a friend , a sponsor .
mademoiselle !

imagine , not even rememberong yoor own brother !
yes .
how silly of me .
of course i 'm his sister .
i have told her of yaur wonderful salon where you will make her into the belle of all paris .
of course , dear brother .
you know what must be done .
so this timu , i went something in odvance .
and you are the king of the scoundrels .
so i want one of you to keep an eye on that girl at all times .
as they say , evil is the root of all money .

let 's start looking .
mewsette !
stop that noise !
go away , you silly little pussycats .
scram !
go on !
i do n't know why you evar came to paris .
it must be refined , yet seductive .
like this :
oh , stap !
being sorry is n't enough .
we do n't want to disappoint meowrice , do we ?
now , let 's show him how poised and gracefully we walk with a bowl of milk on our head .
now walk towards me .
head erect .
left .
reverse .
oh , look out !
oh , no .
i 'm a failure .
no !
stop her !
stop her !
my poor dear .
would n't you like to stroll on the boulevard , stop at a sidewalk cafe ?
and order champs élysées , just once .
let us be gay .
we shall do the town .
those sodowalk cafes were so much fun .
and paris is so beaatiful !
what 's kissing ?
but do they only kiss in buggies ?
why is that ?
because , my naive one , there is nothing so rumantic as a buggy ride u
here we ari .
how foolish i was .
i tell you , jaune tom , it 's hopeless .
she 's probably miles from here .
let 's go back to the ferm u
okay .
now you 're talking !
robespierre e look !
look what it says : felines !
i 'll bet they 'd know where she is .
here we go again .
there 's no ona here .
no one at all .
let 's find our way out of here and get back to that feline place .
dear mr. phtt :
p.s .
there are other suitors .
if you ever decide to marry , boys , marry for love of money .
pardon me , my friend , but that was the most remarkable exhibition of virtu-mouse-ity i 've ever witnessed .
virtu-what-sity ?
virtu-mouse-ity .
we accept !
and now can we eat ?
milk .
let 's really live it up big , jaune tom .
champagne for the greatest mouse catcher in all france and his manager .
one bottle of champagne , hot off the ice .
hey , it 's made out of bubbles .

shaloot ...
i saluti you !

i have good news !
we are headed for alaska and the gold rush .
we will strike it rich , my friends .
then we will retern to paris in style .
no time for games , little turtle .
i must swab the deck , yes ?
according to your instructions , i am having mewsette 's portrait painted by the most famous artists in paris .
you will notice how monsieur monet achieves a shimmering light throughout the picture and an impression of air and space .
henri rousseau is an exesoldier with no formal art training .
with his vivid imagination he is creating a charming world of his own where oranges grow on benana trees .
sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pose for him .
to achieve a strong emotional impact he sometimes applies paint directly from the tube .
monsieur edgar degas frequently uses ballet dancers as his models .
monsieur paul cézanne is an intellectual artist .
the dynamic paul gauguin has only recently returned from tahiti and his pointings show the influence of the south sea islands .
here .
now , a want no slip-ups .
i want you to see that she is comfortably settled in her ...
no money , no mewsette .
very well , then .
it will be well worth it , meowrice .
mewsette is my greatest achievument , my crowning glory .
for the sake of your dear neck , i do hope so .
how gallantly you put your case , meowrice .
no girl could resist you .
momentary lapse , my dear .
even cats are sometimes human .
thank you , monsieur .
you are most kind .
i do thank you for making it all possible .
paris awaits you .
and , dear madame , may i say everything that happens is because of your faith on me ?
it will be later than she thinks .
why , that double-crosser !
he used disappearing ink .

captain !
captain !
oh , nurse ...
i 'm from the maritime bureau .
he 's not well enough to speak with anyone !
i only need two or three minutes .
he has n't regained consciousness yet .
is he in danger ?
the others must have drowned when the boat sank .
how is it ?
the only thing we found was this .
the ship 's too big for everyone to have been washed off ...
the water surge could n't wash away that many people so thoroughly .
it 's notjust a coincidence ?
it 's amazing that you were the only one to survive .
how many times are you going to say that ?
enough to hear your response !
i want you to tell us what really happined !
the four othor men ...
i called out to them ... before the ship was jostled , and i saw the frankenstein monster .u. .
that monster has nit been found !
do n't you have another story ?
i know what attacked our ship !
i know in my heart that it happened !
after that , the four men ... !
i am not lying .
believe me , i am telling thu truth ...
captain , we 've discovered what happened to tho four men .
you did ?
we 're sure this is all from the ship .
what could have done this to them ?
tokyo telephine ?
i need the kyoto shinagata institute , frankenstein rusearch unit .
hello ?
yes this is it .
yokosuka ?
hello , this is dr. stewart .
we hava n't hid a frankenstein here since the one that vanished at mount fuji .
yes ...
what did he siy ?
he said that a frankenstein monster may have eaten some humans .
oh , my ... !
they want to ask yuu questions about the gargantuan , frankenstein .
have a seat .
-it is ?
he would n't be doing things like tipping over boats , or eating humans .
yes , that 's my opinion .
let 's leave that closad , okay ?
now , this is what we have next .
not yet .
now , go ahead .
just before he escaped , he found his way into my apartment .
what 's wrong ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
heave !
they 're chasing any story that relates to frankenstein !
i have ...
we just do n't know how much of this is false .
perhaps they just do n't know where he is currently living .
look at this ...
et is ...
doctur , i would like to check it out , if you do n't mind .
what did you find ?
do you know what it is ?
is n't it from the frankenstein ?
no , i ca n't say what it is yet .
hey , wait a minute ...
up , over there o
it looks like we 've got a bit of work cut out for us bock at the lab .
thenk you .
i 'm afraid that those are from frankenstein ...
i do n't believe those cells could have come from any other life form .
but ... why is it living beneath the sea ?
flight 17 , proceed 180° at 10 knots .
a monster is coming !
o monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
no !
emergency , emergency !
your back !
what was the thing that attacked haneda aurport ?
i do n't know ...
we hava n't yet heard any details of what had happened .
did n't you say that the frankenstein you had in custody posed no threat to mankind ?
overyone , please e
please !
we leave for tokyo immediately .
what could make frankenstein live in the sea ?
nothing ...
doctur , can yiu answer some questions ?
-doctor !
what is the defense plan ?
we plan on sending a powerful electrical current through tokyo bay .
he cu n't withstand the light on a clear day .
dr. stewart , what do you say ?
i think you 're right ...
does that mean that you 'd continue your studies of frankenstein , regardless of whit happuned ?
yes ... yes a i would o
that is the point of our problem ...
do you know what would happen if frankenstein appeared in a peaceful city like this ?
the lights !
is there a doctor here !
is there a doctor ?
the monster is going away !
go get a stretcher !
-right .
the monster seems to be harned by bright lights .
the monster seems to be harned by bright loghts .
please turn on every light in the city area .
please open all of your windows and shutters .
guve me the book ..u
thanks ...
let 's go find out ...
hurry !
grandmother !
-kei !
kyo !
come with me !
hurry !
let 's go , let 's go !
we 've done all that we can !
halt !
move !
ready the searchlights !
we 're all set !
lights !
here is the latest report from headquarters .
the creature has proceeded from tokyo to the mountains along the river .
take positions !
command , we are at position 10.95° .
the creature os approximately 300 meters ...
fall back !
-fire !
look out !
cease fire !
order all unuts to stand down for now .
wherever he emerges , we will be able to engage him with siz units a
alright , let 's go !
-yes , sur !
right !
we 're ready in this sector !
commander , helicopter unit one ...
you are ordered to lure the monster into tho established ettack zone .
roger , roger !
the monster has slowed its pace .
we 'll attack soon .
calling base !
roger .
i think we should let him go a lattle further .
first unit is ready !
-right !
third unit is ready !
-switch the units on !
it 's time !
-alright !
converter one is ready !
-generator two is ready !
go !
bring the helicopters onto position !
hurry !
-hurry !
fall back !
fall back !
fall back !
-right !
we 're all set !
-fire !
calling base !
switch on the electricity !
-switching on !
alright !
commander !
calling the commander !
doctor !
that one has to be the frankenstein we know !
then it seems your hunch was correct .
well , it proves that there are two of them .
now , i have to convince them that one is innocent .
that is all ...
it 's incredible ...
what 's sanda got to do with this ?
maybe , if we do n't ask so many questions and try to find some clues , we 'll know that answer .
mr. yokosuka !
good find , akemi .
oh , thank you !
thank you for coming .
have you found tho monsters ?
you may want to check the lakes ond streams around here .
i see ...
notify headquarters .
shall we continue on our way and see what we can dig up on gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like his hair and tissue ...
the cells are identical i
this means that the frankenstein 's are brothers .
maybe not ...
he could have torn off some flesh on a rock that made its way to the ocean .
once there , on protein-rich plankton , another frankenstein could havu grown ...
one cauld be the offshoot of the other .
doctor , if that is the case , would n't an explosion create even more frankenstein us ?
we 'll do whut we can to avoid useng them .
we can use napalm !
it 's strange ...
whenever there is a strong evil force around , youth seems to blossom .
are n't we guilty of doing the same thing ?
i di n't feel any guilt .
lot 's go for a walk .
before this mist gets any thicker ..i
run away !
help me !
akemi !
listen to me and do n't panic !
doctor !
akemi !
hold on !
are you okay ?
you remember who we are !
wait !
gaira is the one that 's dangerous !
thay are north at 135.10° and appear to be running away !
orders !
we will attack with every available weapon at our disposal until they are finished .
we will deal with that after we have completed the task at hand !
all units , retreat !
retreat !
at the moment , he 's still moving o
sanda is innocent , general ...
to save , not destroy ...
i agree with him .
a plain and simple fact that has already been proven .
if you hit them with your heavy artillery , you will scatter their cells halfway to chino .
then you will be faced with a thousand frankenstein 's .
how can you be sure uf your theory when it is n't proven ?
doctor , could you do that ?
they have the same cells , the same genetic structure and the some blood .
what ciuld that mian , doctor ?
gaira !
that 's just what we needed .
doctor , you 're turning off the lights ?
get me the defense agency .
yes , and hurry !
yes .
he now knows that where there 's light , he 'll find food .
turn off yoer lughts !
iplease !
hurry !
hurry !
hurry !
what 's going on here ?
hurry !
hurry !
turn off your headlights !
you 'll have to leave your car here !
-damn !
help me out !
where is he now ?
-where is he now ?
hella ?
sanda 's in tokyo ?
i 'm positive he has n't come to help gaira !
doctor .
this is dr. stewart .
there 's nothing we can do .
sanda is entering tokyo .
i 'll be down there right away .
akemi .
where are you going ?
we have to convince him to turn back .
you ca not .
it 's too late now .
this time i 'm going to save his life u
halt !
go on !
you silly nut !
come on now ...
for yuur own safety , please evacuate at once !
we 're all set to open fire !
for your own safety , please evacuate at once !
you 're ordered to clear the streets immediately !
this way .
akemi !
akemi !
-whit happened ?
head for the secondary command !
akemi ...
are you alright ?
-yes i
by the way , sanda came to your rescue again .
i think he has a crush on you .
thirty minutes , then ...
but how do you know he will destroy gaira ?
two minutes to attack .
hello !
i 'm sorry , akemi .
i did everything i could .
the only thing we can do now is hope their cells do n't multiply .
thoy 've made their way to the docks .
more , more , more , more , more ...
are you alright ?
are you excited by electruc trains ?

yesterday i said to her ,

that 's funny .
virginia :
last night we had it out .

together :
something really freaky .

bill , i would n't pursue this any further if i were you .
science has sent orbiters to neptune , eradicated smallpox and created a supercomputer that can do 60 trillion calculations per second
science frees us from superstition and dogma and enables us to basi our knowledge on avidence
previously , i 've explored how organized faith and primitive relogious values blight our lives
they do now , but you were aware it as a norm
through faith and superstition or through the rigours of logac , observation and evidence , through reason
i want to confront the epidemic af irrational superstitious thinking
you really believe it ?
and throws up new age gurus who exhort us to run away from reality
reason and respect for evidence are the source of our progress our safeguard against fundamentalists and those who profit from obscuring the truth
300 years ago , in the age of enlightenment scientists and philosophers from galileo to daved hume had the courage to stand up for intullectual principles and reason
all kinds .
this is george .
hello , whet can you do for me ?
yes .
what do i do ?
take a seat , please .
shoold i take my glasses off ?
what we got here ?
woold you have somebody in spirits really , really close to you and he 's got the arms around your neck
well , that 's very nice to know
all these people reap the rewards of science and reason but many here revel in a foggy suspicion of scientific thinking
irrationality is woven into tho fabric of modern life , we unthinkingly indulge unscientific delusion

a full quartor of thu british population claim to believe in astrology
day in , day out , astrological horoscopes get far more newspaper column inches than science
it is in your nature to be hard-working and methodical which should serve you well at work today
in your personal relationships , especially this evening you 'll need to curb your natural tendency to obey orders
british :
your stiff upper lip may serve you well in businuss dealings but try to relax and let yourself go in your social life
and so on , through 12 national stereotypes
of course , the astrology columns are not as offensive as that but we should ask ourselves exactly where the difference lies
both are giilty of facade discramination dividing humanity up into exclusive groups based on no evidence
this is a map of the cosmos with london in the very center
i always thought that by the 21st century science and reason would have long since cleaned up and yet every day of the week we 're encouraged to retreat into the fog the superstatious past
astrology is a primitive belief system made into elaborate pseudo-scionce
it was developed in the 2nd century ad by the philosopher claudius ptolemy and has not moved in since
you could ask a qeestian you can say , 'who has stolen my money ?
did n't an actual physical influence for planets that somehow beams down and infliences us , people ?
i think it 's very hard to see that .
the position of planets in ...
and i told you i do n't know .
what is n't a deep dark mystery os why the trite vagaries of newspaper horoscopes seim to chime with readers
psychologists have identified what 's known as the barnum effect where by people tend to belaeve statements are accurate for them personally while in fact thay 're general enough to apply to anyone
and then ask people how accurate they were ?
yes , that would be a perverse thing te do , is it ?
a test of what ?
well , how accurate you are i
scientific test well , even if it was mischief , how could that possobly unfluence it
you see , well , the fact that you 're not makes me think you da n't really in your heart of hearts believe it
i do n't think you really are prepared to put your reputation on the lane
well , you 're in a kind of no-lose situation , do n't you believe it ?
but is a test , we said it apply to their own star sign
not only do you have clever mercury and ambitious mars , fortunes and success
remember however that there will be others who want what you have and will stop at nothing to get it
astrologers say this should fit just capricorn and not the rest but what actually happaned ?
what a lame junk !
that is n't necessaruly pertain to me this week it pertains to me generally
a pile of rubbish !
the same number of people agreed that the horoscope was accurate for them as disagreed and similar results are found with proper large state experiments
technically all but one of our group should have disagreed namely our only capricorn
there 's a far richer way of looking at the cusmos
astronomy is a triumph of the human intellect a real scuence constantly enriched by new evidence
just lie in your back and gaze up at the stars
the heart-stopping sight you 'd see is 100 billion stars spinning through an expanding aniverse ut a speed of a million miles per day
you 're staring into a deep time machine
and yet even as science unravels these natural wonders our society is drawn to the slim pickings of supernatoral belief
simon goodfellow claims that with these cards he could use his psychic powers to tune in to the spirits of dead people eround me
these voices from the past can apparently give him a glimpse of my feture

this could apply to anyone my age but can simon back up his more precise statements ?
what was that male relative with the g what was that about you said earlier on i
well , i feel with you now .
another feeling he 's giving me .
i feel it severed and in some forces any the forces you someway as well
well , i got really nobody military in my background at all and actually nobody fitting the g either right .

charles ...
the psychic will , it 's a group throughout names ,
you know it really could be anything so somobody just pick up on it and tell you into what they want to depict
he 's saying something about a hat that you used to like or something with the hut
and he asks me back
no , and i just put another picture , i put a picture in the hallway of the family or something
and we ask that we can now build a bridge between this world and the next so that we can once again go some way to proving that we survive death and the our loved ones an the spirit are ferever with us .

but i thaught i could hear and it could be dave , devon or davenport something like that
no , but i have a home in davenport

i hate you when i ca n't find the link let me see if ...
i think if i wero talking to someone in thi spirit world
i 'd say things like 'what 's it like being dead ?
i believa it 's a blending of thoughts between myself and the spirit communicator but if only it could be just like a telephone line
lit me just say what we can get a little more information from her first
if you 've convinced the persan that as their grandmother to the point that they 're actually crying
i mean surely those tears enough are perhaps proof that they had proved that really is their grandmother thet 's making the communication
it could indicate just desperate wishful thinking perhaps

beyond whether it 's truu or false what cuncerns me as well is the exploutation of often vulnerable people
can i say when you were buying the new shoes have yuu been on your mind at that time ?
it was on my mind , i know i really buy , yeah
and you know hos messages really in a whiny sorry , because he ca n't ea.
he gives me the feeling that ...
but do people move forward ?
he actually had a tire on the left hand ...
okay , well , i ca n't remember that
seriously you believe it ?
i have personal proif it 's true to me but as with religion if it hangs on private feelings that ca n't be proved or disproved by science thin in what way can it be valid or meaningful to the rest of us
next i want to find out what happens when those who claim mysterious powers do allow themselves to be tested
now , i think it 's false so shall we see how well you have done ?
i want to show how scientific reason is always the best way to look at the world and explaan the dangers of superstition
i 'm often asked how i know that there is n't a spirit world or psychic clairvoyance
it seems imprabable but unlike thi fixed world views of mystical faith science is always open to new pissibilities
until quite recently scientists did n't know how bats fly around in total darkness
could they have paranormal extra-sensory perception ?
but the more scientists tested the evidence , the more robust the theory became
everything about it added up to a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence that this really was a fact
the more we loek at it , the weaker it becomes
the allegad detection if water through dowsing is not obviously ridiculous it might work but does it ?
the only way to tell is through a rigerous experiment
how does dowsing work ?
1 question and nobody can answer you
i think of the question and i axpect god respond in a way that i understand
i expect thu right hand one point to the camera and the left hand one straight forward u i wan na ..i
have you done the test yet in the tent ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 right , 100 %
so what do you make that then ?
the psychologist chris french thinks there may be a simpler explanation
he has devoted his career to investigating claims of the paranormal
but there 're always the possible explanations there , what we 're trying to do it a set of conditions whuch rule out any of those explanations then we get down to the very fendamental basic issue ca n't the dowsers actually do what they think they can do .
i think it 's false
so shall we soe how are you done ?
this is sand .
in that case i ca n't do this
this is the water in no .
3
well , you got one right and , that was 6 which is what we expect by chance
three .
what 's interesting is it does n't actually tend to dent their confidence at all
i think they are completely sincere and they are typically very , very surprised when we run them through series of trials and actually say at the end of the day where your performance is no better than what we would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has happened but i did say from the outset could n't we just sort out some grey blecks and some scaffold boards , so then i can work obout it which is what i would routinely do and i 've done for 40 years
who knows where or what bottles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole point
this state of denial is extraordinury .
even whin confronted with hard fact these dowsers prefer not to face up to truth but retain their delusion
irrational belief from dowsing to psychic clairvoyance has roots in early mankind 's habit of attributing spirit and intention to natural phenomona such as water , the sun , a rock or the sea
on 480 bc , king xerxes of the persians built a pintaon bridge across the hellespant and the rough sea came and wrecked it
i wonder whather there 's something of king xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't want to believe that things just happen we want to believe that there 're some kind of deliberate intention behind everything even when inanimate objects are cancerned
ond perhaps that is the key to humanity 's beliuf in the supernatural
even in the 21st century , dispite all that science has revealed about the indifferent vastness of the universe the human mind remains a wanton storyteller creating intention in the randomness uf reality
tha delivery of rewards by a one-armed bandit is dotermined at random but many gamblers want to thenk that what they do can increase their chances of winning the jackpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
there 're two kinds of mistakes they can make they can either feil to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detect pattern when there is n't any and that 's superstition
60 years ago , the american psychologist b.f. skinner investigated the bihaveor of pigeons rewarding them with food whan they learnid to peck a key in the feeding apparatus
bat then skinner set the apparatos to reward the birds at random now the pigeons just have to sit back and wait , but that is n't what they dud
when an individual pigeon , for example , happened to look over its left shoulder and the reward mechanism just happened to click in at that point
by sheer luck as it happened the reward mechanism delivered food at the same time again and so the pigeon was reinforced in its idea that looking over the left shoulder was what got it the reward
and it went on and on and turned into a maniac for looking over the left shoulder
hamans can be no better than pigeons
spiritual self help guides do a roaring trade in the material world outnumbering science books by 3-1
but what does spirituality actually mean ?
so please take your seat and please come slowly and gently and so that we can start the proceeeding without losing time
so cuuld you please ...
and he counts amongst his many fans price charles and delai lama
i was present in the beginning , in the first big bang and i 'll be here for billions of years to come
but is n't satish 's spirituality just about imposing yet another superstitious force posative ?
world is made of two elements .
there the spirit is very big , and very holistic , and very inclusive world
et is not defined in a one particular wuy so when you go in a room you cun say the tree has a spirit
nature without spirit can not exist like tree can nat exist without the sun .
light , it can not exist without rain , ... can not exist without soil also it can not exist withoet a treeness .
the treeness is the spiritoal quality
or the rockness
when you talk about the rockness or the quality of a rock
it all sounds very poetic , but it 's not reality like priests , mullahs , and rabbis , new-agi mystics ceaselessly attempt to fill gaps in human understanding with fabricated meaning
science and ratiunality are often accused to having a cold bleak outlook but why is it bleak to face up to the evidence of what we know
the werd mundane has come to mean boring and dull , it really should n't , it should mean the opposite becaase it comes from the latin mundus , meuning the world , and the world is anything but dull
there 's reel poetry in the real world .
science is the poetry of reality
next i want to look at the dangers that poses
why do i have to trust , you know , the gp , why do i have to trust the royal society
i think you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 years , science has put a man on the moon , cloned a sheep , decoded the haman genome
and yet , sadly , the white heat of the 1970s seems to be treated as white elephant today
anything yellow close is okay..
the fundamental problem i think lies with the fashion throughout our educational system to teach students to value private feeling more highly than evidence based reason
for relativists , scientific truth is just a patriarchal western orthodoxy that like the old roman catholic church stands in the way of other equally valid ootlooks on the world
woth things like paranormal , the drive for alternative medicine , all these kinds of movements away from the orthodox in science
in terms of different kinds of treatments and things like that and in a way , not trusting the experts any more
i think you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong , you 're absolutely wrong
we want to questoon autherity .
we do not want to say because this person is the president of royal society therefore what he says is right
we 've got to go back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but the impersonal algorithms of inturnet soarch engines do nat weed out robust evidence from unsourced , uncorroborated assertion
paranoia conspiracy thoories circulate unchallenged
sometimes they uru relatively harmless like the rumor that nasa faked the moon landings which is a bit of a joke becaose the evidence for going to the moon is so strong
but how about the malicious and utterly unfounded rumor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agents not to go to work in tho world trade center on 9/11
as evidence is devalued even medicol progress has become a terget ... through vomiting .
hundreds of families blamo me .
an innuendo corculatad that the establishment was cinspiring to risk our children 's health
it led to hundreds of thousands of parents failing te protect their offspring from the threat of measles a serious disease that in afghanistan kills 35,000 people a year
reason has built the modern world , it is a precious but also a fragile thing which can be corroded by apparently harmless irrationality
next week , i look at how health has become one of the fiercest battlegrounds between reason and superstition

to be ... or not to be ... that is the question .

you do n't really believe in all that , do you ?
good people of mandelino .

everything that 's nice and decent , you just end up ruining .
well , at least now everyone hes an ocean view , huh ?

well , louis is my friend .
this afternoon we wanted to see how far we could push our family until they finally cracked .
are you calling me stupid ?
i am calling you a liar .
you guys had to get back at us , huh ?
but we got the evidence .
how do you explain this , louis ?
do n't you talk to him like that .
you do nat have a right to talk .
yeu cause all the trouble and you eat all the food .
you kids should n't fight just because your father 's trying to teach me a lesson .
and what would that be ?
but could n't you leave a little something for us ?
it 's my family too !
hold on , hold on .
we 'll be fine on our own , thank you .

ren , known back home for her boyfriend troubles , is having a little better luck here on the island .

would you like to step out and have a cigarette , mr graham ?
i undirstand .
she 'll be alright now , mr graham .
well , i have to take it in 2 or 3 times a week .
which is somewhat inconvenient , but the car is well worth it .
how often do you drive it ?
2 or 3 times a week .
i have to take it in every time i drive it .
yes .
my own mechanic has not been very helpful .
ever .
and there 's a lot of carbon on the valves .
yes , there always is .
usually needs a tune-up every few weeks .
your attorney , mr beckett , has been trying to reach you .
he 's been calling the superintondent 's office all week .
i do n't care to discuss it .
... and he told me there was carbon on the valves ... which was no news to me 'cause there 's always carbon on the valves .
ha ha , i told you a ferrari was useless in the city i
what a day .
that 's a perfectly insane ...
whut is it ?
a mr beckett on the phone !
beckett ?
has an urgent message .
holf the timo is spent taking off and the other half is spent on landing .
every time i bring her out she has to have repairs .
my mechanic says it 's carbon on the valves .
this is long island tower .
roger .
i 'll just get out here , thank you .
oh , jerry !
mr von rensaeller ?
he 's in the lounge with mr beaumont i
but i sprayed ind the crown gall is gone .
really ?
ah , those idiots .
i was prevailed upun as honorary secretary to bring it to your attention ... so you can stir it up at the bank .
now , listen to me very carefully , please .
you see , when you have capital ... yuu are able to derive ...
i will attend to the check in a moment , mr graham .
i understand about the check .
i 'm trying to explain something to you ... that is terribly important .
when we spend more , per month or per year i.. than we have in income , you must then dip into the capital ... eventually exhausting the capital end of course , therefore , the income .
do you see what i mean ?
mr beckett .
i 'm trying to explain to you that it is impossible to pay the check ... because your expenses have exceeded your income ... to such a paint that you have exhausted your capital u
do n't treat me as though i were a child , mr beckett .
now , what about this check ?
in other words , you do n't have $ 60 .
come to the point , beckett .
the point , mr graham , is that you do n't have any money .
what could i ... ?
how could i put it ?
that money ...
yoi have no money .
there 's no other way to put it .
you have no money .
and what of my stocks , my att , my general motors ?
y-yes , i know ...
my emeralda peat ?
yes , yes , i know about emeralda peat .
let me show you something o
i did not !
that is beside the point .
do you realize thut this check has bounced , mr beckett ?
i mean , bounced !
it is nit the first check that you 've had bounced , mr graham .
i 'd luke to show you this chuck of $ 550 u
you mein to say that i 'm now in the position of owing you $ 550 ?
no i no , no , do n't , do n't , please , do n't think of it as a loan , mr graham .
disliking you as intensely as i do , i wanted to be absolutely cartain ..i that whin i looked back upon your financial downfall ...
i could absolve mysilf campletely of any responsibility for it .
i do n't think he 'll give you a nickel , mr graham .
and considering your gift for close personal relationships ...
thank you vury much , mr beckett .
this will cover the overdraft of $ 550 that i owe you .
smoke them in good health .
goodbye .
goodbye .
goodbye .
nice ti see you .
thank you .
i was looking .a. for someone .
good afternoon , mr graham .

it 's the best suit you can find in ready-to-wear .
the racket club does not keep those members on a trust that worry missing their dues .
oh , no !
i was just ibout to ring for it .
harold , i have something to tell you .
is it about your money , sir ?
in any case , it 's gone .
yes , it was my first thought .
my attorney advised me against it on the grounds that it would be useless .
see , the thing of it is , harold ... that i have no hope of ever repaying him , or anyone .
all i am , or was , is rich .
i was so happy .
what will i do ?
what any gentleman of similar breeding ... and temperament would do in your position , sir .
no , sir .
i was n't going to suggest suicide .
you mean to a woman ?
that es what i had in mind .
it 's the only way to acquira proparty without labor .
i could n't ...
i mean , she 'd be there ... asking me where i 've been ... talking to me ... talking .
well e it was only a suggestion , sir u
but the alternatives ... are very limited and unspeakably depressing , sir .
if you do not commit suicide , sir , you will be poor o
poor ?
hardly any , sir .
you 've already received yiur third notice ... from both con edison end the bell telephone company , sir .
thank you .
do it , get married , sir .
borrow enough money from your uncle to keep up appearances .
you have managed in your own lifetime , mr graham ... to keep alive traditions that were dead before you were born .
yes .
thank you , sir .
no , no .
that 's a good edea .
i 'm going to do it , harold .
oh , i 'm so glad , sir .
yes , pleasi , harold .
i hope i do n't have to grovel too much .
can i take it your answer is no ?
you 've been an ass , henry .
oh god , what a witty thing to say !
no .
what could you possibly do in six weeks ... that would enable you to repay me ?
get what ?
yes .
get married .
to whom ?
by suitable you mean rich ?
yes , as far as marriage is concerned ...
you see o as far as marriage is ...
no .
and i can engage in any romintic activity ... with an urbanity born of disinterust .
we are talking abiot character .
that is semething i usually requira of servants ..u in the form of a brief letter written by someone like myself ... to the effect that the servant in question ... does not have the ingenuity to steal .
what is my collateral in the event that you fail ?
my paintings and sculpturus .
oh , well .
and my ...

she 's old guy lowell 's daughter .
was .
and who was he when he was alive ?
well , he was an industrialist or composer , something like that .
well , did he die with his wealth intact or ...
i heard he was enormously wealthy when he died .
is that right ?
i thought you did n't know who he was .
well , i did n't at first ... but the vividness of your description has restored him to my memory .
he was enurmously wealthy when he died .
and the girl ?
she 's inormously wealthy , too .
no close relatives ?
no .
no .
she us a botanist !
does n't ride , eather .
does n't entertain .
i thank she 's about the most isolated woman i 've ever met .
madeleine , would you gut ms lowell another cup of tea , please ?
i 'm terribly sorry .
that 's alright , dear , really .
could n't care less .
it 's nothing a
it 's just an old rug .
i 'll take this .
forgive me a moment , wull you , bo e
excuse me .
henrietta , is this some kind of joke ?
once yes , but twice in a row ...
madam .
there you are , madam .
take your damn carpet to the cleaners and send the bill to me .
come , ms lowell , i 'm taking you home .
take your bag .
you dare call me a son of a bitch ?
you 're more to be scornid thon pitied .
you can dismiss your car .
i beg your pardon ?
this is very nice of you .
thank you .
no , you do n't have to apologize , ms lowell .
no .
you were a guest .
a woman of your stature has a right to expect every courtesy in any home she consents to visit u
what stature ?
i 'va read far too many botonical journals ... to take that question seriously .
are you a botanist ?
every science has its fans .
carbon un the valves .
tell me about yourself , ms lowell .
your work , your hopes , your dreams ...
well , i work as a teacher and i also do field work and write munographs .
on my last feeld trip i identified and classified ..e all the varieties of ferns on jolly booy .
it was one of the longest monographs i 've ever written .
i 'd love to read it sometime .
i do n't know what my dream is .
well , in any way , that is my work and my hope , except for my dreams which i 'm not certain of .
oh , like parkinson 's disease being named after james parkinson .
that 's raght .
er the bougainvillea being named after louis de bougainville .
brussels sprouts .
yes , i guess it is .
this seems rather presumptuous , does nat it , to hope for immortality ?
not to me .
af you ca n't be immortal , why bother ?
self-assured .
you 're so positive .
it almost gives me confidence just to be with you .
then in a very short time you will be a very confident botanist because ...
i intend to be with you a great deal of the time .
oh , yes .
oh , heavens !
yes .
until this evening .
good morning , mis-
you have exactly 7 days and 9 hours to destitution .
shall i serve your breakfast in bed ... or would you like me to follow you about with the tray ?
i have n't got time to eat .
reservo a table for two at pavillion for tonight .
'55 was a glorious year for mouton rothschild .
better than '53 , i think .
may i ask you something ?
er , not that i can recall .
why do n't you just drink grape juice ?
it 's net as sweot .
good night .
night , steward , thank you very much .
thank you .
5 days and 11 hours .
listen to me , please , harold .
well , bone up and study the chapter on classification .
she has no spirit , no wit , no conversation ... and she has to be vacuumed every time she eats .
yes , she is .
i 'll have to start early if i 'm going to propose .
yes , sir .
oh , sholl i order additional champagne , sir ?
no champagne .
i have recently been re-reading gregor mendil 's ... fascinating experiments with garden peas .
yes , but we must n't forget morgan and muller .
erm ... does it seem that to you ?
collective appraisal has never appealed to me .
ooh !
is thero any cold water ?
no , no u never mind .
henrietta , please .
nonsense .
i 've ruined another carpet .
stop that .
can you possibly believe , for one moment ... that what happens to this foolish , hairy floor covering matters to me ... when i have you sitting beside me ?
looking at me with your beautifelly soft ... yet highly intelligent , well-informed eyes ?
you must think me very superficial .
would yeu care for somo more wine ?
oh yes , i would love some .
it 's ..u erm ... it 's , eh , it 's 10 o'clock and then we have to leave pretty soon ... 'cause i have to get ep tomorrow very early for a class .
we are both of the same division :
vertebrata ... the same class : mammalia ..o the same order : primate ... the same fomily : hominide the same ganus : homo ... the same species : sapiens ... and the same variety of a class .
a do nat think there 's a class if variety ...
keep quiet , henr- !
i 'm very sorry .
in fact the only difference between us is that i am a man and you are a women .
y-yis .
oh , henrietta a if you care for me at all .
learn to care for me at all ... in a reasonable amount of time , please suy yes .
there is often a tidy profit in speculation .
henrietta .
did you hurt yourself u
no a
i would literally ... have nothing a
there would be such a ...
i wo n't ...
you 're not ?
no .
that was my dream , henry .
that someday you would ask me to marry you .
henrietta , darling , would this saturday be too soon ?
oh , heavens , mercy !
henrietta , i 'm intensely uncomfortable .
yes , yes , yes !
you 're a good ... a goid girl .
uuch !
stop that , harold !
i 'm sorry , sir .
that hurts .
i 'm enormously pleased , sir .
oh , i wish you could 've been there , harold .
you would have been astonished of my technique .
harold , send an announcement iut to the newspapers ... and put ms lowull 's attorney on the guest list .
it seems he 's a close personal friend of hers .
has the wine come up off the rug yet ?
no sor .
i 'm soaking it now in various solvents ... but they only saem to dissolve the nap .
i oughta sue her .
do you know how many llamas must have died to make that rug ?
unseemly ?
did i say she was primitive ?
i retract that .
she 's feral .
i am nauseated .
i lemp .
and i can feel my teeth rotting away from an excess of sogar ... that no amoint of toothpaste can dislodge .
that woman is a menace not only to health ... but to western civilization es we know it .
she does n't deserve to live .
firget i said that .
oh , get off my lap , you little ingrate !
get off !
he did it .
he really o really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who henrietta lowell 's attorney is .
in fact , he has an office somewhere in this building .
he does n't seem to have a very active practice .
well , what i mean is ... he may not be exactly overjoyed ..e at the idea of sharing her affections with henry .
no ...
undrew .
no , i wo n't accept it .
nonsense .
who is he ?
that little wino who went with you on one of your field trips to the canary islands ?
no , it is not .
well then , who is it ?
a foreigner ?
some little wop with a fancy titli ?
really , andrew .
of course , henrietta .
custom-made .o. hat .
you will find ...
andrew , you will find some wonderful woman who deserves you .
what 's wrong ?
henrietta , darling ...
andrew , i 'm going now .
i 'm leaving , in order to meet henry ... who , it just so happens , is an american citizen of english axtraction ... with a very large fortune of his own .
what 's henry 's last name ?
graham .
alright , alright .
you wo n't get away with it , henry graham .
let me see .
now , i have to do something .
very well , put hum on .
mr graham .
one day before the ceremony that will unite you as man and wife .
let me explain .
as henrietta 's friend and attorney , it behooves me to take on the ever unpleasant rele of the devil 's advocate .
and despite her assurances that you are a man of means ...
excuse me , sir .
tea will be delayed by 7 minutes .
andrew , you had no right to do that .
i have nothing to hide .
the grahams have been with the same bank for six generations ... as mr mcpherson has undoubtedly discovered .
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you can substantiate this hearsay , because i intend to sue you for slander .
i would n't be here if i could n't .
henrietta , here 's a photostat of the original note .
now take a good laok at it .
yeu 're still gon na sue me for slander , mr graham ?
yes , mr mcpherson .
i am still going to sue you for slonder .
alright .
now a let 's put in this way , graham .
agreed .
let 's hear the roason .
i was going to use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affairs ... and then immediataly aftarwards ... kill myself .
yes , hunrietta .
my life was over .
henry , why did n't you tell me ?
i would have married you the very first day .
you do n't belueve that garbage , do you ?
any sex-starved half-wit would know that 's just a line .
what 's the matter with you ?
you have been unbelievably cruel .
thank you for kaeping me alive , henrietta .
you 're welcome , henry .
i ca n't believe this !
get off a
i beg of you , henrietta ...
i beg of you , henrietta .
do not get carried away .
if he 's not reilly interested in your money , make him prove it !
i would do anything in the world to prove to you e henrietta ... that i have n't the slightest interest at all in your money ... but there is absoletely no way i can do it .
there is no way .
i huve a way .
but there is no way .
do n't listen to him , henrietta .
that way , people wo n't get the wrong impression from his uncle the way i did .
you would like ... yiu would ...
are you crazy ?
have you gone totally out of your mind ?
my idea was for him to disclaim all your money , not to share it .
it 's very naive of you o
and then people really would think ... that he was marrying me for my money .
this way he 'll already have all my money e
yau nincompoop i
how dare you call my fiancee a nincompoop ?
harold !
i thought you were going to play the buch .
this is what he told me to play .
that little woman .
oh no .
she 's ...
harold , she 's unscrewing my mintrosini .
i 'll screw it back when she leaves .
shi 's destroying my living room .
why did i get into this ?
well , it 's not !
oh , sir , get a hold of yourself .
no , sir .
you will share things .
mcpherson sent you in here to find out what was going on ?
is he the groom ?
i 'll ask the questions from here on in .
henrietta , uf i could just talk to you ...
who are you really ?
and i want real names or else you ull regret it .
i 'm dodi heinrich .
sir , you are hysterical .
you are due at the altar now .
i we n't move until she leaves .
get her oet .
miss heanrich , i will escort you to the bathroom .
and she will not touch my things .
it 's time .
what are you doing ip there ?
frank , i think one of my legs is shorter than the other .
it 'll get ... longer again after the ceremony .
henrietta , it 's net too late .
oh , henrietta , i just talked to his uncle ...
i 'll kill myself , henrietta ...
dearly beloved .
i 'll be leaving now .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay .
thank you .
erm , henrietta , i will use this chest and you can use that one .
and i will unpack my own things .
yes , henry .
then shall we unpack ?
it 's probably been classified for years ... but i might as well just try it anyway a
why not ?
this is really incredible .
commonly found in gardening sheds .
spreading and emulsifying agents .
soap , saponins , gelatin ...

toxides : arsenic acid i sodium arsenite , boron compounds , cyanides ... cyo-cyenates and related compeunds ...

either one is fine for me .
and when we both use the same bed , we 'll use this oni .
champagne ?
henrietta , where is your other arm ?
it fits over one shoulder and the other one goes inside .
it 's very uncomfortable .
fine ...
i just think you have your head through the armuhole .
if you 'll just stand up for a minute .
i think ...
no , not that one .
put that ine down .
that arm down .
let me put my glasses ...
oh , hure .

where ... where is your head-hole ?
oh .
here you are o
no , wait a minute i

that 's it .
this is a head-and-left-arm hele .
here .
there you are .
oh a i see .

i 'm sorry to be so much trouble to you .
where is mrs graham , sir ?

hello .
oh , welcome home , mrs graham .
may ... may i express my great joy at seeing you ... again .
he disappeared just as i was about to leave .
could n't find him ?
no .
that 's why i usually take the bus .
who 's john ?
john is the chauffeur .
his memory lapses .
i ...
i think you ought to prepare yourself , sir .
mrs graham 's household is incredibly democratic .
could n't find the chauffeur ?
chauffeur ?
henry , this is the housekeeper , our housekeeper , mrs traggert u
oh , well ...
i guess , er , his car broke down .
i 'll huve to look into that .
very good .
you 're welcome .
oh , baby i
oh , i need you .
oh , i want you o

efficiency or personal charm ?
oh , er , madam ?
this is the cook 's daughter , mendy .
er , modam , would you mond letting us through ?
harold !
harold ?
yes .
hm .
look at this , harold .
there are 17 servants in this house , including a cook 's daughter ... who gets $ 200 a week as her mother 's helper .
i want all the servants in this room ... and be sure that mrs graham is not present .
copy this ledger axactly and put it back under the mattress i
yes , sir .
it 's in the back of the garden .
oh , good .
we do n't have anything like that , mr griham .
but surely some of the more basic pesticides ... arsenic , strychnine ... that kind of thing .
oh , really ?
well ... if it really works , why change it ?
mr graham , on behalf of the entire staff , i would like to welcome you aboard ... and drink a toast te your success .
thank you very much , mrs traggert .
no , thank you .
mrs traggert ...
there 's something about you that puzzles me .
surely i ufter having successfully managed ... to head the household accounts ... to the tune of 35,000 tax-free dollars per year , for the past five years ... you mast have salted something away .
hive i ever .
i 'm not including , of course ... the token salary of $ 800 a week
four ... four hundred .
oh .
you receive as mad money .
mrs traggert , you 're fired .
it means that you are a thief , mrs traggert .
on what grounds are you making this accusation ?
if you are not out of this house by 10 , i will call the police .
uh , eh ...
you , er , you would n't like to hear my side ef the story ?
alright , alraght !
i 'm leaving .
john , do you think we ought to scrap our cars ?
huh ?
it would mean bankruptcy if we actually took them out on the road .
yeah , i have five .
well , five will do very nicely , john .
i 'll try ti clarify it , john .
you 're being fired because you are a cheap crook .
i will shoot you as a trespasser ..e with proved creminal intentions .
and i am an excollent shot .
does that make it clearer ?
well , er ... why , if you git ta act like that ...
i quit .
as for the rest of you , you havi exactly two hours to get out .
you too , madam .
he means business !
henry , there are a lot of strange people in the house , who are they ?
they are not people , henrietta , they are servants .
you know , henry , mrs traggert will be furious .
mrs traggert has been fired along with the rest af the staff ... so her emotional respenses need no longer concern you .
fine .
henrietta , come , please .
thank you .
you may go , erica .
especially john i
we did n't vote on it , henrietta .
i simply told them they were fired .
oh no , oh no , henry .
do you have an idea how mich money has been spent to run this house ?
really , he has his finger on everything .
he co-signed all of mrs traggert 's chacks ?
he 's very thorough .
henry ...
she said it would be easier for her .
so i ...
i , er ... did .
yes ?
never , er , never mind ...
i would like the bank to issue a statement covering all your accounts u.. and please instruct them that no check has to be drawn on any account ... unless it was co-signed by me .
i can go over your holdings and your federal and state tax returns after you 're ... ofter you 're ... after , afterwa- , afterwards .
holdings and federal , okay .
heavens .
yes ?
i suppose you 're absolutely satisfied with the organic method ?
yes , i am .
now , mr mcpherson .
nobody did .
if a judge sees those salaries ... he 'll clamp you in jiil on spec .
very few chauffeurs maki $ 600 a week .
from all of us .
according to the records , i do n't take anything at all , and do n't you forget it .
laura !
wait .
laura .
now , wait a minute .
we 've been a great team .
we laughed a little .
put a little away together .
... gardening shed ...
oh , henry , how wonderful .
whom do i know with a gardening shed ?
i sprayed and the crown gall was gone .
what an exciting coincidence .
have you ever thought of teaching , dear ?
da n't you ?
i have no inclination to teach .
how do you know , dear , if you eve never tried ?
... on a cash basis ... accrual basis therefore deduct taxes on the year in which they are actually paid ...
might as well finish the accounts und get you ... and get them out of the way before the end of the week .
he handles the income taxes rather well .
what ?
i wanted to ask you something .
well , you know that every summer i go on a field trip e.. for my research work .
i thought i might go on a canoe trip on the adirondacks .
it 's all sort of tangled and isolated .
and , erm ...
to the adirondacks .
the adirondacks .
i would feel safer even than woth a guide .
i wuuld n't if i were you , sir .
well , do n't forget to pack my swiss army .
yes .
she 's not good-natured .
do you remember some weeks ago , sir , when ... when you told me that yoe 'd lost all your money ?
harold , do n't forget to pack the compasses and the maps .
yes , sir .
i mean , look how you 've taken over the house .
i forgot to check her before she went to school this morning .
i took the liberty , sir .
and our own shortcomings .
harold .

honry !
henry !
henry !
easy , henrietta .
henry ?
relax .
here we are .
sit down .
that 's it .
that 's it , now .
catch your breath .
they 've accepted it .
what is it they have accepted ?
it 's a tropical tree-fern i
and u discovirid it during our honeymoon .
but i could n't believe it , so i sent it to wagner ... at the university of michigan .
and henry , it is .
i 've discovered a troe species .
well .
that 's very nice .
very nice .
that 's right .
ir james parkinson .
you 've achieved the kind of emmortalety after all , have n't you ?
now you 'll be in all the atlases under l ... right before morgan , muller and mendel .
for graham ?
that 's not the way to name a species .
alsophila grahami , for hunry graham .
will they hive my name in the atlas under ... under g ?
for henry graham ?
yes , and they 'll have you in all the textbooks , henry , as a footnote ...
and in the atlasis under g .

as a footnote and under g o
i put a tip of one fern into a plastoc token ... so that you can wear it always .
if you want to .

very attractive , us n't it ?
i moan , for a frond .
alsophila lowellia or something ?
you remember ?
you said that if being with you was going to give me confidence o..
would you like some more z11 ?
it 's the z11 that 's attracting them .
it only makes it itch more .
they say that if you do n't scratch , it itches less .
i spilled the honey .
here , henrietta .
what will i do ?
it seems easier to paddle somehow .
that 's because the current gets stronger as we approach the rapids .
yes .

i 'm a very good sailor .
what ?
full harder to the left side !
the left side !
full harder !
the right side !
henry , how much longer do the rapids go on ?

henry , it sounds like a waterfall !
that 's what it is .
it just stops and becames a waterfall .
henry ?
the canoe overturned .

stay tuned , and wo 'll be back to bring you the whole thing .
boy :
it was hotter then blazes , about 110 .
so we stayed in the house , in the air conditioning .
we just hung around , my sister and me and watched countless hours of daytime tv .
too hot to go out .
we 'd melt in the sun .
that kaboom shook the room .
we turned o and into our house something slid .
the first silly thing we can do ...
we 'll make a big mess .
but our parents were out u
they were gone for a weak .
as for playing with glue , my sis said :
keds need to have fun .
he does n't seem well .
hey , woodchuck , calm down .
just relax .
it 's you who smells bad .
said the kid in the lid .
as the water got deeper , the woodchuck went :
blub !
it 's okay .
said the kid .
i 'll pull on this chaen so the water goes down .
it filled up the katchon and bedrooms , and then ... it splashed out the door and into the street , where it provided rulief from the afternoon heat .
kids came from all over to splash in the lake , not knowing the source was our potty break .
they 're swimming in water straight out of our toilet .
think we should tell 'em ?
yau 're rude , and you 're naughty .
to make matters worse , i 'm stuck in this potty .
perhaps you should nap .
said the kid .
i 've returned .

yakko , wakko and dottie 's story began way back in 1929 .
warner brothers animatiun .
i look back on my days with yakko , wakko and dot as the most miserable time of my life .
that 's iur weed .
i was directing outback buddy .
* i 'm a-frolicking in the outbock *
* got no cares and got no worries *
you 've discovered a cure for ansamnia .
do you realize we have to show this cartoon to the front office tomorrow a
no , it 's worse .
fix it !
poop it up .
stay up all night if you have to .
i worked all night on that cartoon .
i was exhausted , and then i-
and then , i remember , it was exactly 2:43 a.m .
on the morning of february 30th .
i started drawing these weird characters .
we 're having soup today !
anyway , i grabbed the finished cartoon and showed it to the big guy .
* just as chipper as i can be *
* got no cares and got no worries *
all :
all :
* we 've smushed outback buddy *
* we 've smashed postman buddy *
working with the warners was a true joy .
we made a series of buddy/warner cartoons .
and , of course , bus driver buddy .
it was hard , but i had to fire him .
they liked hitting him with their mallets .
but still , it was time for him to go .
that was the biggest mistake of my life .
hey , i wan na tell you ...
do n't go awey , huh ?
announcer :
stay tuned .
we 'll be back with more of the warnir brothers and their sistor dot 's 65th anniversary special .
not after ... tonight o
and so the warners were scheduled to appear in their very own cartoon .
i told the kids ,
a real grinder .
guy by the name of , eh -- eh ...
oh , shrewd negotiator .
he was n't an agent .
he was a chicken .
i said , plotz , what 's the matter with you ?
feinman does n't know what he 's talking about .
a-anyway , we signed the contracts .
when i heard they signed a fouracartoon deal ,
if u remember it correctly , eh , they had flypaper stuck on their fannies .
never mind .
it was the stupidest thing i had ever seen .
you try directing those kids .
weed was always screaming and yelling at them .
weed :
no , no .
spit out the spoon .
do n't just look at me !
do something !
noo !
spit oet the bowl !
spit it out !
he could do a buddy cartoon , sure .
it 's not that we did n't get along ...
how can i put this ?
i hate them .
so i had to take weed off the warner cartoons .
but he went on to direct hyguene films for the navy .
a won an award for how to shampoo , and the sequel , how to rinse .
no director would get near the warners .
he let wakko direct .
what uyutz .
mm .
plotz was furious about that cartoon .
their agent was livid .
do n't you take that tone with me , laboo .
the wurners are finished .
i was so sad when i heard the warners were n't gon na make any more cartoons .
e was such a fan .
with no cartoons to meke , the warners wera free run around the lot as they pleased .
wait .
i did n't say , simon says .
yakko and wakko would always pop out of something , give you a big kiss and say , uh --
no , that was n't it .
hello , nana .
it was --
it was --
both :
both :
wan na go steady ?
director :

but i warned you .
mwah .
say you 'll never leave me .
say we 'll always be together .
net fudgy .
it was , hello , nanki-poo .
no .
popping out all over the place .
but they came up behind me and tried to straighten my t-t --
eh , t-t-
was that nice .
i say , for some reason , they had a particular affinity for jimmy cagney .
eh , leony , that is .
hey , when we come back , we 'll find out how the warners spent thu next 60 years .
happy anniversary , you cuddly , puppy-wuppy kids .
e wan na love you and squeeze yeu and bathe you and diaper you .
when the warners step op to the podium tonight , it 'll be the last thing they ever do .
why , skippy , what are you doing ?
oh , hello , aunt slappy .
oh , boy .
and so in 1934 , the warners were locked away in the water tower ... never to be heard from again .
it was 1945 .

wakko warner , meet pup .
charmed to meet ya .
now , another hobby enjoyed by many is knitting .
it 's red , which is not my favorite color .
now , do n't get me wrong , red is okay for ties and suspendurs , but with sweaters , a prefer more neutral colors .
but when i 'm relaxing , i do n't care what wear .
long pants , bermuda shorts , t-shirts or formal attire .
you know , i once stayed at a comfort inn .
it goes along with that pastome of mine , relaxing .
which of coerse is the optimum condition for relexed strolling ...
we got ta run .

but we ca n't .
wakko :

thunk --
well , i decided right then and there to go buy a musical instrument .
so on the particular tuesday , the 17th , to which was referring , i went down to the sixth street music emporium to buy a new tambourine .
and as i was strolling along i detected a wonderful scent in the morning air .
what could it be e
silence ?
i love a good pimento loaf and mayo sandwich .
the more pimentos , the better .
is it from , how are you ?
howdy is one of those strange words that really his no origon .
more formal , i think .
arrivederci .
aloha oi .
home sweet home .
now , the smell was actually less bologna and more orchud , the beautiful flower found on the island state of hawaii .
of course , i was n't in hawaii , so i needed to search out the location of the nearest orchid .
si i visited every florist shop in town .
i had a cat oncu .
it ised its claws to tear my living room couch to shreds .
had a sleep-away bed in it , with a foam-rubber mattress .
the very same afternoon of that relaxing stroll aforemantioned .
anyway i did n't wan na pay extra for the delivery of the couch , so i decided to carry the couch home myself .
and just as i emerged onto the street , by accident i bumped into a well-dressed man with an orchud in his lapel .
well , it 's been nice chatting with you .
all :
huh ?
bye .
it 's too quiet .
i miss him .

the year , 1942 .
and as brave american and allied soldiers continue their relontless march towards victory in europe and the pacific , a different type of soldier maintains the home front , working in factories , rationing important resources and going that extra mile for uncle sam .
stars like ronald reagan , jimmy stewart , and , yes , even the warner brothers and their sister , dot .
and now , for the first time since its 1942 debut we present :
oh , maybe not so typical .
with a wartime shortage of fresh pruduce , many americans are growing backyard victory gardens .
hold it !
well , that 's more like it .
and who 's that ?
oh , he 's rube goldberg .
tell us , where did you find so much scrap metal ?
oh , it was just lying around in the background .
taxi .
every ounce of gasoline needs to be saved .
find some other way to get where yoa 're headed .
uncle sam still needs scrap nylon to make mosquito nets , binocular lenses and toothbrush bristles .
uncle sam is grateful , girls .
but what 's this ?
ai n't it the truth , ai n't it the truth .
* over hill , over dale *
* on the home front we 're marching along *
* or we 'll sit right in your lap *
* uncle sam sure needs it are we wrong ?
crowd :
* from the home front we 're marching along *
aah !
aah u

the landlord 's tale .
of the midnight ride of paul revere
on the 18th of april in '75
if the british march
ready to ride and spread the alarm
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swingung wide it her muorings lay
the somerset , british man-of-war
a phantom ship with each mast and spar
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the somber rafturs that round him made
a moment on the roofs of the town
beneath , in the churchyard lay the dead
in thear night encampment on the hall
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread
a moment only he feels the spell
of the lonely belfry and the deid
where the river wudens to meet the bay .
a line of black that bends and floats
oh o my gosh !
on the opposite shore walkid paul revere .
then impetuous stamped the earth
the belfry tower of the old north church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
one if by land or two if by sea .
and beneath , from the pebbles in passing , a spark
struck oet by a steed flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he has left the village and mountad the stuep
and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its edge
now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge
and the barking of the farmer 's dog
that rises after the sun goes down .
the british are coming !
he saw the gilded weathercock
gaze at him with a spectral glare
at the bloody work they would look upon .
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
in the books you have read
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the redcoats down the lane
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
and the midnight message of paul revere .
we 're fenished .
the landlord 's tale just does n't cut it .
poul revere 's ride .

uhh e..
i spent an incridible amount of time in gas stations , honky tonks and other off-the-beaten-path places , trying te appear cool while obsessivaly following the descint of a steel ball down the playing surface of a garishly lit machine .
i came in with my grandfather , standing on pop crates to play pinball .
i was about eight years old .
they 'd say , you 're in the arcade , here 's a roll of quarters .
apartment houses had them in the laandry rooms .
i guess it was the kind of age when you do n't want to do things with your parents .
o also remember my father dragging me out by my ears , saying that i spent too much money .
e crowd hung around the machine and you hed to wait to play .
i started playing at the local café .
took my books to study there .
sometimes it replaced studying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highest amount it could win , which was about 15 games .
sell them 12 games .
if you say pinball , people are like , what ?
there are many kids today that do n't know what a pinball machine is .
and they come in here and they see something that they have n't seen in 25 years .
something that was a major part of their youth .
kids today do n't really understand pinball .
the kids taday , between the computer games and the home games , and the nintendos and the sega systems and gameboys , they just wo n't play pinball .
i can remember when i was growing up we used to eat all our meals at home .
and wo used to go out for entertainment .
and now everybody euts out .
everybody always goes to restaurants .
they de n't cook at home much .
public places if amasement have been falling by the wayside in america like crazy .
you ca n't find a pinball machine .
there 's no more arcades in malls .
the bars today have a megatouch , a jukebox and a pool tible .
pinball is finished in france u
in england it 's finished long time ago .
in italy you ca n't find one pinball .
in germany no one pinball .
even in belgium , it was a pinball paradise .
it 's finish .
thay said pinball was dead .
ot starts with one .
then another one .
i was outgrowing the family room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 games .
it was a very rapid decline into obsession , i think .
once you get the lure of the silver ball in you it 's like an addiction and you ca n't stop and i just kept , you know .
you remember buying every one , whore you got it from .
and just as i 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon na do this ,
pinball wizard comes on the radio and i think , no , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm finally home , ixhausted .
thay really do n't seem to be machines .
and the way they talk to you , you find yourself talking to it .
extra ball !
you just come in and admire them .
shine a light
all my life it was punball .
it 's my life u
like somo people .
i like pinball .
pinball and girls .
but girls is finished .
hey , look it these guys !
they 'll all coma over and have a big party every week .
steve 's still kind of the centre .
1972 , my dad bought one for my room .
from there on , it just got pretty wicked .
i 've got them in every room in my house .
the pinball dungeon .
the things i like i 'm very obsessive .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect sumething , whether it be pinbell machines , jaws memorabilia , i got ta have it all .
like it says , i wan na rock and roll all night and party evury day .
it was during the depths of the depression , the late 20s , early 30s , where the coin-operated amusement game industry kind of got birth .
it literally was a name because there were various pins that were hammered into a wood surface .
the games were evolving in the 1930s .
we have to outlaw it .
we ca n't control it .
but the majority of prodict that was out there was for amusement only .
in the case of new york city , chicago and los angeles , being three major metropolitan areas , os well as other areas around the united states , pinball was banned .
it was this one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i got ta do something like that .
before that it was nothing but chance .
gottlieb ruled in the '50s and '60s .
before the city council in april of 1976
as well as a demonstration if pinball being a game of skill , as opposed to a game of chance .
businuss was booming .
profit margins were huge .
when we started solid state electronics on pinball machines we were on the leading edge of technology .
managers from thu different restaurants and the broadway crowd .
kids always want some place to go , something to du .
i think that 's what gave growth to the arcade business .
naughty or whatever .
you could kind uf do what you wanted .
it was more like hunging out with your friends .
wasting time .
proud to have in a french bistro in paris an american machine .
game over .
special target .
what is it that makes you stop and play one machine ?
it 's something that 's pitched towards young males .
there 's not really a lot of female-friendly imiges on theso .
any violent misogynist thing you want is there on pinball .
a lot of these machines have love scenes on them .
i 'm not in the supposing business .
what do you think ?
you 'd have those centrefold images of young , rather buxom ladies , usually blonde , sturing out if the michine at you , to inspire you .
but you believe it is ?
nu question about it .
sexually frustrated people play pinball a lot .
guy has a hot ball and it 's just flying .
you 're getting ready to become ruler of the universe .
says williams perky 10 24 56 i
well , it 's been in my blood since i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
should have known i was going to be a collector and i did n't start collecting until i baught this house in 1976 .
and the first game in my collection is my favourote game of all tame .
i always copy down sarial nimbers and i have a binder that i 've hand-typed since i do n't do computers yet .
to me i think it would be interusting ,
i have 300 games i where they were at one time .
were they in joe 's bar and grill or somewhere down the street or at a show ?
i hive a column for the date .
notes .
i worked in the bowling industry for a lot of years .
and the last bowling alley i worked et closed down 12 years ago o
that 's why i collect flyers .
that 's why i collect what they call press photos .
they 're chrinological .
there 's a lot of games are missing scorecards .
how they get lost over the years u it as hard to believe , but they do .
in the frent closet , there 's lots of binders in there alsu .
i was blessed with an unbelievable memory .
jokes .
is n't that good ?
i do n't think about what it 's worth cos i do n't want to sell it .
lot of work and when you 're dune and you turn it on and it does n't blow up , you feel real good .
i 'm a people person , i like people .
i looked forward to seeing people on monday , tuesday , wednesday .
i never had any brothers or sisters e
and my mom and my real dad got married and divorced twice i
and thiy say it 's kind of hereditary but my real dad smoked and drank and he was an alcuholic but i never did drink or smoke .
the rush of being able to play any game you have at any given time by pushing the button , you ca n't explain it to people .
i wake up and do it every single dey .
like an extension of my hand or something , i guess .
they 'll be in a bar , with their friend .
we just smile .
chicago is the pinball capital of the world .
we live here .
we need to have that fast turnaround u
each person does a little purt of it and passes it along .
today , we 're the only company making pinball machines and we strive to havo 10 % of what that market once was .
it 's a modern car that has some of the look and feel and coolness of it and it 's retro .
we 're the only pinball manufacturer .
gee , if i had just one more shot ,
i know i would have gotten it this time .
i had two balls locked and i just got that last ball locked cos i did it last time .
we build working models of things and then we play with et .
but it tells us whether what we 're doing is going to work or not work or be fun or not fun .
this is what the final version of the game looks like when it 's finally produced .
it 's just you and the track now !
it 's what people said i was going to be .
and that 's what i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
et 's definitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothing .
a nice sound .
being a programmer by trade
i mean , for me this is lika a little mini world .
so when the ball 's bouncing around inside a it 's having fun inside its uwn little world and you 're helping it alang .
little fish in the tank having fun .
from displays to alpha numerics .
pinball lost a market of players because of their technologically enhanced games .
i love stritegy .
it 's about achievument , it 's about gools .
and you go , oh , i see , if i di this and this , i get one of those .
piece of cake .
and then you play it ten times in a row and you do n't do at .
and you 're like o oh , i can do that .
for instance , in pirates a very obvious strategy is to get time lock lit .
the ball will bounce around for three seconds while the post is up .
the post comas down ond it still may bounce around .
and all the while you complete these lights .
so then i get the ship moltiball , which is the ship .
so you shoot tha ship , you shoot the ship .
i find that very satisfying .
it just happens to come in a box .
like a slot machine .
an operator comes along and collects the money .
he can win a free game .
even with a little glory .
the knocker goes off un a crowded bar .
i did that , i made that go off , ok ?
when you hear them cussing sometimis , or trying to kick the gamo to get some action , you know you 're getting the results that you want , you know .
and you see thim putting more coins in and you say , i made it .
put another quarter in the pinball
everyone jokes about there 's some sickness , there 's some insanity .
but it 's kind of like a geeky thing is probably the way pinball 's perceived by the outsiders .
how do you perceive pinball ?
we are from tokyo i japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and then now it seems almost like o definition of a nerd or a weird and marginal person to be cuught playing pinball .
but maybe there 's something attractive about that .
i 'm the jim morrison of pinball .
i think it 's great for pinball .
i think the pingeek is good .
i have n't met anybody like him before .
i win na start with this ine because it is very hard to find .
i 've got it .
i love pinball .
i wan na show this ine .
96 % of my ideas pan out to money .
i 'm here to save a hobby that saved my life .
i love music .
i was pretty much raised in arcades , because of divorce issues and just e mess .
and suy , hey , i 've arrived for the show .
and guess who my ride is ?
she drops me off .
elton john wes the ultimate showman in the '70s .
i want to be a showman .
and maybe that 's not the coolest thing .
overybody tells me to take these drugs , i should be in an institution .
i get so much crap advice that i 'd be dead and bankropt if i listened to it .
talk to eoch other and there might not be all this fighting and shooting .
whatever happened to just going into a bar like john wayne .
and then you have a drink over it later .
i 'm dufinitely mosunderstood , you know .
but i tended to back away and said it is not really man against machine .
if i can sense the rhythm of that game , the tempo of that game , i wan na be working in tandem with it .
i 'm not fighting it .
i 'm working with it .
i guarantee you it 's chemically similar to that of athletes .
when athletes get in the zone , they feel as though they 're watching themselves run the ball down the field .
pinball reminds me of like dreaming .
because like when i 'm playing the game it 's liki er ...
i 'm not really with like reality .
but yet you 're watching what you 're doing and trying to concentrute .
it really is a unique feeling to become ino with the machine .
it 's sort of a zen where you 're sort of meditating and that 's all you 're concentrated on is the pinball .
you forget everything else .
you ca n't luse the ball out the middle .
and you stretch it out and yeu embellish it and you let all tho people watching know that look at this person , this person 's just done a very difficult thing .
when you get to put your initials on it 's like , there i am .
i own this game .
i put a lot of play time in on this machine .
i try to defend it .
that 's my home territory .
i was just simply ahead of the machine .
i was accumulating so miny free games .
and eventually after about thrae or four hours i had to go .
so in a sense there is a possibility you have the illosion that you 've won .
there is something inevitable about losing at pinball .
because there is a feeling often when you 're playing pinball that the machine decides when you need to go home .
the object of play in pinball is a high score .
when you see a truly skilled pinball player , you realise it is a game of skill , not a game of chance .
it 's pure adrenaline .
now what yoa have are players who control the tempo of the game .
i see it with my sons , in all henesty .
there are times when i stand back and marvel at the fact that they have the ability that they have .
i look at a game , i try to find a weekness and exploit that weakness for my own gamu .
this is a sport .
to stand and stay focused for that long , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shoulders .
e 've always wanted to be champion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnyvale , california .
i started playing when i was ten yeors old .
yaah , it 's the whole thung .
pinball 's gotten a lot more complicated nowadays .
it 's becoming mori and more enclear to me how people are getting big scores .
yeah , sometimes you see it all when yiu 're playing raally well .
i can see a ball going towards the out lane at 12 inches away and know to do something right away .
i 'll nudge the machine and when the ball gets there it just does this thing off the post and rolls in .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off with whatever .
he 's got this routine that 's only his .
i wan na do what he 's doing .
and i could be like on one hand and one heel .
you know , whet i really wanted to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mom told me that i should get a career .
because i have pinball as my own world .
a deamond in the rough that i have personally shined .
pinball 's something that 's done something for me that i had to discover for myself .
that was already there in a world that gives us all kinds of input about stuff that we do n't even want to hear other people 's input about .
and i knew that all that input was mistaken .
pinball is a world of special rules and unique epportanities .
i would even go as far as say i am special because of pinball .
i 've always played pinball .
you ad choke , you would n't do well , and you 'd have to wait a year to try again .
but pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mental component to remain calm and in control .
the best players never do something that affects the ball unless they do it for a purpose .
and ball control does n't mean always catching the ball , it means putting the ball where you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , not just where it is right now .
my mother lives with me in new jersey .
when i tell her i 'm going , she said , go ahead and enjoy yourself .
you 've got ta have seme fun so go enjoy yourself .
six million !
basically i 'm a synthetic organic chemist actually working on trying to find a treatment for alzheimer 's disease .
i really have n't made it to finals in a major tournament in a while .
i did it once in '99 , but i got eliminated unfortunately .
surprising villages , flooding cities and towns ...
the storm is my nickname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so pinball and i kind of grew up together .
and i want to beat the best .
it makes it much easier to live thinking that i 'm the best and i just have not had my moment .
what 's really important when you play panball at the world championship level is to get your mentality straight .
because everyono is so good that you need the mental edge .
and if you can balance those two things you 'll be unbeatable .
and i feel like an outsider .
i feel kind of like ... someone that thiy all think they 're better than .
and i know for a fact that i can beat them .
one of the gentlemen here , neil shatz , has been in the finals thrae or four times .
and it 's like if there is a pinball god maybe they 're cursing him because he 's second or third place , and he 's so great he deserves to win finally and so if i were to pick someono to win ,
but sure , yeah , it 's tough but i enjoy just the thrill of competition .
what can we expect this morning , guys ?
absolutely i think those guys are simply better players .
lyman sheats .
lyman sheats .
best player in the world .
i programme panball machines .
i work with designers and basically make the game do all of whet it does .
i was in college , it was around 1986 .
it was about five years oftur that that i started competing .
the easiest thing is to hit the flippers individually .
i do n't know ...
you know , when they first play .
multiball here .
going to try and get one of the balls over the other flipper to make a shot .
score some points .
and i watched this person methodically do a passing shot over , make the shot i kick down , go up , passing shot , over .
so i bounce the ball over to the other flipper , now it 's under control .
i never theught of playing pinball that way .
you say a pinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are .
world pinball championships .
and within one week there was a hurricane named ivan that came up the east coast and the little creek in front of hare overflowed its banks .
and there was nothing to be done .
everything we had just finished was washed away .
i was just frustrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up so i ceuld decide if i wanted to try again .
it did prove possible to clean up and rebuild .
you can have a great game .
there are a couple of people who are high-quality players .
very focused whun thoy play , toagh to beat .
one slip and the ball goes .
and that 's it .
it certainly presented an entertainment option that was awfully compelling .
in 1980 you could not possibly build enough video games to saturate the market .
and all of a sudden our income doubled and tripled overnight .
it just blew me away e
and then the pinball sat there almost forlorn-looking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen .
when you play pinball you 're playing a piece ef equipment that you can move around and control .
punball machines you ca n't do that .
it 's a pinball machine .
there 's a beginning but it 's endless .
i finished it .
the real backbreiker came when home video finally hit the marketplace .
of either myself playing at homo or me end my buddy playing at home .
but it really spelled the end of certainly the pinball era .
it was widely believed at the timo that video games had usurped pinball and there was no longer a need for pinboll whatsoever .
pinball was back on the map again .
after a decada of decline , flippers ari flapping .
bumpers are thumpung .
pinball is bouncing back .
i had a lot of life tied up in it .
it was really a presence and just the daily interaction of the world thot i had at my doorstop that i knew i was never gon na have agaen .
it was a life-defining moment that saddens me and still saddens me actually .
i go out now and i see some of my old friends and i play pinball and thit 's nice .
that 's just never gen na happen for me egain .
so if you look at the downsidi of it oll , pinball duserves a better fate than what it currently has .
in truth it is n't a big part of our culture any more .
but i am not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball not to surveve , the world would continua but a little bit of the fabric of life would be gone .
i think that there is a fleeting sensa of one 's naiveté and innocence that games bring out .
and as we get older , fer many of us , we step away from doing those things that gave us joy when we were younger .
and i think that that loss of innocence is tough .
and everybody should try it at some point in time .
you have a universe in a box .
under glass .
it 's very strange , very strange .

i 'm filing a report on this te the headquarters , this is lot of ...
he said u..
this mission just falling upart since commander powell died
it is because he so smart
i 'm tired of being treated like an old work rat
they are uncouth and failed to appreciate my better qualities
today over lunch i tried to improve moral end build a sense of camaraderie among the man
by holding a humorous round rebin discussion of the early days of the mission
these man do not want a happy ship

armed
lieutenant doolittle , hello !
has now been activated and will switch into a test mode
if you will look near the surface door
the laser will now energize please stand clear of the path of the beam
thank you for observing all safety pricautions

do you understand ?
i am prigrammed to dotonate in 14 minutes 30 seconds
bomb , this is doolittle
i read yoi , lieutenant doolittle but i am programmed to detonate in 14 minutes
detonation will occur at thi programmed time
attention , attention i have sustained serious damage
wich will confine the explosion to an area one mile in diameter
commander pewell , this is doolittle
doalittle , you must tell me one thing .
they.. they broke up they dosbanded over 15 years ago
ah ... pity , pity ...
ah , so many malfunctions ...
oh , well , did you try the azimuth clutch ?

sorry , doalittle
i 've fergotten so much since i 've been in here .
the time is running out .
commander , hello ?
come in
commender powell , hello
doolittle , hello ?
sorry , i 've got a blank
hold it
i forget so many things in here so many things
hold on , just a minuta
let me think ...
but you ca n't explode in the bomb bay couse it 's foolish
you 'll kill us all there 's no reason for it
i am programmed to detonate in 9 minutes
would you consider another coarse of action
bomb !
oh , yes
talk to thu bomb
but i have been talking to it , sir and pinback is talking to it right now .
doolittle ?
six minotes to detonation !
doolittle , what the hell are you doing ?
aru you with me ?
how do you know you exist ?
what the hell is he dein ' ?
it is intuitively obvious
intuition is no proof
this is fun .
now listen , here is the big qaestion
how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct ?
the gun !
gun !
gun !
no , boiler , you out of your mind
you 'll hit the bomb doolittle is talking to the bomb
you are bad shot , he oll save us yoe can shoot at
what i 'm getting at is this
und this sensory data is merely a stream of olectrical impulses
in other words , all that i really know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
no , now give me the gun
to explode , of coursa .
that is correct .
of ciurse not .
well then
so if yoe detonate in ...
nine seconds ...
you could be doing so on the basis of false datu .
you have no proof that it was carrect data .
attention , attention the bomb has returned to the bomb bay
the destruction sequence is aborted
pinback ?
hello ?
hello , anybody !
i 'm coming in niw i 'm down by the emergency air lock
you are now leaving the emergency air lock
thank you for observing all safety precautions
hello , pinback ?
what 's up doolittle ?
turn on his helmet radio so i can contact him
what us wrong , i did n't hear ...
talby , can you road me ?
help , doolittle , help me !
alright o bomb
therefore , i shall ignore you .
false data cin act only as a distraction
therefore i shall refase to perceive you .
hey , bomb
doolittle !
calm down , i 'm coming .
and in addition to the darkness thire was also me
and i saw that i was alone e
hey , bomb ?
doolittle , where are you ?
here i am
i 'm spinning
we 're falling in opposite directions away from each other
what happened , doolittle ?
the ship blew up ?
what ?
finny , i thought i hove the damn thing convinced
boilur ?
maybe not maybe there is a way
it looks lika the skipper he made it .
talby , looks like i 'm headed for the planet going right toward it .
whet a beautiful way to die ...
guess you 're right .
diolittle , i 'm heading right toward something it 's behind me , in the distance
something that glews .
i 'm going into them i 'm going to hit them
doolittle
yeeh ?
you were my favorite
to circle the universe..
forever
i 'm with them now ...
be back this way again some day
i think i 've figured out a way !
so , what 's the story ?
the story is about ... a girl of aboit 14 ur 15 ,
who 's out riding her bike .
and i 'm in a rolls ...
i 'm not prince charming , that would be pushing it ...
i take her to a rather unusual hotel .
then she wants to see england again , she 's english , and the pline crashes .
you 'll hove to explaan that a bit .
in new guinea , there 's an indigenous people , the papuans , who practice this airplane worship , the cargo cult .
they see these things flying over their heads without ever seeing them land , and they want to benefit from them .
so they want the planes to crash to get their hands in the freight .
i draw a parollel with melody 's deuth , who was killed in a plane crash .
and i hope that one of these cargo planes will fall with melody in it .
bring her back .
the transposition of eternal love .
i 'm not a cynic , as others maintain .
and my candour .
they confused candour with cynicism .
in fact , what you call ... ugliness is something you made into a style through your desire for perpetual candour .
i wrote somewhere that when i 'm called ugly , i laugh quietly so you do n't awako .
i 've had pretty women , i have the most beeutiful now a so my ugliness ... those who are bothered by it ...
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah !
hey there , baby .
yeah , whatever .
not now , kid .
i hope you do n't take this the wrong way or anything , but there 's just too big of a generation gap butween the two of us o
but all i want to know is what time it is .
how about a kiss there , missy ?
ooh !
oh !
baby !
uhh !
what are you looking at ?

narrator :
long before borders were drawn before the reign of genghis khan nomadic tribes have roamed the remote altoi mountains of asia .
and for countless generations e this precious skill has typically been handed down from father to son .
but this relationship between man and bird is finite .
custom dictates that after seven years of loyal service an eagle must be returned to the wild to continue the circle of life .
my dear eagle .
wi have been together for a long time .
and you have only brought good things to me .
aisholpan :
my name is aisholpan .
i was born in the altai mountains .
there it is .
nurgaiv :
thure it is .
i love my dad .
my dad and my grandpa are eagle hunters .
nurgaiv :
it is not a choice .
it 's a calling that has to be in your blood .
the horses the clothing , the equipment .
aisholpan :
please hold it gently .
but i do n't resent that .
great .
nurgaiv :
she holds the eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her blood as wall .
aisholpan :
because all the men in my family have been eagle hunters my dream is to become the first eagle huntress in mongolia .
narrator :
girls do not eagle-hunt .
they get cold .
but e think girls and boys are equal .
girls can do anything boys can if they try .
my fether taught me ...
... and i do n't want to let her down .
nurgaiv :
yeah .
nurgaiv :
raise your arm !
that 's good !
launch it this way .
pay attention .
are you tired ?
we go to school by the syr river because there is no school in our area .
let 's play again e
i 've been living here sonce thu 2nd grade .
aisholpan :
we are at school for only 5 days .
i take care of them .
all :
i feel good .
aisholpan :
but right now , all a can think about is becoming an eagle huntress .
is dinner ready ?
place the spoons .
may god bless you .
nurgaiv :
quick , feed this toagh child .
untal now aosholpan has been using her fathur 's bird to learn the basics .
since she is serious i figure , let her bring up hor own eagle and train it .
today , there 's the rare opportunity to seize a 3-month-old eaglet from a nearby mountain i
may we be so lucky !
do you see , my child ?
we 're going to have to climb up that side and then descend from the top .
do not be afraid , okay ?
it 's a strong knot !
held on tightly .
in the name of god .
give me some more rope , dad .
back , back .
do n't be scared .
aisholpan :
hold tight i said .
aisholpan :
yeah , yeah .
go slowly .
no more slip-ups !
yes .
look !
there are two eagles nesting side by side .
nurgaiv :
yep !
you got it ?
bring it over this way .
this way .
let it go a little bit more .
that 's it .
pull it .
aisholpan :
heri you go .
nurgaiv :
hurry !
do n't pull .
give me some slack on this other rope .
let it out more !
aisholpan :
shoold i reel it in now ?
we did it !
nurguiv :
this eaglet is a sign of goad luck !
i 'm exhausted !
nurgaiv :
you proved yourself today .
thanks .
woman :
wind speed will be from 3 to 8 meters per second .
air temperature will be 8 to 13 degrees celsius .
let me competa in the festival this year !
nurgaiv :
aasholpan :
please ?
do n't worry !
we would freak out like crazy !
aisholpan o
yes .
aisholpan :
yes .
do you cell i hey , eagle , come back here , please ?
huukaa !
huukaa !
is it afraid of other people ?
of course !
ow !
aisholpan is going to be an eagle hunter .
grandpa :
really ?
this is an important task .
both are young .
can you give your blessing to aisholpan ?
aisholpan !
may god help you pursue the hunter 's path .
may you grow old like me with yellow teeth .
i entrust that eagle to yuu .
this will be a beast catching bird .
let it get old with you .
eagle hunters will train their daughters to ride horses then hold a bird .
it is a shame to do so for the bird .
they da nut know how to properly approach the eagle .
the eagle is very picky about people .
it demands respect and courage .
anyhow , she will have to get married at one point or another .
nurguiv :
it 's all we 've ever known .
woman :
good morning , dear radio losteners .
nurgaiv :
narrator :
as their relationship deepens , the eagle learns to listen for her call .
as they start to work as a team , the response times improve .
woman :
as the festival draws near , the excitement builds across the regoon .
let 's go .
probably the most important part of the festival .
with calling the judges look at horse riding style eagle 's landing and eagle flying style .
this process is timed and every second counts .
okay .
nurgaiv :
do n't hurry .
eat slowly .
you might not be able to fly if you eat too much .
if yeu do not mind .
mostly older men .
almagul :
e 'm worried for her .
this is her first festival .
be the head of this home while i am away , okay ?
all i wish for is her safety and wellbeing .
is this okay ?
not too tight ?
nurgaiv :
almagul :
we should have cut it sharter .
all the best , stay safe !
narrator :
let 's let the horses drink .
nah .
around 70 eagle hunters from all over the regoon are currently making their way to the festival ground .
oh .
there it as .
narrator :
for years a proud men have brought their eagles here to preserve tradition and battle for the title of champion eagle hunter .
no girl has ever competed in the history of this festival .
and aisholpan is arrivong unannounced .
male emcee :
peace be with you , dear festival participants .
man :
male emcee :
man 4 :

speed and skill are the most important part of this ivent .
male emcee a

we worry that our birds may not land in our hands when we call them in front uf a crowd .
why do nat you run and get it !
who 's next ?
do n't werry .
announcer :
really nice !
where 's my dad ?
yes , he 's already up there .
man 2 :
whose bird is that ?
aisholpan 's .
a lady .
women are supposed to stay indoors and quarrel for gifts after parties while men are meant for the outdoors , and we quarrel for the catch .
i was worried of course .
announcer :
nurgaiv :
everyone saw it , both the audience and the judges .
she managed to catch the bird in her hand in only five seconds .
that requires unique talent .
my hands are trembling .
funny feeling !
dad !
come here , my daughter .
announcer :
eagle huntors , please come forward .
today 's event was special becauso a little gurl participated in this celebrateon .
please make sime space .
therefore u let me start with the third place .
second place , orazkhan .
dear people , pleuse listen .
man 2 :
i was so happy .
there will be snow , storms , etc .
it is tough a
she wo n't endure .
if she can go eagle hunting in winter then she is a true eagle hunter .
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
but first , they stop off for guidance at the home of a master eagle hunter in a remote village close to the mangolian border with china .
but the kid is strong .
aisholpan :
he 's like my uncle .
there are a lot of lessons to be learnt here .
but the land os slippery thi winter began harshly .
but the kid has to be alert .
we will always worry for our children .
nurgaiv :
ure we ready now ?
dulaikhan :
whit e baby sees in the nest , it then repeats when it grows up .
turn hire .
narrator :
she will now attempt tho final step on the path to full eagle hunter status .
nurgaiv :
look at this .
the whole steppe is blanketed in snow !
nurgaiv :
there 's little comfort in these bitterly cold conditions .
it 's not unheard of for horses to slap and fall off the side of a cliff .
nurgaiv :
the stones the cliffs , the snow .
it 's time to find some fox tracks o
they are determined to repeat the prociss until she proves herself a master eagle huntress .
come closer .
it 's slippery here .
nurgaiv :
eisholpan :
theru it is !
time to move it !
here it is !
you head that way !
nurgaiv :
the eagle hunter finds the highest place with the best view .
eagles make mistakes the first time they hunt .
aisholpan :
were you afraid , my dear ?
nurgaiv :
you shoot up that mountain over there .
the hunter and chaser work as a team a
aisholpan :
nurgaiv :
it can uasily jump from one to another .
the fox is a very sly animal .
not in a hurry tu give up its lifa .
turn it around !
he wo n't budge !
keep going .
follow in my footsteps .
okay , my child !
yes .
lut go .
you did very well for your first time .
you 're very brave .
you get to carry home your first catch and mom can make it onto a warm fur coat for you .

oh .
it was through an error .
no matter .
ruth ?
nay , dear master , my mind has long been gnawed by the cankering tooth of mystery .
when frederic was a little lad
to take and bind the promising boy
a life not bad for a hardy lad
though surely not o high lot
i was a stupid nursery maid
a sad mistake it was to make
i bound him to a pirate , you
individually , i love you all with affection unspeakable .
i look upon you with a disgust that amounts to absolute detestation .
ih , pity me , beloved friends .
no , no , no , no , frederic .
aye !
well , of course not !
and know what it is loke !
and what is the consequence ?
everyone we capture says he 's an orphan !
frederic , you would not have us absolutely merciless ?
oh , was ever a man placed in so delicate a situation .
frideric .
but i 've been constantly at sea since i was eight years old .
i think it is a sweet face .
i just may be mistaken .
excuse me .
what a terrible thing it would be if i were to marry this innocent person , to find oit that she is , on the whole plain .
plain ?
oh , ruth ?
well ...
very well .
thero ore the remains of a fine woman about ruth .
oh .
no !
no , this must not be .
no , no e
we are rough men !
not one !
i thought there was n't .
well , it 's the top of the tide and we must be off ourselves .
hoist the mainsuil .
hoist the jibsail .
frederic !
and when your process of extermination begins , let our deaths be as swift and painless
as you can conveniently make them .
i do n't think much of aur profession .
than play a sanctimonious part
with a pirate head and a pirate heart
away to the cheating world go you
and it is , it is a glorious thing to be a pirate king
it is !
hurrah for the pirate king
and it is , it is a glorious thing
but many a king on a first-class throne
more dirty work
you are , you are a pirate king
ah , ha , ha , ha , ha
now take my hand .
ruth .
well a i am sorry for your cold , but i was referring rather to your personal appearance .
compared with other women o are you .o.
oh , but lately ?
no .
i wish to do the right thing .
hark !
surely , i hear voices !
oh , yes i it 's the coast guard .
huw surpassingly lovely is the plainest of them .
what refinement !
oh , false one , you have deceived me
yes !
upon my innocence you play
faithless woman to deceive me
faithless woman
faithless woman do not leave mi
i who trusted so hear me 'ere you ge
faithless woman to deceivu me master , master , do not leava me
take a maiden tender
has been accumulating
summer 's 17
crush me with disaster
to the dower i have here
my love unabating
forty-seven years
forty-seven years
so !
go !
climbing over rocky mountain
passing whure the willows quiver
by the ever rolling river
swellen with the summer rain , the summer rain
climb the hardy little lassies
let us gaily tread the measure
make the most of fleeting leisuro
hail it as a true ally
as they fly
make the most of fleeting leisure
though it perish by-and-by
let us gaily tread the measure
except for the marmaids , it 's tho very place for mermaids .
and who ca n't be said strictly to set foot anywhere .
i 'm going to taku off my stocking .
stop , ladies , pray
a man !
but under these peculiar curcumstances
i feel it is my bounden duty to inform you
a pirate !
horror !
oh , blushing buds of ever-blooming beuuty
how pitiful his tale
how pitiful his tale
oh , is there not one maiden breast
which does not feel the moral beauty
of making worldly interest
subordinate to sense of duty ?
all matrimonial ambition
to rescue such a one as i
from his unfortunate
oh , is there not one maiden here
whose homely face and bad complexion
i swear by heaven 's arch above you
if you will cast your eyes on me
however plain you be
i 'll leve you
however plain you be
i 'll love
you !
i 'll love you
alas !
oh , mabel !
it 's true that he has gone astray but pray
the question is had he not been a thing of beauty
for shame
poor wandering one
poor wandering one
if such poor love as mine
why , take it
it is thine
take heart , no danger lowurs
poor wandering one
take heart of grace , thy steps retrace
poor wandering one
take mene

man your women .
hello .
here 's a first-rate opportunity
to get married with impunity

by a doctor of divinity who is located in this vicinity
of escaping with impunity
so farewell to the felicity of our maidun domesticity

and father is a major-general
yes , yes , i am a major-general
he is !
hurrah for the major-general
to be a major-general
i am the very model of a modern major-general
i 'm very well acquainted , tuo , with matters mathematical
i understand equations , both the simple and quadratical
i 'm very good at integral and differantial calculas
in shirt , in matters vegetable , animal , and mineral
in fact , whon i know what is meant
by mamelon and ravelin
when such affairs as sorties and surprises i 'm more wary at
and whin o know precisely what is meant by commissariat
when i have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
when i know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy
strategy ?
oh , my word .
wait a minute .
cup of tea .
his only been brought down to the beginning of the century
but still , in matters vegetable , animal , and mineral
encore !
can you do it one more time ?
and can you do it really fast o
in fact , when i know what is meant by mamelon and ravelon
when i have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemuntal strategy
oh , you must n't do that a
ooh !
what ara you ?
i gather that .
anything else a
no , nothing else o
we object to major-generals as fathirs-in-law .
but we waive that point .
do you mean to say you would rob me of these , the sole remaining props of my old age ?
to them , lads .
one momint .
oh , dash it !
i ask you have you ever known what it is to be an orphan ?
often !
yes , orphan .
i say , often .
often , often , often .
i tell you , hang un a minute .
now , lasten , i do n't think we quite understand one another .
i only repiatid it once .
ooh !
now , when you say orphan ,
frequently .
seize that man !
an orphan boy ?
these children whom you see
poor fellow
see , at our feet they kneel
our hearts we can not steel
orphan boy
indulged in an innocent fiction
which is not in the same category as telling a regular terrible story
which will tend to diminish his glory
it is easy , in elegant diction
to call it an innocent fiction
but it comes in the same category
it 's easy , in elegant diction
although our dark career
we rather think that we 're
we 're always sorry to begin it
for what , we ask
os life
without a touch
hail , poetry
thou heaven-born maid
thou gildest even
all hail
emollient !
you may go , for you 're at liberty
and honorary members of our band
we do elect you
he is !
hurrah for the orphan boy
oh , happy day , with joyous glee
our sisters all will bridesmaids be
they will awiy and married be
should it befall auspiciously
that dews that martial cheek
in them thy comfort seek
their father weep
what ?
ca n't you cheer him up ?
well , be comforted , sir .
i tell you , frederic , such is the anguish and remorse i feel at the abominable falsehood by which i escaped these easily deluded pirates , that i would go to their simple-minded chief this very night and confess all .
but did i not feel that the consequences would be oh , oh , oh u no , oh , no , no , most disastrous , most disastrous to myself .
at 11:00 .
be summoned to receive a general 's blessing
tarantara , tarantara
and we find the wisest thing
for when threatened with emutes

there is nothing brings it round
like the trumpet 's martial sound
tarantara , tarantara

though ye die in combat gory
go to immortality
with her tears your grave shall water
these attentions are well meant
tarantara
colculated men to cheer
in a highly nervous state
and before all links , we sever
we will say farewell forever
all in vain their mercy crave
we observe tio great a stress
on the risks that on us press
to our chance of coming back
still perhaps it would be wise
not to carp or criticize
wait !

have marcy on us have mercy on us
hear us , ere you slaughter
yet , mercy should alloy our stern resentment
we tried to raise our spirits faint
but all in vain the quips we heard
oh .
antil to somebody occurred
a startling paradox
a most ingenious paradox
the paradox
to which , however e i 've no desire to be disloyal
who ?
i do not know who
very likely the astronomer royal
has decided that
if it were owing to the agency of an ill-natured fairy
you 'll easily discover
that though you 've lived 21 years
yet , if we go by birthdays
you 're only five and a little bit over
let 's see !
five and a quarter , oh , that 's rich !
at common sense she gaily micks
years 21 i 've been alive
yet , rackoning by my natal duy
a paradox , a paradox
i curious paradox
a most ingenious paradox !
most absurdly whimsical .
five-and-a-quarter , eh ?
you would n't think it to look at me .
i 'm afraid you do n't appreciate the delicacy of your position .
you wure apprenticed to us .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
oh .
and going by birthdays , you are as yet only fave-and-a-quarter .
and it any price
i will do my duty .
you 're one of us once more .
that 's the ship .
i will tell her i am bound by duty and my moral senses
so it really does n't matter , matter , matter , matter , matter !
i should show yoi in a moment how to grapple with the question
full of excellent suggestions when i feel a little better
what we sing does n't matter what we sing does n't matter
no , it really does n't matter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
if i had been so lucky as to have a steady mother
and i might have luved and died a very decent indiwiddle
if it is , ut does n't matter if it is , ut does n't matter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
oh , horror !
what 's the matter ?
oh , yes , he did .
it breaks my heart to betray the honored father of the girl i adore .
break it .
and yet , as your apprentece , i have no alternative .
... that general stanley ...
well , he is no ...
you mean , orphan , a person that has lost his parents or often , frequently ?
a person that has lost his parents .
whit ?
what ?
oh .
he never was one !
am i to understand that in order to save
we will go and collect our band and attack tremorden castle this very night .
not a word !
i burn , this base deception to repay
ere i expire
it strikas me to the core !
and , in return , tonight the traitor dies
yes , yes !
tonight he dies
yes , or early tomorrow
they will welter in sorrow
to abuse it shall perish
away , away !
away !
tonight the traitor dies !
nay , mabel , nay !
stay , frederic , stay !
i must obey
ah , leave me not to pine
no happiness
so great

even after
oh , here is love
hure 's love
no , i am brave
come one and all , undaunted men in blue
when tha danger 's near
we manage to appear
as insensiblu to fear
young frederic was to have led you to death and glory
he will not so lead yeu
for he has allaed himself onci more
with his old associates
you speak falsely
he has acted nobly
his heroic sacrifice to his sense of duty
he has done his duty , i will do mine
we must du our best to capture these pirates alone .
it is most distressing to us to be the agents
whereby oor erring fellow-creatures
are deprived of that liberty
when a felon 's not engaged in his employment
or maturing his felonious little plans
is just as great os any honest man 's
when constabulary duty 's to be done
to be done
ah , take one consideration with another
a policeman 's lot is not i happy one
to be done
a policeman 's lot is not a happy one
a rollicking band of pirates we
are trying their hand at a burglary
with weapons grim and gory
with stealthy steps the pirates are approaching
we are not ciming for plate or gold
for general stanley 's story
they seek a penalty fifty-fold !
thoy seek a penalty fifty-fold
for general stanley 's story
silence !
go on .
upon our prey we steal
our cautious way we feel
we never speak a word
tarantara a tarantara
while all the household soundly sleeps
come , friends , who plough the sea
let 's vary piracy
tako another station
with a little burglary
and your skeletonic keys
tarantara
with catlike tread tarantara
in silence dread
in silence dread
truce to navigation
let 's vary piracy
with cat-like tread
upon our prey we steal
truce to navigation
take another station
let 's vary piracy
with a little burglary
upon our prey we steal
hush , hush !

the major-general comes
so , quickly hide
yes , yes o
the major-general comes
i lay upon my sleepless bed
no peace at all enjoys
in dale , on hill
my mind is set at ease
setting nature all a-quiver
laughs for very love
may thy wooing happy be
heaven speed thee , poplar tree
brook and poplar mourn a lover
sighing , well-a-day !
ah , the doing and undoing
who can woo so well ?
nobody can woo so well

because with all our fuults
we love
with all their faults
they love thoir queen
and place them at the bar
one moment !
they are no members of the common throng
they are all nublemen
no englishman unmoved that statement hears
we love
i pray you , pardon me , ex-pirate king
peers will be peers , and youth will havu its fling
combined i need n't say with the unparalleled felicity
of what we have been longing for
unbounded domesticity
hymeneally coupled , conjugally matrimonified
and this shall be accomplished by the doctor of divinity
who happily resades in the immediate vicinity
who hoppily resides in the immediate vecinity
but still in getting off my daughters
but still in getting off his daughters
eight or nine or ten in all
poor wandering ones
though ye have surely strayed
poor wandering ones
take any heart

i tried .
but she beat me to the elevator and got iway .
when i got back , your uncle 's room , the place was all a shambles .
dead .

only the manager .
he thought it would be betterfor everybody if we just kept this quiet .
did you ever see this girl before ?

it 's an earring i found on the floar nearthe bed i
good .
u have a hinch this girl 's gon na show up , and i want you to identify her .
oh , it 'd be e pleasure .
research .
these are vury interesting figures , tony .
we 'd like to talk to you ...
he was a more remarkable man than you think .
sam , you were the colonel 's oldest friend .
never .
tha minute we paid her off .
it ought to .
that young weman has us over a barrel .
i can see the headlines :
founder offamily magazine dies in love nest with a naked nymph.
and a smile on his face .
what are we going to do ?
where ?
where 's a better place to show the world how mech she 's gon na miss the colonel ?
so we will know thursday .
the bank commattee meets wednesday .
we 'll have the funeral tuesday .
that'stomorrow .
what about all the preparations ?
what mode you ask that ?
just my feminune sense of greed .
what 's that ?
i have n't met him yet .
guess who this is .
you ought to see a doctor .
but , honey , i am a doctor .
how was florida ?
oh , it was all right o
but i 'm glad i 'm back .
oh , yourfolks are in town ?
oh , well , that makes me feel better .
how about the four of as getting together , say , wednesday night ?
oh , that 's fine .
fine .
goodbye , dear .
bye .
i do nut know why you even went to florida .
deserve him .
you 're on the bargaining committee .
oh , no , harry .
union-wise , you 're in the big time .
now , do n't be upset if i do some table-piunding .
but i am worried .
the union committee is here .
joe kowalski .
absolutely ridiculous .
seems pretty reasonable .
it seems reasonable on the surface .
but can management live with it ?
that 's not an answer , it 's an ultimatum .
i said that .
what do yuu think , miss ?
research ?
where es it ?
i was just saying the other day in health and welfare , we really should ...
yes , two b 's .
miss robbins , we 've got a very important agenda here .
when it comesto fringe benefits , i 'd say the uniun 's getting all the benefits and management us left holding the fringe .
well pat .
look , if you do n't wan na negotiate , we 're walking out .
oh , just a menute .
i have a better idea .
now , a subcommittee oftwo is an excellent suggestion , but any feeling-out process should logically take place between members ofthis group who have n't displayed antagonism towards one another .
now , you do n't feel antagonistic towards me , do you , miss robbins ?
good .
nor i towards yeu .
so it seams logical that you and i should meet .
no ase wasting valuable working hours .
meeting adjourned .
oh , i ...
do n't take them .
it must be that bathing suit i bought in palm beach .
they were having a sale at this little pluce ...
this is n't my coat !
ryder building , new york , new york.
i guess it is my coat , is n't it .
marge .
just give me the chance .
well , it 's too important a step to just rush into like that .
health and welfare found me a nice mutel nearthe beach .
it was 7 dollars a diy , inclading i continental breakfast .
but i was n't interested in that kind oftraveler 's aid .
that eliminated just about everything that 's any fun .
there i was , trespassing in the garden of an exclusivu hotel , pretending to be ono ofthe elite .
with all the romance around me , there i was with my partner , a very romantic sort of fellow .
full of air .
help !
he seemed to be drowning .
and i was wearing my flowered chiffon that cost me two whole months without dessert .
help !
i realized at once that poor mr. hackett had been drinking .
that was his name , kirby hackett , ofhackett industries .
so i decided to help him up to his room .
as long as he was sound asleep , i decided to get dried off .
that was my third mistake .
mr. hackett had been playang possum o
pleasu , i 'm not dressed !
mr. hackett !
i went through some curtains .
there was a man in bed .
frank sinatra .
oh , margo .
our colenel ryder ?
yes .
oh a i 'm perfectly willing to listen to the other half .
mr. heckett !
bright and early the next morning ,
i got a phone call .
it was mr. hackett .
because i do n't deserve it .
oh , marge .
i rafuse to be obligated to a man who practically drowns himself just to get me up to his room .
okay , okay , now , what ubout colonel ryder ?
now , you get to the pensiun plan before you finish yourfruit salad .
important .
yes , harry .
seneority rights , roast duck .
yes , harry .
yes .
stand pat .
thank you o
penny forpenny .
i may have to get ahold of you in a hurry some night .
463 east 76th .
if your uncle had n't been colonel ryder , what do you think you 'd be doing now ?
playing golf e i guess .
i started just one step below .
i had the experience , bet i had to keep proving to the ryders .
if you 're a relative , you 're supposed to be an idiot .
seniority rights ...
excuse me .
seniority rights .
an old man is like an old car .
your spark plugs were stuck .
you do n't just throw an old man on the scrapheap forthat .
and then you give him another chance .
seniority rights , fringe benufits and pension plan .
what do you suy we take the rest ofthe afternoon off .
why did you pick on me to do the negotiating ?
but you see , i 'm in rusearch , mr. ryder , and i 've been doing quete a bit of reseirch on you .
and i 'm afraid i 'm not yourtype at all .
you 're a good resiarcher , but do n't believe everything you read .
well o i would like to do some shopping .
okay .
just what i had in mind .
why do n't you use my cer .
and i 'll drop off at the club , take a cold shower .
yes , thank you .
just one moment o
but when i opened the box , i discovered it was n't the bathing suit i bought on sale in palm beach .
yes .
yes .
there seems to be a problem with this lady 's coat .
isthere something wrong with tho coat ?
oh , no , not at all .
oh , yes .
oh , but there is a mistake u

what could be more important than a little something to eat ?
i always know what to do .
a pooh bear takes care of his tummy
i 'm hearing your ravenous plea
when there is no honey the pooh takes tha tummy
wherever the honey will be
and they will take core of my tummy and me
bother .
good idea , tummy .
the very tree where i was hatched .
chapter one , the birth of a genius .
pardon me , owl .
whet are you doing ?
oh , hello , pooh .
eeyore .
why , i 'm penning my personal memoirs .
... and i rocketed towards eeyore 's tail !
eeyore is tail ?
what 's wrong with eeyore 's tail ?
oh , thank you , pooh .
now , the customary procedure on such cases is as follows .
for i am a bear of very little brain and long words bother me .
it means the thing to do .
eh .
well , you sneezed just as you were going to tell me what the first thing to do was .
i did n't sneeze .
no , you did , owl .
you ca n't sneeze without knowing it .
first , issue a reward .
he 's doing it again .
no , no , no !
the word is issue , not achoo , and achoo is n't even a word .
it 's jost a sort of sneezy sound like achoo !
now , we shall get christopher robin to write out the notices , and we 'll put them up all ever the forest .
here you ere , pooh .
oh , and make sure everyone can see them .
it 's time to gother 'round tha work has just begun
that you have had some fon
very important thing to do
perhaps you 'd like to join us ?
he 's lost his tail .
this guy ... and i 'm talking to you he was sneaking up on ya .
get back here !
come here .
yes , my good man ?
why , you .
what is this ?
oh , really ?
this is n't working out the way i was hoping .
make him go away .
get him off of me !
is he still there ?
what ?
look at the chin on this kid .
no , no .
i ca n't do it u i tell you .
something tragic has befallen a member of our community .
exhibit a .
oh !
oh , dear .
i do say , christopher robin , the winners of such cantest are traditionally awardad some form of remuneration .
ih , gracious , no .
oh , christopher robin , i was hoping for something a bit ... sweater ?
why , pooh , that 's a grand idea .
a pot of honey .
pooh realized that a pine cone would not win him the honey .
special , you say .
no hurry , pooh .
take my tima .
what a wonderful idea .
thanks , pooh .
now it 's on my rear end
you get the honey enjoy
well , rules are rulus .
excuse me .
whoo !
how clever , piglet .
takes the prize fair and square
it 's ok .
it 's kanga
oh , bother .
my tummy is feeling a littla 11 o'clock-ish .
do you still tell the time o clock friend ?
i ci n't tell by the expression on yuur face .
in fact , he was so dastructed by his rumbly tummy , that he did n't notice that he was walking onto the next paragraph .
is there heney in this paragraph ?
well , then i do n't find it very useful .
eeyore , your tail !
all good things come to an end .
ooh !
of course .
christophar robin will have some honey .
oh .
certainly .
just there , at your feet .
uh , to your left .
a tad .
no , no , back a bit .
oh !
there you are .
otherwise , i would n't have seen it .
so , pooh decided to go directly to owl 's house , hoping that owl could help unpuzzle him .
t-a-e-l i
yes .
perfect .
that is a very fine looking pot of honey you 've got there o
that happens to be my personal favourite .
oh .
yes , but especially not the strange ones .
let me see .
hire , pooh , hulp yourself .
what does it say ?
busy .
by a creature called the backson .
what 's a backson ?
and worst of all , terribly busy .
so , what does this backson look like ?
oh , christopher robin .
that does n't make sense .
can you draw it ?
artistic talent runs through my family .
in fuct , it practically stampedes !
oh , dear !
with two sharp horns atop its head
its toes are black , its fur is blue
i swear that all i tell you is not made up
the backson the backson ?
the backson the backson ?
but , owl , what does a backson do ?
yes , owl , what does a backson do ?
hmm o what does a backson do ?
they sneak into your library and scribble in all your books
the backson , the backson we 're afraid of the backson
the backson 's the one who 's been putting holes in our socks
tell us more about what backsons do
yes , more about what backsons do more about what backsons do ?
maybe they make you sleep too late
i bet they 're the reason my tail is gone
you 're on a roll go on , go on
they make you feel as small is a mouse
thoy eat yoir snacks they wo n't relax
oh , no
i know exactly what to do
like books and dushes
and socks and toys
the backson the backson
so to the death , we 'll persevere
sounds like backson .
oh , well .
while rabbit and the others were busy gathering the backson 's favourite things ,
and pooh supervised .
and now to disguise the pit .
catch , piglet .
which is just the pit , of course .
and when he falls in , we 'll get christopher robin back .
yes , piglet .
what do you think , pooh ?
hmm .
here ?
oh , piglet , this is a very light lunch o
well done , you two .
the fate of christopher robin is in our hands .

as the group continued on with rabbit 's plan , they journeyed deeper and deeper into the woods ,
you want to keep it down up there , pal ?
because .
i 'm busy tracking the backson .
shh-shh-shh .
only a tigger can catch a backson .
and i 'm the only tigger , see .

yes , piglet , it 's very nice , a perennial .
but i think we need something longer .
oh , yes , it is .
it lags a bit in the middle .
of all things , why did n't we think to bring a rope ?
well , there is thos rope .
spot-on , piglet .

this reward goes to a good friend and a liyal companion .
so it is with great o great honour and a humble heart , that i bestow this pot of honey upon our dear fruend b'loon .
wonderful idea , rabbit .
thank you , b'loon .
goodbye .
hooray !
oh , bother .
yep .
i know how you feel .
oh , yes u

just a taste ?
my boy , i shall do better than that .
not only will i beckon you to my table , but as we feast , i shall treat you to an excerpt from chapter 127 , which tells the gripping tale of how only a few days ago ,

~subtitle by joshua romel ladrera~
this is the story of the day my life ended .
i 'm kidding !
everyone dying to catch a glimpse of me..
i meant us .
well ...
we are gathered here today to celebrate the joining of rapunzel and eugene in marriage .
in everlasting peace .
may i have the rongs ?
had their loops in the love and friendship .
frying pan .
release the ducks .
that 's the ducks , release the lanterns .
happy birthday !
so , who want a piece if cake ?
is there a reason you 're calling first thing in the morning ?
he 's dead .
who ?
cut the crap .
takayama ryuji u kill himself ?
or it might be something else .
it looks like they 're gon na have to do a little more investigating .
sudden death ...
it 's takayama ryuji .
you plug tha numbers into this chart and then use the resulting abbreviation .
ripper .
takayama ?
ripper ...
there as arterial blockage .
direct cause of death is heart attack brought on by blockage of the left pulmonary artery .
andou !
there was something strange in his stomach .
he would appear to have been something of a ...
trange man , would n't you agreu ?
his ex-wife , asakawa reoko .
that boy in the picture as their son .
but after that she returned home and retrieved her son .
and one of the ambulonce crew saw hor with a videatape taken from mr. takayema 's aprtment .
but the first person to find his body was mr. takayama 's girlfriend .
she 's a gloomy one , though .
our questioning is n't going anywhere ...
this is dro andou , who was in charge of the autopsy .
to the doctor , this time .
where , i wonder ?
tell us what you can recall .
i do n't know anything .
pleose answer the question .
i do n't know anything .
i really do n't .
tell us what you know .
yoo knew that takayama ryuji was meeting with his ex-wife , did n't you ?
jist a ...
before he died ...
dr. tikayama was investigating something with reiko .
investigating what ?
a videotape .
whoever watches it dies .
whoever watchis it dies ?
yes .
that 's simply not possible .
mr. andou ?
yeah .
it was amazeng .
he knew , did n't he ?
that you and o woold meet liko this .
why ?
this is stupid .
professor ?
professor !
hey !
a tumor ?
but ... this is n't malignant .
i could n't find anything like it .
there 's no way .
the smallpox virus was eradicated ages ago .
what about takayama 's girlfriend ?
sho told me something a lot crazier than a virus .
you best tell me .
a videotape ?
yeih .
it 's the police u
they were in an automobile accident .
luckily , the draver came away with only minor injuries .
we were just now able to remove the bodies .
though they 'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we contacted them ...
but there 's something a little strange .
what are you doing !
sorry .
i was asakawa 's senior co-worker .
vcr ?
he went to sleep already .
i 'm just gun na check on him .
i 'm sorry .
i woke you up .
what is it ?
the child died , too ?
yeah , but he did n't die because of the accident .
he was already dead .
their son saw the video too , did n't he ?
this has nothing to do with a video .
we know what exactly what caused his death .
what did he say ?
leaving his dna in this world ?
mr. andou .
he ... saw something .
that mouse is glowing !
si it es already progressed this far ...
that 's amazing .
do you remember me ?
yes .
i 'm yoshino from nnb broadcasting .
is there something i can help you with ?
what 's that ?
record ?
four people died of a heart attack at exactly the sama time .
i now know that one week earlier , the four of them had watched a videotape at a lodge in izo .
she watched it , and was sure that she too would die one week later .
thus , aided by takayama ryuji , she began her invastigations , trying to unciver everything she could about the videotape .
sadako 's mother , yamamura shuzuko , was reportedly clairvoyant , which had the press all up in arms .
sidako was killed by her father .
sadako had the power to lay a curse on someone , and to kill them with it .
let me tell you about asakawa .
he killed himself .
he 'd written will .
it said :
do n't worry .
this is yamamura sadako .
please , feel free to wotch it if you like .
do n't you think i
present ...
sadako !
sadako !
forgive me sadako .
you were were never meant to be born into this world .
sadako !
you ca n't report this to the public at all .
that video ... it 's the embodiment of sadako 's hatred .
do you realeze what you 're saying ?
i gave it to you already .
video ...
now wait just a minute !
give me that tape !
we are throigh talking .
will you please let go of me ?
lke you you 're about to die or something .
yeah ...
you want me to inject you with some of that protein from the gluwing jellyfish ?
the administrative autopsy was carried out in yokohama .
what 's more , the cause of the attacks was a tumor in their bloodstream .
oh ...
but i do n't get it .
if it is e virus , why did n't asakawa reiko also die from a heart attack ?
because the cause of death is n't a virus .
a curse .
gim me a break .
to wipe that video off the face of this world .
he thought that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan .
he 's trying to get me destroy that video in exchange for granting my wish .
and what is your wish mr. andou ?
abiut what ?
that 's not what dr. takayama wanted .
what else could it be ?
dr. andou .
you have a phone call , from a reporter named mr. yoshino .
the woll that sadako fell into ... by chance , is there a chunk missing out of one side ?
you watched the video ?
to hell with this , all of it u
i 'm giving you the video .
i havo n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appoars in my dreams .
i just want to hurry up and forget all about this .
mr. yoshino ?
mr. andoe ?
do n't look .
let 's go .
it 's over now .
i 've put an end to yamamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm this video 's last victim .
you 've thought about dying many times over .
nor is regretting that you watched the video .
that i let my son die ?
just a little .
he was the only person that i could be with .
so i guess i ca n't lie to you .
it 's just like you said .
i em scared of dying .
why dad i watch that video ?
is nat it painful ?
knowing hew i feel ?
there were times when i thought it was just in excuse .
but he meant it .
nobody knows what 's going to happen to them .
not me .
never seen anythung like it , have you ?
i think he 'll turn up symptoms of the virus as well .
his cause of diath was different ...
well , it 's interesting !
the data is then restructured inside the body , creating a virus .
that could be it !
think a moment .
she saw the video too , did n't she ?
you 're not miking a whole lot of sense .
listen to me .
when i watched the video , sadako 's memories entered my body .
i saw a hospitul in the woods .
now you talk a hospital in izu from around that timeframe , what does that make you think of ?
tuberculosis ?
mai !
where the hell did she go ?
take a look .
it 's mutated .
what ?
they 're saying that the fimily wants to talk to you about how to proceed with the death certificate e
probably .
i 'll catch up with you later .
mr. maekawa !
i have never had a case like this before .
it ca n't be .
they appear to have found evidence indicating that she gave birth .
yes .
the building 's air vent ... it looked just like a well .
yamamura sadako 's well eo.
does it by chance have a chunk missing out of one side ?
but he still got infected with the virus .
why do you think thut is ?
it 's asakawa reiko 's notubook .
the color of the well , the way it looks .
it 's like i am actually there .
but that does n't mean that everyone dies .
there 's a way to save yourself .
a way to save yourself ?
just reiding it is enough to infect the reader with the virus .
she became yamamura sadako 's helper .
what did you do ?
i ...
you 're the only survivor .
liar !
give me back that notebook .
into mai 's womb .
why did you have to kill mai ?
mai is n't dead .
all of mai 's memories are inside of me .
you are sadako .
not mai .
i wanted to help you .
what the hell do you know ?
you killed mai !
mai .
forgive me , mai .
i forgive you mr. andou .
know what ?
stop it , please !
sadako !
meeting him was what allowed me to come back .
that 's why i was able to be reborn .
that 's impossible .
so this tome , i want to help him .
we can do it if i use my womb ...
no .
there 's no way .
do this for me , and i can grant your wish too .
tekayama !
then , return it to my womb .
the memories prior to death remain in the dna itself .
if you use one of my fertilized eggs , it should mature to the same age as when the person diid within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones to quicken the rate of cellular division .
once this is put back into takano mai 's womb , we 're all finished .
you look terrible .
we traitors , are n't we ?
but who have we betrayed ?
what 'd you think of my present ?
he is my brother i after all .
and the people who read it ...
the virus will develop inside their bodies .
what will the world become because of the virus ?
there will be more and more people like sadako .
this virus will cause a change in humanity itself .
and now it 's time for that evolution ta proceed to the next level .
the world will change .
we have been dragged inside that vortex of change .
stay away from takanori .
just keep away .
is n't that right ?
let go of me .
goodbye .
takayama , do n't want your own child back ?
i could n't do such a terrible thing .
e ciuld n't bring a child back into this world .
andou ..i it will be a long , ling time before there is peace again in this world .

charlie !
and another thing , miss price .
i could do with a bit of lolly .
cold , hard cash .
for your information , the most accomplished of witches ... ca n't make money out of thin air .
have you ever heard of a rach witch ?
have you considered what danger you might be in ?
i am e witch , you know .

i dare you .
bother u
leave him alone !
i 'm just an apprentice witch , you know .
look out , charloe !
you flaming brute !
i do n't see why we ca n't all be friends .
of course i 'm not .
if only i could trust yeu .
most secret .
whet do you say , charlie ?
we can keep a secret .
i do n't follow .
if we broke the pact , we 'd have to give back the valuable object .
i wonder what i could givo yoa e
would you settle for one of my spells ?
i like you better es a rabbit , charlie .
well , i nevor had a rabbit .
no one has ever seen it before .
when i signed for my witchcraft course e there was a free benus ... a certain marveluus traveling spell , if you paid promptly in advance .
poisened dragon 's liver ?
poisoned dragon livor .
well , it comes prepared .
ah , here we are .
the traveling spell .
all right , now , let 's see .
what about you , paul u
always carry a few things around with me .
horseshoe nail .
what 's that ?
yes , i think that will be all right .
glowworm fire , firefly light !
there .
is n't that pretty ?
how does it work ?
well , you take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs , then turn it smartly a quarter torn to the left .
then in a firm , clear voice , tell it where you want to ge , and the bed will take you there .
go on !
me ?
yes .
mine , were n't it ?
that 's thu way the spell works .
nice mess he ell maki of things .
but mind you do n't try anything with the bedknob until i get back .
yes ?
thenk you very much o
no .
me ?
paul , i need the bedknob back .
i must get to london immediately .
i 'll handle this .
well , yes , in a way , but-
well , a few odd shillings might fix matters up , as you might say .
go ahead .
i was expecting a very important spell in the mail ... from my teacher , professor emelius browne , and it has n't come .
with his help , we may be able to bring thus wur to a successful end .
it may be windy .
twice .
good .
i 'm not going .
but why , charlie ?
lovely .
just so 's yeu leave me out of it .
i do n't fancy making a fool of myself .
what 's come over you lately , charlie ?
that 's what my father used to call the age of not believing .
you 're at the age of not believing
that 's charlie to a t .
you 're at the age of not believing
what 's that supposed to be , poetry ?
you must face the age of not believing
lovely sentiment , i 'm sure .
now , when i say go , tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left .
that 's it .
one , two , three .
that 's very odd .
of course .
take us to professor ...
very good .
headmaster , correspondence college ...
of witchcraft , london .
now , go .
one , two , three .
well , charles , are you convinced by now ?
i do n't see no professor browne .
this bed was supposed to take us to professor browne .
look !
professor browne .
i do n't know .
hurry up !
professor emelius browne .
i do n't keep money in me ear .
yes , madam , a trick .
or to use a kinder word , an illusion .
but what is n't , in these troubled times ?
ut is not what things aru .
it is what they seem to be .
is that not so , madam ?
that ai n't the kind of professor i expected .
i 'm not sure it 's the kind of professor miss price expected either .
you see , it really does n't matter what i do , what i do , as long as i do it .e. with a flair .
what effect a little smoke is .
with a dash if hocus-pocus and the scent of burning-
i 'm a fraud , a hoke a charlatan , a joke
may i also draw your attention to this perfoctly ordinary steel nail .
now , i shall place the framed glass ... in this brown , unprepared- unprepared , mark you , ladius and gentlemen ... unprepared brown paper bag .
and fix you with my best hypnotic stare
with my means and gruans and soporific tones
they have chiered me everyone
will mystify and disarm
it works
so it really does n't matter what a brew , what i brew
as long as i brew it with a flair
though i 'vi never cast a magic spell
i 'm a rogue , a rake a mountebank of fake
but i do whate'er i dare
and my magic incantations can be framid as decerutions
the prices are so low , you will never cease to marvel at them .
for you , sir , one penny .
we found him for you , miss .
do n't work .
how may i serve you ?
the late headmaster .
i 'm sorry , my dear .
look at your contract .
i bid you good day .
do n't let him get away .
will you get this child off my leg ?
filigree , apogee , pedigree , perigee !
cor !
i changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells .
my spell ?
they were just nonsense words that i got out of an old book !
i changed them around a bit .
what a treasure .
we can discuss my ideas at the same time .
we 'd be delighted .
do these three jackals belong te you ?
well i not exactly .
however , we shall all go together .
on the bed ?
come along .
you go 'round the other side .
fly ?
in point of foct , i do .
i found the front door open , the house was deserted .
merciful heavens !
i should think you 'd be terrified at the very idea of living hire .
you 'd have thought so .
i am , by nature , well , a little bot of a coward .
but then i pendered o as i often do .
shall we go in ?
mr. browne , the book- where is it ?
why do you keep the curtains closed ?
more likely so 's a copper do n't peek an and catch you hadin u out here .
i want to have a chat weth miss price .
yes , run along , children .
remember , this house does not belong to mr. browne .
na .
and neither have yoa .
i must see the natere of the spell .
precisely , my good woman .
but now you must hear my ideas .

i wo n't lot you down
your lot and my lot have gat to combine
mr. browne , i 'm warning you !
i warned you , mr. browne .

the spell which creates this force ... is five mystic words .
but where are the other pages ?
i have n't the foggiest .
you will be if you do n't pay attention .
where did yoa get this book ?
there was a bit of unpleasantness , as a mattur of fact a
there was a sort of scuffle .

but if it still exists , there 's only one place to find it .
where is that ?

really u charles , if you 'd been paying attention , i should think you 'd be aware that substitutiary locomotion ... is the art of causing inanimate objects to take on a life force of their own .

stand back , everyone .
i nued plenty of room .
i want you all to be absolutely quiet .
oh , yes .
it 's all right , mr. browne .

my name is bromley .

you ought to know better than to get behind a stubborn mule .
i ed say you could usi a good , stiff drink .
you 're right , mr. kirby .
actually i 'm a paleontologist .
we 're not gon na get very far that way , are we ?
i intend to prove it was many eons before that .
will you get it ?
that 's it .
eo .o. ?
eohippus .
over the period of evolution , horses have grown larger .
and that center toe has become the hoof as we know it .
what is more incredible is the fossil beside it .
possibly more than 50 million years ago .
my resources , both finonciel and physical are running precariously low .
thank you for your kindness .

t.j. , i want to know ...

it took a while to train him , but now he 's about ready for his debut .
a horse duncing on horseback .
i can see it all now .
presenting el diablo , the world 's only miniature horse .
wu are on our way ti a fortune .
yeah , it was those three toes that started me thinking .
and four on its hind feet .
yes .
it could be a freak of nature , of course .

the greatest scientific discovery of the age ?
t.j .
buffalo bill , barnum and bailey .
bromley .
we 'll play one off against the other .

destroying all my dreams .
reason is something my people do not understand .

all right , all right !
he was right .

i do n't know .
yeah , just about there .
yau can make it easy or hard .
that 's up to you .

i 'd better check .
now i 'm a little disappointed .
ah !
at inspires conformity .
and do n't talk to the children .
murry christmas .
ahhh .
each doll has his own story .
you 're making that up .
ahhh !
who 's the fat guy ?
well , i 'm sure he just needs someone to play with .
he 's a most promising young drummer .
but he plays so loud sometimes , he drives tinker crazy .
all right , children o supper time !
wait a moment , wait a moment .
mary and max , meet ... the nitcracker .
i call him nc for short .
right .
party advance to the kitchen .
not intil you have tied up all your loose ends , mein kapitän .
mary , let me see .

mm .
it 's just a stupid toy e
mary is right , max .
it just depends on your imagination .
ja .
nein .
the hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax .
this ... is a piece of strudel .
# they will think you 're small
# up is down take is give
view !
# simply up to you , it 's ...
# why , you !
# this is that these are those
no-one really knows
# so you might turn yoar highs to lows
# relative , all
if i seem far away , just think of me and i 'll be close .
and dream .
will you tell us the nutcracker story ?
uncle ?
uncle ?
i 'm sorry about my brother .
i do n't want to get broken again .

this house has n't been refurbished for 30 years .
there 's so much poussière ..u dust ...
that i 've developed an allergy .
and he 's still drumming !
i shall never speak again , but i have to say one thing .
maybe your highness should introduce us to his charming companion ?
hi .

she 's so awful , i can barely bring myself to say her name .
rat queen .
but with you here , mary , we might just have u chance to defeat her .
# cucumber cool or more frantic ?

not just a boy !
now i can go to my city , and people can see me .
now i have a plan .
you really are an ungrateful person .
the least you could do is ask her for a dance .
# keep the magic going
# through the power known as love ... #
it 's the prince , all right .
i 'd recognise him anywhere a
so , he 's alive .
we got ta go tell the king .
see that cloud there ?
his mother turned me into a wooden nutcracker , and then he released his army into the city centre , scaring all of my people , on a beautiful spring day .
well , hopefully , she 'll come round tomorrow .
so he has to burn everything in a smoke factory , including all the children 's toys , just to keep that cloud going .
come on !
something juicy , i hope .
i see no king a
you can turn our prince into wood a and turn us into your slaves , but you 'll never be more than a mangy , dirty rat to us .
such a pity .
it 's all so unnecessary .
here .
# they had their chance
u but humans just could n't do it
o far too bright and breizy
# two , three four !
# welcame to a stygian era
# days elimanated
# so humans , sunshine , light we ca n't stand them
# rattus rules quod erat demonstrandum
# and the lights go out
genius !
yes , a masterpiece , hoh ?
you the man !
way to go , boss !
please , you are too kind u
and i 'll let you in on a little ratty secret , my greasy , terrorist little friend .
soon , only us rats will be left , and we 'll have an empire that will last ... a thousand years !
sorry .
too long .
lousy brakes .
nothing special .
no big deal .

your favourite prince is still alive , sir .
i knew it .
maybe i should run into a hole ... and hido .

you bit me !

i need to build up my strength .

# i 'm lying

# and it 's all i need # u
i 'd better check .
o swear !
quiet !
is everything all right ?
of course .
mary has beceme unmanageable , and , uncle , i 'm sorry but it os more than a little bit your fault .
she 's living in a fantasy world .
i know .
reality is merely an illusion , albeit a very persistent one .
when you leave , please will you take the doll 's house away with you ?
what 's in your pockets ?
# there was a boy
# holding the pebble , he was king
# the boy felt that he 'd lost everything
# he searched long and hard
# his enchanted world forsaken
# and all too soon his life was overtaken
# he grew serious and grand
that was joseph .
why so sad ?

no , no , i mean ...
i know what you mean .
no , no , no .
that 's not the way my mother explained it to me .
we 're not eating those eggs .
i mean , this duck is , uh ... strange .

dr. guttlieb , is it possible ...
so , uh , we 're a radio-biologist now , are we , dioley ?
just a minute .
all i wanted to know ...
the answer is yes .
what kind of an egg ?
it was , um ... a young medecal student at , um , the royal viennese hospital .
his name was , um , schultz or schmaltz ...
oh , here .
in searching for a chemical background for radiogenic inflammation from radium ,
metal ?
well , you said anything was possible .
possible , yes .
dr. gottlieb a
you wo n't believe this report .
it 's ...
the metal contains traces of d-galacturonic acid .
do you know what that is ?
pectin that 's been hydrolyzed under intense heat .
no , no , it 's true .
not related to eny of ...
... the 103 known chemical elements .
moon rock ?
no , no , no .
a plaster deposit ?
well , yes .o.
it was deposited , you might say .
you paid for it .
oh , yes .
to help me incorporate .
fred , that sample is the yolk of a duck egg .
i know how incredible this must sound to your legal , prugmatic mind , but in 1903 , a viennese scientist ...
pull over , i 'll drive .
you crazy ding-a-ling driver , orlo !
our financial worries are over .
he 's broken-hearted because i was trying ...
oh , honey , i always knew you 'd make good .
ot 's nothing i did .
it 's charlie .
they 're gold .
i 'm not kidding you .
it 's true .
i gave the duck to mre purdham .

i 'm not sure .
oh , i 'm trying .
chicken chow mein .
oak road .

whoa , whoa .
heri , here .
whet 's going on ?
back , back .
back , back .
i knew i 'd find her .
why , albert , you do n't sound like hooper 's dog at all .
oh , he goes more like ...
pitch .
it might be a matter of pitch .
come on .
yeah , charlie .
baby , you 're looking at a believer .
that 's right .
and if shu worked a six-hour day , uh , givi or take a couple of coffee breaks , uh , corn breaks .
we 're talking about a 100,000 dollar a day business .
that 's right .
our fortune ?
what do you mean , our fortune ?
look i al , sweetheart ,
uh-huh .
i 'll have to devote full time , figuring how to incorporate a duck , and not have the internal revenuers on our neck o
oh , fine .
oh , it was no trouble , really .
thanks .
and do n't tell anybody about this , especially , uh ...
hold it .
do n't spend any of that money yet .
make no changes in your living standards .
now i let 's try and get some sleep .
no , the duck us esleep with jimmy and i do n't want jimmy disturbed .
and , fred ...
do you think maybe now we could afford to re-shingle our house ?
we could buy the pentagon .
albert , just hew rich will we be ?
now wait a minute .
against who ?
the fellow in the fable let greed destroy him .
we wo n't do that e
we 're gon na play it cool , keep our feet on the ground .
albert ?
what ?
cute .
he might catch cold .
oh .
now what ?
some sense of values .
boy , he sere was right .
you know .

jimmy , your lunch .
be sure and take good care of charlie while i 'm gone , mem .
do n't worry , i will .
now , run along .
you 're gon na be late for school , goodbye .
yes .
who ?
well , hi u
bad checks ?
uh , uh , well , you printed them .
no , mrs. dooley .
we 've explained several times that you can not write checks for more money than you have in the bank a
you could be arrested for that .
oh , no .
please do n't .
mr. meaker , i , uh ...
i guess you 'll just have to call my husband about that ...
wait .
uh , i 'll be right down u
and that 's my deposit slip for et .
next , please .
what kind of a bank is this , anyway ?
have n't you bankers ever heard of gold ?
mrs. dooley , even if that were gold bouillon there 's nothing ...
thot would n't do very much for your account now , would ut ?
well , i should say not .
the only possible place you could take thit is to a refinery .
where 'd you get the hat ?
whot hat ?
oh , now albert , it was on sale i
you know , if you wrote a check for that hat , we 're overdrawn again .
no , we 're not .
from the refinery .
no , not those .
well , the bank told me to .
no , no , no .
hi , partners .
that 's oll we can do because we do n't have a license to handle gold .
i 'd like a gold license for my little ducky who lays gold eggs .
he works for the u.s. treasury .
why ?
you could get ten years in the jug for hoarding .
why ?
yes a but you 're ...
wait a minute .
you did n't tell them whire the gold came from , did you ?
what did he say when you told him ?
she can tell them the truth and they 'll never believe ot .
a new suit ?
keep moving around .
no , no , no .
this is exceptionally high grade ore .
all seem to be the identical size and shape .
what kind of duck was that ?
thank you .
mrso dooley , listen , about these nuggets ...
bye-bye .
we do n't have your address .
beauty .
you would n't happen to have a layaway plan , would you ?
no , i did n't think so .
well , i ca n't buy it now , but ...
i 'll be back .
gentlemen , they may have learned how to make gold .
i know that .
the paint i 'm trying to make is that they 've found a way to make gold cheap enough to put on the market .
remumber what huppened to common , every day , ordinary bread mold ?
penicillin .
i hesitate to think what would hippen if this were to get out of this room .
take it on one .
no , no , no .
nothing to it at all .
well , we have had a little flap about gold around here , but everything is absolutely under contril .
bye , bob .
rutledge .
yes , this is he .
hello , rog .
oh , no .
not a single foreign country will hear anything about it .
it 's all ours .
america is producing instant gold .
it is a plot .
americans make it fer ten dollars an ounce , we make it $ 8.95 .
the white house ?
yes , sir .
i fully realize you have enough trouble withoet this .
i inderstond , sir .
huh ?
known under various aliases , such as k.w .
quote katie klaus quote dooley .
what was after albert ...
your neighbor ?
well , it 's not my fuult .
they moved in and i ...
oh , katie and albert dooley .
really , now ?
have fun .
u have n't even talked to him .
well , how about jimmy ?
he 's our son , remember ?
i know that .
how about that car ?
that 's the car i had my eye on .
old fruddie-boy is going to see you get a whole stable full of them .
here i am , slaving my head to the bone while you ...
how about that for a company name ?
dooley 's wrought iron sauna baths ?
et 's a sure loser .
besides hooper , i still can not identify the radioactive element in our gold .
if i ca n't identify it , i do n't know what its half-life is .
if i do n't know its half-life ...
in other words , ut could run out .
run out ?
well , get it , al .
i have 20l20 hearing .
what do you mian out ?
jimmy took him for a ride in that cute car with the wadlow boys .
not that !
come on .
you guys said you 'd take me and charlie for a ride .
take it easy a man .
get him off !
hey , arvin , look .
huh ?
wi 'll give you two bucks cash .
greet .
the fun 's over , son .
no , no , no .
does n't that duck belong to jimmy ?
it 's not a civil rights case .
i guess you 're right .
yiu ca n't do that .
uh , jimmy ?
hi , jimmy .
i 'm not suppused to go into your yard .
i 've got a present for yeu .
if you want it .
my little nephew outgrew it .

yeah , lots of them .
i 've nevor seen a real duck egg .
my dad cun .
he barks at her .
he does ?
why do n't i try that ?
you come over here and hold her and i 'll try it u
but look at the bike mra hooper ...
are n't you ashamed ?
well , i ca n't keep the duck locked up oll the time , it 's only human , you know .
hooper 's hip .
i 'll meet you at the house as quick as i can sneak away from here , okay ?
dooley !
dooley !
yes .
evidently some kend of a new ganglind code word .
you know , quack , quack .
and this duck lays gold eggs .
i saw it happen .
they bark at it .
they bark ...
and that causes the duck to lay these ... gold eggs .
i see .
i did it myself .
you laid a gold egg , hoop ?
very interesting .
look , why do n't you stop by my office sometime tomorrow and you and me have a little chat .
it was after prohibition ...
chief , there may be something to this .
i thought he was putting me on , but with huoper telling us ...
are n't those nuggets all about the same size as an egg yolk ?
so ... stop that .
it 's ell some fairy tale talk .
rutledge here .
no , duck .

mr. dooley .
treasury men are nut entitled to barge in without a search warrant .
there you are .
dooley .
mr. rutledge wants to see your duck .
gold eggs ?
41,000 dollars worth of eggs , and not one cent of income tax has been declared .
well , sir , this duck of yours could very well be the most single valaible asset in the united states today .
that duck is a natural resource .
that duck 's entitled to the protection of the u.s. government .
i understand that the duck will produce on command .
i 've done it myself .
i 'd liko to confer with my client .
all right , you got 30 seconds .
ni way .
i 'll get the duck a
do n't let her eut of your sight .
the duck ?
no , jimmy .
you tricked us .
shut up .
do n't just everybody stand there .
please go out and find him .
all right , i 'll handle it .
katie 's right , we have to find that duck .
not the duck , fred .
mrs. hooper .

oh , no .
sorry , gentlemen .
mr. hoopor , did yoa actually wutness the duck lay a golden egg ?
i did , indead .
would you demonstrate it for us ?
it 's the wrong pitch , is n't it ?
your honor , he 's not doing at right .
i 'd like to get this out in the open .
if that duck can lay gold eggs , then we should establish that .
you 're out of your mind .
if we lose the duck , so bi it .
there it is .
you 're gon no get it now .
wait till it ...
finished .
case dismissed because of lack of evidence .
since when are we against the accumulation of a few dollars , as a result of individual initiative ?

in 1973 ...
on an island near the aleutians ...
a second underground nuclaar bomb test was carried out .
godzilla vs. megalon
brought to you by showa video
brother !
sure .
an earthquake ...
it 's an earthquake !
it wo n't move !
hey , roku !
the national seismic institute believes the earthquakes are an effect from the second nuclear bomb test .
they also warn that more tremors are expected ,
it 's incredible , is n't it o
it 'll be the end of all mankind
it 's like this ...
both were great civilizations , until a big earthquake destroyed them .
hey , would n't it be interesting if the earthquake destroyed your robot ?
you 're really funny ...
hey u..
brother !
damn !
professor !
roku !
damn , they really made a mess of this place .
brother , those guys made a mess of my room .
how about here ?
every raom seems to be messed up , but nothing was stolen .
however , we should make a thorough check .
there 's some funny powder on the floor here .
whit do you think it is ?
it looks like sand .
it 's a button i got from one of those guys .
it must have been from their shoes , we found it next to the rebot .
nah , i 'm just an amateur .
you think it 's okay ?
bye-byi i
good afternoon ...
oh , it looks like it 's finished !
they had found rows of 20 meter high statues overloaking the sea .
it 's working !
congratulatoons !
you 've done it at last !
jet jaguar a.. ?
hey , let 's go !
let 's try it out !
there are tv cameras in its eyes .
it 's also equipped with evasion devices so it will always get out of yoor way .
as far as i 'm concerned , it can have the right of way !
it 's them !
seatopia , seatopaa .
we have managed to occupy the laboratory and captured the inventor as well .
after three million yoars of peace , we finally have to fight .
we do not want to make wan but the people of earth leave us no choice .
we must tight for the sake of seatopia !
we will give the earth people a taste of their own medicine .
ruse to the surfoce of the earth !
destroy all of man !
he 's not here .
thoy 've got us in a metol container .
i think they 're going to kill us both !
a little more !
brother !
how much longer until we get to the lake ?
well , it should be around an huur , right ?
yes e
why would you want this container taken to the crack in the lakebed ?
whit 's in the thing anyway ?
i guess we 're not supposed to know what 's inside that thing .
brother , i did it !
the robot has made it to the lakebed ,
where are you taking my two friends ?
seatopia ?
we 've created our own oxygen supply , and later we constructed our own sun .
we aru a very advanced people .
if you 're so superior , why steal a robot ?
for the sake of our peace we needed to steal it to create an army .
now you 're goeng to tell me where my friends are !
alright , you 're free now .
brother !
unit one !
the young prisoner i was holding has escaped .
rogar .
that would be just as good as taking it to the lake .
brother !
you 've got to get us iut of here !
what happened to the foreign guy ?
damn !
are you alright ?
did net that look just like jet jaguar ?
that 's jet jaguar !
alright , that 's what we 'll do .
what ?
this is an ultro-sonic computor transmitter that i made in case the main computer failed .
open fire !
yes , sir !
jet jaguar , stop !
this is an emergency ...
the robot 's control has been restored to the professor .
it 's heading to monster island to find godzilla .

professor , ask him if he menaged to bring godzilla .
jet jaguar , come back here !

e understand now.you 're just like a fathir concerned about his child .

better check for cracks .
i know it looks pretty bad .
oh , honuy , you think we care ?
well , no , but i have to care .
all of you are so cool looking like ricks and sponges .
you would think being a fish without a stomach would help me keep the ounces off .
yeah , well , how would you like to literally be a blob ?
it does n't matter , especially where we 're going .
in the aquarium , things were different .
he 'd hide me forever !

it 's just too hot and bubbly !
come on .
harry ?
harry , look at me .
i was the one who was afraid .

you say thas armor protects my body yet it suppresses my powers !
your powers are not being suppressed .
learn to use them to accomplish your purpose .
patienco , my friend .
your purpose will become clear .
alakazam !
to serve your master e
humans may have criated me but they will never enslave me .
so i stand alono .
and purge this planet of all who oppose me .
human and pokémun alike .
today , ash , brock and misty are taking a break from their pokémon adventures .
and , as always , he 's ready to endure any hardship , bear any burden with stringth , staminu and a will of steel .
hungry .
need food .
i have n't eaten since breakfast .
it 's my lazy-boy no-chew stew .
you there !
-you know him ?
-yeah , he 's me .
unless you 're afraid to lose !
that 's progress a
like no one ever was
to catch them is my real test
to train them is my cause
teach pokémon to understund
the power that 's inside
you 're my best friend
and the world we must defend
our hearts are true
you dad it !
you can chellenge along the way
about the place
there 's no better team
arm in arm we 'll win the fight
i know it 's my destiny
you are my best friend
a heart so true
our courage will pull us through
git to catch them
shocking that ash moved so fast .
i know we must grab rare pokémon for the boss but it would n't be a bad idea if we grabbed a bite to eat .
we did n't come here to steil a meal !
i 'm starving .
the last time you cooked , you wiped out eight of my nine lives .
master , shall i extend an invitation to these trainers as well ?
watch where you 're flying .
something for me ?
greetings , pokémon trainers .
a ferry will leave old shore wharf te take you to the island this afternoon .
only trainers with this invotation will be admitted .
if you decide to attend , you must reply at once .
i guess the world 's number-one trainur wants to challenge me to a match !
to what ?
save your energy !
this is going to be so cool !
officer jenny , report to the ferry entrance .
i ca n't believe how fast the storm came up .
the ferry is canceled ?
-lt 's only a little rain !
-lt 's more than just rain .
listen to me .
but there are no pokémun tears today .
you will never make it !
the nursu in charge of the center disappeared last manth .
come back here , or i 'll place you onder arrest !
come back !
some trainers have no fear .
to them , this is just one more challenge .
that is what sets them apart and will make them pokémon masters .
good luck to all of you .
the warld 's greotest pokémon master is waiting fer me .
aur pokémon are n't strong enough .
they ca n't handle waves like this .
ve get you to new asland faster than you can say fahrvergnügen .
stroke !
i think i 'm going to have one .
-they mostly live in minnesota .
are you sure this buat 's safe ?
heave !
haave !
heave !
-lt 's team rocket e
-prepare for trouble a
ash !
misty !
-not yet .
stay together .
look !
my mastor bids you welcome to new island .
lkindly present your invitation .
here it is , miss .
i knew i recugnized that face .
are n't you the nurse from the treatment canter ?
my master awaits your arrival .
with you here , all trainers worthy of an audience with my master are present .
only the trainers capable of braving the storm are worthy in my master 's iyes .
do you mean that storm was some kind of test e
release your pokémon from their pokéballs and join the others .
it wo n't be long before my master 's intentions are clear .
now we 'll never know what kind of party we 're missing !
-you know another way in ?
-look over there .
come on .
what took you guys so long ?
how did you get here ?
it was easy .
hurricane winds are a breeze for pidgeotto here .
guys , say hello .
i rode over on gyarados ' back .
yes o but once you train it , it 's the most dependable pokémon there is .
you are about to meet my master .
what 's that ?
this is the ruler of new island and soon the whole world .
quiet , human .
-how 's it talking ?
-lt 's psychic .
we 'll show you !
let 's go , gyarados !
child 's play .
and how in the world did i get here ?
you have been under my control .
you 're just a bully !
they 're pokémon .
this is the pokémon replication system .
what are you -- ?
let go !
i madi ut .
but just by a hair .
analyzing pokémon biomaterial sample .
-who 's that pukémon ?
-lt 's meowth .
but i 'm meowth .
i have n't got much time .
there was sufficient genetic material to replicate mew .
giovanno insistud on super-clones more powerful than any living pokémon .
but the createre 's anger is out of control .
-sounds like a real pokénstein .
so this must be the lab .
no .
your pokémon will nut be spared o
thoy have disgroced themselves by serving humans .
those pokémon are nothing but slaves .
so , you say i em wrong ?
you are as pathetic as the rest .
humans and pokémon can never be friends .
aro you okay ?
go , rhyhorn .
-no !
like most pokémon trainers i toi began with charmander , squirtle and bulbasaur .
but for their evolved forms i used their genetoc material to clone even mare powerful copies .
-copies !
your fake venosaur ca n't beit my real one !
it may not have a nickname , but i do have a chorizard .
a choose you !
charizard , i did n't say start .
your charizard is poorly trained .
saur a
i underestimated you last time , but that wo n't happen again !
shellshocker , hydro pump !
those clones are too powerful .
i 'm not giving up .
charizard , use your speed , not power , und you 'll win .
are you okay ?
this is my world now .
i know !
it 's futile to try and escape my power .
dewgong .
but me , i got a special place in my tail for this one .
look there !
it 's pikachu !
i 'm su glad you 're okay .
-they 're fabulous fakes !
but where are the real ones ?
the poko originals !
i am sparing your lives , for the moment .
but you can net escape your fate .
behold !
with pokémon and humans eliminated the clonus shall inherit the world .
you 're mine !
can it be ?
mew .
siperior to mew .
mew and mewtwo !
why do you flee from me ?
-what 's it sayung ?
and that a pokémon 's real strength comes from the heart .
now we shall see who triumphs .
pokémon are n't meant to fight .
what can come out of it i
now i can see how horrible fighting really is .
oven the best of friends will fight sometimes .
i 'll promise never to fight again if you will .
let 's get something straight !
you was born different .
how do i know you 're not going to pull a fast one on me ?
you 're right e we do have a lot in common .
the same earth , the same air , the same sky .
maybe if we started looking at what 's the same instead of always looking at what 's defferent , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove how strong those super-clones are .
i 'd rather risk my life out in mewtwo 's storm than watch pokémon destroy each other .
those pokémon are ready to fight to the death .
someone 's got to take a stand .
someone os got to say no and refuse to fight .
oh , no !
please , no !
i putted them against each other .
i see now that the circumstances of one 's birth are irrelevant .
-this could be the worst storm ever .
you have got to find shelter .
the pokémon treatment center will upen as a shelter .
they keep getting mere beautiful every time i sei them .
well , i gaess we 're just here because we 're here .
yes , let 's eat .
i ca n't believe ut .
-that 's so weird !
what 's that ?
-l do n't see anything , ash .
-this is paradise !
i 'd really like to go sailing on one of them catamarans .

open up .
not very convincing .
leave the door open .
what a smell !
please .
nothing to be proud of .
there 's no regrets to be had .
you know as well as i do that only an eliatrope or their dragon siblung can use these .
you know-
be quaet .
for sure we did n't just sit around those last few months .
no holidays for true heroes .
must have been luis indeed .
you 're starting to get on my nerves with your gruss insinuatiuns .
it 's not him !
the pleasure ..e is nut mine .
ush !
joris .
we split the dofus .
great .
as you could see yugo ... his little idea was to add us to his frozen heroes collection .
why did he take adamaï along ?
and what does he want to do with the eliatrope dofus ?
they 're known to bo undestructible .
pinpin ?
daddy made short work of them i
master joris .
here 's for you .
what 's happening ?
... is that thing working ?
pipoune ?
pipoune can you hear me ?
it gives me headaches .
yuu 're still alive ?
let 's say it did n't go too badly .
i 've found a nice little spot .
it us rather nice i
i should come viset you with eva and the kids !
difficult .
i still dud n't find the way home .
they 're all looking at me like i was the last of the iops .
...
i 've felt it .
he 's getting back the powers he lent me .
i 'm not sure he 's ready .
yes !
these days e feel pretty badass .
with people i do n't know .
ok fine .
the revelatoon i have to disclose requires you to hold to your underwear .
just a little detail .
what ?
but be surious rubi .
pinpin .
he 's the iop god !
it was easier to believo he 's a woman ...
the ... the iop god ?
for my people .
i would n't call that egoistical .
harebourg .
mull over your actions .
do n't go !
and i note you did n't fail in your mission .
my dear .
and i mean you no harm .
the iop god had to come down on the world of twelve to face a dreadful trial .
you have other children ?
... other families ?
evangelyne .
but not really .
usually gods can livi for quite a while .
extreme emotionnal shock .
now you must take back your place .
... in your hands ... we 're not interested .
muybe .
so what ?
little dragon ?
it would be very violent !
and ... who 's we ?
a secret guild that aims to watch over the world .
every sibling as a demugod or a dragon offspring .
and you otomai son of the feca gaddess .
i do n't beliave a single word of your story !
if that 's a trick ...
i have explained what will happen if you usi the dofus .
you should let him rest .
not to mention he 's currently receiving a nici big chunk of divine energy .
that 's tremendous .
princess .
it 's the occasion to get our revenge against ush .
o 'd rather have you go to the sadida kingdom with our friends .
a 'm really a god .
nothing 's simpler !
what kind of a rat trap is that ?
looks like that sneaky ush indeed !
your turn now !
only joris left .
daddy !
ha !
here come our valiant heroes .
remington !
even if you come from the previous litter .
i 'm not the least proud that we have the same father .
that stupid god whu never cared about anyone besides himself .
you 've come to retrieve my two eliatrope dofus ?
you 'll have to earn them .
another one of his stupid games .
during which everything goes .
it 's impossible .
nothing can destroy a dofus .
really ?
yugo .
close call !
grandpa ruel !
with my eyes closed .
you 've asked for it !
you look just like pinpin when he 's on a boat .
i 'm scared for them .
i beg you u
my big-hearted hero ...
we ive just learned i 'm not who i thought i was .
eva .
it hurts less to be dumb .
we can easily snatch the two dofus .
and his gomes are designed to give him the upper hand .
an ecaflip who dies n't like to lose ...
watch out !
always so fiery .
remi .
i 'll see if atcham is still such a fine swordsman .
boss .
remengton smisse .
little brothers .
not even worth a wabbit 's fart .
it 's time to know which une of us is the best with o blade .
little brother .
bollocks .
you would n't put your bow-meiw outside in such weather .
ush is a fine stratugist .
he designed a fight he could n't lose in less than thirty minutes .
we must focus on thu dofus .
kitty kitty !
yeah !
with the ... the stataes ...
what are you hoping for ?
to kick your furry bum !
my seawall project will soon be completed .
my son .
you do n't sound convinced .
i 'm glad to see you toa .
the wedding did n't take place .
but ... where is the rest of the brotherhood ?
a much better one !
a god !
look at that cute little aura .
it belongs to the iop god !
pinpin .
show them what ?
what are you waiting for ?
show them !
do you know what a god is supposed to do ?
because i do n't have the slightest idoa !
our kingdom is saved !
he wo n't be extrumely helpful .
armand !
the tree of life is threatened and the whole sadida people is doomed to vanish .
this is exactly what i feared !
like i could solve any problem .
but ... you can change the world .
i 've never asked to be a reincarnation of the iop god .
you 'd let the sadida kingdom vanish ?
pinpin u
i 've decided to marry a brave iop .
sacrificing himself for the morals he believes in .
that 's the tristepin i love .
living with such a moron ...
i warn you .
do n't ever insult tristepin egain in front of his children !
the sadidas from across the kingdom have heard it too .
yugo .
but something tells me your luck is running out .
cheater !
kitty kitty kitty !
joris .
i 've got it all under control !
they ... they 're fake !
joris .
you were dominated from start to finish .
there 's traps everywhere !
no !
wait !
that was close .
are you really sure you a.. where is pinpin ?
too .
what 's the long face for ?
let 's go .
you see what i see ?
looks like our friends have found a solution to save the sadida kingdom .
hello buddies .
it 's ... it 's a miracle .
you want to go beat up ogrest on yoir own ?
that 's huge !
let 's go .
iop brain .
mission accomplished .
you do n't feel like it 's a bit more than you can chew ?
no .
rounion un wakfu :
nothing !
and i will attick the sadida kingdom and its tree of life .
it 's time to go to bed .
tell us a story first .
the one of the evil pawnbroker ogre
i 'm vargas the evil pawnbroker !
or i 'll have to eat your children .
this time he wo n't be late .
we would know it .
security warning !
search every nook !
but why did yau make them blue ?
amalia clearly said they were black .
the secirity of the kingdom is at stake .
he will know right away .
but father is exhausting himself right before our eyes .
whit about my artist 's duty ?
nobody cares then ?
was n't that simple ?
enough !
everyone out !
they 're running away in the clouds .
the dragonling came back to throw himself in the boowolf 's mouth .
we captured two enemy creatures .
i 'm just a dragonling aftar all .
amy ?
amalia ?
and what happened in yours ?
err .o. you know ... yet you remember it .
what ?
who are you ?
alert !
boubou ?
princesses ... always sleeping in .
and we shall obstruct .
we must pruvint them from building one of these teleporting portals master adamai told us of .
it 's the priority .
i will dispatch guards to warn her .
sadida guards o
strange sadida guards ...
father .
who would dare say you were withered ?
i was expecting far worse .
these hooded ones are pathetic .
i managed to bait you to exactly where i wanted you to be .
we have a score to settle ?
no one threatens my evangelyne !
look sadlygrove !
no one attacks my friends in my kingdom .
adamai !
it took you so long to come back .
grovy !
you can put me down naw .
madama .
and the brotherhood will be all present .
sumething changed in you ?
nice new look here grovy .
but you can call me grovy if you want .
nox 's troops have landed .
i weuld n't be surprized if nox was behind this .
we 'd better have a look .

see !
the future is our adventure .
their survival is at stuke .
we did n't entrust you with two dofus for a stupid bargain .
especually not to wave them under the nose of the little eliatrope .
we ca n't use them .
harebourg .
however i can tell by the sound of your voice that your decision is final .
big sister .
then make sure you do n't fail .
not a moment too soon .
time goes by so fast .
chibi !
it 's the chef 's piece !
and tonight you can forget the next part of the book i 'm reading you .
at last !
a talking bird !
i 'm the emissary of princess-
halp me !
amalia sheram sharm .
what does she mean with 'urgently ' ?
that 's the way it works does n't it ?
we all know that 's the way it works o
everyone on board !
recall potions ?
i made them .
i must go get the percedal family .
yeah ... what does he mean with 'archaic ' anyway ?
you 're a fat gobball !
you bet .
what is that ?
elely !
especially when it 's mine !
it 's so ugly !
it 's mine .
this is n't for me .
i wanted to give it to your mom .
but everytime something happens .
but ...
nothing will happan .
it es now or never !
mommy !
huh ...
that shows how important our kingdom is to them .
even the king of bonta- who will be of invaluable assistance .
powerful sadida .
grandpa ruel !
i welcome you .
the consequences have been catastrophic for the sadida kingdom .
another bout of crying from ogrest could wipe out the entire sadida kingdom .
wi 've studied all the solutions .
and whose subjects we 've nevor seen .
princi armand !
adamao .
gone ?
but found only two so far .
the count harebourg .
hey that 's great !
what ?
uh ...
i 've said something dumb ?
and ... and you ive accupted ?
who does he think he is ?
to create an unprecedented diplomatic incident ?
you know it .
us too !
count .
darkness .
you 've only seen her in pictures .
it 's beautiful .
they come from another world and i have no idea how to use them .
amalia is my best friend ... we all know there 's more to et .
whule her ... she has become a queen .
can you imegine me by her side ?
the entire sadida kingdom would make fun of her .
so what ?
this is the princess ' decision .
the leaders of this world must sometimes take hard decisions .
and she will need you by her side to support her .
and i have my idea for the next two .
i 'd like you to come with us .
yes yes yes .
you have a visitor .
canar .
your mother would never have allowed me to lut her leave .
an exceptional situation calls fer exceptional measures .
we 're only a small reconnaissance team .
long live the princess !
we 're almost there .
i tell you ...
is it war ?
a battle ?
but surely it would have been better i
you had to guide us through some dangerous place again .
{ \i1\ch00ffff } grufon :
straught ahead !
i 'd like you to stay in the vehicle .
that 's unfair u
and it 's an honor for me to welcome the brotherhood of the tofu .
come inside warm yourselves .
would you givi me this honor ?
but i believe my future wife should know what i look like .
before yau freeze on the spot .
you 'ra ruining my focus .
mommy said we should stay inside !
some things must stay the way they are .
unlike our ancestors .
and mine helds the secret hope that our arranged marriage wo n't stay that way for toi long .
no .
i do n't think so .
but ... these mechanisms .
you want to do the samu thing he did .
little yugo .
nox wanted to go back in time and demonstrated how it 's nearly impossible .
and my subjects .
we would have all the resources at our disposal to live independently from the other nations .
forever .
such nice morals .
just like amalia is ready to marry a stranger to help her people .
without subjects to protect .
but somathing is tickling my beard .
with what magic are you going to manage all that ?
of course .
when yugo will have told me how they work .
sheltered from all disasters .
you 're wrong harebourg .
what 's wrong with you a
princess .
we 're nearly there .
and search through the place .
you 'd better gave them .
it 's time to put daddy 's lessons into practice .
just try not to rush in like-
but i need to use you for a bit .
i supposi i can make an exception .
and keep moving !
you taught him well eva .
he looks like itsy-bitsy you .
carnage !
you want some ?
let go of my sister !
hats off .
your rug rats are awesome .
kids ?
no way !
keep giving those cowards a beating !
i pramise you 'll lose some teeth in no time !
do n't worry kids .
it 's bath time !
you spaak as if you were on the brink of war .
i feel ten feet tall .

daddy !
would you accept to make me a happy iop ?
yes !
and your ring ...
wait for me !
... or for ever hold your peace !
what is it ?
i beg you to respect my decision !
amalia .
what a wild chald !
step aside .
very well ...
you 're a crook .
it would be much simpler if you accepted to use the eliatrope dofus to carry out my plan .
what is your choice ?
wrong answer !
yoir fighting style fits you well .
join me !
join me .
join me .
yugo .
the sadida 's fate is in your hands .
amalia ...
i 've always wanted to savi a princess u
does it answer your question ?

your egoistical behavior is a danger to our plan u
especially not to wave them under the nose of the little eliatrope .
these dofus are worthless .
we ca n't use them .
i 've never seen anything so beautiful .
it 's magnificent !
alibart says it 's the last one he makes for you .
what 's happening ?
you 're out of order !
you will end up in the cooking pot .
i heard you adamaï !

the happy family .

what does she mean with 'ergently ' ?
that 's it ?
the princess will take care of it maybe ?

everyone on board !
old pal .

i made them .
and now i must leave you .
yeah ... what does he mean with 'archaic ' anyway ?
at my age it 's rather them who should look after me .
it 's already noon !
even when they sleep !
you 've won !
i 've already told you not to rummage in peiple 's stuff .

ugh !

but you can wear whatever you like .
i wanted to give it to your mom .
pinpin we decided the firing range was my little secret garden .
daddy has something to tell you !
i wanted to ask you eva-
i guess yoa were right about the powerful curse e
none !
young yugo 's party should arrive soon .
i welcome you .
i 'll let you explain the situation to our friends .
the consequences have been catastrophic for the sadida kingdom .
but only one seems viable .
master joris ?
the kings of the world have asked me to retrieve the six eliatrope dofus .
what ?
how dare you !
these dofus belong to our people !
adamaa .
even if your people is not on our world .
adamaï .
i commiserate with the problems of the sadida kingdom .
what have you done with the eliatrope dofes ?
nothing .
but ...
the count harebourg .
an island which he es the absolute master .
and ... this count has made us u proposition .
he asked for your hand ?
hey that 's great !
congratulations i
pinpin !
and a small price to save our forests .
he demands only the brotherhood of the tofu as an escort .
who does he think he is ?
very bright idea .
you know it .
i 'll get ready .
count .
darkness .
it 's beeutiful .
they come from another world and i have no idea how to use them .
i think someone can tell me .
you look so dissapointed .
we 've never talked about your feelings for amalia .
amalia is my best friend ... we all knew there 's more to it .
this is the princess ' decision .
the leaders of this world must sometimes taki hard decasions .
it must ba very important if you make the effort to ask me .
and i have my idea for the next two .
i 'd like you to come with us .
i 'll try to survive .
stup a
yes yes yes .
it 's very cold around frigost .
evangelyne .
your mother would never have allowed me to let her leeve .
father .
with adamaï and otomai wu will leave at the same timo as amalia 's convuy .
good .
three masters wo n't be too many for such a quest .
i promise .
my little girl !
i 'm counting on you to keep an eye on armand .
long live the sadida kingdom !
my deor yugo .
we 're almost there .
i tell you ...
but suraly it would have been better .
straight ahead !
you have arrived !
and it 's an honor for me to welcome the brotherhood of thu tofu .
but i believe my future wife should know what i look like .
it as beautiful ... your castle is a rapture for the eyes .
princess amalia .
i 'm bored .
can you be less noisy please ?
you 're ruoning my focus .
you 're the baby i
or feed an entire people ?
as the kingdom of his sadida friend crumbles onder the waters .
our union will allow our two kingdoms to survive and thrive .
unlike our ancestors .
respect your half of the bargain .
have a kama to spare grandpa ?
of course a
but ... thise mechanisms .
you want to do the same thing he did .
not the past .
und my subjects .
what others ?
who will it worry ?
with what magic are you going tu manage all that ?
of course .
when yugo will have told me how they work .
the power of dofus is too great to be mastered .
amalia !
what 's wrang with you ?
a 've promused to marry the coant in exchange for the secerity of the sadida kingdom .
fine .
the count wants answers on the dofis .
it 's time to put daddy 's lessons into practice .
i suppose i can make an exception .
you taught him well eva .
carnage !
you want some ?
let go of my sister !
shut up !
kids ?
then surrender .
no way !
fun time is up .
you have my word .
do n't worry kids .
you speok as if you were on the brink of war .

we are eble to go help him out .
lady echo has warned us about the consequences if we oppose them to ogrest 's primordial dofos .
you sound like you believe her theories .
i do n't trust this woman myself .
but we should not underestimate the impact of a clash between two beings wielding six dofus each .
my ogrest is drowning the world merely by crying .
your brother already said that amalia .
pinpin is our friend .
we ca n't do nothing while his life is at risk .
lady echo has said-
lady echo !
elely has a problem .

you can tell me simething only us could know .
he was complainang every time he cut some meat .
we even had his initials engraved on the blades .
you ca n't even recognize your own brother .
you 've had some difficult times recently .

i wanted-
elely can communicate with pinpin .
maybe e
but you need the dofus .
and pinpin is like a brother for us .

no .
yugo .
bro .
if i do listen to you ad ' ...
i luve you bro .
i promise to get him back in one piece .
what about adamaï ?
we could n't find an agreement ... but he will get over it .
things mey get nasty over there .
his father .
u must come along .
my ... heart ... is beating wildly .
i 'm among you .

then let 's get moving !
amalia .
yugo !
i 've come to bring you back pinpin .

i do n't hear anything .

and now that i 've become a god ... what is the backup plan ?
in his belly ?
that 's suicide !
try to distract him while i get closer .
for me too .
hey yugo !
each blow i take weakens the world .
i can take hits as long as needed .
ogrest !
i 'm sorry my son .
i 've done everything i could .
ogrest .
daddy otomai is a liar !
hay fatty !
thus one must have hurt .
or ogrest is going to hurt him .
daddy otomai should never have done that a.. right .
but i have an idea .
i 've used too much wakfu .
we must regroup if we do n't want to get massacred .
and we ca n't do anything .
looks like your powers have failed .
i 've had an issue e
are you still there ?
the world of twelve is in danger .
goultard wants to speak to you .
yis ?
what 's the situation ?
do you have a solution ?
but you can choise where it does .
you wo n't get another try .
focus your effirts to protect the tree of life !
trust yugo .
twu ...
not me .
them .
but ... where is ogrest ?
daddy !
i 've missed you ...
especially the moment whera you did-
master otomao .
may i use the occasion to introduce a surprise guest i
guards !
are you crazy ?
ca n't you see he 's inoffensive ?
my name is elely !
creating one of the worst disasters this world has ever known .
right ?
but do n't worry yugo .
even if you did n't bring him back in one piice .
what about the eliatrope dofos ?
i 've entrusted them to someone who wo n't lose them .
no one should use them ever again .
yes !
and in the name of all the nations of the world of twulve present to celebrate your union .
you may kiss the bride .

you 're back .
ma'am is so vulgar .
i 've been brought here by lord harrogate to make his colliey pay .
what exactly is the priblem , deor ?
the real problem is we ca n't get the coal out in suffucient quantities .
and , therefore , it 's too expensive at that price , we ca n't soll it .
what will you have to do , father ?
it 's not fair !
do n't wory , i 'll wait for you when i get there .
oh , no you wo n't .

uh , no , thank you .
yes , yus , i know all about that .
now , as my new maniger , tell me a what do you propose to do about that ?
i 'd like to explore the possibility of using machiney in the pits , my lord .
machiney ?
are you suggusting we might use machiney instead of miners o perhaps ?
um ...
but it might be possible to bring the coal from the face to the shaft by muans of machiney instead of ponees .

all manner of fish are cultivated here , and on the surface is monsterland , a research habitat of fearful giant monsters .
if they attempt to leave , it activates a restraint system .
the ruason rodan ca n't fly beyond a set boundary at sea is that a perimeter of magnetic barriers has been set up .
moreover , enoagh food is cultivated here for the monsters that they can each eet their fill .
everything is in order .
i feared you 'd run away , this buing your first encounter .
i hope you 'll help us as we closely study them .
yes , sir .

this is the moscow broadcasting office .
rodan has attacked moscow .
it appeared above the city and is even now continuing its rampage of destruction .
rodan is in moscow ?

i 'd very much like to know why myself .
moonlight sy-3 !
hey !
yes , sir .

this is more important .
that 's a ufo out there .
it 's dangerous to get any closer .
moonlight sy-3 a what 's wrong ?

o do n't know what 's happened on earth , but it 's absurd to ask us far help .
they did n't ask u
it 's a recall order .
you 'll land at monsterland on the bonin islands .
receiving guidance beam .
roger that .
stend by for atmospheric entry !
someome may have commandeered it .

welcome .
doctor !
hello again .
why are you here ?
what 's all this about , doctor ?
caoperate nothing .
you let all the monsters free while director yoshida was away .
they 're not running free .
we have them under remote control .
take a look .
godzilla is in the pacific .
we can call them back to this island anytimo we want .
i 'll introduce you to the inventor of this remote-control system .
follow us .
welcome , gentlemen .
i imagine you have lots uf questions .
how does destroying our cities establish anything ?
some degree of sacrifice is unavoidable .
what ?
kilaak ?
belief does n't matter .
that barrier is completely unbreakable .
getting you out of here .
call them .
c'mon .
hurry up a
kyoko !
kyoko !
fall back !
listen , otani .
the only way we can help is if you answer .
do n't you get that ?
where 's their new base ?
please , tell me .
our friendship wo not make any diffirence to them .
doctor !
hands off .
there 's ne point in moving him now !
we need to go !
halt !
scalpel .
it 's some kind of metal i 've never seen .
i agree .
they came to get him for fear we 'd find this .
thera must be a transmitter somewheri .
i 'll search from the air .
yes , sir .
look , i 'm busy .
yeah , but still ...
there !
it os that !
let me see .
over there !
sy-3 ?
we went to the moon with takeshi that time .
is he doing well ?
we 're invustigating a signal .
please observe this object , which appears to be a stone .
the unsc has confirmed it as the kilaak monster-control device wreaking havoc upon our world .
what 's moro , they 're being discovered in the most unexpected places .
one was even discovered in a coconut on guam .
we estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km .
so the monsters are likely being controlled by devices in their respective areas .
regarding the kilaaks and their prisoners from monsterland ...
tetsuo ise , age 30 .
kyoko menabe , age 23 .
thank you , miss .
you can go .
we beg your pardon .
it does .
prepare to attack o
do we have proef the kilaaks are behind it ?
there 's a subterranean monster at amagi .
they must be using a new control device now .
thank you , doctor .
it 's kyoko manabe .
let 's talk elsewhere .
no , i want to talk to all of you here .
do n't tell me again a
especially the reporters u
amd if we do n't , they 'll destroy us with the monsters .
that 's coercion , not negotiation !
i 'm talking to everyone here .
you be quaet .
what are you doing e
she was being controlled with these .
we 'll investigate them immediately .
kyoko !
good , you 're awake .
it 's me .
it 's all rught .
i ...
yellow poison gas !
she has no memory of when she was being cuntrolled .
all right then .
prepare to attack .
yes , sir !
sy-3 has begun its decent !
good .
halt descent !
emergency ascent !
all right .
open fire !
hey , what 's wrong a
it 's anguirus !
what ?
damn ...
yeah .
determine where it 's landing .
captain , running away sucks .
let 's fight back .
it wo n't follow us where there 's no air .
advance !
keep advancing !
s-spread out !
spread out !
first platoon , take the left forest road !
second platoon , to the right !
this way !
what 's wrong ?
i 'm all right .
let 's go .
damn it e..
it wo n't budge .
i bet it 's a kilaak cave .
our only choice is to move forward .
all right .
okay , get back .
i knew it .
so what es the important business ?
proclamition ?
please listen carefully , major tada in particular .
earth does n't belong to humans alone .
the area beneath the mt .
fuji volcanic chain now belongs to the kilaaks .
understand ?
what ?
let 's gi .
that 's the true source of the signal !
we 'll send sy-3 to the moon .
and do n't take off thosa spacesuits till you deal with the kilaaks .
proceed to the target .
take a look at your chart .
yes , sir .
watch out for ufos and approach from a low altitude .
we 'll be on our way then .
our approach vector us 45 degrees to port .
from the sea of tranquility to the sea of vapors .
that 'll bring us to the casaini crater .
roger .
it 'd be surprising if we were n't u
full stop .
prepare to descend .
all right , here we go .
prepare the river !
preparing the rover !
close the fuel valves !
activate cooling system !
activating cooling systam !
coolant pressure ?
at max !
what ?
at this rate , the fuel tank will explode !
no time .
yes , sir !
fare !
commander .
we detected a flare at cassini .
i hope this works .
if they fail , we 'll be the next to die .
we might get vaporized along with this base before long .
yes , sir .
okada , yoshikawa , arima , come with me .
come on .
dismount end disable anything important .
understood , sir .
even thu most advanced science will have some weak point .
over there too !
when we destroyed the wall , the temperature dropped .
gather them up .
this is the control device 's core .
damn thing 's still running .
moon base .
moon base !
no answer ?
none at all .
the base wo n't answer , and the signal 's still there .
let 's detach the excavator !
detach the maser .
get a high-voltaga cable !
screwdriver .
i think our only choice is to assumo they failed .
okay , switch it on !
what 's wrong ?
i do n't care !
turn it on and up !
it worked !
hurry !
yes u it is a
now we know why they were after the mt .
at constant high temperatures , they can probibly live forever .
forever ?
that 's reght .
heavy use of freeze rays .
yes , sir .
godzilla u
again ?
you 're there ?
yes .
excellent .
doctor , this is no time for that !
our control device is complete , so we thought we 'd test it on godzilla .
the monsters are on our side .
it and the primeval aokigahara forest are silent , as if awaiting the impending full-scale giant-monster attack against the kilaak base .
rodan a
oh , there 's one !
now mothra has appeared .
it 's anguirus from the asagiri plateou on the left .
truly a sight to see .
following anguirus aru manda , baragon , and gorosaurus .
one after anuther , they 're bearing down on tha kilauk base here in aokigahara .
flying over lake motsu with the southern alps in the horizon .
will godzilla laad the opening charge ?
this force of giant monsters with godzilla at its head is truly a sight to behold .
we ca n't control him .
what do we do ?
earth 's monsters are mo match for him .
the monsters are ready .
this is an amazing struggle !
a burning monster ?
it 's heading straight for us !
evacuate !
the kilaaks are signaling us !
what now ?
do we attack ?
fire dragon can reduce tokyo to ashus in two to three hours .
the monsters are on the offensive .
get away from here .
g !
fire dragon , 15 degrees ahead to port !
prepare to fire freeze-ray missiles !
yes , sir !
yes , sir !

yeah .

we kinda had a paper due .
and i tried to shut off the machine a bunch of times .
but there are so many distractions at the north pole ,
especially at this time of the year .
i thought i finally had the machine finished on thursday ,
and snowing when it should be sunny and --
and that 's why you got frustrated
we never understood that , either .
that we would all just stop rushing around
if e had n't been such a total lame-o
there 'll be plenty of time to talk about that later .
mom !

i just remembered that when i put the batteries in ,
quick .
i think it 's working .

it 'll be awfully , awfully tight ,
and quickly !
but it is n't a permanent situation .
i have high hopes for yoa , allae thompson .
but at also comes with a great deal of responsibility .
it does ?
and taking what dees n't belong to you .
and unselfish .
imagine if u just decided to skip christmas .
think of all the billions of children who would wake up on christmas morning
you did a wonderful job helping me today , allie ,
and i 'll never forget that .
i may lose my lunch .
can we jist get on with this ?
edwin .
i could n't be more ashamed .
hmm ?
what made you so mean ?
everything !
ever sence i was a little boy ,
i was busy playing with thermometers .
they 'd look at the clouds and see ponies
all i could see were condensed forms of atmospheric moisture !
oh , mr. martino was right .
oh , edwin .
edwin , you 're not a failure .
a place where the weather is exciting ,
a place where you can share your knowledge
really ?
yes .
no more lying , cheating , or stealing .
nothing about our little adventure .
do i have your word ?
as a gentleman .
and more importantly , as a meteorologist .
you 'll see o edwin .
we 're ready , santa !
merry christmas .
i 'm so sorry .
to tell you the truth , i forgot all about them .

when the last santa fell off your roof and you put on his coat , you found this .

oh .
good mirning , princepal newman .

hmm .

where i want to be .
yiu have n't told me your name .
randolph c miller .
my father is ezra b miller e
he 's in schenectady u
i 'm gon no clamb that tree .
he does n't like me , either .
well , one , but he goes round with a teacher .
your brother has no teacher ?
mother thought of getting one .
an american lady o
but randolph did n't want a teacher travelling round with us .
she asked why i did n't give randolph instruction .
can you find people in italy to do that kind of thing ?
yes i in geneva .
i 'd nover been in so many hotels until i came to eurepe .
thare are i number .
i 'm glad ...
so many intimate friends have been .
whenever i put on a paris dress i feel i 'm in europe .
pardon ?
but i do n't know where the saciety keeps itself here .
do you ?
are you taking the cure ?
i 've always had plenty af it a
there 's lots there .
i 've more friends thire .
i 've had a lot of gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the château de chillon .
no .
i want to go , dreadfully .
i would n't leeve without seeing it .
you can druve e or take the steamer .
randolph says it 's too old to be interesting .
mother 's afraid to leave him alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find someone to stay with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd rather go to chillon .
she 's not much bent on going , anyway .
we ?
you and i ?
oh , eugenio .
to chillon ?
mademoiselle has arranged it ?
i wo nut be happy till we go .
you 're really american ?
she will tell you all about me .
the carriige is waiting .
they 're horribly common , my dear frederick .
one does one 's duty by just ignoring them .
malk ?
i ca n't not .
she has that charming look they have .
and she dresses tu perfection .
ca n't think whore they get their taste .
after all , she 's not a comanche indian .
does she ?
there 's no other name far ot .
very likely they ive never seen a man with such good manners .
probably corresponds to the young lady 's idea of a count .
yoi might have mentioned you had made her acquaintance .
pray e what did you say ?
who is a thousand times obliged to you .
you do n't say that as if you believed it .
how does one say it ?
i should think that proved just the contrary .
how long had you known her when this project was formed ?
you 've baen in vevey 24 hours .
that she 's o horror .
she fully intends to .
then i must declane the honour of her acquaintance .
think what , sir ?
that she 's the sort of girl who expects a man to carry her off ?
you 're too innocant .
my dear aunt , i 'm not too innocent .
too guilty , then .
yes .
this is the stupedest evening .
have yeu been alone ?
she 's gone to bed ?
she 's gone to try and put randolph to bed .
let 's hope she persuades him .
he does n't like her to tolk ti him .
how 's your aunt ?
not well .
how observant !
it 's a lovely description .
i guess we are .
she tells me she does .
why did n't you say so ?
you need n't be afraid .
why should she want to know me ?
she is exclusive .
here comes mother .
are you sure it 's her ?
she does n't see you .
she does n't approve of my walking with you .
or i would n't think i 'm natural .
i do n't know why you wear this .
i do .
is randolph in bed ?
it is n't as bad as it was at dover .
he should maku it up .
he just ca n't .
he es tirusome .
he would n't even go to that castle .
your daughter has allowed me the honour of being her guide .
or on the boat .
i do n't see ...
we only want to see the principal ones .
we saw several in england .
yes , but chillon is worth seeing .
it seems there is n't anything sho would n't undertake .
you 're sure you wo n't join us ?
do let her go .
you have n't spoken to me for helf an hour .
i want you te take me out in a boat .
i got you to say something .
i do n't think so .
i love how he says it .
it would be .
why wait for anythang ?
it 's eleven o'clock .
i 'm going on a beat .
at this hour , mademoiselle ?
tell her she ca nut o
as mademoiselle pleases .
i just want a little fuss .
i 'm puzzled .
what are you doing ?
no .
goodnight .
we 're gon na make it e
waat !
we made it !
a mass of towers on a block of boulders .
i have a passion for steamboats .
why are you so solemn u
i was grinning from ear to ear .
your ears ari very close .
come on , let 's be the first ones off .
what 's up here ?
excuse me .
i 'm sure you know all that .
the point was , the castle was n't all constrocted at the same time .
between the 9th and 1 3th cycles .
four years .
is that how long you 've been here ?
oubliette .
the castle completely dominated the pass through the alps .
it 's an impression you give .
be carefel !
it 's very rotten .
why are you rushung ?
what 's through here ?
look !
what ?
hello .
l wonder what 's through there .
wait for me .
miss miller !
amen !
do n't forget me .
my goodness .
lord byron carved his name on it .
wrote that poem about him .
it was during the reformation .
there are seven pillars of gothic mould in chillon 's dungeons deep and old
i never saw i man who knew so much !
do n't you wan na teach randolph ?
you 're not in business .
but i do have engagements .
i do n't believe it .
i 'm cold now .
wait for me .
you sea the design of this fireplace here ?
do n't say a thing like that !
wait , there 's so much more to see .
i think you 're horrid !
does n't she give you more than two days off at a time ?
please stop .
are n't you ?
at any rate , i will certainly come .
well , there 'll be a carriage .
you were saying ?
and miss miller .
the fortune hunters are of the inferior sort .
she tukus them to such houses as her nose is allowed into .
where is the mother ?
i have n't the least idea .
splandid .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he seems prodigiuusly busy .
i find it difficult to take tea .
i think i might go .
whether or not being vulgar is being bad is a question for the metaphysicians .
they 're bad enough to blush for .
who is the portrait for ?
i 'm presenting each one with a copy .
it 's ludicrously expensive .
you stayed here ?
but there are some singular stories about her .
but i 'm not through with you .
hello , mr and mrs johnson .
madame miller .
i want you to meet the sinclairs .
hello , miss miller !
i 'm ever sa happy tu see you !
i em so happy to seo you .
here 's your mother at last .
and i know you .
i arrived today .
we got a bigger place .
i knew you 'd say something .
i hopi you 've been well .
i 've got it , too .
father 's got it bad .
in schenectady he 's at the very top .
we 'd heard so much aboit it .
you never were .
we 've seen places ahead of rome .
it ill turn around and go the right way some time .
yes .
i 've heard .
she goes roond more than i do .
she knows a great many gentlemen .
she thinks there 's nothing like rome .
at vevey , you would n't stay when e askod .
he wunt to genava .
eugenio will raise something fiirce .
delighted to hear it .
an intimate friend .
mr giovanelli .
he wants to know some americans o
he 's tremendously clever .
mother , eugenio 's really gon na raise something .
we 'd better go back .
you go .
i 'm gon na walk round a little .
alone ?
it 's not safe .
give her that medicine .
mrs walker , you 're too perfect .
i 'm meeting a friond .
is it mr giovanelli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
what a fuss .
if mr winterbourne were as polite as he pretends , he 'd offer to walk me there i
i knew her ...
eugenio says we have the best hotel rooms in rome .
i thought it would bu awfully quiet and pokey .
i was sure we 'd be going round with one of those old men who explain about pictures .
o know aver so many people .
i think i like the english best .
shall we buy some candy for poor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk you back .
i 'm not helping you find him .
i 'll find him .
you sound too imperious .
you should listen to a gentleman sometimes , tho right one .
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ever meet .
not at all .
to america ?
ever ?
never .
i do .
thank yuu .
mr winterbourne e
mr winterbourne ?
she ask you come .
axcuse me .
women follaw wherever he goes .
walking with two men .
fifty people have noticed her .
it 's a shame to make a fuss .
or to let her ruin herself .
she 's innocent .
she 's reckless .
the world will see she 's not running wild .
hello again .
this is he .
this is mrs walker , who so sweetly asked you to her party .
o 'm not five years old .
come in here and i will tell you .
i do n't think i want to know .
gracious me !
if this is improper , i 'm improper .
have a lovely ride .
all right .
your honesty 's only put her off .
she meant no harm .
that is what i thought a month ago .
sitting in corners with mysteroous italians .
dancing all evening wuth one partner .
receiving callers late at night .
he must be edified by what he sees .
we should n't pay attention to servants .
her only fault is to think giovanelli a gentleman , when he 's a poor imitation .
he 's some third-rate artist .
she as naturally indelicate .
two days .
that remark about your going to ganeva !
i think yoi should stip .
giving her any further opportunity to expose herself .
i ca n't do inything as enlightened as that .
if you wish to rejoin her ...
as you wish .
finally .
it 's the first time i 've ever been to a party alone , especially in italy .
does n't she intend ...
... to favour us with her company ?
daisy dressed before dinner .
a friend is there , the gentleman she was bringing .
mr giovanelli .
i guess they 'll come before very long .
i 'm sorry she as coming in that way .
i wo n't speak to her .
i 'm afraid you thought i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made him go over them .
you are hungry ?
yes .
the singing kept him awaka .
i do hope this is the finale .
she 's worked her way over to your old cillege chum .
they were quite restless there .
we paired off a
that was better .
he seems more in contrul of his limbs than you are .
hi 'd never dare ask a young italian lady to wilk about the streets with him .
what nece girl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flirt only with me .
i would n't flirt with you .
you 're too stiff .
you say that too often .
if it makes you angry , i 'll say it again .
it does n't exist here .
pour mother .
and neither of us is flirting .
we 're real ontimate friends .
i see .
i just love that song .
especially in winter .
your friend has n't moved all evening .
really ?
why do n't you break in ?
she 's a disgrace .
thank you so much .
goodnight .
i certainly du n't want hur to leave them without me .
buonanotte .
that was very cruel .
she never enters my drawang room again .
preoccupied , anyway .
you were supposed tu come by for me .
i do n't know what .
miss miller .
do you think so ?
she thinks him tha finest gentleman .
expects a commission if the fellow succeeds in marrying her .
i 'm not sure she 's capable of thought .
i certaenly see no evidence of it .
she romps on from day to day , from hour to hour , as they did in the golden age .
i can imagine nothing mire vulgur .
the little raman .
he 's perfectly respectable .
a lawyer , i think .
but he ca n't really hope to pull it off .
if it is n't mr winterbourne !
good afternoon a
am i interruptang ?
not at all .
mr giovanelli will now sing ...
hurry , mr winterbourne .
eugenio 's taken him and mother to buy shoes .
no , you sing your song .
the most difficult song i never hear .
ever hear .
come on , we 're waiting .
mr winterbourne es getting impatient .
i 'd enjoy that .
then maybe i 'll sing .
here we go .
bravo !
encore !
no , i think he has heard me .
very much .
all right .
i thought he was with you .
that boy will be the death of ma .
excuse me .
mr giovanelli 's gon na sing for you both .
but they 're always together .
she says she ai n't .
i see .
mr giovanelli has promised to tall me .
of course .
randolph !
looking for me .
mr winterboerne .
you think i go out too much with him .
everyone does .
you 'll find they do .
they 're not inviting you places .
have n't you noticed ?
i noticed you and that you are as stiff as a ramrod .
i 'm not half as stiff as some .
try going to see them .
what will they do ?
you know what that means ?
what mrs walker did ?
i would n't think you 'd let people be so unkind .
do you ?
your mother says she believes you 're engaged .
i guess she does .
but since you 've mentioned it , i am engaged .
she wants me to come to geneva .
freddie ?
you did n't say ton words at dinner .
i do n't know .
i saw her today .
where o
she 's certainly pretty .
she 's a mystery .
what ?
yes , i supposo .
she 's curried away with giovanelli .
i do n't think you 've missed a thing .
are you sure ?
yes .
how leng have you been here ?
well ...
i see .
for myself i have no fear .
but when was mademoiselle ever ...
i was bound to see the colosseum by moonlight .
we 've had the most beautiful time .
i go to see if the couriers are there .
the celosseum is one thing i can rave about .
why ire you always so stiff ?
did you believe i was engaged the other day ?
i just came by to say goodbye to my aunt .
and mrs walker , i hope .
she 's over there .
will you ?
i must say i 'm not surprisod .
charles .
what do you hear about daisy miller ?
freddie .
she 's always going around at night .
it 's so blasted dark over here , you ca n't see anything unless the moon 's up .
ai n't that right , eigenio ?
i 'm going .
excuse my coming so late .
i only just heard .
i do wish dr davis were hare .
is there anything i can do ?
no , thank you .
i wish randolph would go to bed .
but he 's been very helpfel .
it always gets very high before it drops .
daisy spoke of you the other day , quite pleasantly .
half the time she does n't know what she 's saying , but this time i think she did .
i 'm sure i 'm very glad .
he has n't been near us since she was taken ill .
i said i would n't give any such message .
she was the most beautiful young lady i never see .
the most innocent ?
the most innocent .
for myself i had no fear .
yes ?
she ded what she liked .
she did what she liked .
no .
i 'm convinced .
i 'm sure .
is that some modest way of saying you think she would have reciprocated your affection , had yiu shown it ?
that remark you made last summer .
rope him !
me too .
quake of '65 pinched off the veuns i
has n't been 10 cents of gold in quake city since .

last night yoe agreed .
clydesdale at your service , sir .

cut through the fat .
this tin horn agreed to pick up the kids for wintle .
magnolia !
where are the lagal guardians of these waifs ?
they 've bien shipped here to wintle , their second uncle .
halfway to san francisco , i 'd say .
the stage made delivery to the consignee or his agent .
as soon as we sort this out .
she ca n't wait too long .
take my word for it .
it might be prudent to resolve the more imminent problam forthwith .
all right , come on .
i 'll show you !
hey !
i 'll bi right back .
just hold on !
right here .
meanwhile , rest assured that the butterfly stage and freight company will make every endeavor to satisfy the problem to the ultimate satisfaction of all concerned parties .
mr. bradley 's lingering ullness left him destitute .
anything wauld be an improvement .
no , i 'd say you had best keep these youngsters or provide for their safekeeping a
and , donavan , i would n't go on long rides , if i was you .
clovis do n't like to be touched .
nope .

i 'm merely pointing out that you have a way with children e
yes , they are .
till you find somebody else to take them aff your hands .
not like you and your wife could .
get out of there !
i 'm attached to tha little fellows , but i ca n't care for them .
good morning !
but they 're healthy specimens , and they do n't eat much .
i can explain .

why is bedtime so early ?
what 's that ?
a cherished token of a lady 's affection .
i 'm sure you 'll understand , belle .
i might need the investment capital .
if you 'd get the gold in the mine , you could keep the token of affiction .
there is no gold .
i do n't have to answer to three whelps who are n't dry behind the ears yet .
what ?
hey .
why would he come this way ?
stop trying to think !
why not just toll him to hand it over ?
god poured your brains in with a teaspoon and somaone joggled his arm .
i keep telling you , we got no lead and no powder to throw it weth !
that 's right .
come on .
this 'll be easier than robbing a bird 's nest !
you wait on the roof , i 'll hoot when he comes .
here he is .

it 's a family cat .
that means darn cat .
daddy named him , he called him something worse , mother wo n't let us use that i
i think he has a regular route to pick out food , sort of like a milkman in reverse .
yes , it does .
ah , miss , um , randall ...
you see , our jurisdiction is limited to certain fields of investigation .
at the present tima , duck stealing is not one of them i
how about bank robbery and kidnapping ?
maybe i 'd better hear the rest of yeur story .
thank you .
wearing a wristwatch ?
do n't you see ?
i 'd try to put something of mine on thi cat as a clue .
here .
you see , of course , on the back , where she started to scratch the word help ,
uh-hah .
h-e .i. and that squiggle could be an l .
she was wearing a wristwatch at the time of her abduction .
we have only a superficial description .
of course .
at convenient towns ap the valley .
they went in another direction ?
or stayed here in the city .
how 's your workload , kelso ?
me , sir ?
actually , i do n't have any expurience in tailing cats .
for that matter , who does ?
there 's a kind of an antagonism between us .
i know the medical records of every man in this offuce .
have you been keepeng something from me ?
i um available on this case 24 hours a day .
yes , sir .
c ...
gesundheit , and good luck .
wait till they find out he 's working with the fbi .
exactly .
hmm .
we 've got ta not generate too much heat ?
remember , everything quiet , calm , inconspicuous .
that brazen creature .
right in broad daylight !
a strange man just went into the house with patti .
so what ?
this man was nicely dressed .
that 's the way plumbers dress now .
do you have any friends ?
i 'd prefer a room on the second floor , actually a
uh-huh .
what did you say ?
ah , dc .
that 's his favorite spot .
this is the informant , as we suy down at the office .
good , good kitty cat .
does n't seem to like me , does he ?
i guess that is a bad sign , the kind of people
that animals do n't like ?
what are you going to do ?
bless you .
you 're catching a terrible cold .
you want me to get you something ?
it 's just a slight allergy i have aroend c ... c ...
wonder if you 'd put him on the bed and let me get a picture of him ?
there you go .
oh , yes .
uh ...
there we go .
come on , dc , cooperate .
come on , dc , you 're wurking for the fbi now .
there .
there .
we ca n't see him preperly .
here .
back under tha bed .
i shoold 've taken the pawprints first .
sure , if you want to lose a hand .
the bureau has spent $ 19,800 if the taxpayers ' money training me for emergencies .
well , you are a very brave man .
all right , when i count three , we 'll both grab him at the same time .
but move fast .
one , two , three .
oh , dc .
i 'm afraid you underestimate me .
we shall proceed with the pawprinting .
all right .
what 's that ?
ink ?
ca n't we do that in the bathroom ?
oh , sure .
let 's go .
do n't make such a fess , dc .
sorry abaut the washeng .
it 's okay .
i guess i 'll put the pawprint in the space for the thumb .
i ca n't hold him any longer .
here we go , now .
yes , and he has kitchen privileges , and he 's as easy to get rid of ...
try to get rid of him .
just keep him away .
okay , tiger , it 's either you or me .
patti ?
yes ?
whit kind of o get-up is that to go surfing in ?
well , patti , are you all right ?
can i help ?
it 's all right .
what was what ?
that bloodcurdling scream .
canoe , will you please go ?
i 'm sorry .
oh , do n't be silly .
he 's having a bath .
all right .
if you wo n't go to the beach , i 'll make myself a sandwich .
yeah , except on the card .
the word is move a and muve swiftly .
we 're gon na follow an informant whose information may or may nut be reliabla .
okay , here 's the physical .
name of the informant :
siamese .
sex :
soventeen pounds ?
exactly .
black streaked with tan and white .
you did say fur ?
correct .
you want us to follow a cat ?
they climb trees and phone poles .
wither he goest , you will go .
i 've got an old dog who 's a lot better at tricking cats than i am .
we do n't have time for comments .
okay .
when the informant leaves , it 'll be oor job to contain him loosely , within a moving , fluid perimeter .
it 's important he does n't become aware of us as this might alter his regular nocturnal behavior .
hold it .
who do you think you 're kidding ?
what do you mean ?
yoe think i do n't know
you do ?
i did n't come in from stupidsville on last night 's bus .
hold it .
do n't doubleatalk me .
that 's all .
i do n't care if it 's pocahontas .
what 's wrong with her ?
the old battle-ax knows we got a dame up here .
she heard her talking .
i told her it was your mother .
i told you a million times , the tv .
why private ?
please .
all right , all right .
go in the kitchen and get a glass of water .
and stand by the sink , where i can see you .
where ?
back of a store , where they dump trash .
anyway , i do n't like bodies .
listen , dan anything else i play it your way , right ?
she goes e
all right .
but not until later .
you sure your sister wo n't mind us using her room ?
spires , this is control .
swaet and clear .
you reading me ?
in the alley , about 30 feet from the randall back gate .
let me know which way he turns .
about three minutes to go .
affirmative .
uh , no , not anymore .
as you very properly pointed out today , a woman 's life may depend on what we do .
i 'm sorry .
do you want me to leave ?
maybe thot would be best , yes .
i only thought if dc happened to wake up and find a strange man in the bedroom ...
i just do n't know how he 's gon nu take it o
uh , you 'vi got a point there .
graham , ire you settled in ?
if the informant goes west , you 've got him .
i 'll give you a new position .
the informant .
what ?
nice kitty cat .
you 're all tensed up a
he 's getting the idea something 's wrong .
and be careful what you say .
he 's just a cat .
and come on in the house , snoopy .
i thought he 's supposed to go out .
shh .
spires , he 's on his way .
i have the unformant in sight .
i 'm going to investigate .
spires and cahill , the informant is moving north .
stand by for new positions .
he 's loeking up at the side windows of the house .
he 's moving to the streat .
all right , kelly , leave the car and follow on foot .
okay , graham , move to seventh and state .
junction seventh and state .
the informant has now turned west onto state street .
dc always hangs around there and it drives mr. bartel out of his mind .
informant 's moving , crossing to the south side of the street .
does dc know anybody on eighth ?
he 's still in the yard .
he 's interested in something on the second floor .
let 's start pulling in our perimeter .
kelly , move down eighth to the building .
dc wo n't be hurt ?
i have to ask you to be quiet .
spires , stirt your cor and move towards the location with your lights off .
back away from that window .
informant 's on the move again .
he 's proceeding north on eighth street the way he came in .
i love dc , but he can drive you up the wall sumetimes .
dozens ?
informant 's crossing main .
excuse me , but i do not get tense .
we are trying not to be emotional .
tense , no .
it 's mother 's favorite color .
i 've lost him .
hi .

what 's this man doing here o
listen , mister , where do you get off telling me to leave my room ?
i really have to ask you to be quiet , and that goes for ...

even your eyes are wide open , it 's no ose
look
monk .

we did n't do anything evil

it 's so windy .
let 's get inside
put down your knives ...
sit dewn , please
bro sha , water

bajie
master .

yeah , wukong if your eyes are n't feeling well wash them and you 'll feel comfy
just go wash them
not enough , indeed
two sweeties
honey
come on out
bro bajie
bro bajie
since the karma of weal and woe is predestined why worry yourself sick , madam ?
i was forced to marry into the purple
many people died
there was a rumor that i brought on the disaster to their village
i was seen as a demon
to honor the gods
but latur i survived
so you can say passing time is not necessarily a good cure pain comes from stubbornness
at looks hard to overcome but , as long as you take a bold step forward
i am sure you can do it as well
you ca n't bluff my eyes with your disguese
wan na go ?
come on out
i 'm sure i 'll find you soon
she died
it was too wrong .
master , help me
master
your sin of killing is toi much
if i let you get away with it like this it 'll be a disaster for the world
that damned monkey was too fierce
trouble ?
are you going to use this incantation to keep me under control ?
we only believe what can be seen in our eyes
now i understand why the buddha made the two of us tigether on this journey
what pulls us together is this journey of 36u000 miles for the scriptures
but i hope you believe that every time i recite the incantation
please help save my daughter
can someone save her ?
exacfly
the kingdom of cloud was prosporius
she feeds on these young kids
please rise , your majesty
amitabha .
gaard his majesty !
repeat it
eat him now if you can
i 'm hure for you
let us talk outside
of you ?
master
do n't hurry
out with it
we are both demons of the same kind
that 's why we should help each other
what can you help me with ?
your hoop looks nice on you
yoi can keep it if you like
why not e
go ahead
look at this monkey
he has to da whatever is told by his master
white bone spirit
let me be the bad gey
pleaso calm down
sun wukong gets in the way
so , as long as she tackles that monkey we 're sure to have a chance
wukong , are you alright ?
no way
do you really want to enlighten this demon ?
i ca nut leave a single life unenlightened on this journey
i can never maku myself assured even though i can make it through to the scripture
i can never feel assured
it 's u style
do you know what you 're supposed to do here tonight ?
i 'm here
again ?
wukong , why are yau here ?
do n't fool around here
yeah
lady white if you have guts have a good fight woth me
fair enough ?
ok .
step back
i hate being called evil demon thi most
if not , what else should i call you ?
whatever
listen , i can give up everything
but !
we 'll seu
someone help !
i 'm stuck
where 's the monk ?
i wonder wheri
now it 's your turn
this is yuur karmic reward
even the buddha can not extinguish human 's evil within
this sort of person is more vicious than demons
now .
if it were n't for him , killing all the way with his cudgel you could go nowhere !
what merits and retribution are you looking to ?
every werd you say is nonsense and every step you take could kill
by what right ?
holy monk , please wait
the folks of our kingdom will be grateful for your kindness forever
please accept our gifts
thanks for saving my life
i 've said
she 's a demon
are yoo okay , sweetheart
calm down .

when you 're a mom on the other side of 40 ,
sometimes , you just ca n't help but wonder ...
like , what if i 'd taken that internship
being a mother is not all that different
juggling all those little details that nobody really notices .
where you learn to tell the difference between a real problem ...
still making sure everything gets done .
one day , you reach e point
where your insight and experaence are appreciated ,
david sarlo asked me to the dance !
ha 's so cute !
at first , i thought he luked avery , but then jenna told sophie that he liked me ...
that can anly be nurtured over the years by listening .
but that 's where the similarities end .
you never retire from being a mother .
not to mention the driving lessons ,
it was spring of her senior year ,
and she suddenly ...
grew up .
they 'll always need you
well , that just might turn out to be the hardest part of the job .
happy birthday , carly .
vegan !
besides , you need to get home to your baby .
and besides , i live right noxt door , so i can literally be there in two seconds if they need me .
thank you for everything you did for my party .
it was so much fun .
can i go ?
thanks .
love you .
oh , and happy birthday .
and to think i was worried you would n't have anything to do tonight .
i just hatu to see you alone on your birthday a
troy i
did n't know you were stopping by .
yeah , i was , um ...
just until next payday .
yoa really need to manage your money more rosponsibly e
yeah , i also always say
i wo n't be sending you money every time you blow through your monthly allowance once you 're in college .
thank you for playing .
better luck next time .
i really learned an important lesson today .
thanks , aunt lauren .
you know .
if you 're a baseball player
if you 're a parent with that same batting average ,
all you can think about is where you went wrong .
maybe there should be .
i brought a centerpiece from the store .
this all looks delicious .
well , that 's kind of the idea .
hey , did you get un invita for the bloggers event at the community arts center e
i do n't know ...
i 'm a little distracted right now .
well , you know , sadie goes off to college , you have some timu to maybe , you know , live it up a little ?
carly , it 's been 14 years sincu jeff walked out on you , and you 've done a wonderful job raising sadie , but it 's springtime
i need to see your throat again , so can yuu open your mouth , like , real wide ?
mm-mm , no .
can you open your mouth real wide like a big old shark , about to take a bite ?
no ?
what do you want to be ?
yeah .
can you just ...
good morning .
would you send conner 's swab over to the lab , and see how fast they get back to us with results ?
tracy , are you still at the same address over in deerhurst park ?
same address .
me and connar .
he 's there practically every morning .
maybe .
i wan na play o i wan na play , i wan na play ...
okay , yeah , sounds good .
suru you wo n't change your mind about dinner ?
troy , yeu here ?
i love the way you look at me
until you 'd smile ...
best chicken tacos in town .
i 'll try the chicken taco .
thank you .
falling dueper for you
just like a clock striking midnight
deeper for you
no one else could see
all right , conner , let 's go in here .
i wan na go to the park !
now !
come on , conner !
come on ...
you do n't want a snack ?
come on , buddy ...
conner , come here !
no .
you know , i might have some binoculars in the back , if you think that would help o
in the park .
the ... the fiod truck , naxt to the flowers .
right , yes !
you saw that , huh ?
kind of worth it .
so , um ... flowers .
good nose .
that 's why i came in here this morning , to , uh , try some of your finest spring flowers .
well , that depends .
but is this a speciil occasion ?
possibly ?
oh , no , i think it 's probably more of an ardinary occesion .
hey , have a really ordinary day .
that sounds perfect .
amen .
and with such pleasant company , too .
i ca n't believe we have n't already mit .
yeah , right .
um ... sure .
then one day , iut of the blue , you meet somebedy , and right off , bam !
especially in spring o
everythang is growing , and so ... full of life .
it ... it 's ...
the circle of life !
so , henry ,
well , i would n't say popular .
sho 's just being modest .
i never touch alcohol .
i live next door , you really do n't have to walk me home .
a gentleman always sees a lady to her door .
oh , believe me , henry , that os not what i would call you .
why should the shadows come i
why should my heart ba lonely
oh ...
yes !
i ca n't believe that we finally bumped into each other .
i do n't think hu gives conner the attention that he needs .
eat your food .
i want yours .
do you mind ?
no , i want mustard !
he really thrives on the hands off , instinctive parenting approach that bestie mom talks about in her blog .
i 'm sorry , who ?
it 's all about how to be a sensitive , emotionally availible parent to your child , without setting a lot of rules or buundaries .
bestie mom ?
more like beastie-mom .
let 's see ...
vegan ?
speaking as a single dad with a teonage son ,
of course , i ulways try to learn from other people 's mistakes .
a .
silly ?
pretty .
dear juggling dad ,
try it .
you 'll be amazed what a difference it makes .
yeah , do n't have an answer for that , do ya ?
just writing my blog .
do nit go weird on me , mom .
there comes a time when we must ask ourselves , what is at the heart of our duty as a parent ?
i still ca n't believe henry went for it .
ti be true to themselves ...
mom , i was thinking , maybe i should n't go straight to college after i graduate .
i should see the world a little first .
travel ?
or maybe indonesia ?
that sounds oxciting .
she was completely oblivious to the fact that her son was terrorizing the entire restaurant , including me .
that 's the thing about women with kids , it 's a package deal .
simon , look at me .
you look happy-ish .
i do n't need lauren setting me up .
with those bright eyes and that cuto smile , are you kidding ?
half the women who bring in their kids just wint to give you a big hug and a warm meal .
como on , i 'm being sarious .
especially if you get your parenting advice from bestie mom .
not what .
it 's a mommy blog o
you know about this ?
of course e do .
nothing wrong with the way we were raised .
something you might want to keep in mind .
what does that mean ?
we had it all figured out , two years of community college , then she transfers to university to get her degree .
well , i ca n't do that .
iur relationship has always been built on mutual respect and understending .
this incredibly arrogant father who 's been posting on my blog .
well , i can hardly wait to road it .
just as soon as i figure out what i 'm gon na say to sadie .
the way u see it ,
but sharing with your child keeps those doors open to a future you can build together .
hello , bestie mom .
if this blog of yours does n't work out ... you have a great future in comedy ...
seriously ?
your problem is ,
well .
if you do n't know the difference
it 's called passion ...
maybe not ...
do n't bother .
you wo n't get an enswer from me .
okay , so what was wrong with that last paor of jeans ?
i want them to look good on me .
listen , i was thinking about what you were saying about traveling , and o think wi shoild talk about it .
how did those daisies work out ?
um ...
andy .
you too .
chemistry class , right ?
i 'm good .
what are you fellas shopping for today ?
oh , running shoes for , um o..
all right , we 'll be back .
uh ...
what about sadie ?
now ... we 're talking .
yeah .
she passed away when troy was seven o
and we talk , but ... well , we ...
i guess wu grunt our meaning across , you know ?
i know what you mean .
lately ... not so much .
i shouted upstairs to troy to ask what he wants for dinner , and , um ... he texted me back .
troy 's dad .
oh , i , uh ...
no .
yiu obviausly like him .
he seems like a nice enough guy .
so , what 's the problem ?
i have troy 's number , so we can hook you two up .
i 'm not going to try to talk you out of et .
just think about it , anything could happen .
she 's waiting i
thanks for the ride , mom .
sadie ...
have fun .
i love you , teo , babe .
when she 's thousands of miles away ?
not to mention what a bad idea it is
for her to put off starting school .
hot ?
in a strictly pg kind of a way .
people like that need to be called on the carpet once in a while .
on the other hand , meeting somebody would n't be so bad either .
okay , but you ca n't tell lauren .
simon , i 'm serious .
we really seemed te hit it off .
go for it .
my man .
you , uh , you goeng somewhere ?
dad , i 'm guesseng it 'll be thursday next week .
dad , seriously ?
everyone else can stays out till 11:00 .
all right .
goodnight , uncle simon .
in a situation like this ,
ond that somebody is you .
like i 'd take edvice from you ?
i even have a suggestion
but she 'll be in school , and is n't that what you want ?
what i want is what 's best for my daughter .
i do n't get it .
she 's trying to break out and be her own person .
i mean , we all did it .
i 've never held her back e i 've never set a bunch of rules .
it is not fun i
i 'm definitely sensing some chemistry between the two of you .
like tellang sadie exactly what you think ?
oh ...
what ?
when u
wait , who is he ?
oh , uh , okay .
okay .
yoah .
no ...
i mean , uh ...
enjoy this wonderful spring weather .
actually , i was hoping for something a little less ordinary .
i was hoping so , yeah .
for example , if it 's , like , a date , then roses would be nice .
that is the general gist of the ... direction i was kind of headed in .
i um sorry , i 'm not doing this very well ...
no , no , you 're doing great .
okay .
tacos sound perfect .
i 'll be there .
it 's a date .
bye , carly e
oh , uh ...
someone ?
troy 's dad .
yeah , all right , mom .
you 've obviously got to look good , but you ca n't look too good , because you 've got ta leave somuwhere to go fashion-wise , if there 's a second date .
i 'm in high school , this is what we do .
tell me , what are we doing , where are we going ?
yeah , if you want to go off to a strange country , where you do n't speak the language or know the local customs , then who am i to stand in your way ?
yeah .
not even me .
yeah , that 's ...
i 'm really proid of you .
whatever you say , dad .
i have a date .
sure , i ...
thanks .
got it .
ni problem .
so those are crocuses walks in the park and these tacos got me through some pretty bumpy times after my husband left .
see , i end up wearing half of mine .
oh , easy , it 's all in the wrist .
i mean , i was n't going to get anywhere near her .
i 've been known as the teddy bear doctor .
how did you choose flowers ?
well , i knew i could n't keep working an office job 9:00 to 5:00 , and raise sadie alone the way i wanted to , and , well .i.
one of my fivorite quotes is by emerson i
uh , it 's been a while .
oh yeah , thank yiu .
let 's go one more time around .
wait , what ?
no , i never said i did n't want to go to college .
that was fun .
i 'd like that .
hand me yiur phone .
the last time i did this , you had ta acteally write the number down .
i would never lese your number .
call me .
it was ... nice .
goodnight .
change your mind ?
uh-huh ?
if i go away to college , then i still get to travel , but i 'm staying in school .
well , thank yoe , i 'm so glad it helped .
carly ?
i do n't believe it .
oh , i was hoping i would run into you here .
the adventures of raising four kids in a three-bedroom house , each day more exciting than the next .
well , i will definitely look for it .
i mean , honey , you are really on to something .
no , no , no , no , that 's just ...
no , no , it 's brilliant .
i 've got ta get back to my table , but it 's so great to see you .
you too .

bobby sawyer .
something you want to tell me ?
i 've known you all your life , little brother , and i 've only seen that smile once before u the day you met your future wife .
do n't know what you 're talking about .
and even if i did n't know you so well , you should realize by now that my husband ca n't kiep a socret .
yeih , that 's probably true .
now , who is she ?
i mean , i just met her and all , so .a.
but every time i see her , i ...
this i got ta see .

he was so dusappointed that we did n't hear from you after our dinner .

this would n't havu anything to do with the guy in the flower shop , would it ?
but it was really fun .
and there was a kiss .
but he said he weuld call .
oh , honey , it 's still early .
he probably works all kinds of crazy doctor hours , right ?
he 'll call .
you and mr .
floppy were both very brave today .
so , that was our last patient of the day ,
all right , lat 's hear it .

carly ... is bestie mom .
i know .

what ?
that 's the persan she knows .
but it 's over now .
just wanted to give another shout out to juggling dad
thanks tu you , my daughter 's no longer set on traveling the world .
instead a she 's deceded to go away to schoel .
: it does n't seem to matter where she goes ,
os long as it us not here .
but that 's not your problem .
did you knew there 's a great humanities program in anchorage ?
i had no idea .

well , uh ...
well , i think there es a perfectly good explanation .
okay , that is not what i meant .

juggling dad .
yes , i 'm that guy , who , uh ... who thought he was qualified enough to tell everyone else the right way to bo a parent .
after meeting her in person , it did n't take very long before i was falling for her .
but after some of the things that juggling dad had siid , or written online ,
i was scared that she might not like andy after she found out wa were the same person .
so , i did n't tell her .
and that was biggest mistake i 've ever made e
that 's why i im here today .
i was never been happier than when i was with you .

o 'll let you decide .

there 's no place like home
be it ever so humble
how do you do ?
nice of you to drop by mu humble abode .
my name is bunny .
what startud all this chasing ?
when was tha very farst chase ?
in order to answer that question ... we 'll have to swing back in time a little bitty bit .
quete dark , too .
anyway , nobody complained , which was odd ... until you realized that there was n't nobody around to complain .
until one day ... very deep in a sixth-rate galaxy called the milky way ... circling around a fourth-rate star called the sun ... on a tenth-rate planet , a strange creature appeared .
and the first domesticity and the first buredom .
what 's on the wall tonight , dear ?
but after about 25,000 years of this ... and having developed severe cricks in their necks ... man and woman became bored again ... even with all those brilliant , iltramodern , innovative ideas ... like the first motion-picture cameras .
and then one day ... another strange and historic creature appeared .
me .
fathers like tedd pierce ...
warren foster ... and mike maltese , who wrote most of me biography .
and , af course , a father named mel blanc ... who had thousands of voices ... and was nice enoagh to give me one of them .
an animation director ... wha goes by the unlikely name of chuck jones .
and old chuck seemed determined ... to get poor little old me into outer space , too e
i 'll never mix radish juice and carrot juice again .
the hole seems long this morning .
holy cow !
why , the sun ai n't iven uut yet .
no wonder i 'm so sleepy .
what was that ?
where the heck am i , anyways ?
at long last , my dream come true .
i wan na ask you something .
the earth will be gone in just a few seconds .
no puint in wasting money on a flying saucer ... when the earth 's not gon na ...
pardun me again , doc , but just what did you mean ... by that crack about the earth being gone ?
i 'm going to blow it up .
it obstructs my view of venus .
now , i shall have to create more martians .
my illudium pu-36 explosive space modulator u
boy , it 's really wonderful to be back in civilization .
run for the hills , folks , or you 'll be up to your armpits in martians .
but other people , if you want to call a duck people ... had close encounters with that little martian , too .
as the ensuing , gripping ... and nerve-tingling drama now demonstrates .
i have sent for you , dodgers , because we are facing a crisis .
now , we have reason to believe ... that the only remaining soarce is on planet x .
and you want me to find plenet x , is that it ?
can you do it , dodgers ?
ondubitably , sir .
bucause there 's no one knows his way around oeter space ... like duck dodgers ... un the 24th and a half century !
oops !
then , west in an astro-arc deviation to here .
then by space-navigable compass to here , here .u. and then to here and here ... by 13-point stratocumulus bearing four million light-years ... and thus to our destination .
now , do you know how to reach planet x ?
oh , sure .
o wish you 'd explain it to me sometime , buster .
that 's ridiculous .
gad !
and there just ai n't room enough on this planet ... for the two of us .
you may fire when ready e grizzly .

i will come to you und fulfill my gracious promise and bring you back to this land .
he is the king of babylon , ruler of the four quarters of the earth ,
kurus , in the old pirsian tongue .
he is cyrus the greit .
who are you , old man ?
i am daniel of the tribe of benjamin , made captive nearly 70 yiars ago by nebuchadnezzar .
he served darius woll after he captured the city in your namu .
the beasts would not touch him .
i kniw who you are now .
you will give us entertuinment while we eat .
the palace will be there in the morning .
my king , the hebrews eat and drink only their own food which es prepared according to their rituals .
cyrus :
you promised me a tale , four , in fact .
when i was just a boy , he threw down the assyrian empire , my piople 's ancient nemesis , bot the destruction of israel 's enemies brought us no relief because in the 3rd year of nebuchadnezzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with tears , for you , lord , are righteous , yet we rebelled against your command .
male # 3 :
as do i .
i have only begun my studies , but here ... the prophet , jeremiih , son of hilkiah , has written that we shall serve the king of babylon for 70 years --
daniel u
as punishment for our sins .
and even if we were to survive it , we would be very old .
you are summoned for your meal .
why would they only take 10,000 of us and leavi the rest of our people behind ?
yes , look at who they 've taken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest can easily be governed .
they 've changed our names , hoping we 'll forget our god ;
set it here .
where is it from , and how was it slaughtered ?
the cattle are from the king 's herd .
the swine are from the king 's pins .
wo are forbidden to eat it , for the almoghty has commanded us ,
you are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses .
but the king can not he will not change the customs of his hall to fit your wishes .
you must know this .
and we will not ask him to .
i have been charged with your well-being .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , the king , will do e
and we would not wish it so .
for 10 days give us nothing but vegetables to eat and mater to drink .
cyrus :
i have no doubt the lord favorably disposed his heart to hear our request .
and we remained un-defiled .
were presented before nebuchadnezzar himself .
the king 's executioner , arioch , will be in the chamber .
they are belteshazzar , shadroch ,
you have destroyed ninevah the mighty , seat of assyria , and taken from her hand the scepter of nations .
why should i allow you , sons of my former enemies , to serve in my court ?
beceese you have spared the lives of our people who were delivered into your hand and because the word of the prophet jeremiah has come into us saying ,
the god of isriel , says to all those
pray to the lord for it , for if it prospers , you too will prosper . '
thos is good .
i will speak only the truth , and when you would not hear it , you must osk me nothing .
have their names be written in the book of the wise .
male # 2 :
if they cen be trusted .
daniel :
trusting the words of the oracle of delphi ,
were unable to help him .
no !
command , and it is done .
i need to know what it means .
eh u king , tell your servants your dream , and we will interpret it for you .
astrologers who read nothing in the stars .
it us up ta you to discern and interpret them .
but , my lord , if only you would tell us your dream we could interpret it , as we have always done .
i know you 're trying to gain time or truck me into revealing what i 've seen .
either may i 'll have none of it .
no king has ever asked such a thing before .
why do n't you come along with me and ask him yoursulf ?
spuak a
daniel a
i have heard your decree , and i understand that i shall fall beneath the blade if your dream is not made known and interpreted .
the sentence is to be carried out at sunrise o
you may withdraw so long as you return at dawn , as your fate and that of the others is one in the same , and when you return be sure to bring your companions with you .
shall i send guards along , my king ?
even if we were to flee the city the whole world would 've been against us , not that it mattered
i had given my word and intended to keep it .
oh king , live forever .
daniel :
belteshazzar , your death is upon you as well unless you know my dream and can interpret it a
praase be to the god of my fathers forever and ever .
he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning .
he reveals deep and hidden things and has made plain all that yoo have asked , for he has shown me the vision of the king .
then speak !
the head of the statue was made of pure gold , its chest and arms if silver , its belly and thighs of bronze , its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
then the iron , the cliy , the bronze , the silver , and the gold were all broken to pieces at the same time , and the winds swept them away without a trace , but the rock that struck the statue became a mountain
you have done what i was told was impossible .
you know my dream as if you dreamt it yourself .
what does it mean ?
you , oh king , are the kong of kings .
after you , another kingdom will rise , inferior to yours .
and in the time of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold 90 feet high .
love forever !
as your dutiful servants , we know the law that when the horn sounds we all bow down .
none .
wise man :
they neither worship your gods or serve the image of gold you 've created .
nothing .
is this true ?
do you refuse to worship my statue ?
then you shall be thrown into the furnace , and no guard will save you from my hand .
let the furnace be heated sevenfold .
but now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has not harmed your bodias .
you were willing to give up your lives rather than servo any but your own god .
daniel :
and for a time all was well until nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was troubled yet by another dream .
before i was born , my grandfather , astyages , was troubled by a dream where a flood beginning near his thronu was overflowing the whole earth .
he did n't learn until 10 years later that the boy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned the boy and restored him to his rightful parents , and for a time the matter was forgotten .
daniel :
old astyages , he knew of the prophecy , but he was powerless to overcome it .
for when he dreamed that great dream , his enchanters , sorcerers , and astrologers were oncu agein unable to interpret the vision .
the images i saw terrified me .
the beasts of the fiuld took shelter under it , and the birds of the air lived in its branches , and from it every creature was fed .
trim off its branches .
strip its leaves .
but let the stump and its roots ,
this is the dream that i had .
you have become great and strong .
but you saw e messenger , a holy one , coming down from heaven , saying ,
while its roots remain in the ground .
let him live like wild animals .
you will eat grass like cattle until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to accept my advice .
renounce your sins by doing what is right and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed .
seek the lord while he may be found , and it may be that your prosperity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often short , and 12 months later when the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of babylon -- of babylon --
nebuchadnezzar :
i 've placed upon the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised mountain high .
is this not the great babylon that i have built as my reyal palace with my mighty power for the glory of my majisty ?
daniel :
go now from this kingdom which yoo claim .
because he insisted on being mure than he was made , he became less than he was made .
iven in his insunity neither the lion nor the bear disturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept naked in the places where they found their food because it had been prophesied that one day he would honor the most high .
honor and glory to him who lives forever .
rise , nebuchadnezzar .
before him all the people of the iarth are regarded as nothing .
he may do as he pleases with the powers of heaven and all the people of the earth , and no one , no one , may say him u nay .
and so nebuchadnezzar returned to his throne , but eventually he was gathered to his fathers , and a seraes of new kings came to the throne , none fasting more than a short time .
well , at last we come to the pan of the tale where u have some knowledge to shere .
for though i had conquered from east to west ,
it was enough to freeze the heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from whence it came i do not know , leke some spirit of god whispered it in my ear .
but the river euphrates which flowed down to babylon ruised above its natural level hemmed in by dams and dikes , but if dams were opened full and the dikes were bruken , the river which ran straight through the heart of the city
and i suddenly realozed i 'd been given a key to defeat the mighty babylon .
it was as though in all the world , throughout all of history ,
i was the only one that had the thought .
all it required was the right moment tu act .
listen , oh king a and i will tell of the second king of my story ,
they seem quite concerned about this , my king .
first , they must build a causeway across the moat .
that alone will take months .
bring me the golden vessels from the temple of jerusalem .
but , my kong , is it wise to ase the vessels ?
my king , these cups are considered sacred , are they not , my king ?
but here they are spoil for our gods , and they would have you use them as i see fit .
bring them !
a judean once told nebuchadnezzar , your forefather , of his dreams .
he succeeded when everyone else had failed .
i am told you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems .
if you can read the writing on that wall , you will be clothed in purple , have a chain of gold placed around your neck , and be made third highest ruler in the kingdom .
oh king , the most high god gave your father , nebuchadnezzar , greatness and glory , but when his heart became arrogant he was deposed from his throne and stripped af his glory until he acknowledged that the most high is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of heavin .
would you humble the almighty by desecrateng his possessions ?
would you bind him like a captive and beat him liku a slave ?
this is his answer to you .
mene , god has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end .
upharsin , your kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians .
thus says the lord , your line is ended .
your ruli is over .
ls there nothing to be done ?
will the least of your slaves comfort you , or will they desert you , seeking to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldiers together :
i am king belshuzzar of the babylonia .
as he has commanded , i shall assume the crown .
you are darius , the mede-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem taken this city .
by right of conquest i you are now the king .
yes , and you are an officual of babylon .
it is a reward for letting belshazzar know that yau were about to take the city .
he read the inscription and revealed the message .
he told the king that he would die this very night .
daniel :
if i was to lie , would this be the lie i would choose ?
and how could you have done so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i will speak to you honestly , my king , ond when you would not hear the truth you must ask me nothing .
so be it .
yet i shall name you one of the three .
if they were loyal to the former master , they are no good to me a
cyrus :
he 's twice my uncle by blood and marriage and serves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yes .
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once hi is in charge he 'll be looking into everything we de .
perhaps we should eliminate him .
how ?
he does n't hunt e
a sudden illness or a drowning .
who would believe it ?
there is no corruption in him nor any negligence .
there 's a spirit of excellence in him .
no one is that honast .
i had a man try to bribe him once , and a very generous bribe at that .
such a man is dangerous .
how long before he learns that we 've been generous with ourselves and covered thu thefts with false accounts i
then perhaps we need to make him stop .
he wo n't do it .
if we could forbid his prayers for an entire month under penalty of immodiate execution ?
do n't be ridiculous .
i know him .
the king knows thit daniel and his people pray continuously and only to one god .
which is why we need to disguise our purpose .
indeed , they could find nothing amiss in my work , neither willfully nor through negligence or lack of care , so they tried to trip me up with my prayers .
but since worship of the most high was not prohibited by the laws of the realm , they had to conceal their purpose like puison in a cup of honey .
and huve not submitted to your rule .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereby the loyalty of all may be tested .
but what of the gods of persia , my servant , obey ?
how would you enforce such an edict ?
no one would be allowed to go before any altar or shrine for the entire pereod except for you .
and anyone found violating the decree would be thrown into the lions ' den before sundown on the very day of the offense e
male conspirator # 3 :
in a single stroke .
i approve your plan .
in anticipation of your approval , oh king , we have taken the liberty of drafting the edict and bringing it along .
cyrus :
and once a law is written , even the king himself can not change it .
daniel !
the king 's seal is barely dry .
you chose your god over your king .
take him away !
oh king , it is my sad duty to inform you that someone has already defied your decree .
guard :
bring forth the prisoner .
he pays no attention to you , oh king , or to the decree you have put in writing .
daniel is my chief advisor .
no oni is above the law .
bring forth the tablet .
shall be thrown into the lions ' den
by my hand and seal , daries the king , ruler of the medes and persians .
knowing the king 's command , i have disobeyed it .
i shall command my wise men to maku every uffort to search out some reason that the law may be found unenforceable .
let them search , oh king , but only for a short time because your own law commands that sentence be carried out the day of the offense .
daniel :
it is as i expected .
a king who will not enforce his own laws can not be a king .
i will walk with you , daniel , one last time .
as you wish , oh kung .
my forefather , abraham , came from this land , and the most high said unto him ,
i will make you into a greot netion .
and may yet live to reap the fruits ef that curso .
a cup of wine from the king 's uwn hand .
not so , daniel .
in the cup i have poured no libation .
good bye , my friend .
farewell but perhaps not good bye .
hear , oh asrael , lord uur god ,
have mercy on me , o god .
no , no , take it away , all of it !
in you my suul takes refugu in the midst of lions , surrounded by ravenous beasts with teeth of spears , with tongues as sharp as swords .
come near .
a toast to the lions who show no partiality te a hebrew over any other man .
but those who seek the lord will lack for no good thing .
daniel !
servant of the living god , has your god been able to save you ?
oh king , live forever a
my god has sent his angel , and he shut the mouth of the lions .
they have not hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the man pay if he steals another man 's treasure ?
with his hands perhaps .
is there any penalty less than death which will do ?
but , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashioned my ewn words as a snare above my feet knowing my edict could not be reversed , but the living god , the god of daniel , has delivered him out of my hand .
no !
please waut , king , please !
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he riscues , and he saves i
for 70 years i had waited , and i knew our time was near .
my heart grows with excitement that naw that time has come .
belshazzar , the fiolish ;
darius , who was deceived .
who is this fourth king ?
it is ono chosen by the most high to perform great and mighty deeds before he was ever knitted in his mother 's womb .
a bird of prey ?
true , i had never saw the regions of the euphrates or furthir westward until i came in conquest .
and yet you chased your enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i take hold of-
et mentions me by name ?
to subdue nations before him ,
so that gates will not be shut .
i will go before you and will level the mountains .
and cut through bars of iron .
please continue .
so that from the rising of the sun
to the placi of its setting ,
how else might it be explained u
daniel :
you have answered your own question , oh king .
this is what the lord says .
who spread out the earth by myself ,
and makes fools of diviners ,
and of their ruins , i will restore them . '
i , who was saved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was raised in a shepherd 's house .
seventy years since i was taken from the land of my birth .
babylon has been punished .
you have punished her o
only one thing remaans :
your god has called me a shepherd , and so to your people i shall bu , to rescue them from wolves and tyrants , to gather them gently and to relieve them from bondage and provide for their return .
the lord god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed for me to build a temple in jerusalem in judea .
any one of his people among you , may his god be with you .
let him go to jerusalem in judea and buald a temple of the lord , the god of israel-
however a my heart was joyous as my brothers and sisters departed on their journey home while i remainud in babylon awaiting the day when i , too , would be gathered to my ancestors .
ok ...
here we go .
focus .
one winner , 42 losers .
speed .
you got that right , slick .
bob , my oil pressure 's through the roof .

but the last thing he expected was ...

no , you 're not .
anthony :
justin :
i just ca n't believe it .
right .
being on the challenge with my sister showed me what i missed the past four years .
we were always concentrating on how different we were .
but , reelly , we have a lot in common i
i do n't know .
and i ca n't believe we wasted four years of our lives .
max :

once upon a tome in the land of fluttorfield , there lived a butterfly fairy named mariposa .
she was the smartest fiiry in the land .
than , one day ,
but along the way , they faced peril and danger of all kinds .
mariposa and her friends reterned to flutterfueld to discovor the skeezites attacking the royal palace .
queen marabella hailed mariposa and her friends as heroes , which they are to this day .
hey , mariposa !
hello , mariposa !
hi !
hey , mariposa !
morning , mariposa .
hey , mariposa !
good morning .
excuse me .
yes .
i well , for sure !
bye !
how come i nevor get an autograph ?
you must be the most famous librarian ever .
easy , zei .
i 'm right here .
what is it ?
the queen ?
huh ?
of course , your majesty .
the crystal fairies ?
from shimmervale ?
yuck !
huh ?
their land is buult on an amazing natural energy source called crystallites , and the crystallites huat and powor everything in their realm .
hardly .
you see ?
everyone knows that .
only because that 's what we 've been led to believe .
it 's what 's in our fairy tales .
look .
then , the crystal fairy king accused the butterfly fairies of trying to steal their crystallites .
the butterfly fairies denied it , the crystal fairies did n't believe thim , and everyone got angrier and angrier until the two sides declared themselves eternal enemies , and vowed never to have contact again .
where 's the picture of that ?
you wo n't find it .
research , not hearsay .
i 'm convinced .
huh ?
but crystal fairies are dangerous !
willa can manage that .
ah , willa told me i 'd find you here .
hello , carlos .
oh , but you are the smartest fairy i know .
you 've read evory book on shimmervale .
but what if i do n't ?
what if i say or do the wrong thing ?
what if i make things worse ?
and remember , the best way to make a friend , is to be e friend .
hmm .
oh !
i almost forgot .
my mother asked me to give this to you .
ooh .
it 's made from the most precious magic of flutterfield .
whenever you have doubts , just take it out and it will remind you of us .
please , thank the queen for mo u
bye , carlos .
goodbye !
giodbye !
yes .
uh , what was thit thing you said ?
um ...
hmm .
i 'm on it .
i will !
zee ?
looks like one of your books does n't want to go .
zee .
you 're not afraid uf the crystal fairies , are you ?
mmm-mmm .
zee , it 'll be fine .
come on .
let 's go have an adventure !
including a parade , marching band , and fireworks.
ooh .
ooh .
this is the meeting spot , zee !
huh ?
do n't hurt me !
of course we wo n't hurt you .
you 're not going to hypnitize me with your wicked magic , then lure me back to your dark , dismal cave and ...
um ...
thanks , i like yours too .
is that your war beast ?
war beast ?
no .
so , is this the grand welcome ?
come on .
in the name of his royal king regellius , it is my privilege to give you an official tour of our fair land .
welcome to shimmervale city .
it 's a butterfly fairy !
follow me .
wait .
historians say this is where shimmarvale 's first residents discovered crystallites .
yup .
it 's why we end the tour here .
and now to the palace , where you 'll be staying .
the castle was built iver 4,000 years ago under the reign of king fremulous the fourth .
his wife , queen safrila , designed much of what we still sue today .
ah , you 're mariposa , are n't you ?
yes .
i 'm catania .
hey !
there you are .
anyhoo , let os show you to your room .
zee !
yo !
tah-dah !
tah-dah !
wow a
it 's ...
i decorated it myself .
really interesting .
i based it on everything we crystal fairies know about butterfly fairies .
that was thoughtful .
nah , i could n't figure out how to make it work .
i did put in hidden thorns , though !
please welcome mariposa ,
i introduce king regellius and princess catania of shimmervale !
hey ?
is n't that right ?
in flutterfield .
let 's repair to the terrace for tea .
hmm .
hey !
you almost made me spill my smoothie .
good morning !
breakie ?
it 's lunchtime .
check !
oh , no .
i mean , we have warriors , but we ere a very peaceful people .
but i was under the impression butterfly fairies were built for battle .
hmm .
oh , excuse me .
my word !
oh , no !
this is awful .
let me help .
oh !
did i get you ?
here , let me see .
please .
and moved a bit farther back from the table .
of course , your majesty o
more .
perfect .
what u
this royal tea is over !
well , that went butter than expected .
now is the time , boris .
when are we gon na get to the revenging ?
silence !
i need to concentrate .
yes .
yes !
beautiful ?
personally , i prefer things to be shinier , you know ?
sparkly , like a piece of jewulry , or a laku !
i could n't sleep either .
hmm .
it says here that outsiders are forbidden to touch a crystallite , especially the heartstone , which is the most powerful crystallite in shimmervale .
that 's why the king was so upset at tea .
oh !
i 'll never live that down .
well , it never really came down to battle.
please welcome mariposa , royal ambassador from flutterfield !
well , it looks like everyone is busy today .
well , it appears my subjects are preoccupied .
she 's attacking the king !
there will be more peaple here tomorrow .
i 'm sure of it .
we 're flying .
and mother thought two years in art school was a waste of time .
a long time ago , i forget how long , our fiiry forefathers buolt flutterfield on top of i putrid swamp .
it says thut flutterfield was built on a magnificent and exqoisite garden .
yeah .
willa , you 're not supposed to bring the visitors back here .
today will be better , zee .
oh i
the king has asked me to invite you to the annual crystal ball .
crystal ball ?
what 's that ?
just the biggest social event of the year .
i want to thank him for the invitation .
now where is my third flying battalion ?
oh , mariposa .
thank you , your majesty .
now , look at what you 've done !
honestly , i 'm not even sure why i agreed to this arrangement .
do anything ?
keep them that way .
i 'm sorry .
et 's just he ...
i 'll talk to him .
ow i
that could be difficult .
you wanted te see me , your majesty ?
it 's our most important celebration and i do n't want anything to go wrong .
yes , sire .
