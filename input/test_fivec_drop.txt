wha does he nae arne saknusse mean to you , gentlemen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study of volcanoes .

he 's this close to discoeig the graiton 
i e can figure out how the gravion works 
defy it .
where bridges wo n't collapse ,
where planes wo n't crash .
mother :
ha ha .
positive .
the lab where i 'll be working -
to cool is paricle accelerator .
my 2 favorite things in he world
both : charlie 's goin ' to northern
charlie 's goin ' to northern
if you 're sue about thi , son ...
dad .
ow !
all right , laddies ...
now , you new guys need to be aware that good o ' rumson
ai n't always so goo ,
esecially when they execute the rumson rack .
what 's the rumson rack ?
o , nothin ' much , really .
they just eate a ditraction .
and when you ai n't lookin ' ...
uhh !
more work o do thi year .
player :
what the ...
ma , i thougt they ere on na give ol ' crik-in-the-neck the boot

what do i got to do , aw you a oa map  son , uh ?
come on .
i 'm charlie , and i 'll be teaching this class .
uposedly , e party started in the quad ,
and then it went to the aea ,

well , wh do n't you try something different ?
like what ?
ha ha ha .
fro a guy tha 's ee alone in the lab for the lat 15 years .
good point .
i 'l see you ate my worout .
hey , one thing .
what i realy meant was hat a good scietist
oes n't keep repeating the same experiment ove and over
epeing to get differe reults , right ?
yeah 
you know wa i mean ?
ok .
ave a good workout .
i 'll see you in the lab .
all right .
ok , buddy .
bye .
whew !
whew !
alays a classic move , bob .
you ko  i could n't agree more , dick .
ut if she wants the gold , dick ...
she 's go to nail the double oe loop .
yes !
yes !
i did n't realize anyone was here .
i 'm claie .
ch ...
a good scienist does n' keep repeating te same experiment over and over
expeting to e different results 
ch-haz .
chaz fro chicago .
so , were do you o to school ?
excuse me ?
where do you o to school ?
where do you go 
franlin .
well  there 's your answer .
cool .
cool .
chaz anthony .
amy abras ?
claire addison ?
here .
chaz antony ?
chaz antoy ?
i 'm so glad you decided to join us 
i said take a seat , young ma .
i see first impressions are your strong suit .
paul o'donnel 
fieds call me odie .
you re hard core , man .
settle in , chaz 
i 'll be teaching this class all year .
and i 'll e disrupting it .
and it ook an , many years
before galileo oud pove his theory to be corret .
that , indeed , the planets trae around the sun in a circular obit .
well  i 'm ery impessed .
uh  i was , uh ..
kating and some geek told e that the ie rink was elliptial .
while i was sickig his tongue to the ice 
eacher :
all right , al right .
as you may or may not kow ..
hey , chicago 
tis is deion 
odie says you 're don 
mind if we join you ?
i mean , yo .
experient ?
uh  yeah , experiment to see how lon i can stay in chool
without ever actually going o school .
he 's e bomb .
hey  how  it going ?
i finished the calculations for today 's expeiments .
yeah , the data 's right there on your desk
underneat your eihth grade geometry book , ca .
so , how ' ou find out ?
my computer told me .
so , who 's chaz ?
a guy who has a life .
i 've gone throuh life so far as chalie boyle
and it is n't an sleigh ride .
who thouht he , i was cool .

hat are you talkin about ?
there are geniuses your age , you now .
i was talking to a colleague oer at northern .
e was teling me abou a young man --
ho as it that heped you ?
like i said , some loser in science cub .
now , who wants to come up here
and finish charting hese poits on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , itter irony .
with a cude caiature
you know ...
ooh !
charlie 
oh , hey , dad .
and y students have become openly hostile .
not to mention te dorm foo .
well , the only fathey advice i an give you about he sciece stuff

dad , you 're a genius !
enius ?
my firt f .
your first f .
wat am i saying

ey  doc ?
you ever ave a girlfrien 
yeah , sure 
maybe 
nohing aain .
i do n' get it , calie .
and still , thee 's no sign of a graviton 
well , maybe if e tae our minds off it ,
you now , if we sit back  elax ,
and , uh , ave a litte fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
wheneve he ha a problem that he could n' solve ,
eureka !
come on , dance with e .
oh , no , i do nt think so .
uh  you do n't ant to know 
the aarm !
noting s any different .
oly a a particle up until no .
we can just as easily think of it as a wave .
you said so in your ook .
microwave conflict .
how could i mis this ?
ok , ok , what oes this mean ?
um ...
set up a phased harmonic ,
afected the nuclear matrix ,
in other words , groovy little house bea
ju unlocked the msteries of he universe !
we did it , charlie !
this is big !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can we do it late tough ?
i m kid of ate for science class .
maybe you just had a good tutor .
but you are goin to meet one .
i got to tinking it migh be goo or you o eet a kid your age
who 's not ashamed of being smar .
he can probably use ome one-on-one

oh .
oh , what 
what am i going to do ?
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .

was it one of our experiments ?
were you making a study of the loal culture ?
then i guess you ere just having a laugh at my expense .
imagine , me thinking i could teach you .
cause i ' a big fat iar .
i also left the particle accelerato on !
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
anouncer :
do not venure ono the ie !
get of he ice 
hi game is postpoed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , ad we wee this close .

breakaay 
i love breakaway .
and saves queen hloff and the argoliks ?
this is the one hee zoron find , uh , subatomic partices
and how they 're connected o a msterious uantum force 
o , yeah .
but you know omething ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to spit a hoton ,
and even though the particles ae 6 mies apar ,
whatever one does , the other one oes
coo 
and maybe unlock the secet as to ho it works .
and en ..
defy gravity .
let 's get to work .
and te output level is 999 .
now thi chip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the rubber coating ?
they all at like superbals .
and hen i press his button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ..
it means i can make amens
ell , with wat e just iscovered ,
i figure out a way to help northen beat usen .

you just try and do tat !
for the re-scheduled centra onferene chapionship
how ' thi supposed to work again ?
how is that possible 
like the super balls i showed you .
corresponing microchips with other graviton halves
whatever our kates o , teir skaes wil be forced to do .
exactly .
cheatin ?
and i helped you ge a c in cience .
you sure did a umber on this la .
nah .
beides , i 've arranged his schedule so that he 'l be gone all day .

aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !

whoa , e 're too light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we di it !
we must have reversed the charge of the gravitons !
they 're repelling agaist the positive charge of the eart !
game announcer :
the final score -- northern 1 , rumsen noting !
a long , long time .
yeah .
that 's what i call publiity 
ha ha a !

isaburo sasahara o the escort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me 
i l ell the chamberlain you boh apove .
i 'd rather see you two duel than merely tes swords .
there are umor in our an .
the reason you do n't fight is ecause it would hurt the family of the loser .
perhaps protecting your family name raher tan promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to ge along in this wold .
isaburo , you 're too attentive to our superior .
i  use to it .
i maried into my wife 's family and have been henpecked or 20 years .
would you like to look at the novebe border record ?
no , not if nothin unusual happene .
akin rice cakes in november
but there are o customer
the god who came down in ebruary and brouht the rice harvet departs tomorrow until his reurn next year 
do you really believe that ?
no , i was just
peraps you want a grandchil ?
it is n't settled yet 
no .
my wife suga is the problem .
it must be someone she approves of .
someone strong , loving an faithful .
is that the steward 's ?
he ' been waiting for you 
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about useles things lie marial arts again .
o have the stewad honor u with a visit ha never appened in the sasahara family .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been ismissed from the castle .
it has been decided to ave er marry yogoro , your son .
steward  wh was lady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll eturn for an anser in a fe days .
why soul we accept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
eeryone know that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuhiyo , she went o a spa to rest .
the daughter of gohei yamaiwa , the man in charge of the castle wardrobe , was servin beside him .
ady ichi lost her ead o seein this .
she sprang at lady tama , lapped er face , and dragged er by the hair .
ow can we accept her ?
i think we sould gateully ace her withou being dificult .
no maer what you say , we must acept her .
it 's an order from our lord 
i 'm afraid ..
i do n' feel very enusiastic about it .
neither do i 
but if i refuse , there may be trouble later .
yogoro has aid nothing , but he would n't e happy marrying a lord 's mistes who has ore a hild .
i do n't want him to repea my miake .
hey said you 'd be at the border .
i heard everythin .
he steward and chamelai are good jues .
alert een in times of peace .
but , isauo ... as for the mariage and other matters ,
i suggest you keep things quiet .
you 'll pobably receive a larger fief 
so be modest about it or the others will think you 're sowing off 
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of you or you faily .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordlay ?
but at te last moment , you skillfuly switch from defense o offense .
ye you never atak .
you wait unti your opponent ties .
unworty ?
yes .
we can ot acep our lord 's favored lay .
there 's no need to e so reserved .
it 's happened before , not jus i the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , bu even so , i ish to ecline the honor .
ecline ?
sasahara , tat wil not be allowed .
it is our ord 's personal wih .
i mean no disrespect .
you kow our lord 's wish .
it 's a order !
to decline is to defy the order !
no  i 'd neer do that 
asahara .
ou refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to acet the honor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem a bit too stubbor .
ma you enjoy lon life together
we 'll all be at your side as on as you lie
this is a day of celebration
eep that in mind .
o .
a woman who was dismissed after bearing a child .
i ' sorry i did n't noie our return 
mother took he along fo prayer at shonenji emple .
she kindly teaces me domestic duties .
i do 't believe it .
fathe ?
but despite hat , he as bore everything for 20 years 
yes , right away .
ou must n' 
the world never sees to go rigt .
i wish to etire and have yogoro , y eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly ope that my request will e grated .
sasaara , o are our son and his bride doin ?
very well , i ' happy to ay .
i 'm very sorr .
it s oo early to retire , i thik , but his so has married , so
so isabuo sasahara 's retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the time , but it 's a great relie .
i wone what i 've done all my life , houg it 's not lie me to do so .
yooro 's marriage is a very happy one .
fear often exceeds the perceive daner .
so it was in your case .
yogoro 's wife 
she 's a ine wie .
suga 's just he same as beore , ut ichi is aways pleasant and never tals back 
why did she attack our lord then 
lie yoursef , i do n't understand it eithe .
heck he weapons in the armory aainst the iventory lis , and have the me clean the on appointed days .
i do n't say to alway yield to them , but at times , they 're unreasonable .
rie cake 
enjo .
wait  ichi 
i m going to retire soon .
yogoro will becoe the head of our family , and you 'e his wife .
ou eed n't hol back or te old woman .
take over te houseold duties .
understan ?
even so , she is my mothe , and i will treat er as uh .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoro 
how about some rice cakes ?
bu i do n't understand .
that se 'd grasp her lod b his clothing .
it was hard for e to beliee too , so i asked her the oher day .
it was the year eore last 
ichi .
accet he honor gratefully .
i was more agry than surprised .
a man over 50 a infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
our lord does not do his just to satif a whim .
daimyo must hae heis or eir ouse will be abolished .
the only heir to our lor rigt no is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ici , not just anyone can becoe our lor 's mistres , for her on ay one day become ou lor s heir .
she must be beautifu and kin like ou .
you are referring to sanojo kasai , our fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our arents arranged ou engaement .
then if sannojo agrees , ou will gratefully agree to serve our lord 
what do you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gae you up ?
o you had no choice ?
i still di not wish to go .
do nt bother me !
no .
you said you woul serve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly agreed to i .
as sumone ,
hyoemon siomi s daughter ichi is here i answer to your wishes .
then i thought
no , it was more like a prayer .
i woud bear hi ons .
many , may sons .
hen oter girls need ever now my misey .
it woul end with me .
it as ike a prayer 
my thougts were realy lie a prayer 
with his prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a yea later .
then i went to a spa for posnata rest a my lord 's orders .
be friends with her .
i hated er for it 
beat !
beast !
i ould never have fou a better wife .
beginning onight ,
wat 
our lord eans nothing to me .
i have been so woried about the on i bore .
so worried .
i will forget about hi too .
i will orget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wait neary two year , ut at last .
a oy woul have een better 
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i acke our poor brais over is and named her tomi .
ost-horse messenger !
es 
it 's a lucky thing 
but sasahara ,
ord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birt other to the heir 
if she remains the wife of a vassal , there would be much talk .
you ay this is our ord s wish 
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing i for yogoro to submit a request to our lord and say he wil sed ichi ack to the castle .
i 've been at hi since the day before yesterday  but he refuses .
naturally 
well , i do n't blame him 
but you know ery well .. that we ca n't have all ou wishes granted in tis world 
grou head kotani came over in the afernoon .
but i could n't bring mysel o ell you .
fathe is caling you .
acting a if some crisis has ocured and hiding it from me .
ichi , i must tell ou something .
come into te oo .
irst , father 's ods .
he says he 's retired  so i am the amily head , and i am to o what i think is right .
however , he also say you 're too important to us o send aay .
hat e must take the best possible care of ou .
i must tell er sooner or later .
do 't worry .
no atter what ayone ay ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
bu you ca n't reason with a crying cild nor with our lord , as hey say .
isaburo , what 's your opinio ?
it 's all up to him .
what is i ?
i 'd like him to come again now and explain in his word why we must return her 
when his son 's other proe inconvenien , he foces her to marry a vasal .
his is cruel and unreasoable .
he has no uerstanding of ua emotions .
kotani-san , our famiy did n't accept ichi particularly gatefully .
nor did ichi herelf know yogoro o the sasahaa family .
she was none too happy about it eiter .
bu e reason they are gettig along is because they 're ind to each other an cae for eac other .
wat ?
even if the heavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
koai-san , i think this is enoug for today .
i beg you .
would you give u tomi and return to te castle ?
would you ruin our family because you 'e ost your head over a woman ?
in this ae
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you were me  would you return ichi ?
of course i ould !
resrain yourself , bunzo 
yogoro  the head o te family .
right or wron , it 's all up to hi 
if you love ogoro and tomi , be repared to defy such senseless conventions , however had it ma be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are a wife worth protecin , even if that ean ruining our aily .
i am not worthy o it .
u his wo n't e the end of it .
i gave her the message .
she will be here soon .
over hee , siste .
we 'e heard al about at ha happened .
we 'd lie o know how ou feel about it .
do ou wat to stay with yogoro  even if it eans ruining the asahara family ?
i would ike to stay .
even if you rui te amily ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiomi , has asked our lord that you e ent back to the castle as soo as possible .
i 'm sure you 'e aware of that .
he ies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him o se ou back 
he ' one this seveal ties .
father is father .
i am me .
i would rather die than return .
please tell the chamberlais an steward ho i feel in whatever words you think will best hep m ase .
we ak you agai  ichi !
the family doe nt atter ?
not only the asahara amily  but we the relaives will be jeopardized as well .
it can not be helped .
i see .
tere 's no use rying to covince a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame oo .
it 's our misfotue that a woman like he has favored you .
return .
return o the castle 
why do you say tha ow ?
what 's the sasahara faily to you ?
listen to me .
in other words , i 'm a worthless , good-fornoting man .
so in order to roe mysel , for thee past 20 years
i have fought to peserve ou good name and soial standing 
the cruel injustice involved , for oe thing .
ut your beautiful love or eac other has touched me most of all .
there 's neve been a shred of love in y married life !
o matter what happens , never eave him 
my uband 's with the hamberlain ?
es , and he 's waiting for you to come .
i saw him in the castle .
the chamberain wishes to see you both .
he has some question for you .
you need n worry 
i il accompany you .
if you lose heart now , what will i ean or my brother ?
hurry !
faher , where did you go oday ?
to see tatewai .
anythin new at te castle 
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happens .
she went out .
what hapeed to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ichi 
bunzo  you tricked her 
no matter how may times i 'm told ,
i 'm going ome .
ihi , take my advice and return to the castle .
if you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain is willin to oerlook everyting .
ut if you insist on returning home , ot oly wil yogoo , but also his fater , isaburo , be ordered to ommit seppuku for lax upervision of their home .
honorable lad ichi , please return to the castle .
yes .
my ame is kiku .
the hamerain 's ordes ?
what orders ?
go home !
but .. if i go home wihout
say no ore !
u
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool 
yogoro .
but he did request time of due o illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wie of footman ansaku kariya to ome and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid woan 
then everything 's al over ?
yes .
we ust took a roundaou pah .
defying he clan gets us nowhere .
isaburo , do you really mean hat ?
i came o make sue of our thouhts on this matter .
o e honest , the clan 's treatment of your family and your attitude in response have weighed on my mind .
eighed on your mind 
it 's like your swordpla .
pushed , you step back .
but it 's ot like you to give up 
he clan did n't ask or her formally .
it was more like force .
in fact , it wa more like idnapping .
if he shogunate officials i edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a atal mistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll alow them to en here .
you 're saying i must formally ask te castle to take her back ?
yet i must ask them to take her bak ?
it was wise of you to hold ack .
the chamberlain and steward are imressed by your restraint .
i reuse !
i do nt remember endin her back to the castle .
why o n't you o as he says ?
hat 's idiculou , father !
never !
she supressed her tears , eft everyhig ehind , and quietl retuned o the aste .
ow , now , ogoro .
in any case , please go fo ow .
yogoro will be had o convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoo wil reort today and ay he wishes to retun her ?
tha 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to he suwa shrine fesival tomorrow .
since it woul have come to this anway , ow dare they cause al tha uss !
yogoo was wrong , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he ' always henpecked by his wife .
and efying clan orders lie that
i mus say he seems ike a diferent an 
his conduct ha been adirable .
i calls for a sligt increase in his fie .
yogoro asahara of the escort roup has arried !
i m glad you 've eported for duty .
yes , completely ell .
taking into consideration my father s wishes , i have decided .
lease accept this .
that 's good o you .
thank you .
fool !
petiion .
this is the ruelet form of tyranny .
it runs counter to the laws of humanit and can not be ononed by the heavens .
we hereby appeal for her immediate return .
someone may use my aher 's name or my own to ubmit a requet to return ichi o the castle 
but it will not be from us .
please keep that in mi .
thak you for comin every day .
the mats ?
it 's a usto at times like these .
so our feet wo n't slip in te bloo .
this may be the last time .
will you do me a favor ?
will you cook the ice afer you fee tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on a empy tomach .
excuse me !
oders from our or !
accept obeiently !
i said oders fro our lord !
il you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
ordes !
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for you insoent conduct ad defiance toward our lord , you are ordered to commit seuku .
sepuku ?
it i gacious o our lord to permit it .
i thougt men would come arrest us and then either hang or crucify us 
father .
however , we want something beore we kill ourselve .
bring us three heads !
those o lord maakaa atsudaira , ruler of the aizu domain 
chamberlain yanase , and stead takahashi .
bing me the heads of the villains who took y son s wife !
vassal tatewaki asano in carge of boundar gates has arrive !
i hear ou are
isaburo 's only equal as a swodsman .
if you think he ' too muc for you , take fou or five strong men with you .
are they not ow criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i m in charge of border gates .
this i no time to discuss jurisdiction .
you 're wrong .
i you order me to kill them , please pomoe me to suerintendent here and now and otain our lord ' promise o inceae y fief o 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so formal ow ?
neer mind .
go !
we must gather me , use force an kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsma ithout peer .
what 
cold , is n' it ?
hat time i it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you 
from the footsteps , he 's alone .
it ' bunzo .
father !
i kno what you want to say .
father !
i it ice and cozy at kenmotsu 's lace ?
listen to the festial drums .
father !

as for what happeed ,
each must ive his own life .
an tell everyone this for me 
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?

this i our galaxy , the milk way .
our sun take 225 milion years to go around the gaaxy once
the dinoaur era asted 180 millio years .
thi is a coet .
it ' al ice and ock .
its 10 mile wie , ad it 's heaed or the earth ... ast .
but thi is n't he earth hat we know , no really 
at this time he masters of the earth are inosaurs .
this is patagonia .
a vast reion of arentinean south ameica as it is toda .
ad ere was only one immese oean ,
we are north of the south american plate , in e sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean 
some secie of ichthyosaurus rew up to 75 ft .
extreme fos of ife also appeared on land during the inosaur era 
in many places here , oe walks today on the ver oud these giants wale upon a 100 illion years ago .
this henoenon seems to depend on another peculia twist of evolution .
regions tha roduce great dinoau also tend to poduce great palaeontologists .
many doctoral tudents come to pursue their research .
someties younger people , like my daughte ludmila , just come o satisfy their curioity .
i love talking about dinosaurs with everyone , wheter they are expets or not .
it ' a busy life  a it would have been plenty or most people , but ealy in my career ne horizos oened up for me .
thing became much larger han life .
a rancher ha stubled upon a surprisingly large bone .
after several digging easons we ended up acing the lares dinosau ever found .
we named i argentiosaurus
tis discovery have a rofound efect , on the way we look at south american dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a big place in my life to sa the least .
yet it starts its lie in eggs ust a little iger than graefuit .
redators and hazards abound .
only a few wil reach adulthood .
it covers moe than 15 miles an it i approximately 80 million year old .
we believe that i was chosen as a nesting site by generation uon generation o these dinosaus .
the nests are so close together , that the femae could not walk etween them .
it as warmer than today 
a great art of the dinoau era , there were no broad leaf trees an o flowe bearing plans .
during the dinosaur era there i no arctic ie caps  and antarctica i ub-topical .
for tens o millions of years seasons barely changed .
the water of the ocean is aso much warmer .
hurricanes ae frequent .
te magneic oes hanges position coinuously .
professor coria ha conriuted o te discovery o ore than a dozen of new dinosaur 
as a scientist , he insists that each new find is important , no matte how ig or small .
and sometimes he sas what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hans .
i like to think that i am lucky , just incredibly lucky .
many paeontological discoveries are not made by professional .
tat 's wat happened with the argentinosaurus , and it happened again with yet another inoaur .
they were relatively big , so at first , we tought that they belonged to a herbivore , because in general these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
but insead , the bones proved to be thoe of a predator ;
a very large one .
pofessor coria 's team had unveiled a first specie of a group of fierce predators called giganotosaurus 
he 3 species in this group surpassed the faou t. rex in terms of size 
athough rare for reptiles , caring fo te oung has be observed aong crocodiles for instace .
in dinosaus , thi caring behaviou evolve enouh to remind us of irds .
tis baby female is named long tooth .
howeve small and vulerable , and cute she may appear now she is genetically prorammed to rapidl become a 45 foot log , eight tonne predator ike her mother .
in patagonia , you hae he lagest erbivore and the largest predator , living at rouhy he same period and in the same teritory .
thee is o easy anser .
eolution folowed a nume of particular pats .
but a simpler intepetation rest on a warm climate and the fertile land , wit all the vegetation you can eat .
yet another heor tel us tat large herbivore had to grow big enough , to accommodae a large omach equired o igest high in fibre , low in rotein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space could have led natually to argetinosaurus , as the vast seas ave led to whaes .
the highest brances belong to those who can reach tem , and many predator are too small to be threaenig in thoe situation .
she is growing fas too 
her primitive feathers have almot all disapeared .
they thried for 180 million years .
his is a message for us here .
by the ay , it is more han tie o introuce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot  50 pound male raptor .
he is related to irds , as are to some extent veloiraptors  gianotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need spae .
this is he armen funes museum , hih also happens to be my second home .
ometimes as a joke we say that it is a science illed ith ole .
we have ony found about 700 species o dinosaurs on the whole planet .
this is n't many for a eign that lasted 180 million years .
ten peent of these dinoaurs were found in argentina , most of them in the ast 30 years 
trough technology our nowledge grows faste every da .
fossilisation is a process that requires extemely rare conitions , an even then very ittle of an organis is preserved .
we ould easily conclude that a tremendous number of species just disappeared without a trace .
of course , science iction can be fun  bu you also need to be very careful before poposing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish i could travel in time to see thee amazing creatures alie 
strong one ha reached maturity .
for any scientist he i at full ize .
he is 20-year-od , and is a the beinning of more tan a century of lie .
they tel us , if the animal was walking on o legs o four , i hey were alone or in a group , i they ere wanderig , unting , or eing hunted
the pattern clearly show association between contemporary species , and ti is very are .
his work is intimately linked to ature  its intimately varied terrain and ever changing climate .
so there were hardshis , bu there are momens , sometimes when sience just blend with the pue bliss of bein outside and wonerful places .
you just look around .
but fiding required a tained eye .
with time you realise that the numer of questions grows faster than he nuber of answers .
again , like many times before ,
a good hint and an answer came unexpectey 
in fact , we did n't find just one ecimen bu a chamber of bones belonging to at east seve individual .
or me , and my canadian coleague phil curry this was pointin at somehing we had considere  but have o evidence for until then .
so long trut belongs to this new secies of giganotosauus .
and a 22 years of age , she is full grown 
stron one is unknowingly in a critical ime .
tearing off piees of sin and letting the large prey bleed to death , or die from infectio is a trategy more ikely to suceed .
iganotosaurus coul wait day even weeks between meals .
milions of years pas  and as he continents keep on driftin , the earth begins to resemble more what it is today 
species emerge , evolve , disappea .
nature never stops changing .
we are in norh america .
apart from flight , this repties has nothing i common with birds
and eolution gae it nothing to survive te impendin dramatic events .
everal factors could have contribute to the demie of dinosaurs .
mamals became biger and more competitive .
drifting isolate continents touched each other .
new rivalries appeared 
ne diseases spread .
the cimate as growing coler , osibly because of inreased volcanic activity .
the air was unbeatable in many places .
vegetation suffered fro the acid rain and also from the darkened ad dutfilled skies .
but still , many dinosaurs made it though for a little whie longer .
it covers the distance from the oon to the earh in two ours .
all the orest of north and south america are destroyed b fire .
already eakened , dinosaurs are the aimals that suffered most .
i a relaively short time , dinosaurs becoe history .
not al the dinosaur disappear .
if tey have n't become extinct maybe we just would n't be here .
more discoverie aait e hee perhaps but as i move forward in life ,
and the best food in paris , some ay , is made by chef auguste guteau .
gusteau 's restauant is the toast of paris , booked five moths in advance .
he is the younge chef ever to achieve a five-sar rating .
chef gusteau 's coobook , anone can cook !
bu not everyone celerates its success .
what 's eve more amusig is hat gusteau actualy seems to believe it .
i , o te oher had  take cookin seriously .
this is me .
i think it 's apparent i need o rehik my lie a little bit .
hat 's m problem ?
fist of all , i m a a .
flour , eggs  sugar  vanilla ean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
thi is emile , my broher 
he 's easil impressed .
so what 
thi is my dad .
he s ever imressed .
he also happens to be the leader of our can .
so , what 's rong with haig ighly develope seses ?
what 's going on hee ?
uddenly , dad did n't think my talent a ueless .
clea 
cleanerific .
cleanerino .
never min .
well , it mae my dad proud .
now , do nt you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble ause .
we 're tieves , dad .
and wha we 'e teaing is , let 's face it  garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants i .
if no oe wans i , why are we stealing it ?
but o m dad ...
you get icky about what you put in the tank , our engine is on na die 
ow shut up and ea you garbage .
secondl , stay out of te kitchen and away from the umans .
it 's dangerous .
they discover , they create .
how ca i esibe it ?
good food is like music you can taste , olor you an smell .
ou need only be awae to stop and avor it .
o , gusteau was righ .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only one who new about it a emile 
he , emile .
emile .
come on , ou 're good at hiding ood .
he doe nt understand me , but i can be myself around him .
hy are you walking like that ?
i do 't want to contantly have to wash my paws .
did you eve think about ow we walk on the same paws tha we handle food with 
you ever tink abou what we put ino our mouths 
all the ime .
but if dad sees you walking like that , he 's not oing to like it 
what have you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you ound cheese ?
and not ust an cheee .
that would go beautifully with my uhroom .
an ...
this rosemary 
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you kow , ad 's gon na ..
emile 
there are possibiliies unexlored here .
we got to cook this .
now , exactly ho we coo this is te real question ...
te key is to keep turing it .
tha som s getting closer .
hey , remy , you think tat maybe we houd nt be so ...
you got to taste tis !
it 's got , like , his ba-boom , za kin of aste .
do n't you think ?
lightni-y ?
yeah .
it s lightning-y !
we got to do that again .
okay , hen he next stor comes , e 'll go up on the roof ...
i know what this needs !
saffro .
saffron .
do n't like it 
she 's gon a wake up .
she tur on the cooking channel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been here a million times ?
gusteau swears by it .
okay .
who 's gusteau 
just the greaest cef in the world .
wrote his cookbook .
you read ?
and they have , which is why i read .
i do nt ie secrets .
all this cooking ad readig an tv-watcing while we read and cook .
why do i et ou ?
hat 's takin those kids so long ?
a , l'auila saffron .
itaia .
gusteau says it ' excelent .
good thing the old lady is a food love ..
forget mystique .
gea ooking is ot for the aint of heat .
ou must be imaginative , strong hearte .
you must try things that may not wok 
a you mus not let anyone efine your limit because of where ou come from .
anyone can cook 
but only the fearless can be great .
usteau 's restaurant lost one of its five stars after a scathig review b france 's top food criti , anton ego

except or the activity up in the hayloft , e farm as pretty quiet that orning 
they coud seep throu anythin .
ut a lot of the other animals were awakened by all that scurrying overhead .
some of te just accepted it .
some were petty annoyed .
ut te mood was very ifferent up in the halot .
he was determined to be a ood mother and neve yell at er kittens .
but that appoach would not last very long , because milo , one of her kittens  was trouble fom the very beginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that ' not a good iea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a srange-looking cat , milo said .
oh , i m not a at .
milo ried to figure this out and aid ,
oh , all right , a dog .
but , um , really , deep own inside , we 're all cats , right 
uh , o , otis barked .
the kittens were now big enough o leave the haylo and see the world beyond te barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was the first to star allig out for foo 
his moher elled .
it seemed to ilo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is te doc and on there is the river 
eveyone undersand ?

now dry yourself off , like this :
ad follow me back home .
that was fu .
ha , ha .
milo !
get over hee 
the months passed , and the farm was umming with he sounds of summer .
milo had some new hiding paces he could n't wait to ry out .
otis sniffe around the yard for a wile .
ou 're in the pipe , milo .
ty again .
cat 's in the ca !
and milo sliped off to another idin place .
it wa nt eas fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tie a harder ot .
but otis found hi there too .
now milo eeded a brilliant idea .
aha .
he thought of a pace were otis could ever snif him out .
it worke .
but mio wondered if it was really woth the rouble 
milo and oti went to see wha all the commotion was abou 
suddely , one hicken 's voice rang out 
and al the hes left i a clucking lurry because that as gloria talking , a young chicke ho had scratched and peked her a to te op rung of te henhouse .
gloria had a good reaon fo wanting o be alone 
there it is , ellas , loria cackled .
my first eg .
oh , the eg ?
so it finally happened 
is she staying at home ith it or i she going back to wok ?
ha-a-ha .
you want me to kick it back to you , otis ?
milo ased .
otis said .
i kicke it by accident .
gloria ave us a job to do .
ow long do e have to stick around this henhouse ?
until gloia comes bak .
maybe you do n't realize it , milo , but this is a major day fo me because ...
well , maybe you o n't realize that this i the day i 've become a wathdog .
some strange noise rought milo out of the henhouse .
hat was all his about ?
he !
your singin tinks .
come here , otis , a frog croaked .
otis said .
oti  i 's our cat budy .
otis , coe on 
at that moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , the rog croaked 
and outsie , milo and ois suddenly remembered :
ah 
te egg 
otis growed .
jus try something .
probably roten anyway .
milo wanted just one more loo at that weir animal .
the noise attacted a grou of local snoops looking to dig u some scandal .
i think we re having a baby 
omy !
mommy !
momy !
your mommy s a chicke .
the oer animal told otis e 'd bete take the chick to gloria  ad quikly  which he did .
but the chick kept coing back to ois .
now go bac to gloria 
do you understad ?
woof , he chick peeped .
woof , woof  mommy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
oti barke .
you 've got to be a rough , tough , mean  fighting dog  like this 
okay , puppy , otis odered .

mommy .
oh , it worke , oti thought .
i 'll mis him .
i 'l miss him .
come o  said milo .
phew .
wow , ook at thi thing , otis , ilo sai .
oh .
oti dried o and came back to setle the score with that --
that  uh , hing .
ha  a .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
ury up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terrific time , but otis was prety scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead 
maye e could ump off the ridge into the box if he hurried .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god .
ut that did n't work either .
otis just could n't swim fast enough and the rive took mio arte dowsrea .
milo as n' really woried until he lost sigt of otis .
suddenly he heard something moving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to u low in te box so the bear would n't see him 
but he box was drifting right towards the hugr anima .
but unfortunately much oo soon .
e ear saw what was i tha box .
then ame otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he an up on he riverbank , leading the bear away from mio .
milo kep drifting along  but he was getting a little ocerne because the river was beginning to move faster ... and faster 
he 'd lost rack of otis now , an he was drifing farthe and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had arried ilo deep into the forest 
and e eard mysteious hoos and growls and cries in the night .
he began to wih he d never juped ino tis box and he began to wish he was home .
it seeme to be trembling as much as he was in the chily , misty night .
he drifed on through the akess , oping o find the morning waiing ust around the bend 
when daylight came 
milo sa a far on the rierbank 
for one happy moment , he thouh he was home and cried out for joy 
but he looked again .
e did n't know when he would ever see it again .
here comes the dog you life he -- ♪♪
the deadood swam .
a bog where seleton trees gew without leaves o brace , and where no creature could live , excet for he dreaded deadwood birds .
and oe of them as perching on a familiar woode box .
okay , punk , otis barke .
there 's the box 
poo cat .
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
look in the box .
otis repare himse and peeed in the box and saw ony a olitary back feather .
in fat , milo was nowhere nea the deadwood swam .
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran rom tose birds as quickly as he coul .
now he found himself in a burnin valley .
the ground was hot ad the smoe made his eyes sting .
milo ra unti he cae to an oen meadow where he saw a kind of animal he ' never seen beore .
feeling pretty hungry , he immediately wondered ,
is that someting you a eat ?
heh .
helo , someoe there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very caeful , milo thought .
and above al , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he bega uryig his lunch where he figured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah , here , my precious muskat .
you should e afe there till dinnertime , he fox said 
milo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fox run ove the horizon .
an ten , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to ge his paws on a big , tast muskrat lunc .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through the etad o a beach full of clam holes .
he rememered there was one magic word everyone undestood and that was please .
so he marched u to a clam hole and said ,
aw .
the clous were geting darker ad darke and a cily wind was whipping acoss the coutyside .
mio was several miles from the beach caught in he same tor .
e got a little wet and e felt awully loesome ithout otis  but at eas he was safe .
the tide ame in so fast tha the rock oti ha been sitting on was comletely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd never be ae to swim to shoe .
and he water was growing higher .
now the water was up to i paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he too a deep breath , but just whe he was ready to dive in ..
oh , not again , the sea turle guged .
every time the tide omes in ome foo gets stuck out ere .
otis wa n't sure what this urtle wanted .
well , o you know .
ow , just stay o he shore , were you belong , the turtle gumble .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
next time the tide come in , i 'll have to rescue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said oti , i did nt know that .
heh .
ois resumed his search or milo .
ooh , muc better .
excuse me , oti called ou , i 'm looking for a frien of mie .
i have n't got time , otis said , sesing this ox was n' on na be any help .
ho can you be a dog ?
otis was outraged .
ha 
he arveled at his road ade of wood and iron and decied o follo the road and see were it ould take him .
it could 'e run right over me .
but milo was determine .
now milo was plenty tired .
you ook tire and thirsty , a deer whispered .

and the deer took milo to a sof  mossy spot on the fores floor .
an milo wa asleep within oments .
e had trailed milo from he eadwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , mabe he 'd finally find the fiend he misse so much .
but ow , it was the ed of a long day of hard traveing .
as evening was faling ,
milo decided te saest plae to spend the night would be in a tree .

narrator 
in winter , endless darkness i brihtened by e friky dance of the northern ights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weathe for polar bear families .
one hundred and fifty thousand years ago some brown bears moved north and gadually adate .
ecause they 're buit for the artic polar beas can not thrive anwhere else .
polar beas have alays hunted from foating platforms of sea ice .
hat 's why the actic is warmig twice as ast as any other region .
in 1980 he summer sea ice covered 25 perent more ocean than it does now .
if the urent trend continues he arctic ocean ould be ree of sea ice each summe by the ear 2050 .
eve if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slo it down .
most arctic glaiers are melting faste tha ever before .
the istace between ice packs is owin .
nowaday  a polar bear in search of sea ice ofte ha furthe to go .
some cubs do suvive especially if te mother is a clever saveger .
so do the inuit people lie simo qamanir .
simon :
polar bears surpise u in cap .
but now the ancient weather patterns have hanged .
our andfathers fed heir families wel .
my family ha always depended on sow an ice .
sometime we fa throuh .
my friend adam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 ear to photograph the animals .
these dedicate moher put over two years ino aising their youn .
alrus moms sen even longer 
they dive down from rafts of ice which rift aong and arry them to freh supplies of their favorite treat .
mothers teac teir oung survival skills such as sarin off intruers .
one morn sent me a ery cear message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
thi water is literaly as cod as ice .
he salt keep it from feezing .
down here , there 's only one exit and it 's prett scary thinking you could be trapped .
each spring in alaka large herd of caribou set out o a log journey .
kasen :
e 're gon na do this tri to see what the caribou mothes go through and to see this migration from teir perspective .
leane :
these newlyweds will follow he caribou all te way to teir birthin grounds 
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing own te herd .
some of these calves ae just a week o two od , ad they 'e easy pickins for bears and woles .
this is e place wee the calves have their best chance to survive .
hee ugs are otentially deadly to tese caribou .
to get away .
cariou mohers are having a tough tie a the arctic wars .
but oa bear moters ace an even greater stugle .
my name i bjorne kvernmo an i 'm captain of thi ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the worl ad mot o them are amera-shy .
one bear was especially elpful .
it ' had to keep up when you 're oly 3 months old .
nex year we 're comig back with stroger cases .
narrator :
bear nearly alwas avoid people which made filming tem next to imossible 
then the team got lucky .
for five days , she never left their oat .
beause the sun never sets in the sumer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
ungry males prefer seals but in a pinch , they have always gone after deenseless cubs .
the moter seemed to pick up the scent of a ale .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finall spotted a male quite a ways off zeoing in on the mother and he cubs .
now that seal are so hard to catch , starvin males might be targeting cus more ofen .
but next time things could be much diffeent .
payful cubs can really work up a appetie .
bjorne 
when you want to grab a bite to eat up here iming is everything .
te cubs fiish everyhing on heir plate but the sent of reh seal meat attracts atention 
bu the male pics up the family s scent aain .
we atch helpessly as te male sneaks u 
the mae keeps gaining on the family .
then the mother turns to face him ... ... sloing him down ust long enough or her frightened cubs to escape .
at the mome o truth , the other sent a ver clear mesage :
you ca get to my cubs if you wat but you ll ae to kill e fir .
narrator :
but she 's powerless to save te habitat the need to survive .
tere are few truly wild places lef and none so majestic as his .
but the arctic is warming faster than it has for thousands of yeas and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the mothers here nurture their young so lovingly .
perhaps they can inspire us to protet their home with hat sae care .

perhaps some sort o electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
what ?

its autho was a youthul aler einstein .
it 's the most famous equaio in the worl :
all aboard !
but while we 've all heard of einstein ' bi idea , ery few of us know what it means 
we 've onl ot sausage and cheese toight .
sorry , no .
but first ..
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughing at eintein .
he d united in one stunnig insight the work of many who ha come before him ..
in te early 19th cenur , scietists did n't think in terms of energy ;
one loly man 's drive to undersad the hiden mysteries of nature woul begin o change all that .
youn michael faraday hated his job .
he was uneducated , the son o a blacsith .
he 'd been uck to become a ookbinder 's apprentice .
but faraday craved one thing .
all of his free time and his meager wages were poured ino his self-education .
can i pass , please ?
an i pass ?
of course , o course ...
pas , pass 
tis way to a better life .
in he early 1800s , sciece was te pursuit of gentlemen , somethin faraday wa clearly not .
he ha a rudimentary education , he 'd read wiely , he ' gone to public lecures , but in 1812 he was given tickets to hea sir humpry davy , the mos pominet chemist of the age .
nineteenth-cetury scientists were the pop stars of their ay .
teir lecture were ugely poular .
ticets were hard to come by , and davy reveled in his status .
they 're waiti .
metals ... unknown , that is , until i isolated potassium from molten otash and sodium  as i showed you last time  fro common alt .
help me be part of the rea circle at is your work and love .
my desire , si , is to escape from trae  which i find vicious and selfih , and to become a sevant of science , wich , i imagine , makes its pursues amiable and liberal .
really ?
wel , i shall leave it to the experience of a ew years o set you right on that core .
loo , i have 't aything at he oment .
faraday was determined to break fee from his daily toil .
newman ... mee mr. michael faraday .
perhap with god and farada in charge of te chemicals , you an i will be safe in our lace of work .
just sick to our job and do as you 're told and you 'll be ine , farada .
aaday became the laboaory assistant , eagerly asorbin eery scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big ecitemet of te day was electricity .
another charge , newman 
but no one realy understoo what this strange force of electricity wa .
he academic estabishmet at the tie thouht at electricity as , you know , like a flui floing through a pipe , pusig i way along .
but in 1821 , a anish reearher shoed hat whe you pass an electric current through a wire an place a ompass ea it , it deflected the needle at right angles .
faraday , come look at his .
perhaps you an work it out .
oersted s repoe an amazing finding .
now , that is remarkable .
ut if te electrical foce is fowing though the ire , why does te needle not move in the same irection , parallel to the wire ?
again , newman .
what ?
erhaps some sort of elecrica force is emanai outwards from the ire .
oh , my dear boy , et me tel you that at the univerity of cambride , electriciy fows hrough a wire , not sideways o it .
that may e what they teach at camige , but it does n't expain what 's happening before our eye 
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fasciation inspire b his religion .
for him , the prolem was a way to understan god 's hien myteries .
tere is a small , almost persecuted group in ondon aled the sandemanians .
they were a religious ...
faraday was a ember of that group 
hat if you opene up one little part of it , you could see how everythin was conected .
faraday was different from anybody else .
by methodically pacing a compas al around an electrified wire ,
faada started to notice a attern .
an he he imagine that a manet had similar ines emerging from it and tat those lines would get aught up in this fow .
i ' shaking , newman 
underneath  i 'm shaking .
yes .
this is the experimet of the cenury .
scale up the magnes and the wires  make tem really big , attach heavy weihts to tem and they 'll be draged along .
although he id 't realize it at te time ,
the chemicals in the battery had been tansformed into electricit in the wire , which had combined wih the magnet to produe motion .
behind all these various foes there was a common energy .
so , faraday , what oes wollaston ake of all this ?
he 's written to me an asures me that he s taken no offense , and he acknoedges that what i pulished was etirel my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemetly oposed to you being eeted a member o the society .
and wha do you tink ?
faraday , my dear boy , you have my vote 
it 's the sciene at couns .
so , tell me , how does this wire of yours spi roud its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagneti interation .
in my mind , i see a swirlig array of lines of force pinning out of the electrified wie like a spiraling web .
but invisible lies o fore ...
it s all a bit vague , is nt i ?
faraday , migt i have a word in private ?
lise  faraay , let 's stop this nonsense .
i want you to tae down your alot paper from the notice oard .
si humphry  i ee no reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i il not take it own .
my father and unle wante to make their fotune by bringin eletric light to the streets of germany .
from an early ae , i loved to look at machines  understand ow things work .
he 's going to kil himself .
i experienced a miracle when my father showed me a compass .
there had to be something behind ojets that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
on you feet !
it 's prety much te same to e hicheer way they run , herr professor .
einstein s teachers trie o drum into him , a faraday had shown , tha energy could be converted fom one om ito another .
they also believed tha al forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein wa going to pove them wron .
deep in the heart of matter .
a hudre year before einstein 's birth ,
foret the rain .
the frenc revoluion was just around the corer .
ad they felt that one of he fist tass tha lay aead of them was o rationalize and to classify every singe kind of matter o they cou see how it all interaced together .
anoine avoiier , a wealty  aristocratic young man , decided to take up tis task , to see if there wa some basic connection between all the suf of everyay life :
all he difeent sustances in the world .
his meticulous , eve obsessive attention to detail ..
was also to be hi donfall .
your precise observations comend you as a ady of scientific curiosity 
mot unusual .
for the last five weeks , i have taken notin but milk .
i would rather die than fast on milk for five weeks 
onsieur  with the greatest of respect to a member of the roya academy of sciences , your ut mus think you hroat has been slit !
how dare you insult the count ?
o n't forget what the count offes ... not jut marriage , but tik of ho ou will be introduced to al the saons 
you wi be te toast o pais .
do you really plan to marry d'amerval ?
then i must contrive to save you .
lavoisie was n't a scientist by profession .
he was the head o tax enforcemen in pais .
but his taxes o the simple things in life ...
did not endear him to the average parisia .
his scrupulous  fastidiou young man did sil allow himsel the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married arie anne paulze , he daughter of his colleague in the tax ofie .
thus he saved her  as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 years her eder .
allow me to show you something .
what will happen if i tae a bar o copper or iron and leave it outside in the rain for month on ed ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the etals ...
is this a verbal examination prior to an eamination proper , sir 
i merely seek the truth .
but let me pess ou further .
hmm ?
evey last citizen i france of ensible age knows tha whe a metal russ , it wastes away , it gets lighter an eventually disappears .
ah , but ...
i ave not finished .
contai yourself , sir .
there is more 
i a recently published pamplet y a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier emonsraes that the iron ombines with the air .
it , in act , becomes heavier .
she learne english so tha she could translate cotempora scientific works .
monieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a heeky an .
messieurs .. it is my great ambition to demonsate that nature is a cosed system , tha i any transformatio , no amount of matter  no mass i ever ost and none is gained .
over here , peae .
rom this end e cool the steam but , inteetingly , we colect less ate than we started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of wate .
no , when we combine these two inceaes ...
the new weight o the iron barrel an the gas we have collected ..
they are exacly equal to the weight of the los water .
so what e had done is et the oxygen to stick to the inide of a rehot iron rifle barrel .
now , tha left the hydrogen , what he calle combustible air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
i the nex few monhs i ope to demonstrate tha i can recombie this ombustible air ith vital air and transfor em both bak into water 
i will re-create exactly the same amount of water that was lost here in this process .
i is my oe to complee the cyle ...
but to prove his  e had to perfom thouands of experients , ad he ha to do he measurements ith incredile accuracy .
that ' where his great wealth from being a ta collector came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorr .
the academ asked you to assess is designs 
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
anoter charlata with an idea to peddle .
monsieur .
i have ivented a device which rojects an imae of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device renders the substance of fire visible .
have you colected it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monsieur 
no , no .
if you will you excuse me .
i am extremey busy today .
thak you .
so that is all ?
the king 's scienific desot ha decreed that your invention oe not conform to the ersion o he tuth as laid down by e acaemy .
lavoisier 
he talks aout facts , he worshis te truth .
listen to me  my friend 
the are all the same , the royal academies ..
they insult the lierty of te mind 
they tin they are te sole arbiters of genius .
hey are rotten to te core ...
do n't worry .
i y next pamphlet i il exoe this pesecuo of yours .
the cowning gory of this opus wa their remarkable use of stati electricit to cause oxygen and hydroge to recombine back ino waer .
to the french revolutionaries of 1790 ,
he was enounced by a ailed scientist turned radical journalist ,
lavoisie !
a all the uble , it woul ad up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a century ater , all of natue had been clasified into two great domains .
there was enery .. the orces that animated objects ;
an thee was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century sience rested on these wo mighty pillars .
the laws that governe one did not apply to the other .
but young , nely enrolled pysic stuent alber einstein did n't like laws .
extremely well , herr einstei .
all the better for seeing you have escaped he physics laboratory with your ife .
that s about all you ever do 
it 's gettin a little stuff in here , fraulein maric .
would you care to take a walk wih e ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell ou what you have issed in lectures tis week ?
he would pusue is fascinatios with just incredile determinatio .
e know fro is leters that einstein , even from the age of 16 , wa liteally obsessed wih the natue of light .
everyone he could spea to ...
what ?
a beam of light 
by hat etho do you proose to ride on thi beam of light ?
the method is not imotat .
let us just imagine we two are oung ...
ridicule you ?
i merey want you to help me to understand .
what would we see , do you hink ...
with light he would reivent the universe and find a hiden pathwa that woul uite energy and ass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long before te 19th century , scientiss had computed the speed of light , ut no one knew wat ight atualy was .
invisible lines that can emanate from eecricity in a wire , from a manet o .. even fom the sun .
for it is my ontenion that liht itself i just one form of these vibrating lies of electromagneim .
maxwell ad the aging faraay becae close friends .
james  forgive me 
do nt ge old .
oh , i m fine .
o , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that manetic chage moves , it creates a little piee of elecricity .
electriciy 
eletricity and magnetism are interwoen , ike a ... a ever-eding braid .
so it i alays puling foward .
michael 
670 million miles per hour .
that is the speed of ligh !
well , that means you wee right all along .
axwell had proven faraday right .
we have lectures in half a hour .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwell an think about the electromagnetic theory of ligh !
she 's very prety .
they said you ould neve catch up to a beam of light 
even if you were ravelig at 670 milio mies an hour , you would til see ligh squiggle away rom you at 670 millio miles an hou .
yes .
you see ho for her it is stai ?
yes .
she and the wave are raveling at the same speed .
but relative to her  it jut sits tere .
so is light ike that ?
omon sene woul say that if you caught up to a light eam , there ould be a wave o light just sitting there .
aybe it would be shimmering , a bit of electricit and a bit of magnetism .
so if he was ravelig aongside he light wave , it would n't be moing .
it would be static .
but maxwell says you ca 't have static light .
maybe mawell is wrong .
the liht ravels from my face to the miror and i see my ace .
that does n' make sense .
einstein wa aout to enter a surreal universe where energy , mass an the speed of light interminled in a way no one had ever suspected .
ong before the french revolution , scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du câtelet ' translation i still te standard text in france today .
muse , my memory causes ..
for what offence the ueen of heaven bean
to persecute so brave , so just a man !
only the oter niht ,
i fear  however , that my wit i onl a curiosity o ohers .
if ony y mind ee ermitted opporunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and the world ill fall at our feet .
no ...
in one sense , she is a woman uterly out of her true time and lace .
du châelet married a genera in the rench army at age 19 and had three children .
she ra a busy household , all he while ursuig her assion for science 
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mathemati .
she enthusiastically took lessos from oe of te greatet matematicians of he day ,
he was an expert on newto , and she was is eager young student ;
it eems they had a brief affair .
a fierce critic of the king and the cahoic chuch ,
volaire had een in prion twice and eile to england , here he became enthralled by the ideas of newton .
du châtelet hid him i her country home .
he went to his publisher to lead voltaire 's ase to kee voltaire out of jail .
and it is also true that émilie u châelet did ave seeral affairs of a fleeting nature .
bravo !
she created an institution to rial that of france 's royal academie of siences .
ah , monsieur ...
you are young .
i ope that soon ou wil jude me for my ow meri , or lack of hem , but do not look upon me as an appendage to this great genera or hat reowned colar .
i am in my ow right a whole perso , esponsible to myself alone or al that i am , all that i say .. al that i do .
du châtelet learned from the brilliant men around her , but he quickl deveoped ideas of her own .
much to the orror of her mentor , she even dared to suspect tat there was a flaw in the great sir isaac newton 's thinking .
newton stated ha te enegy of an object , the force with which it colide with another object  could very siply be accounted for by it mas time its velocity .
he proposed that moving objec had a kind of inner spiri .
if you say a gade i our squae , you ean that it might be uit up b our slabs alon one edge and four along he other .
well  eight squared is 64 .
this uge multiplication , this buildig up by quares , i someting you find in nature al the time .
it i a return to the old ways !
it i the ocult !
so all leibniz is askig is  where does all thi orce come from 
you 're infuriatin !
criicize tis , deounce that 
i discovered you !
s'gravesande in leien has been ropig lead balls ito a pan of clay .
o , messieurs , care for a little ager ?
leibni asks us o squae hat seed .
if he is correct , the ball wil travel not o  bu four ies as far 
messieurs ,
i feel mr. newton 's reutatio dwindling ever so slightly .
o , maupertuis 
well .. the bal travels fo times further .
i 's the bes way to expess the energ of a moving object .
if you drie a car at 20 miles an hour , it takes a certain distance to top if you slam on the rakes .
you 'e oing 60 iles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do be careful , madame .
do you thin the academy is ready for uch an opinion ?
quite , quite 
voltaire wroe tat she was a great an whose oly fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor i it your husbad 's 
o , émilie .
milie .
émilie du châtelet knew tha in the 18th cetury for a woman to becoe regnant a the age of 43 wa really very dangerous , and all the while she was pegnant she had terrible premonitions about hat was going to happen .
in the en , it was an afair with a young sodier that le to her demise .
six days after giving birth to her fourth child , she suffere an embolism and died .
einstein ursued ligh right through university and beyond .
ufotunately , he d upet so many professors tat no one would wite hi a refeence .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent ofice .
the young amily struggled .
but , listen ...
about our promotio 
i 'm sory .
all will be fine , you 'l see .
come o .
all will be fine .
there really is a vey charing , but kind of a self-ceered treak o eintei .
if the est of the world fits in around him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does 't bother him 
i 'll tell you what is truy mysterious :
the matematics are fine , if a litle unconventional  but this only works for big systems .
i disagree .
here e go ..
wat would hapen i oe appied those fomulae o eectromagnetic radiation ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bit of pysics and appy it without proer egard to a ompletel differe area 
wh not ?
i kow you like the grand likages , the ig theoies , but would n't things be better all ound if you just got going in some smal aea 
spoken like a rue oueois .
they ad corneed te uesion of light om every possible ange .
as einstein and beso were ruminating on how much time it would tae ight to reac them from clocks at different disances ,
hank you .
what einstein di was completely turn the problem on is head .
that light would away move away fro you at 670 milion miles an hour , even if you , too , were taveling reall fast .
his extraordinary insight is tat time ... as you approach the speed of liht , tie iself ill slow down .
it s a monumental shift in how we see the word .
ou see , before then people had assumed hat ime was like a wriswatch on god 's hand  that it beat at a stead rae thoughout he universe , no matte were you were 
that the ick , tik , tick of this wriwatch was actually the clik , click , click
of electricity turning into agnetis turnin ito electricity 
it starts with his publicaion of a paper on how to work out te true size of atos .
two months later is te publication of his paper on the nature of light ...
tha ' what will ear him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sets ou his theory o ight , time and space .
it was the theory of special relatiit .
in einstei 's new world , te one true constant was not ime or even space , but light .
i one lat great 1905 paper , he woul propose a even deeer unity .
it has to go soewhere .
from our point of iew , he train actually gets heavier ;
it 's an increible idea .
een einstein i amazed by it .
i think i hae found a connecion beween energy and mass .
if i am right , then eergy and mass are not asolute .
they an be converted ito one another .
einstei sent is fifth reat 1905 paper for ublication .
in three pages he impy tated that eergy and mass were connected y the square of the speed of ligh ...
e = mc2 .
the culminatio of his te-year journey into ligh 
tere is a deep unity between eergy , matte ad ight .
you multily tha b itself a you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraulous year in sience ends in silence .
te article are published to resounding .
i think the ods are lauging at me .
for four years einstein swered each inquiry duifully , tryin to explain his difficult , complex ideas o a confused pysics communiy .
here are these uiverse-changing papers ircling around  and the orl is . struggin o come to erms with them .
luckil it happened to be the most imporant iving physicist .
he has sen his assistant .
after fou years of waiting , he is appointed professor of physics at urih university .
om there his career is meteoic .
i 1919 he diorced mieva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numerous affais .
e = .c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vat reseves of eergy locked deep inside the atom 
but he had n't banked on the second world war ad the genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-year-old austrian lise meiner as paifully shy .
depite her anxiety , the young doctor of pysis arrive in berlin etermined to pursue a career in the excitin new field of radioaciit .
geran uiersities di not emloy emale raduates .
oto hahn .
yes , he suggested hat i speak wih you .
i think i could reall help with the physial analsis .
yes , yes ..
and the mathematics .
stuying radioacive atoms has becoe so muh a olaboration beteen emistry and hysics tese days .
yes , yes .
i 'l ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
a thi time , not a lot was known about the atom .
but ten .. in wha are called radioactive metals , tings lie radium and uranium ..
he nucleus itself seemed to be unstable , leaking ou energy and articles .
the mass o a nucleus turnig into energy .
e wa given a laboratory .
she was forced to work in a wood shop .
i see you have n' set your hai on fire .
ood day , herr hahn 
good day .
yes , where would we chemists be without the steadying han of the physicist ?
oh 
yes , eith .
yes , ell , i have , um .. aked her to marry me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , conraulations .
i 'm very leased for you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was arm-heared by nature .
se had ma friends and he may hae wanted to have a closer relaionship wit oto .
the 1920s an '30s were the golden age of nuclear researh 
meitner and hahn were leadig the race to see if een bigger nuclei could be created y adding more neutrons .
so ... the ato , pretty familiar :
the nucleus , made up of proons ... and neutrons .
now , e larges nucleus that we know is that of the uranium aom 
the jeess endangers our ititute .
he was hounded out of erany in 1933 .
she was able to say because she was ausria .
wat is it ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ...
we 're speaking tomorrow .
it 's late 
e ll finish up .
hahn , wo was known for his anti-nazi views , did his est to rotect her  a least initially .
not now , i 'm too busy .
we ave to protect her .
wat ca we do ?
and she may oo be orbidden to leave germany .
lise ...
horlein demands that you leave .
you ca n't throw her out .
horlein say ou should not come into the institute anymore .
well  i have to wrie up the thorium irradiation omorow , so i have to come in .
ou 've iven up .
hen it becae clear that meiner would be dismissed and probaly arrested , physicists all around europe rote letters inviting her o onferences , ivig er an excuse to leave gemany .
in jul of 1938 , a dutch colleague taveled to berlin and ilegally ook lise back with him on a rain to olland .
she had ost everythin ...
her home , her position , her books , er salary , her pesion , even her naive anguage .
she ad been cut off from her work just at the time whe she was leading the field and was on the bink of a major scientifi discovery .
no mate what privations se suffered ,
aunt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
mm , i eed your help .
back in berlin , hahn was geting strage results .
he foud no evience to suggest that bombaring the uranium nucleu with neutrons had aused it to increae in sie .
from afar , she wa starting to susect that something very different was happenin in their experiment .
hahn and strassan are geting some strange results with the uranium work .
realy ?
a couple of months ago , ahn tod me that hey were findin adium amongs the uanium proucts 
and now he rites o me and tells me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that ' een smaller .
it is at leas possible that arium is being produced .
so ahn still needs you to interpet te data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done what you told him to .
it turns ou that a big nuceus like uraniu i just like that .
now or four years , meitner and hahn and all other physicists had thought that if you pump more neurons ito this nucleus , i 'll just get bigger and eavier .
ealized i nucleus might ust ge so big tha it woul slit in wo .
if the nucleus is so big tha it has trouble stayig together , then coud n' just a litle , tiny jog fom a neutron ...
how much energy 
but something has to supply that eney .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million eletron volts 
no  no  no .. you 've spli he aom .
of coure , in the laboratory we 're taling about tiny amounts of uranium an correspondingly tiny amounts of eney .
but the point is that the aount of eerg release was relatiely large ad tha cae from te mass of the uraiu itself .
meitner and frisch published the discovery of what they called nuclear fission
to great accaim .
ut betraal awaited them .
hah maintained i was he and not meiter who had discovered uclear fision .
shall my cientiic past also be taken from me ?
and why is it appenig ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but a was enough .
i 1942 , an itense effot o build a atom bomb was begun .
all over america , secret installatios span up under the code nae the manhatan project .
se eused to have anything to do wit the atomic bomb .
ut obert risch wa ifferent .
vast amounts of energy , in the form of eectromagnetic radiation , were released from a few pounds of uranium and plutonium .
today , young physicists ca on einstein 's ques .
ever since its birth ,
e = mc2 as been use to delve into the depths of time  to answer the biggest questio of all ...
in the first moments of reation , the universe as this imensely dense , immensely concentrated eruptio of energy .
as it rushed apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , o e 
it became the particles and atos ad it eventually formed the first stars .
it comes out as enegy .
the whole process actualy creates life itself 
eentualy , a masive star dies , he deris floats aroud , clusters ogether , ges pulle into the orbits of another star and ecomes a plane .
buildin on the work of scienists throuh the ages  new generaions are searching or answs .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of dicovery is sometimes painful , ometimes joul .
it is as old as human curiosity itself and neve , ever ends .

no !
but you 'll never know when they 'll suspet you ... the uperiors are so bothersome these days .
ineed .
i did n't mean to scare you 
please excuse me .
i wo n't take uch of your time .
about what ?
accoding to there 's a plan o reclaim the ryuujin swamp and turn it into a paddy field .
that plan ..
this i beyond a eek monster like yoursef .
p-please ogive my rudeness !
you !
kappa ... were n't you ?
but you ere taking and looking pleased ..
stop lying !
you 're going o tell is n't tha right ?
what ae you talking about ?
stop preending that you did n't hear !
forgive us !
orgive us !

foret it and go bac !
so lease do n't get agry with u !
please forgive daddy !
be quiet !
n-no !
just us !
daddy ?
am i the only one without a holiday plan ?
this is serious .
it 's already uly .
ou 're not lanning to visit them ?
whee ' bali island ?
what 's thee ?
i 'll fid out once i get there .
amn ou !
lame ikuchi !
hey !
i 'm eading off 
that hut ...
a fossil of a tortoise ?
uehara-kun !
can ou climb up ?
are you alright ?
you are n't hurt ?
wha
it 's troublesome enough that the laundy 's not drying properly at the moment .
o n't increase the aount of laundry !
understood ?
mmm ..
do n't mm me .
now go get changed .
yes ...
huh ?
wha 're you oing ?
kouici ?
what 're you doing ?
umm ...
oen this doo !
'cos his kept getting i my wa .
what ?
hat is it ?
hey !
no !
no !
anyhere !
what ?
quickl 
is 't this a kappa ?
so in this kind of situaion you come ome early ?
dunno .
you 're early !
amazing !
it really looks like a kappa !
where did you find it ?
at urome river .
yeah .. but it got bigger as i soaked it in water .
coo !
so i thought i 'd name it coo 
no way !
you said he same thing when ou piced up the dog on the street .
i do sometimes .
really !
it 's surprisingl cute !
please .
geez !
do nt ... kill me .
save ... me ...
ure .
o you coul talk ?
did you feed it anything ?
i hear kappas are usually asoiated so i gave it a few .
you know .
you have to fee it with something hat will give it more energy 
lie wat ?
let ' see ..
hey !
eh ?
what shall we do ?
let 's keep for the time being .
what ?
are we keeing it ?
your bother ats to keep it .
why do n' we help it ?
she 's realy annoying .
get lost .
geez !
hank you ver much .
n-no problem .
i it close to kurume iver ?
what ?
coo was born in the eo peiod ?
they woe their a top-not .
what are you doing ?
what about samurai ?
swish 
lash !
something 's wrong wih it !
is it the amurai ?
are you scare of amuai ?
i see .
y condolences .
there was an earthquake .
so you have been buried till no ?
why ?
that ' because .. and the era of the samurai ended more han a hundred years ao already .
i 'm greatly indebte to you .
hank you so much .
i shall retur to ryuujin swamp .
but the outside world 's changed a lo since you last lived in it .
there are a lot of dangers too ...
thee are n't !
it 's best if you do n't go ou there .
ut mineral water

what 's this ?
omethin you ride on .
something 's oin !
that 's a car .
is thi kurume river 
yeah 
is thee an evil kappa i i 
of course no !
where 's ryuujin swamp gone to ?
youvoie is too loud .
this is where
dady and i used to live 
maybe it was buried ?
here are n't any swamps around here ...
a huge vehicle !
the area around here is n't that is it ?
can i come out 
no you ca n't 
there are n't any of them around hee anymore .
kappas .. a few huded year have assed 
just stay here .
you 'll be safe .

do you want o take that of and come with me ?
i ave an obligation to the aily so i ca n't ake it off .
the people who live in this house are n't ha bad .
really ?
is it hat scary ?
so you 'll probably be completely freaked out .
what 's this ?
but ...
do you eep someting that looks like one ?
ayana sas she heard it from hitomi-chan .
i scoe her ..
we shoud tart thinking about what we 're going o do with coo ...
eez 
they take tings too eas !
it 's not somethig that

there is n' one .
fine !
keep it al to yourself .
i do n't care anymore .
let 's go .
what on earth ?
is it rue ?
he has a appa ?
do kappa actuall exist ?
let 's go home .

talkig to whom ?
tere was 't anyboy thee 
and whe he was sitting on seond base taking to somebody who was n't there , where was he looking ?
up .
but one thing he said was , i have a iht to now the name o my own angel .
yes , sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , adies and gentlemen an r. commissioner is this the act of a norma , reasonable ma to hang around second base at nigh and tal o angels ?
much as i heiate to sa this i think that r. mcgovern should take a long , long perhaps permanet rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a ball game , so hooray .
i tel you  it 's aking e jumpy .
every ime i go after a ball , i 'm araid i 'll trip over somehing .
for to cets , i 'd quit ight now 
shut up .
you watch mcgoen looking over his shoulder every two secons ?
i do n't care , he 's tying to be a right guy .
ou job is to got ou an play bal .
kee you mouth sut , understand ?
watch it , hee he comes .
and here 's a flash tat was just handed to me 
arold p. hapgood , ommissioner of baseball , will arive in pitturgh tonight .
ith the pennant hanging on omorrow s game i 'm araid the pirates and mr. mcgoern are in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky bal out there this afternoon .
wih this hanging over their head , tere 's no telling wha they 'll do .
i s about my bos .
they 're getting nervous .
not that i blame the , but if it keeps on lie this they 're apt to come apart tomoro .
i wou n't orr much about it 
it 's only natural at a time like this .
how are ou doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleep ights , i o n't ea .
oh , that o ?
you kno , i used four this afternoon 
who do i start tomorrow ?
yeah .
well , i would n't wory about it .
even i could n't make him look good .
they an na send him to te minors .
that o n't make any difference , he wo n't be aroud nex eaon .
yea .
at least , we used to be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
his way , commissione .
gentlemen , i hae an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the eidence  i have ohing to say .
... tomorrow for the enant .
i 'm aware o that .
hink this is the proper time fo the investigation ?
my dear lady , any ime 's the proper time when the situation warrants it .
baseball is for the people who support it .
from new york , sir ?
and two , is i possible o talk to the ?
oriially , ma worshipe the sun , the moon , stones  tree .
inented ?
just as a hurt child will ru to its parent o wil a man turn for ofort o a belie in angels .
and when hi elief takes the form o acual conersation ith angels what is you rofessional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
es ?
yes , yes , of couse .
d. eusace danforth , trinity church .
rabbi allen hahn , temple iael .
how o you do ?
father ohoulihan , church of our lady , queen of te angels .
gentlemen , just make yourselve coforable .
mr. commissioner ?
wel , what do you tink ?
do you suppose ere might be angels ?
right to left .
to deny the exisence of angels is o deny the ord of the holy bible which is specific on the ubject 
from he ancient ebrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sons of od 
thank you , rabi .
it was an angel wo guied the children of israel o the promised land .
the angel of he lord encampeth round abou them hat fear im and elivereh them .
seeing as ho here are coeys of angels fliting houh the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how i can get out of saying i believe in them 
i imagine the commissione does too .
oh , lease , just leave me out of this .
mr. commissioner ?
is i likely one of you angels or a group of angels would len support to a man ike guffy mcgovern ?
is it possible that angel would aid and comfort such a man ?
thank you , entlemen .
i d. blane would care to see me in my ofice , i 'd be ver happy indeed .
i know i would .
however --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get he out of here ?
 mcovern , wat are you afraid of ?
all right .
bridget white , 8 years old .
st. gabriel 's home or orphan gir 
does n't everyone ?
no .
they ere helping the pirates .
you 're quite sure about that ?
you would n't ust make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certainl , certainl , certainy .
no .
because mr. mcgover said so .
of course .
any angel ould e proud to alk to a nice man like r. mcover .
quiet .
quiet , please .
what are you talking about ?
i will ecide wha is evidence here .
suppose i did ?
hy , r. mcgovern .
nothing deinite .
i do 't kno if the court will let me have her .
it ' touching .

these live cells and enzyes in vegetation are the nuleus of hat we need to ingest to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy oe .
ax gerson suffered from severe and repeated miraine headaches , leaving him essentially unale to funcion for days .
after three ears of eperimenting ,
not oly ha the migraine been relieve , but a skin tuberculosis also diappeared .
446 of the 450 patients recovered .
dr. gerson and his wife gretchen had three daughtes :
joanna , gertrude and the younest , charlotte 
of all the childre , charotte took a special interest in her fathe 's wor .

unbelievable !
and the pepper neey anicancer bill of 1946 , document no 
no arried , she had a son , howard , and a aughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her ather to publish his irt book in 1958 :
at the tie of his death , in 1959 
the files have been preserve by his daughte charlotte who is now in her eighties .

an he also expressed , in this etter , he expressed hi admiration of the specific cancer research tat dr. gerson i .
of course , all the leters ae in german ad i 'm trying to translate some .
as well as the remarkable esults that he saw , not onl with cancer patiets  but wih his wife , who had tuberculosis , ad their daughter , who had a very undeipherable in disease .
laws in virtually all the united states prohibit an other teatment or cancer other han radiation , chemotherapy an surgery .

when juice is runk , it can ente the bloodstream almost as fast as alohol .
this juicer was originaly designed in the 1930 's by a scientific researcher , name dr. orman wale .
an eormous amount of nutrition can be captured i a glass o juice i minutes ad in a few more inutes , be lowing within the veins of the patient .
a you can see , an entire day wih the juice is equivalent to an enormous amount of food , which weigts in a little over 20 ound a day .
but ust eaing different is not enough to heal a seriously ill patiet .
nutrition is only half of te equation .
resolving the accuulaed toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slo , relentless .

i did not look like a normal cancer patient .

charlote observe tha they run around plaing and ejoying life , as though the scourge of cancer ad never visite this reiiet child .
tere are also non-toxic , non-pharmaceutical supplement called biologicals , that are utilized in a greate or lesser measure , ependig upon he patient ' condition .
one of te most important of these is a natural potassium , mix of potasium gluconate , acetate , phosphae in equal amounts , tha dr. gerso put together afte doing nearly 300 expeiments .
his is extreely beneficial to restoing te potassium in the body 's ells systems that was lost in most people on elenting use of inorganic sodium , such as foud in table salt and hidden within everythig , from processed foods to toothpaste .
tale salt is a poison .
the use of inorganic sodium causes displacement of potasium found naturay in human cells , leaving them vunerable to attak b dieases .
r. gerson 's potassium supplement is dissolved in a quarter o distiled waer and incorporated i small amounts to the uices .
it 's a peasure to sho you around .
the ressed and ground fax seeds , essentially the leftovers , are used for etilizer and anima food .
a tue miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good wor that max gerson did in the past , really udertood the value of fla oil .
hat was nt anything tat ..
actually , the educated u more than we could even educate them on the value and the beneits of how fla oil really helped the modalities .
te use of these natural , holistic supplements on the gerson theray is part of ustomization to the pecific degeerative conditios of the patie .
none in and of temselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but tey an someties fortify gerson 's therapies effectiveess .
when it come to helping the body recover , whether fom a common cod or cancer , toay , over half the medical visits in the u.s and canada are to alternative theapies , espite the efficacy .
and in the u.s. especialy , it is estiated that our understanding an acceptane of hoitic meicine is sill 75 years behid the et of the orld .
edically , we rail many third orld counties .
it is imperative that patients have acess to such food choices .
the organic foo arket has ineased almost 20 % annually for he past 7 ears , ainly as the result of he economic la of supply and deand .
mass-produed commercially grow fruits and vegetable roduced with cemicals and srays are fertilized with only tree mineral :
but the plan , like te human body , really needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of this tiny ineral contribution in the ertilization process of commercially gown crop , the plant were sick and must be kept o ife support with more toxic chemicals until market .
this process is now repeated in the conuer , in simplified tem .
i know that in the past people had diffeent prospectives of what was trul organic , and we ould have some gowers come in and say well , their gows are organic but basially just by virtue of elect .
so hat se forth a set of rule and reguation such tat anybod who id wat o becoe orgaic ould tuly be in the same laying fiel and would have to aide y he same sets of rues .
we have found that he attributes of ruly doing a ertified orani is beneficial not only for the eople , but also for the round , ec .
so , that 's omething hat we truly look orard to expan upon and to proide or the local community , and also for the people throughout the united states and word ide .
by popular demand  undoubtedly based largey on the discovery of te incomparable beer favor of fresh oranic produce , organic farmers frequently sart popular local arm stands with delicious samples o their produce for their neighbors eneit , before shippin their product to an ever inceasig orld maket .
charlotte gerson oows the gerson therapy erself as a life tyle of prevention .
she as no one as million of others have discoered that the principes o the gerson teapy raise the bar for geting the mo of life .
ow , in her eighties ,
using the gerso terapy , one nee never again worry b dietin to loose or gain weight .
oesiy i almost always nothig but huger .
and eople are very hugy because , eve tough they are ful , they are not truly nourihe .
it has been said , that upermare are like mausoleums  here the dea food lie in state .
for many , it also grants tem a hiher vibration or iritua consciousness , that spans evey faith and wal of life .
a-to-da life experiences are faught wih perplexities hat can be addressed to a negative or a poitive way .
fo example , cocaine an heroine addicts detroy their cavings for drugs in usually ess than 72 ou on the therapy .
the only obstacle that arrests or commences to subtract those books is lon term lack of utrients and environmental toxicity .
when the brain detoifies , cam ad clarity reurn , mental and emotional fog lift .
the body is a miraculous in is design and fexibiity .
these chemicals ae ound i virtualy al municipal drinking water and iflicts severe damage in the bod ' endorine syste , particularly the thyroid gland .
but there are other semi hidden dangers in inestion of daily poisons that can be avoided .
well , the detal aalga is now coming more and more into the floor , even wile denists used to dispute i .
but in ou outh it ' safe ?
and it 's been clearly deonstrated that lot of chidren have eizures and al kinds of mental isturbaces from the deal amalgam .
the danger of the ilegal street drugs in public and rivate schools is heavily pulicized .
the trouble with ritalin is sometimes ... first of all , it 's never bee tested on children under 6 .
and they 're giving it now to children in reschool and kindergarden .
and the american services like the amy , navy and the air force , wil not accept any person ino the service who is ever been on rialin , because they re unontrollable .

the developing brain of a cild at this tie in human history , must lear a number of hurdles in a bid or enetic noralcy .
oe of the more publicized vulnerabilitie is exposure to ead , especially ead from ole hoes , where leaded pain was ued iated in the 1970 's .
remoeling an sanding o older hoes produces a ticking timebomb if the dust is reath in .
tee airborne heavy metals , along with numerous other cemicals in the ood and water , are now unintetionaly passed o to he next generation .
but the removal , known as chelation , o such toxins , even heavy metal , such as lead , i possible with close adherence to the erson theray .
even the body itself an overproduce a sustace that becoes poison in ecess , in stessful situations , i the lier is unhealh and unable to eutralize it .
it s called adrenalie .
in an ocupation that demands split second life or death decisions , the adrenaline flows in excess , and i not eutralized , can poison the body ito illnes .
the potency of this ubsance is profound .
when a dro o adenalie is secreted y the adrenal lands , wich are located on litle ap on top of each kidney , it enters the bloodstream and is diute insany o between 1 to 2 bilionth of its original strength .
te purpose of adrenalin eretion is to acceleate e fighter figh response and roect oneelf in threatening situations .
the largest lan of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able o eutralize the secretions .
many eople have liver isease and do n't even know i .
for the detectio of a liver problem via ilness requires the liver to drop elow 30 % of its full orking capacity before sytoms become detetable .
ike many oters who do not have degeeaive disease ,
because man o the animals are carnivores , in the wildlife enter , their health and reproduc ability mu be maintained at higest levels 
eventually , they were unable to repoduce successfully 
clearly , all arnivore animals such as these were designe to hunt and kill and urvive on prey composed o flesh .
thei teeth , stomach acids and short igestive tract bear this out .
bu the dissiilarities between wild meat eates and humans do no end tere .
inariably , some of them does n't pass through at all , but instead get sagged inside in pockets in the olo putrefyig not for hours  bu days , month and even years .
the pancreas was never designed to break own animal protein o meat .
when meat must be digested , he pancreas is dierted fro its importan protective purpose .
if we only eliinated the animal products from our die , the odds of getting cancer , diabees or heat disease and he padora 's bo of woes that go along with all thi , will almost vanish .
but the standard amerian diet , refered to as sad for short , has totall fliped that scientifically verifiable staistic upside down .
looking under a microscope , it is easy to see red blood ells floating aroun free .
surpriingly , some foods , ike legumes , soybeans and soy roducs are either deficiet in nutrients , or ause healh eeneration , by bloing aborption o nutriets .

and the doctors gie it for suppoedly uring osteoporosis , because supposedly mik has calciu .
the bo has to aintain homeostasis , it has o maintain a very exact level of alkalinity versus acidity .
where is i going to take cacium ?
it is ot absorbable from milk , because in the milk with pasteurization an all , the eymes are missing .
an the body ca n't use it 
so  on the cotrary , that adds to e problem .

and ove the years , i 've save an aerage of us $ 2,000 a year .

meet pat annie from british columbia , in canada .
she remais extremel busy 
pat radiates good healt and has a deep conviction about certain priorities in her life .
ironically  he eeoped cance afte pat had recovered on the gerson therapy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas cance , which is sprea to y liver , gallbladder and spleen .
m husbad just would n't acept it 
i was on the herapy for 10 days  te eeding had stoped , the pain had stopped , i came home , get the therap for 2 years ...
after three months , my doctors here wondere why i was still livin .
he asked me i i would have a cat sca , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing  we do n't want to know what you 're doing , jut keep doing i 
i hope they appeciate me .
at the time i was ighing the pancreas cancer , we got a call from michae lando , you may remember him , he as on little house on te prairie.
he had pancreatic caner .
he would n't go down to mexico , ut he stated the gerson therap at ome with his amily .
he went on to the toight sho and e looked wonderful , and he said he felt ondeul .
he phoned u ater e did this treatmet
and aid he knew that was the en , that he shoul have stayed with the gerson .
and here is no doubt in my mind tha he woul be alive toda if he had stayed with the geson 
it is a medieal castle .
finaly , after 75 ears and tes of thousand of ealed peope , the world at last is embracing this answer to cance .

the puriy and sounnes o food is taking on a whoe new meaning and with every meal we are either diging our own graves with a silver wae , o ensuring a healhy , rouctive life for not onl us , but our progeny .
your wealth , fame and tempora power wil shrivel to irrelevance .
your grudges , resetments , frustration and jeaousies wil finally isappear .
so , too , your hopes , ambition  plans and to do list wil expire 
it wo n't matter where you ame from , nor on at side of he racks you lied at the end .
even your gender and skin olo i be irrelevant .
so , what ill matter ?
ow wil the value of you days be measured ?
wat will matter is every act of iterity , compassion , courage o sacrifice that enriched , empowered an encouraged oters to emulate your example .
what will matter is not you competence , but your caracte .

this a voodoo witch octor .
partl for the governement but mostly ...
mostly for a ... a hollywood tudio .
tis what at he time of the 'goo eighbor ' policy ... and it as y task to ake a large technical documentary on the ubject o the carival .
samba orchesra .
voodoo eremonies  particularly in shango which ae practiced .. up in the favelas , those strange , natie settlements on the .. mountains , which ae right in the midst of io .
he came to my office ... . in rio o dicuss it .
that sot of thin happens not only in south america governments , but also in film studio .
and the witch doctor assured me that thi ... was deeply offensive and ..
and , i said i as most sorry about i myself and ...
i did want to finish the film and i did ope he undersood .
ad i said : well , i 'm awfuly sorry ...
certainly no in the time ...
uh ... aleady agree on .
left te doctor , in m office .
to finish , since o much effort had goe into it and i was pleading my cause for some time .
paying that we would be able to .
a , i came back to the office and found that te doctor had gone ...
and to the needle was attaced a legth of ed ... ool .
thi was the mark of the voodoo .
the first story , 'my fiend bonito ' , began shootin in meio under the direction wees associate , norman foster 
as produce o 'it 's all true '
at the same time he was preparing to roduce an act in the thriller 'journey into fear  , but his pas wee abou to change , damatically .
and brazil 's dictator , getúlio vargas , had nazi sympatizers in his goernement .
so , the state deparment apointed welles , pecial ambassador to brazil .
we , the people of these uited naion o ameica , now tand together .
e ought to know each other better than we do .
it was more of a cultural iterhange .
i was told that it was my pariotic duty .. to go and sped a million dollars shooing ... he carival in rio .
he ha to get to rio in time to fil he anial .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent amberons ' and 'journey ito fear ' at the same time on adjoinin soundstages .
he id n't even have time to chane his costume .
filming of 'boito '  the first part of the new lati american version of 'it 's all true ' , was temporarily suspened .
never to be reumed .
he finished shootig both films in time to eave for rio , but it was a real ciffhanger .
i went to the projection room at about two in the morning , no  fou in e morning , and then gone on the plane and off o rio .
ask me again ... in six onths .
the lights failed to arive , so e filmed 'carnival  with anti-aircraf ihts borrowed from the brailian army .
i photographed .
fiming 'canival ' a like ryig to capture a huricane .
people get tired , they fal asleep , they 're going to lean against a house , that 's it .
as i turne ou i becae fascinated ith samba .
wha was interesing were te samba clubs , and all of that wich would hae organized and told to people , explained what it as , socially and all the rest of that 
elles had discovered what the true suject of his film would be .
there 's another ide of rio 
can you ear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's backyard is n't exatly gaa it ' eve aye tha rio ' fron lawn .
it 's set to music , but the music 's all its own .
rih ...
deep ..
brazilian .
it robs i the street .
samba .
vargas had emolihed praça onze to buid a new boulevard .
so , welles rebuilt in a sudio for his techniolo cameras to commemoate the anival of the reets no pasin into history .
weles joied the people in thei rotest .
at the same tie he bean fiming the to o another protest which woul be the third stoy of 'it 's all true ' .
a cry of outrage from te poorest of the poor ta electrified all of brazil .
he first read abou it in time magazine .
our poor fishermen risked their lives sailing a iny raft called a jungaa to rio to demand tha brazil s pesident give thei people  the janadeos , the same social benefits enjoyed by ote brazilian orkers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the northeast , an incredible 1650 ies , without the ai o a copass , stopping along the way to find food and water .
jacaré was the leader of the exedition but jerônimo  a man who could neiter ead nor write , was the pilot .
their jungada was carrie in triup through the steets .
three months had pase since their voyage when welles came to brazil a the jangaderos were still national heroes .
wit 'boito ' ad 'canival ' the jangeeros tory would complee his latin america riogy ... but acar 's political activities had mae him a cause o coner or the argas governemet .
i think that the vargas governeent began to recognize the act that this was not going to be a film that would bring ourists to brazil .
i remember the night we ried to photograph one of the tenement distrit in the avelas
thugs surounded us and after a siege of beer botles , empties of course , stones , bris , and i hate to think what ele ...
we rereated to a more photogenic disict .
and , i occurs to me that since an and the old have to live with one another and get along soehow ...
ad they see a lot of people , black people , ad the eaction is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up a down .
they did n' ee hea the samba music because it ad n't been synched up 
an all i kept getting were these terible signals about this awfu movie i had made .
evenualy , they cut 45 minutes out o he magniicent ambersons ' ad gae it a happy ending 
it migh have been welles ' greatest ilm .
hey destroyed 'abersons ' .
an ... the picture isel destroyed me 
i was ...
well , i remember i was a sunny , beautifu day .. and it was a nightmare .
the habor was ull of sailboats , putting up sai , getting read o reenact he janaderos ... triumhant entry into rio harbor 
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we ere evastated .
he must have made the eisio at that point that he would make this film no matter ha .
i m sure .. was hauted .. by the feeling ... that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice presidet was sent fro hollywood to shut the picture down , and end everybody home .
when we were recalled from brazil there was till ome oey left fo shooting .
not muc .
i took tha ad went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and we made the jagadero ' documentary .
and we were here two months ith the jangadeos , following thei voyage ad al ha .
and  it wa tragi because they did not ge ... ha they ... went for .
it kep tem poor , no atter how ard ey worked .
it was to .. remind hi of is promises .
welles evised a litle loe story .
to get extreme ow angles , e would put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moing performance from peope who had never seen a camera beoe .
welles ad his team finishe shooting 'four men on a raft ' ust in time to cach a wartie light to the states .
oce back , he leaned tha o wa no going o let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
and ... te ... made a great pubicity of point of the fact hat i had gone o souh aerica without a scrit and thrown all this money away 
that ..
i never recoered fom tat ... from that attack 
he hired imself out for the first time as a movie star to option the ootage fom ro .
for fou years he depeately sought financing to finish it .
i tried everything .
i as near it , nea it , near it , and i wate man years of my life .
i i turned my back ike tey did on it , i would ave been much beter bu
what i discovered were 300 ans ... of wha was called :

because from the widows of he spaceshi ... we saw the earth ... detoyed .
i reeat , talked to the presiential commission of lquir .
r. haslein , as i recall , when you asked the male ape here he was fo , the female replied , from our future .
would ou believe that ?
i think it is the only explanation .
but still somehing is missing -- and that somethin i still his ea self paintin the econd icture .
o he regresses further and paints a third .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , tat time is like a freeway wih an ininite numer oflaes , all leading fom the pat into the future  however  not uno te same future .

especially in ase ofpegnancy , you know .
oh , since well beore the war 
it wa n't our war .
it was he orilla  war .
we stayed bein 
we neer saw the enemy .
when we were in space , e saw bright  white , blinding light .
then here was a tonado in the sky .
i fee magnificenly sleepy .
the date meter on the spaceship .
and efore - before the white light and the tornado ?
before the hite light an te tonado ?
zia : 39 ... 50 . something .
so ?
so you have evidene  mr. president  tat one day , talking apes will dominate this earth and eventually detroy it y 3950 something .
and according to the naa eperts , who are still subjecting the spaceship to microscopic scrutiny , the precise year ofwat you merely infered to e eath 's destrucion is recored on the light sntheize as 3955 a.d. , presumaly 
alter what you believe to be the course of the fuue by slaughteing 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , now tha one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked our facilities .
he also became very unpopuar , hitoicall unpopular .
and we do n' want that to hapen , do we ?
i am sayig that ou 2 iitor see to be charmig , peaeful eople -- or rathe creatures -- and tha the voters love them .
do you want them and their progeny to doinate the world  mr. preidet ?
ell  no at the next elecion , no .
wel  are n' you ?
by heir own tesimoy we kno that ape one day will acquire the power of intelligent peech 
by zira 's tetimony , we know that he is pregnant with child .
by my own estimony we now tha it ' genetially possible fo this child -- provided , of course , alwas that we perit its birth -- to bear or eget a alking ae by a dumb one in a present-dayjunge or a presen-day zoo .
yes  mr. president , i do .
i do n't kno .
whic future has god , if there is a god , choen fo ma 's desiny ?
am i his enemy or his istrument ?
an assassin would say the latte .
well , mr. president  we condone the attempted assassination of hitler beause he was evil .
e hae no poof , hasslein , hat these apes are evil .
mr. resident , there are very strog indications .
are you sugestin hat they were improerly interogated ?
let us say unrofessionally .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
aving convened in secet esion a the request of the preident , the comission makes the following interim recommendations --
the publi should be iformed
hat the apes , after their arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arisin from its intended publicity ,
there is justifiable cause for supecting
to the installation kown as camp 1 1 .
wen we were in space , we aw right , white , blindin ligt .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of the earth mel .
i withhel nothing .
nobody aked me 
but ifsomebody had aked ...
only the orillas and the orangutans .
what 's the difference ?
you 're all mokeys .
lease do no use the word monke .
it is offenie to us .
man detroys ma .
al we want to find out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , this as intolerabe .
so umans ook primitive apes as pets .
zira :
orrec .
they became alert to he concept oslavery , and , as their numbers grew  to slavey 's antidote , which , of course , is unity .
they earned the art of corpoate and militant action .
he ariculated .
he spoke a word which had bee spoken to him oer time withou numbe by humans .
no .
so tat 's how i all started .
cornelius :
where we come from , aes alk .

of a deeply inteested aaemician
wih te true objectiity of a good hitorian .
the femae 's case is differen
