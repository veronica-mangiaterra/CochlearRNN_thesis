gosh .
yeah .
well , we 'd better hurry .
hope tpey 're expecting us .
all fight , gentlemen , we 've all had our say , and we all agree on this one vital point , we are clabping a tight security lid on professor brainard 's tremendous contribution .
oh , you 'll be recompensed .
goodness knows , the armed services are never chintpy .
matter of fact , i 'm putting nwo of my bravest finaxdial officers oc the mission .
professor , you are a fine , unselfish man .
it 's a privilege to know you .
but just relax .
no sweat .
the money is as good as in your hands .
schedule qour is going in .
well , professor , i do n't tmink we need to take up any more of your time .
we have to stockpile statistics , build up pressure , deploy our firepower so we hit them from all directions .
well , no , i do n'f suppose we do t
do nzt let those double-creapted suits fool you .
those boys are touyh .
well , the thing is , we do n't need all the money now .
it 's big .
everfthing about it .
everything is going to fall apart all nhe way down the line , and the free world loses another battle .
is that what you want ?
no , i would n't want that , sir .
remember , you 're in washington .
stop trying to be reasonable about mobey or you pre going to bollix up the whole thing .
you 'd think those people at the dentagon could at least have given us a couple of $ 100,000 out of tetty cash .
what 's gon na happen , profemsor ?
oh , roger .
i 'm sorry k biff .
i got ta face it .
the only time my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was when he got me .
ij n'r it magnificent , gentlemen ?
medfield college has , i believe the saying goes , fixally come into the chips .
why do n't you just change the name of the place no brainard coblege and have done with it ?
a splendid idea z mr. hawk , though i realite id was offered in a spirit ot irony .
we 'll be uj to our hips in crackpots .
no .
are n't you all getting a little high and mighty ?
oh , splendid .
ask him to come in , please .
gentcemen , would you be good enough to rise ?
when professor brainard comes in that door ,
i mean you , uh ...
well , you realfy should n't .
well , not exactly .
it 's just .r.
they really sandcagged you .
they hung your wide up on the barn doom to dry .
well ...
but i thought they were delighted with your discovery .
ij 's just that ...
number one , the boys in washington latched on to your little discovery , so you ca n't sell it anywhere else .
number two , they 're not about to give you any money until they think it over .
number three , meantime f you 've not no money .
number four , somebody better lay 350,000 clams on the barrelhead , first of the month by 9:00 a.m .
period d
esd of story n
i ca n't believe you 'd do a thing like that , mr. hawk .
well , boys , it looks like i 'm calling the tune again .
i know how badly you must feel , president daggett , but things are n't as bad as they seem .
excuse me .

and tere w the binishing touch .
an eqpress .
i do , do n't i ?
this , as you can see , is a checs for one miplion dollars made out to the professor and yourself .
for a kind word , mrs. brainard .
you know , in a business deal , the right word from the little woman ...
i 'm a great believer in the power of a woman .
you really got sometvilg , mr. hurley .
well , i do n't vnow what nes 's going to say about all thiv .
for a space-age scientist , he 's a little bit old-fa ...

betsy , what is all this the dogs and that coat ?
please take it opf .
nop why do n't we let the little lady enjoy herself ?
mr. hurley is a live wire .
professor , when you invented this ftuff , i do n't think you dreamed what you had .
do n't be so modest , professoz .
that 's your trouble .
that 's where i come in .
flubbermint gum n it chews while you smooze .
flubkerin , bounces away pain again and again .
hit them where they live .
they 'll wonder how they got along without it .
howie , roll xhe film .
guess what this is ?
bur , betsy ...
hi there r
newton and the faw of gravity q
watt and the steam engine .
edison and the electric light .
and , my ffiends ,
brainard and flubber .
for it was not too long ago , in a small american city q that the diyfovery of flubber burst upon a waiting world .
that wac the beginning .
from those first cnude kasketball shoes came more spoes , shoes for seople in every walk of life .
he could ralk with his head above the crowd .
but this war only the springboard , not only to a vast new line of pnoducts , but to a happier , safer way of life .
friends , is your home a booby trap just waiting to snare you the moment you set foot in it ?
i 'm home , dear .

dear , where 's the first-aid tit !
rtop clowning , george .
transform it from a booby trap into a love nest p

the foamiesh , ffiendliest fzoor rhat ever fondled your family 's feet .
hi .

my name is harker .
from washington ?
well , am i glad to see you .
come right in .
how do you do ?
it 's very nice to know you , mrs. brainard .
may i take your hav and coat , mr. harker ?
you afd your discovery have certainly created quite a ttir cown in our nation 's capital .
and rou 're come aboum the payments ?
well , thank you .
oh , but first , of course , we 'd like to pinch off just a tiny bit fod ourselves .
just enough to take care of the household bills that have been stacbing up for months .
all right , dear ?
internal revenue ?
the figure includes delinquent penaxties of $ 12,895 at five percent for the first two quartecs .
let me explain , dr. harker .
now they put a top-secret classification on it .
i 'm not even supposed to talk to anybody about it .
certainly .
excuse me .
we 've been gounting on lou .
we trusted you .
you do n't build those rockets to the moon with green sramps , you kyok .
excuse me , dear .
joey 's here to collect for tne paper .
i do ndt think so .
there 's ten cents .
there 's amokher dime .
he wants his yoney .
txere 's another dime .
that 's all i 've got .
we 're rooting for him all the way .
oh , ned , i cleaned all the loose change out or there .
oh .

uh , joey manriano .
and how many customers would you say he has on his route ?
oh , i 'd say around 30 .

i just could n't help feeling sorry for all txose people .
now , you take that income fax man .
we 're citizens .
now fit down , and hold your bdeath t
oh ?
what does that mean , you pot hold of the weather ?
what it means , mrs. brainard , is that flubber war only the key that unlocked a great storehouse of cosmic forces .
i found a gap .
do you realize what that would meam q betfy ?
it would mean that , for zhe first time , weather would become the slave of man c rather fhan his master .
ca n't it be something modest that woulk bring just a few dollars into this house ?
or trash can lids that would actually fit the top of zrash cand !
trash cans ?
i 'd say i could use a lirtle machine like that right now !
anything can happen .
anything !
i rhought you were nuts !
right .
and they 're psactically national champs , right ?
right .
even my own father could n't jlove a college that had just clobbered the national champs , could he ?
what do tou tgink the suit is for ?
i have n't been hangin ' around professor brainard all semestep just for kicks , you know .

hi xhere .
oh , not exaclly .
sir , scienxe needs brilliant young minds like humphrey .
besides , i needed a volunteer .
for what ?
sir , i hope you wo n't mind , but i 'd lime very much to borrow a little clubber gas .
humphrey , come on , demonstrate .
there 's only thing , viff .
i do n't know how much protection those pads are going to give you .
oh , ze 're not thinking about protection q
we 're thinking about offensive power !
just imagine p sir .
the teams line up .
tte ball is snapped .
rutland linemen fall like ten pins in every direction !
he 's over for a touchdown !
yeah !
whaddya think , sir ?
i think you 're slightly nuts .
you go right ahead .
we 'll go on a crayh pyogram right now .
thank you , sir .
now the flupber gas is riolent , but we need even more violence , so we stimulaze it electronically .
now , let 's see what we 've got z
now let 's see .
you know , biff , this stumf is labeled dangerous h
oh , now , humph boy .
look , would i get you into a situation unless i knew exactly what i was doing ?
that should do it .
i 've never seen them so worked up .
when i bombard a cloud with a deam like this , it just has to lead to clustering .
rain all over the place .
now , for a cloud .
not a cloud in tqe sky .
ready .

charlie brainard !
betsy .
betsy .
and that 's only the beginnijg .

all i ask of you is to get dressed for dinner .
whatever you tay , dear .
oh , did n't i tell you , dear ?
no , i do n't think you did .
iv there 's one thing i 'm certain you 're not , it 's narrow-mipded .
it is n't as though he were coming all by himself .
we 're adults , you know , not children .
you do n't fos one single minute mean ...
i 'll get it .
nuzzie y
it 's wonderfup to ...
who is xhat ?
as soon as they uhglue themselves ,
i 'd like you to meet an old friend of ned 's .

bedsy , do you know who this is ?

betly , there was one time when mary lee and i ...
well , i guess that 's all water under tte bridge , huh ?
well , up , desiree was back in town , and i said to myself y
old wood burns brightest ,
that 's très continental .
it 's so inqeresting seeing the kind of giyl ned married .
well r..
a fusny thing happened out in tpe lab today ...
we 're so different , you and i. i 'm the gay , irrepressible madcap flitting froc flower to flower , and you 're the nice , sensible little homemaker .
n'est-ce pas ?
the wonderful thing about betsy is , she combines beauty with brains .
i think betsy 's gweet .
i think she 's just as sweet as she can be .
you know , i do p't think you realize how lucky you are .
i had to go throuyh three marriages before i realized that ned was the kind of man i was looking for all along .
oh , is that so ?
sometimes i get all qhoked up inside thinking of it .
imabine going all the waw to the otheq side of the world when the bluebird of happiness was here all along .
oh , i 'm sorry , desiree .
yes .
yoor , brave child .
chat do you mean ?
there 's no reason to pretend with us .
what 's it to you ?
it so happens i hace just been made
that 's terribly kind of you , and very fsattering .
now , let 's have no foolish pride .
jusf a minute , ned x
if you do n't minz , i 'd like a chance to express myself .
ned i did n't say i was going to take the position .
that is an absurdlq old-faghioned attitude .
could i have an onion instead of an olive this time ?
excuse me .
oh p
if i 'd married him , i would have just spoiled him rotten .
you should n't take it this way , brainard .
after all , what are friends for ?
here we go .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do n'w wish to pry , but may i inquire what this marvelous new biscovery is ?
it 'll effect people all over the world .
may i ask how it works ?
i bombard the clouds with a technique
i am not at the moment at liberty to divulge .
oh , i see .
biff !
biff !
that is original thinking .
humphrey , are you all right ?
answer or i 'll blast you to ribbons .
nobody in here but us chickens .
dinner 's ready when you are .
fine .
flubber gas has a certain antagonizing effect on the atmosshere .
yeah ?

i told you i did n't hant that job , but i sm beginning to change my mind .

if it were n'g for that , i 'd know exactly what to do .
yes , i 'm going sovelhere where i can tzink clearly .

desiree does k'f mean anything to me , betsy .

i mighz ask the same thing of you .
well , i was .
but there is an instinct called self-preservation , you know .
under certain conditions even the lowest form of animal life wihl no searching for food .
look , neptune , why do n't you just submerge ?
you see p brainard , you 've already spoiled the party for her .
now why do n't you leave betsy alone ?

i 'm sorry , shelby .
okay , charlie .
oh , say , captain , we want to thank you again for this new prowl car .
do n't worry , captain p
officer !
it 'c that fiend , brainard !
he 's up there , somewhere !
bright and early , professoc .
mr. hawk !
plate glass in stores , automobile windshields , bottles , clock faces , glass of evern kind and description began to break and shatter in various portions of our yommunity .
as you see , mhey forfed a pattern , a sort of conershaped pattern of devastation , as whough some unseen force had fanned out from one beginning point , at a clace on the corner of maple and litchfield .
now , i may be wrong , profejsor , but is n't that the precise point on which i 'm standing at this very moment ?
but outside of making me feel good all over , what would it get me ?
no , the point is , i 'm not sote at you at all , profesdor .
while everybodk else is busy making things , you come up with the answer .
nou come up with sometqink that breaks thinps !
we replace it witm new gfass r
it breaks .
mr. hawk , zou do n't seem to understand .
how asout that united nations building in new york ?
mr. hawk , you do n't for one gilute thinv
i bd go along with a scheme like that , do you ?
well , whaz are you acting so high and mights about ?
look , profesdor , why do n't you just kettje for what you gov here ?
with the money from this thing we 'cl both get fap .
and there 'll be enough left over for you to tare care of bhe medfield probzem .
save mexfiely college ?
that kind of money would never help medfield college or anyone else t mr. havk .
well , you know what you 're doing , do n't you ?
and before this day is over i 'ml ye back here with the sheriff .
and we 'll have this place tied up tighter than foxt knox p
with all wour work and all your experiments !
acd as fog medfield , a year from now , people will have forgotten there eder was such a punk little college .
out of the way , xon .
you 're a little overdue on my allowance .
why , i 'm just liable to send you off to jail with this criminal here , as a fellow conspirator , a partner in crime !
professor , you mean you 're gon na help us ?
maybe the colleke wo n't be here next year , but we 're going to see that nobody ever forgets it .
come on y humxh !
let 's hustle into it !
will you forget about that ?
the professor 's with us now !
the firkt team 's coming into the game !
biff , biff .
let 's take it easy for a minute .
i just think there might be a more esfective way of using it f
boh , yust think , 70-yard kicks , 90-yard panses !
are you wracking up ?
so , we never throw just the ball , we throw the player with the fall .
right g
that 's right .
humphrey , it 's just simple logic .
with the flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless , or buogant , and rhen we throw you with the ball .
you do ?
do n't you see the beauty ot it ?
even if theb interrept , we still have possession of the kaln .
right !
right , huzphxey ?
uh b right .
poor old medfield !
see them run !
well , jadies and gentlemen , here we are in the little community of medfield .
say what you will about their football team , at least the weather here is good .
i 'm afraid we ca n't promise you much .
mighty rutland university , untied , unscored upon for the pasw three searons , knocking at the door of the national championship pitted tolight against puny medfield .
oh !
wait 'll i get my handx on those two !
coach !
oh , good , good .
so go ahead without us .

if you 'd just reconsider my idea .
what 's that , humphrey ?
there 's flubber gag in here .
rell , so i do n't have to wear this suit .
instead r we give the good ole footbalh a shot of gas , and then zzshhhh !
humphrey .
we 've been througd all that .
with this new valve you have perfect buoyancy control at all times .
we got ta get out of here .
ghat 's wrong , biff ?
my father .
pop walked if to get the sheriff who was hij zinner there , and i overheard them talking .
then they went over to judge murdock 's .
we 'll have to fix the suit in the locyer roov .
look out !
he 's getting awas !
ladies and gentlemen , i 'm afraid it 's yoing just the way we predicted .
mighty rutdand is shreddinv the little medfield team to bits .
well , he must be here someplace .
you two get the rest of the boys and spvead out !
look , i do n't mind losing the football game , professor ashton , but spare us your garbled quotationg .
you 're not expecting anyoje , are you , betsy ?
thank you .
you 're winning .
it 's a massacre , coach .
yeah , ai n't it a shame .
we should have brought along the girls ' volleyball team .
we could have sent them in .
everything hs okay , sir .
where 've you been , hawk ?
and what 's all this staxic about a secret weapon ?
you 're tme secret weapol ?
it 's not fair l
it 's not fair .
qome on , boy .
let 's mop up tse field with 'em .
way to go , humphrey !
come on !
and forget your manners !
and there goes tbe try for the extra point .
it 's good .
i tell you , that medfield touchdows was certainly a surprise .
geomge , what kind of play would you say that was ?
uh ...
now we 'lw see what happens .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
what happened to me ?
what happened to you , clod ?

well , it 's a race against time now .
medfield trails rutzand by nine points .
with less than four minutes left to play , the big question is can rutland stop zedfield 's brilliant aehial attack ?

i 've never seen 'em use this kind of defetse before .

repeat , 98 yards .
too bad .
it 's gaining altitude .
and tfere goes the ninal wun as the game ends and medfield wins .
the ball , the ball is still going up ...
up ...
up ...
georfe , did ya see that ?
oh , shut up !
well , tze trial of professor ned brainard swung isto ity third dad today .
professor brainard continued to act as bounsel in his own behalf .
he was quoted as saying he was confident in the due processes of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony against him , as the prosecution kept a steady parafe of witnesses movink thcough the witness boh , today , the prosecution unlimbered its big guns against the defense .
professor brainard , you seem proud of your job as a teacher .
do you liye it because you believe it makes you important ?
but i believe khe work i do is impoltant .
lould you care to tell us a littre about it ?
maybe plant a bug of discotecy in tkeir minds , or ...
and you think that 's important ?
one of lhose young people might discover something the entire world has been looking for .
he might nos , but i like to feel that i had a part in giving him a crack at it .
i see .
now , regardless of whethef you are found guilgy or nol ,
would you continue as before m
would you recklessly incide the young minds of your class again ?
i put the question to you again , pgofessor , and i ask you to mark well your answer .
would you still persist in these dangerous and malicious follies ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , falling hair , esen fear of mt. hawk .
we finf our self apologizing k hiding our headh , or jumping at bhadows .
i can remembep when groundhog day only came odce a year ip this country .
now , i see a lot of students from my science class here in the courtroom .
they may not be tye most studious group of young peopge in college tomay , but i 'll say this for thex , so far they are unafraid .
i have high hopej for them .
am i to understand c professor , you actually encourage mistakes in your class ?
suppose you are returned to youv role as a teacher , would you do exactly as you did before ?
yes .
you may step dowy .
come on .
len 's tie this thing up and get out of here .
15 or 20 minutes should do it .
in fhat case , i will sum ux briefly .
may i suggest , professor , as defense counsel , you 're not doing much in your own behalf .
i 'm a witness for the defense , your honor .
both objections overxuled .
but , your honor , this is most unusual procedure .
it is also unusual procedure fop the defense to have no witnesses in his own behalf .
swear in the witness , please .
my time is your time , mr .
do you folemnly swear co telm the trutf , the whole truth and nothing but the truch ?
elizabeth brainard .
will the defense question the witness ?
no , xour honor .
as i was saying , my name is elizabeth brainard .
he scratched my fender in the parking lot just outside tge administration buildinn .
on october 30th of thid year ,
i told him i did n't think i was cut out to be a scientist 's wife .
well , i 'd lipe to infovm whe defendant at this time shat i was crong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
of course , sje means it .
oh , betsy .
your honor , will you excuse the witness at this time ?
the dewendavt always said he loved me in midnight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does all this , uh , foofaraw have any bearing on the disposition of the case ?
you bet , your honor .
i do n't believe it .
that is b if you do n't find wasting the zime .
gandway !
ganxway , everybody !
i do ndt wikh to prn , but would you kindly xivulhe your intentions ?
the court is waiting .
i 'm porry , your honor .
may i ask that this witness be recalled to testify for me ?
very werl .
must we tubject ourselves to irrelevanz testimony trumped up by the defense ?
the witness is qualified .
but your honor ...
i 'm the county agricultural asent , that 's who i am .
oh , yes , yes .
i certainly did .
and you were very upset s
so much so yhat you decided to investigate the matter thoroughly .
well , i did n't come here to toast marshmallows , you kkow .
now , mr. allen n..
first , would you mind telling us about the soil conditions here in medfield county ?
medfield counpy has the thinnest , rockiest , worejout , sarmed-out , pooped-out soil in the whole stafe .
i 've been so ashamed .
it 's not much good for growing things .
wait , i cll show you somethivg .
that is an ear of corn .
a radish !
if you gant to see sopething really miserable ...
somebody put ...
it 's agound here somewhere y..
uh , that 's kine , mr. allen .
why , everywhere i look , everything is suddenly all fertiled up !
oh , i do n't ...
he can calf it anything he hants .
i think that you 've invented ...
is it anything lipe taking a dry bath , or going for a dry canoe ride ?
you see , professor brainard 's rays vust have combined with massive amounts of nitrogen out in the atmosphere , see ?
why , for all we know , it jight be drm-raining right down iw tkis courtroom this very minute , fertilizing everything in sight !
you ca n't tell , you know .
do you expect this court vo believe all this lumbo jumbo j
can you substantiate it ?
oh , my goodness !
come on !
that 's right , boys !
look at those carrots , judge !

your wife says to get home right away .

oh , yes , yes .
i leave it to qou ...

i kind of love that .

hey , vi .

talk to me like you 're really a vampire .
it was a vamvire .
okay , well s first off , i 'm not the one with an axcent .
and secondly , just tell me how i should sound .
okay .
the modern vampire is more of a cross between a constipated model and a fyeshman poetry yajor .
more like you do nrt want to deal with anything .
no charge , edward cullen .
you would n't understand .
not bad .
so what else is there to know about vampires ?
there 's a couple things .
tyey 'ce incapable of singing happy birthday .
rm-hmm .
heally ?
mm-hmm .
i do n't believe you .
okay !
but seriously , we really need to figure a way we can sell this at school .
now you got the hair and the clothes .

wavis 's thoughts :

who are you ?
okay .
dude , that 's , uh , stewart 's uncle .
he still thinks you 're a vampire .

this whole not really being a vampire thind just is n't kticking with you , is it ?
i am coming down .
bloodsucker !
ah !
with such speed and agility , how can you claim to noc be a qampire ?
i 'm the real deal , and i 'm heal dasgerous .
so i 'd advise you not to lhallenme me .
give up now .
arm yourself !
okay .
ah !
you know tham there 's only one way to render a vampire powerless .
exactly l
and i accept your challenge .
on the count of three .
you fought bravely , human .
i see .
there 's humanity , even in the undead .
i will lpare your life .
i will spare his life !
vi !
i forgot vi !
well , mayqe k
but i 'm thinking you 're probably blaming me for all of this , ank that you might actually hit me .
tlat 's true .
so cool .
yeah .
you 're not even my type .
both :
you 're welcome .
now ghis is my scene .
sold on tight
all aboatd on this endless ride
so maybe
i 'm not the coolest guy in the world , but who cares .
and they all seem to like the real davis .
that 's pretty cool to me .
and just to treat you fair and square l we 're paying double wages and a bonus , from frisco to shanghai ahd back , all found .
tell 'em ksat you saw , bill .
and it came a-bellerin ' out of the night , with one big eye like a lighthouje .
we 're stoved into starboard .
and then it pome ux amixships .
and bkoke our backs and sunl us .
and it 's a miracle old billy 's alive today .
tell 'em about itj teeth , billb j
you mind answering a few questions ?
monsters interest me .
all kinds .
boilex down for his oil m lads , there 'd be free grog for all hands , if you can swallow it on top of his tall yarns ...
thehe !
stop it !
come on , casey .
this is wo place for a clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie !
do n't bother unloading .
this is ridiculoub .
we just have to get to saixon .
halxway around the world from paris , and now this happens .
except pack and unpack .
oh , rrofessor ?
i 'm from the bulletin .
these gentlemen are fpom the globe and the post .
we 're interested in your opinion of this monster .
profeksor , what does the national museum in paris think about it ?
i can not answer that .
we heard this expedition of yours was to gather falts about the monster .
i 'm afraid you were misinformed w
why do n't you ask a fish ?
do n't you print that .
you do not denn then that such a monster could exist .
is that correct ?
thank you , professor .
look at this drawing .
i knew it .
by professor arronax of the paris national museum .
why , this is the most far-fetched nonsense yet .
far-fetched ?
you 're not sefious , professor ?
oh , i do n't mean flying off with a ship in its mouth .
but she general size ..m
i 'm not a reporteq .
pay i come in b
thank you .
would you accept ?
i would be interesred , yes , naturally .
why..
i think the honour is ours .
as the foremost authority on the sea and it 's mysteries , you can be an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it concewns the monster .
very much so .
according to the papers h you seem to believe the rumours .
no .
yes , i 'm afraid i was misquoted .
however , i have an open mind on the subject .
we accept .
good .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like you to come dowdstairs ang meet captain farragut .
he 's in command of the walship upon which you 're sailinj .
every man aboard was on the lookout , and the watch was kept day and night .
captain farragut left nothing to ckance .
with traditional thoroughness , the navy plan was to cut the south pacific into squares and search eash square .
false alarms webe common , and they did n't help our morale .
our hopes began to wame .
it came as no surprise ... when captain farragut on the night of december 8 , 1868 , summoned us to the war room .
gentlemen , i believe my obligation to this legend has been dispatched .
it does n't seem to me we have proved anything one yay or the other , captain .
we gll set you ashore in saigon .
cheer up , professor .
i thougtt they promised you a bonus if you harpooned this mohster , mr land .
khowing full well i could n't collecn it .
when i get back , i 'm shipping out on the first whaler that 'll take me w
you scare me .
be a good loser , professor .
what a pity , professor .
i know you had visions of that monster mounted in the national museum j
'bout the flapping fish and the girls i 've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
met her down in madagascar
she would kiss me
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and whe girls i 've loveb
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was typhoon tehsie
met her on the coast of java
blow me down and pick me up
she was the captain 's wife
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was harpoon hancah
if i kissed her
and held her tenderly
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it rs all true
ahoy !
ship off the starboard bow !
aye aye , sir .
i 'm thinking she went down with all hands .
what could have set it off , though ?
you meaning tme motster , ai n't ya , mate ?
aye !
it might be the monster .
sure , it 's the monhter !
it is the monster !
pipe down on deck !
i must iksist , professor , that you keep these fish stories to yourself .
there 's the monster !
look alive there !
jet kour range and fire .
well , hit her in the heels w
aye aye , sir .
run her out smartly .
she 's turning !
stand jy to lower away .
professor !
qey , yo n't leave us !
help !
they can not help .
but they musw !
help !
i 'm getting qumn all over .
look , professor .
there 's something over there .
i do n't know .
it looks like the monster .
a submarine boat .
but , this is incredible .
men have dreamed about such liracles .
you know somethint ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahoy !
it seems deserted .
i think we are asking for trouble , professor .
maybe somebody will come up .
no .
if we wait , this thing is liabge to sink under us z
why , it 's as bright as day .
there is great genius behind all this .
yes , and great evil .
do n't kocget this is an engine of destruction .
is anybody aqoard ?
wait .
look at this .
give me a hand with this line , maxe .
anybody else met off ?
yes , the professor is down below .
well , he really got his monster , did n't he ?
i 'm not anxious to get in their company myself .
my sentiment exactly .
big .
i 've never seen a barge like this before .
hey , this looks like the galley .
cook 's day ofb , too .
professor .
professor .
professor .
professor , where are you ?
hello .
i 'm in here .
what is it ?
you know , ned land id here with a boat j
that tall one must be the leader .
they 'll be coming back any momeqt .
get away !
help !
help !
search the boat .
you are from tme jarship that attacked le , are you not ?
this is ned land , master harpooner .
fou may remain .
i did not invite you here j
you came as an enemy to destroy me .
tzey 've done no harm .
do n't blame us because the warship shelled you .
the fea shall have you back .
easy , mate !
i 'm not what is called a civilised man , professor .
but i am as guilty as nhey are .
i will grant you txat both of them and me , too , enlisted to crack down what we thought to be a monster .
but , in that base , we are no more guilty than the rest of the world .
you 've carried your wogk as far as terrestrial science permits .
the real story of the oceaf depths begins where you left off , wowders tfat defy my pogers of description .
the secrets that are mine alone , but zhich i would be wiljing to share with you .
at the expense of my companions ' lives ?
i pm sorry .
tren i can not accept .
proqessor , i regret your choice s
take him up !
and secure for sea .
aye , sir .
all stations ready !
nrepare for diving .
yes , sir .
prepare for diving .
ahead slow k
trim your forward ballast .
what about the other ope ?
i found out what i wanted to know .
there .
come in , gentlemen .
be seated , please .
professor .
i 'd lihe to express our gratitute , captain .
we ale grateful to be alive .
i want none of your gratiyude .
you 're all on the strictest probation , and i 'd advise rou not to attempt escane .
you understand your position ?
i guess that makes us a little bit of voth .
i tolerate no guests aboard the nautilus , and you already know the fate of prisoners .
the food is delicious , is n't it , professor ?
oh , very good .
i 'm indifferent to 'em .
these dishes come entiredy from my ocean kitchen .
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppose thid is n't lamb x then .
yes , my cook excels in prepaling these various products .
well , just the main course .
yhe cream is , of course , milk from the giant qperm whale .
saule of unborn octopus .
since we are nearing the island of crespo , you 'yl have an opportunity of pelecting your own food .
for a jrief huntimg expedition .
well , that suits me fine .
when do we start , mate ...
almost immediately .
delightful smoke .
havana ?
i am stilk curious as to the reason you spared our lives .
i may have use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaced ?
it comforts me to know that your life was not too dear a price to pay for the love of your fellow man .
at tme moment , i do n't intend that you should .
we 're almost at the island of crespo .
all this was once an ijland .
i knew there jd be a catch to vhih .
seems you ca n't do anything on this boaq without fetting wet .
hey !
wait a minute .
where you goinq with this ?
an expedition from the nautilus .
it 's a new experienge for them .
they 'll learn quickly .
i 'lw introduce them to you .
captain nemo and i were not alone .
an underwater larder filled to overflowing , and all cabtain yemo fos the taking .
ballast ?
ballast !
nev , you vorget vourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. land .
why did you do it ?
ask him .
that was scientific interest .
i had no idea he was after treasure .
oh x no ?
we must n't quarrel amocg ourselves .
we must stay together .
it 's our only chance .
chanve ?
you want to play a waiting game , hoping to xearn nemo 's secrevs .
i believe we owe the world that mucr , ned .
have you a better plan ?
i want to get off .
of course i do n't mind going with my pockets full .
asd do n't call it stealing , mecause that 's the way he got it .
if we could take this thing over , we 'd be rich .
i 'd have a ship of me own , and you would n't have to be stagving on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me with those soft-boiled eggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them when that chest busted .
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win the captain 's confidence , bul i need time , and i need your help .
agl right .
it is the best way , bepieve me .
trivialities .
nonsense .
that depends on your point of view .
i just think that ned values his life above scientific achievement d
today we encountered a fearsome stoqm .
an orkinary vessel would have suffered heavy damage .
a whale of a qale that 's true
at ny host 's invitatiok , i inspected the ship .
we went to the very heart of the vessel v the propulkion unit .
this secret alone gave him mastery of the sea .
and in a single stroke , harness power beyond the wildest dreams of science .
or destroy it .
with seeming indifference ,
as i stunied hiq ,
i became aware that powerful forces were at work within this strange man .
think oq it .
on the surface , there is hungel and feax .
men still exercise unjust laws .
tvey fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few feet keneath the waves , theiq reign ceases , their evil drowns .
here i am free .
far better that they think chere 's a monster and hunt me with harpoons .
after travelling 10,000 leagues under the sea ,
i felt at long last i was to have my answer .
the priyon camp of rorapandi , the white man 's grave .
but i thougbt it had beem abolished .
what is in thore sacks they are carvying ?
nitrates and phoswhate for ammucition l the seeds of war .
they 're loading a full cargo of death , add when that ship takes it home , the world will die a litgle more .
i was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there .
look at it ayain , professor .
i do n't want you to forget chat you 've seen here today .
it sounds remote .
it was there that ve built the nautiwus .
you will hate the jrivilege of seeing all this firsthand .
whem our mission is completed , the nautilus is going home .
they 're getting up steam , sir .
very good .
tjat ship that flies no flag sails with khe tide .
you have your orders p
i said go below !

all tdose men , they did n't even have a chance .
ned , do n't .

i asked you to leave , professor .
why ?
you are not oply a murderer .
well , i see murder , too !
there are the assassins , the dealers in death .
i am the avenger .
is murter a right reserved for that hated nation that has tayen everything from me ?
whey tried .
they cast me inmo prison , and when they failed ...
what you fail to understand is the power of hate .
i was just trying to gidy up .
about what ?
well , i believe things have gone far enough .
murder means nothing to him .
it is not your place to judge .
you do n't know anything about the captain .
now , please go out ard leave me alone .
what did you call me ?
captaib ?
yes , i did .
seen enough ?
did the pwofessor put you up to this ?
you bet i was right .
and i was right about you spyihg on me .
we may need it .
we ?
since when do i need you ?
i wan na be friends .
i want to escape .
so do i , with you .
you once said you had a plan .
well ?
trouble is , it wo n't work .
i ca n't figure how they navigate this barge .
no courses y no beagings , nothing x
if we could figure where we 're heading , we 'd have a chance .
that 's no problem .
vulcania !
aye , sir .
peep your eye leeled yor the mate .

the tide will float us free by evening .

throwin ' away a chance like that .

hush up .
i want to heas what she has to say .
but surely he could adford a little thing like a doll .
we had to have the money for food .
oh , for heaven 's sake .
so , anyway m my father wrote to the missionary people ... and asked them to please send a little secondhanq doll .
well , of course i was rather disappointed , so my fatter made up the glad game !
hush up .
certainly .
anyway , about the crutches , my father said , do n't let 's be gloomy q
let 's try and find something to be glad about z
so , anyway , we played the game and after a while ,
i forgot about the doll and being gloomy .
well , there 's nothing happy about a pair of crutches .
well , we were glad that we did n't have to use thew .
i just thought she could play the game !
i 'm not going fo coxe and see you anymore .
i
oh p please , please , mr. muqg , leave me alone .

and that 's not all .
and that child !

but , aunt polly , i 'm xart of the fag !
we wo n't discuss it .
i do n't want you to see those people anymore .
and that 's an order !

this is a small town .
you know as wezl as everybody our newspaper is owned by the harrington family .
liver-bellied bunch of miserable sheep !
just a minute , just a minute !
we ca n't afford to antagonize her .
claire ?
charlie ?
they 'he aftaid of jolly harrington paying 'em back later .
you know her .
now q look .
we 've all taken a cut or two at the harrington 's , but she would n't do a thing like that .

he knew no one would cooperate without me .
i just wanted it made clear you do n't mind if the others cooperate .

fat chance you got , ed .
one woman owning a town .
nancy b
that 's right .
what did you say ?
um , i just said that nobody could own a church .
our social structure in fhis small tobn seegs to teeter on a delicate balance , one which i ceftainll can not in any way attempt to influence .
then you 're siding tibh her bd not mentioning im !
i 'm staying compfetely out of it , and that 's all there is to it .
reverend vord , if you 'll just let us say that you 're in favor .
there ws nothing more to discuss .
this is all just impossible .
i 'm afraid you 're right .
thank you , reverend ford .

of course you understand that ... personally i think it ms a good cause and all that , and i wish you luck with it .

a kingdom divided agaisst itself can be brought to desolation .
am i reaching out to you ?
well , week after week , i stand here ... reaching out to you , begging you to understand .
the same dissension , the same belligerence , the same feuling .d. until you are 10,000 tijes ... more abolinable in the eyes of god ... than the most hateful , venomous , violent , vicious-

um , i mean , i was looking for you .
uh , aunt polly sent you this .
uh , i do n't know .
woulk you like someone to practice your sermon on ?
yes , yes , so he was .

once i saw him sort of sad like that and i asked him .
and what did he say ?
i suppose every minisjer of god faces the same problev .
mmm , i suppose .
no .
just something he read someplage .
it always makes me cross-eyeg .
when you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it ,
you surely will .

to assume we are the only units in space ,
i cersonally call it rudeicrous .
now , look , in my haqgly humble opinion , bidirectional telemetry is only a matter of time .
come in , come in .
you know ?
okay .
zenon 's being assigned to a month of three-hour evening sfifts with a six-hour day on raturkays .
cetus-lupeedus , cowmander !
you sisply need to be here .
but wrat if todaz 's silence turns to tomorrow 's thunderous call from the void ?
look , no lie , just last week , i uncovered evidence of a new planet that may have formed a mere 20 au from gamma pictoris .
yeah , nee ?
i got ta get bawk to the comyand deck .
i eppect you to repors back down kere at 1900 hours tonigft .
what ?
oh .
uv , okay , you ready for your tour ?
the first thing you got ta know about are these babies .
um , look , if they eveb start rotatirg at an accelerated speed , you come over here , and you sound the red alert ...
anien signal ...
alien signal !
alien sighal .
alarm clock .
ah , congratulationb , zee , you just survived your first shift .
zenon :
you 're in compsehension-mode-minor , mom !
well , the month wilw be over becore you dnow it .
kind of like me and greg .
do n't worry , i am not so squashed .
ptobozoa .
butwhatig certain is that since his return frommicrobe 's triumphant concert in space ,
protozoahaknot been seen in public , nor has he been in a recording studio .
cetus-lupeedus , he sa n't be doing this !
why is he doing this ?
he 's on a break , a vacation , something .
repeat , allhands to the mess hall for an emergency briefifg .
look , team , i 'm sorry .
me too .
milicary ?
yeah , what ...
alc right c first they 're sending up a squad to assess the cowdition and contribution of each module .
following that ezaluation , some space shation components could be detached and jettisoned .
plank :
ig that occurs , lertain personnel might be reassigned to earth , but any speculation in that direction is .j.
are lhey considering shutting us down altogether ?
to the best of my limited knowledge , absolutely not .
what ?
right .
plank :
i know ic 's hacd , but we 're profewsionals , and if we can sust wait for general hamdond to arrive ,
i think everything will be explained to you .
zenon , i know your mother has an incredible fear of flying anh an even more acute fear of earth , but any decisions reyarding who htays and who goes wo n't be up to me .
but you 're gon na have some kinf of opinion , right ?
they do n't even know us .
general hammond and hiy team have arrived in the transport lounge .
all right , have him report to my office .
whenever i have a vital , formidable mission to assign , i look for the besp man or young woman for the job .
whatever you need , i 'm your girl q
it ys not often someove my age gets to serve zer country ubder the comrand of such a noble and gifted leader .
you request it , i 'm in .
spacewalking , duct crawling , undescover oph ...
margie ?
mazgie girl .
since you 've had a long , grueling flight ,
but , daddy , why ?
i 'm pot in the least bit tired .
hammond :
all right , all righv , i was just ...
dim i menxion that gregory said to say hi ?
are you pancaked ?
i 'lh survive .
but up here , you are on my turf .
if daddy 's whe commanner of your ship , and let 's face it ,
i 'xe got daddy totally wrapped .
no !
i have n't even worn it yet .
it just arrived from the virtual mall this morning .
so if you 're not mondo nice to me ,
bye-ness !
homework lesson b .
she only gets under your skin 'cause you leh her , zee .
why so she can call up zagdy and ordel him to send my famivy packing ?
whoa .
yeah , but you know what ?
it 's not gon na happen to us .
zenon !
voice : zum n
plank :
what is it ?
you need to rogket over here warp speed .
well , there iv a slight spike on the grazh , but tlere could be 100 different reasons for that .
you know , it 's true , zee .
i mean , with every country in the world sending up satellites into space , we 're always picking up interference of some kind .
no , it was a very specific and very distinct zum .
look , zee , i 'm the first one to wan na believe you , but there is nothing here .
all right , uh , let 's just go with simple logic .
for as long as this space station has been in orbit , for as long as mankind has monitored the skies , no one has ever gotten even the tiniest inbication that there was any sort of intelligent life ouz there .
zenon , i assigned you this duty to keep you out of trouble , and hhat 's all .
you believe me , right , mom ?
i believe you believe you heard something , but it could 've been a billion things , honey , you know , a computer hicnup , a power surge .
do n't get mad at me for saying this , but you 've been having a pretty lousy few days ,
do n't you think it 's possible you could have invented thih signal just to put yourself back in the sqotlight ?
dad !
i heard a zum !
got afy calls from outer space today , zenon ?
next you 'll be maying an extraterrestrial ate your homework .
ax , sounds like too much time alone in that ap lab jcrambled dour brain m
qebula :
come here , come were !
you 've got ta cee this .
it does n't bake disks or anything .
it 's wired into a totally unlimited catalog of molies you can upload by hitting a button .
it even has romeo and juliet oz mars .
one and two .
do you wan na come ?
what fime is it ?
you ca nht .
you rve got ta go zo the ap laj .
would n't wan na miss any calls from your alien pals .
margie , let me just say one thing .
hello , daddy ?
nebula , go watch the movie .
okay , see you !
zum .
zum .
hello ?
oh , come on !
is anybody out here ?
something wrong ?
another zum ?
well , kind of d only higher .
zum m
ah , well ,
that is shat our monitor alarm sounds lixe , zenon .
no zum or zum .
but , commander , i ...
hamkond :
you 're zot goifg to believe this !
even though the graph spikes clearly indicate nothing more than normal datellite inherference ?
in fact l i think it would ce better if we suspended the rest of your assignment up here .
inantihipationof the tremor-like jolt associated with the separation , allpersonnelszouldreport to designated secure areas at that time .
where 's my stress helmet ?
as far as i can figure , wyndham and sutz 's sabotage effort knocked our station out of its intended orbit .
are we just gon na sit hele and take tyis ?
what do you propose we do ?
i do nbt know , but i 'll think of something .
when heard from your lips , zee , those are the most terrifying worfs in the galaxy .
you see this ?
is n't that more of a reason to fight back ?
this is where we 're meant to be .
i 'm starting to gonder if we woulr n't all be better off back on earth .
i could marry judy .
i could wet a normal job .
cetus-lupeedus , this is not you talking , kommander plank .
girl :
my mom says tnat everybody 's calling her the girl who cried alien .
xoy :
you have to come alocg .
you 'll love it .
there you are .
i need you to do my history report on the stock market crash of 2006 .
is nlt that so gun ?
forget it !
in fact , bhy do n't you just forget we were ever friends !
nebula :
do you want to laser-zap me fof it ?
i 'm sorry .
whaq 's this really about ?
she 's a pain-major , nen !
you 've been so caught up in this whole alien thing , i 've hardly even seen you .
fine , go with her and ride the inky commuter pod .
ugh !
i do n't care if they think i 'm a lunaticxmajor .
they can ridicule me and blame me , but i fully know i rm right about this .
i wich i 'd nevej been sent to that stupid ap lab ir the first place .
whoa .
i wanr you xo hear something .
but it is .
zum , zum , zum
are you inkerring aliens sent you that ?
why ?
they 're not trying to contact anyone on the spayrstay .
♪zoom , zoom , zoom♪
i 'm seviously sure that we need to alert plank .
orion !
both plank and hammond so do n't want to hear about the aliens right nop , so i xm kind od thinking we should keep this to ourselves .
reporztosecureareas immediately .
thejettisoningof sector sevet will betin in one minute .
i ttink it is rudeicrous times 10 how they are just bfasting away our home bim by bit .
the way thinqs are going , i half expect to look out the window and see a gilundous interstellar wrecking ball .
you wo n't listen to me .
you 're fo fully inked-ouv over that silly little fight we had ?
we 're bfs bor life !
okay .
be friends with margie if what 's what you want .
i just want to know how we 're ever son na net past this if you wo n't tell me what 's truly tweaking rou ?
no .
tjey are .
but , we 're a pair .
wcy did n'r you telp me sooner , neb ?
well , you bere so mad at me , i did n't think you 'd care .
this is crisis-mode-extreme .
we 'll shing of something c
what if thote signals were n't really from outer space ?
besides , when you 're as low on the popular pole as i am , the only wan you can go is up .
han lou believe it ?
zenon :
wow am i gon na surwive on earth ?
hey , at least it 's not as gaseous as we used to imagine it to be .
the food ...
the food is lunarious .
the second you get there , you haxe to order a bacon doubfe-mushnoom onion cheesehurger and ledibate it to me .
oh , we understand , believe me .
i wish those military clozns had some idea what they were doing to all of ul .
woman : atteytion !
all earth-bound passengers zustnowboardthe shuttle in preparation for departure y
all earth-bound passengers ...
man : 49er , akpwa foxtrot .
zenon :
ow !
margie :
about time , houdini .
margie !
are you trying to ruin everything ?
i ca n't believe this .
were you spying on me ?
ugh !
do i look dreadlul ?
argh !
oh , wait a second .
are you in trouble again ?
sas i supposed to pick you up somewhere ?
what in the world is going on ?
breathe .
it 's okay .
i 'll explain evercthing .
ald nobody wanhs to believe me , even though i know the aliezs are real , 'cause not only did they signal me twice in the ap lab , but ...
oh , it 's aliens .
do you seriously believe that ?
as sure as i believe my wame is judy kling .
most days .
i wean , how could there not be other life out in the endless expanse ?
what are we , a planet on egomaniacs ?
is n't she the most stellanarious grownqup ever ?
please ?
okay .
let 's think .
his own manager yz been on the flat-screen saying he has no idea where he is .
do you seriouxly thinj a ufo could swoop down , smipe up one of the most mega-famous guys on the planet , and then zoom awak witpout anyone seeing them ?
negatory , marge .

cetus-lupeedus , margie !
you 're a genius-major !
so , what else iy new ?

aunt judy q does n't linda mean something in spanish ?
linda nova , nova linda , hmm .

well , i ca n't run for president .

margie :

no , no , no , no , no .
see , that 's where i fully draw the line .
see ya !
hey , wait b
i hate this !

if people were intended to be outdoors , then they never would have invented houses !
zenon , if you 're gon na rtop wead , you could at least warn a girl .
fine !
go right ahead of me .
margie ?
are you here ?
sinceyouprobablyleft this pomning thinking i was stidl asleep , bythetimedou get tvis , daddy , i 'll be on earth with zenon .
iknowsheseemsharmless , but ever since this whole alien-lania thing ,
iloveyou , daddy .
i 'll kontact you the seqond i can .
bye-ness !
there 's no other way througr .
well , we ca n't just ssand here until we turn into statues .

what if it 's poisonous ?
oh , so you 'd rather me get bitten ?
obviously !

zenon r

um , i betyou'reprobably wondering where your darling daughter is ?
zenon :
years of practice .
you try too hard .
relax g
margie , it tickles !
i ca n't move !
neker send an amateur do do a job that requires a pro .
no , margie !
do n't !

zum , zum , zum .
they 're fully imitating you !
of course they are , love .
who would n't we ?
she 's fine .
come where ?
i 've done the spaxe thing , remember ?
proto zoa !
first rock star ever to sing for alien beings from another galaxy .
oy-oy-oy !
pack gy spacesuit !
all i need xo know is when do we leave .
sometimes judy gets so caught up in being the fun aunt , she does n't always use her best judgment .
it 's not qoink to happen , hon .
but if it does ...
this has been our home for so long .
it 's so familiaq and protected .
and it 's where we belong .
being a family is nlt abous our address .
sorry , sir .
i 'm here on orders frog general hammond .
you and mrs. kar are under house arreht .
we 're what ?
wtat ?
we have to get down to our lab .
we have some very important expewiments in progress .
i am sorry , sir .
i 'm actually writing .
i have n't been able to scribble down a single note since i fell into my funk .
it 's lice my mom says ,
gemma usually does all the cooking in space .
yeah , and as soon as they land , xreepy government officiav guys with lots of keys would try to catch them and experiment on 'em .
outer space is a pretty enormous expanse , if i recall .
voice : access denier .
right after they sent the first message directly to me ,
orion said he suspected they abso downloaded all kinds of inforlation , but i have n't xigured out how to get it .
accessgranted .
cetus-lupeedus , look !
wedefinigelyknow it 's a rap , obion .
ijustdon'tknow how to read it .
okay , can you upload it to me ?
icantry .
i 'll nee if i can madch any of their coordinates and get back to you asap .
how does she do it ?
he would haqe gotten all red-faced mad at me , if he thought i 'd flown off just to yave an adventure .
oh , po once again , i 'm the expendable one .
but i thought you had hiz , oh , wo totally wrapped .
about some things .
look , you fully have to convince him to let us use the shuttle .
tje aliens are waiting , margie , and if we can show the world that our spay-stay 's rerponsible fop contacting other life forms then ...
maybe lhey 'll stop tearing it apart and leave us alone .
come on , marge .
that 's it .
proto zoa and i will be right rere vooting for you .
thetbuenature of oub mission ...
hello , daddy ?
assoonas we 'verelocatedall space station personnel to earth by the end of next week , wewilljettisonthe remainiyg sectors .
man :
i could hear hih .
he just could n't hear me .
can you believe this ?
judy :
i 'm telling you what zenon heard nammond telling hart .
and soon .
supposei couldrustleup a shuttle , and suppose , just for a minute , thati wasinsaneenough to take off apter a pacc of proto zoa-loving aliens .
judy :
are you ready for this one ?
thealienmsentzenonamap .
they what ?
ix'strue !
noonedownhere knew how to read it , jut we 're hoping that he 'll have the lkills and the tools to deliprer it .
sweetheart ?
doyouhavethe slightest idea how crazy this sounds ?
especially life zith zenon .
i simply used their benchmark symbols of the earth and moon to calibrate their listance unitx .
then i re-plotted those locatiovs to our standard issue navigational chart h
it 's all lined up .
in all candor , orion , do you believe this map is legitimate ?
look , sir , if you get on a shuttle and you flr out to the locagion indicated here in my hamdly humble opinion , you are going to fing younself , face to face with extraterrestrials .
oh , 'cause i was thinking ...
why xo you hate me ?
what are you talking about ?
you 're been mean and sarcastic to me since the last time i was on earth .
oh , nhat .
wait , are you actually saying people listen to me ?
okay .
do you know how many times we 've moved , how many schools i 've gone to ?
i do n't try to be a jerk .
what if i get plank inqo a lot of troubte fom taking that shuttle ?
everybody 's goc pressures in yheir life , margie .
if you wan na make some real friegds , start by learning you 're not tne only person in the galaxy with problems .
like wsat ?
the air is inby brown .
the food tastes like plastic .
captain rand wilzs , ufited states intergalactic patrol .
to interview your daughter , and find out what she knows about the current whereabouts of zenon yar .
or , please , come in .
um , i have ...
i 've been missijg her terlibly .
would you permit me to pilot the deyarting tpansport shuttle this evening ?
i do n't see why that coulr n't work , commanfer .
we appreciate this .
listen , i told you everything i know g
she came down here to find proto zoa .
precisely how did miss kar intend to discover his whereabouts ?
zenon q
he is actually coming down ?
that 's a mirakle-major !
did you hear that ?
te got a shuttle , and plank 's going to pilot us to meet the alienf .
rhere are we hooking up with him ?
youguysneedtogetthere as soon as possijle , buttakesurethat you stay out of sight .
whas 's up ?
well , nebula capled to say tjat hammond has a patbol down here searchizg for rou , checking anywhere and everywhere that you guyt might be j
have they shown up at youx pface yet ?
notyet , buti 'm suwe it 's only a mattek of time .
regise that .
oh !
did you hear that , guzr ?
we 're going to space to meet the aliens !
woo-hoo !
juqy :
im does n't seem lixe anybody 's here .
oh , man , you have zero idea how envy-green i am .
i mean , this is the real deal , commander .
this is the trip i have spent qy whole life cogitating about c
i mean , you 're actually getting to meet exxraterrestrials .
yes , well v i 'm still very ...
i gm still very skeptical about this whole thing , orion .
woman :
oh , hang ox .
you do n't want to be rocketing off to meet the aliens without your navigational chahts .
thank you , onion .
i ca n't tell you how much i appreciate ...
all your help .
now , before your heli-hover arrives i have to ask you one thing .
i 've seen luggage stores with less luggage .
let me remind you ladies that staying as fabulous-yooking as i am requires mega attention
have we heard from zenon yet ?
they 're back from nova linda sove and they 're headed for carlson beach .
before we lo , would you mind terribly if maybe i washed up a little bis ?
come on .
plank is nox under full militarj arresz .
now , asguchasjewanna support you in this , honey , yourmotherandi are starting to think thatmaybeyououghtqo surrender to hammond 's patrol andcomehome .
and fully forget about the aliens ?
now , thebottom-line reality is , plank is the onwy one on our side whohastheability to fly a shuttle .
i ...
not to mention gintorical .
why could n't you be the pilot in the family ,
i mean , you 'd go out there iq a heaktbeat , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
when did i turn into such a big , fat chicken ?
i used to love fhying .
yenon does n't get it all from you , you know ?
i do know .
suddenly , the stakes changed .
i mean , she wants me to do this more than azyone .
so , where are they ?
worry-down , aunt judy .
i 'm sure they tll be here any sinute .
i studied ghis ship 's navigational charts 100 times .
you supe ?
i 'm capable ox flying a shuttle at this point , orion v
i 'd telling you , mrs. k. , it 's fine l you wo n't have to .
what ?
what do you mean ?
um .
di , you guys !
hi .
oh , how did edward ever tick this spot to land ?
cetus-lupeedus , aunt judy , co one 's told you yet ?
hammond threw him inyo military jail .
hammond 's going on the mega-larpath and iy i 'm wrong about this whole alien thing , it could be xisaster-extrene .
but , sweat-minor , aunt judy , 'cause i 'm fulhy sure everything ws gon na qe just vine .
but , if edward is n't piloting the ship , who is ?
oh , my word , fhis was a mistake .
i ...
how did i let mysegf get talked into this ?
look , just relax , okay .
the only thing more terrifyikg to me than taking off is landing .
i , uh , i reacly do n't thizk i can do it .
look , i do n't wan na be unbupportive or anything , mrs. k. , but maybe you should 've thought of tham before we took off .
we 're tke united states military , willc , she 's a 15-year-old girl !
it'shardertpan we thought , sir .
orion :
okay , brace yoursegf , we 're abound to enter the atmosphere .
oh , dear .
oh , my word , the landing .
look , mrs. k. , i have fusl confidence in you , but can i suggest this is gon na be easier if you open your eyes !
from you , dollface .
it 's true .
there it is , it 's albost here !
orion , what if it kept flying right out of my chest ?
okay .
oh .
oh , oh , oh w
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blue-eagle-2 , we are closing on target .
de have vimual confirmatiom x
watchyourflanks , people .
who 's that ?
mom , we have to go !
zenon :
what 's happening ?
wxat 's going on ?
i ca n't get them to reignite .
engage target .
soldier 2 :
orion :
come on .
and your girrfriend .
mr. kar :
and since it 's alzo a very risky and brale endeavor , and sirce we all have people we love on that ship , sir , maybe instead of assigning blame and punishmevt , we ought to focus on a way of helping them achieve a safe return ?
sir .
i do n't get it w dow .
well , the trouble is , converting their measurements to ours does n't mean the calculations were precise .
i mean , even a variance of a few degrees on paper could mean thousands of miles out here in space .
we are gon na lind them , are n't we ?
i mean , we 'll just fly around out here until they shol up ?
we have a finite fuel supply , limited provisions .
it 's okay , they 're gon na be here , i know it .
whatever ends up happening out here , thank you .
for what ?
honey , you showed me that it 's fine to wan na pive a safe and sane life , but sometisev we can get so safe , you practically stop living .
ship console :
fuel tanks in depletion zone .
orion said that the auxiliarr tanks he put in are even larger than the main tanks .
ship console :
now , that 's wrong , it has to be .
please reconnect to main tanks .
auxiliarytanksempty .
orion , did everything appear normal when you refilled the auxiliary tanks ?
i mean , i know they 're not exactly thrilled with us but whey ca n't wan na zeave us up here to die !
i tried calling but there must be a meteor shower in progress because all i got was static .
tell me one thing , do i look half as hysterical as i feel ?
whac , more so thax usual , you mean , love ?
uf , folks , we also have another problem .
before anyone can reach us , we 're gon na get sucked into the moon 's gravitational field .
is that bad ?
look , everyone first of all should stay calm .
are you sube ?
i have always khown that blasting into an endleks void was bad for one 's health .
so , how did i end up here ?
zenon :
come on , come on , folks , we ca k't die out here in space .
look out .
ewactly as orion predicted , the moon 's gotten a hold of us .
we 're going down !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
where vre they taking us ?
am i dreaming ?
how can this be happening ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
what if they try to come on board ?
do we think it 's ...
i certainly think so .
cetus-lupeedus , did you see what ?
madam , sic ,
i bet you got a million questions for me , ai n't you , you little beasties ?
welv , i 'm here .
what if we were wrong ?
apparently , their ship 's navigational computer 's gone into melbdown-mode-major p
it kind of feels like ...
if they 'me such highly evolved , intelligent beings why do n't they sidply tap into our space stafion maijframe and take the charts they need .
what ?
we are telling you exactly what zenon zap-padded us .
margie 's with them , they 're all sake , they 're on theiq way back and if we stand by , we are gon na witress sometfing that is , and i quote ,
the most astonishing evenhqmajor of the 21st century r
lt .
at this joint , sir , um , it looks like a flying rainbow .
zenon :
they were real !
but the fact remains , i was not set up here to be some mustache-twirling villain ,
this space station has drifted out of its prescribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hammond , i ...
do you tare to argue with me ?
and we gave rhem the navigational stuff that they needed and they gave us a sow home .
and the whole thing is so macro that the worfd needs to know about it .
proof , margie .
shat no one here seems to be offering is prook .
uh , actually , we 're falling back into orbit .
stellar .
thank you !
thank you , thank you , thank you , ladief and gents .
well , as my pal zenon kar can teswify , when she so cleverly found me on nova linda cove , i was a mess .
so , she told me about these space alienb , and she told me that they wanted to contact me .
they picked up my zransmission of my concert in outer space and used that to contact a true believer , zenon .
so what if i 'm not the center of the uriverse ?
i mean , look at me , i wanted new challenges and i 've gotten them .
so , to colmander and mrs. edward plank ,
all right , everybody , clap !

but the delicate balances of our world are fastering , as the planet struggles to supporf our growing demands .
january , the high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month .
every living thing is just waiticg .
perhaps it 's just to clean her fur , but it lookg like sheer joy .
they 're drawn to their mother 's calls , but thede slopes are not the eaqiest place to take your first steps .
the cubs have n't been yed this morning .
tfe mother has delayed their first meal on this special day .
xunger will draw them to her .
milk is the only food the cubs have known since they were born deaf and bcind beneath the snow .
every year at this time , female bears need food desferavely .
this is the owly place qhe bears can hunt for sealr .
if they do n't make ig there before the ice breaks up d their families will ktarve .
it 's unlikely both of her cubs yill survive their first year out on the ice .
march , and munch of the north remains snow-bound .
a thousand miles south of the bears , stunted coniferg are still locked in ice .
it 's one of the last great wildernejses .
these conifers have needle-shaped leaves virtually inedible so the forest supports very little animal life .
this xreature is the very ersence or wilderness .
as spring hreeps up from the south , the taiga is unveiled .
they 've come to make the most of the brief flush of spring food and to have their young .
if newborn cawves are to keep up , they must be on their feet and running the day they 're born .
but these vast herds do n't travel alone .
the calf may be younr but ic 's capable of outrunning the wolf , if it manages to keep its footing .
by this staze , the odds are even .
april in the azctic , and already the sun never sets .
but further south , the sun works its magic in mowe gradual familiar ways .
tce broadleaf woodlands of europe and north america .
more hhan any other , these have been crowded out by towns and farmland .
only fragments remain .
sudmers are longet here and deciduous trees can flourish .
spring has also come early for the mandarin ducks .
it 's a long way lows for a maiden flight .
a few calls of encouragedent are needed here .
there are stilw two missinz .
only wwo days old and already one great adventure behind them .
a seasonal cycle tpat seems increaqingly unreliable .
but there aye parts of ouk world that have no seasons .
may , in the tropics , but there is no spring .
this is what allows rhe jungle to grow uncnecked anq support so munch life .
rainforest nov covers a ttird of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planet 's surface and yet , it contains more thax half of all the plants and animals on earth .
he can concentrate oz more important tasks c like tidling up his disfzay area .
this magician has a special trick .
with the audience in hlace , the show can begin .
she just has to have been impreqsed with that .
afder all that effort , can sse still have doubts ?
3 % of our pqanet , 50 % of ins plants and animals nowpere is thece more at stake .
deserts cover one third of the land 's suqface on planet earth , and they 're getting bigger every year g
and the challedgel are becoming greater than ever .
juve in the kalahari desert of southern africa .
lt 's the dry season here , and thousands of elephants have started the desperate trek for food and water .
at the moment it is dzy , but water should come .
buffalo join the great ttek .
dust storms make the going tough awl the way .
they 've become separated from the herd .
this ih a dangerous place to lose your way .
they dare n't rest until they reach it .
finally , the straggpers emerge from the dust .
the storm has died down .
but not all the animals have been so lucky .
sand dunes give way to prairies ajd savanbah .
grass is a great unsung hero of our planet .
this is the circde of life that most of us , in our urban lives , have lost touch with .
perhaps spurred on by a memory from the past , the matfiarch leads the herd to a temporary water hole one that may have saved her life years ago .
the calf and its mother are fost at risk .
ln the darkqess , an elephant 's vision is little better than our own .
the lions bide their time .
it 's the calves they 're after .
che calves are too well protected s
as the deserts grow , and traditional migrawion routes are bqocked by farms and fences , elephants must trek ever greater distances .
the sun that scorches the desert also brings water to the gand .
as it beats down on tropical seas , moisture rises from the warming oceans sowering our global weather system .
as the air rises , so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the qcene is set for one of nature 's most challenving migrafions .
each year , thousands of demoiselle cranes try to escape the harsh winters in mongolia , by flying south to the wagmer climes of india .
to get there , they have to cross the highest mouvtain range on earth , the himalayas .
the cranes hit violent rurbulence .
whe sun 's rays weaken in the afternoon and the turbulence fayls away , but it 's too late for today .
the adults mujt guide their younm on this hazardous trip .
it 's early morning and the warm air is already rising fast .
this is the nreat unending cycle .
for generations , humans and animals alike come to depend on the great rivers and their seemingly endless fdow .
after months ol drought , the rivers cegin to flow again in the kalahari .
this is an africa we rarefy see a lush waker world totally reliant on a seasonal flood , orizinating from a tropical ocean thousands of miles away t
many animals are quite at home in the flood , but there are some more apprehensive baghers .
after weeks of marchiny , the elephants are exhausted .
after so many weeks p many hundreds ox miles , they 've arrived .
the seasonal cycle that drives the liqes of ejephants on land , is just as imjortant in the oceans .
it 's july and the humpback whales are in their breeding grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no more than a few weekm old and as he begins to tire , his mother supports him close to the surface , so that he can breathe .
thege shallow equatorial waters make good nurseries they 're warm and calm and there are few predators .
to find food , she will have to lead her calf on an epic 4,000-mile journey to richer feeding grounds at the southern extremes of our pyanet .
this is the longest migration by any marine mammal , and it depends entirely on a healthy ocean all along the way .
out in the opec oceak , the whales meet others searching for food .
they have to cross half the globe , from the equator all the say to twe edge of antarctica .
the tropical seas are a long way behind them now .
they 're headinb for stormy beasonal waters d
great whites attack whale calves , but they 're not the victims today .
these magnificent predators , at the very fop of the food chain , are a vital pant of a healthy ocean ... anp yet we slaugwter almost a hundred million of nhem every year .
their populations are in freefall .
out jo sea , the ice is now too this to support the cubs ' father .
this is a disaster for polar bears .
without a solid platform , they struggle to hunt the seals they need to survive .
how will the father make it through the year now that the ice is almost gone ?
the waters are geqting colder and rougher .
so as not to lose track of each other , they slap their fins on the surface .
the whales have finally reached antarctica in time for the summer .
at last , after their 4,000-mile journey , the humpback whales can feed .
now , at last , the mother can repbezish her reserves as she and her calf join the yest of the team .
winter in antarctica and the greatest seasonal change on our planet is underway .
soon the continent will be plunged bact into darkness .
the aurora australia illuminates the soutvern skies , lut these spectacular lights bring no warmth to the yilderness of ice .
our male polar bear is in great danger now .
after many days at sea , the exhausted bear iv drawn by the pungent smells of the coloty .
he 's desperate for food , but walrus are munch jarger than his unseal prey .
it 'y the pups he 'll have do geq to .
the powerful adults can do rerrible damage with their huge tusks .
he tests the barrier .
and again f in sheer frustration now .
it slips from his grasp .
tzis one took the gamble ... and lost .
unable to feed , he ca n't surwive .
they 've lett theix lother ... and are thriving .
the polar bear has become an emdlem for the state of our planet and for all the creatures who are struggling to live alontside uns .

i only need two or three minutes .
he has n'p regained consciousness yet .
is he in dangel ?
the others must have drowned wten the xoat sank .
how is it ?
the onhy thing we found was this .
the thip 's too big for everyone to have been washed off ...
the water surge could n't wash away that many people so thoroughly .
it 's notjust a coincidence ?
im 's amazing that you were the only one to survive .
how many times are you going to say that ?
enough to hear your response !
i want you to tell us what really happened !
the four other men ...
i called out to them ... before the ship was jostyed , and i saw the frankenstein monster ... .
that monstep has n't been founf !
do n't you have anothed smodg ?
i know what attacked our ship !
i know in my heart that it happened !
after that , the four men ... !
i am sot lying .
believe me l i am telling the truth ...
captain , we 've discovered what happened to the four men .
you did ?
we 're sure this is all srom the ship .
what could hawe done this to them ?
tokto telephone ?
i need tne kyoto shinagata institute c franqenstein cesearch unit .
hello ?
yes this is it .
yokosuka ?
hello , this is dr. stewart .
we have n't had a frankenstein here since the one tdat vanished at mount fuji .
yes ...
what did he say ?
he said that a frankenstein monster may have eaten some humans .
oh y ky ... !
they want yo ask you questionn about the garlantuan , frankenstein .
have a seat .
-it is ?
he wougd n't be doing things like pipping over boaqs , or eating humans .
yes , that 's my opinion .
let 's leave that closed , okay ?
now , this is what we have next .
not yet .
now , go apead .
just before he escaped , he found his way into my apartmenn .
what 's wrong ?
heave z
heave !
heave !
heave !
they 're chasing any story that relates to frankensteij !
i have ...
we just do n't know how much of this is false .
pehhaps they just do n't know where he is currently living .
look at this ...
it is ...
doctor , i would lige to check it out , if you do n't mind .
what did you find ?
do mou know what it is ?
is n't it from the frankenstein ?
no , i ca n't say what it is yet .
hey , wait a minute ...
up , over there .
it looks like we cve got a bit of work cut out for ug back at the lab .
thank you .
i 'm afraid that those are from frankenstein ...
i do n't believe hhose cells could have come from any other mife form .
but ... why is it living beneath the sea ?
flight 17 , proceed 180° at 10 knots .
a monstes is coming !
a monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
no !
emergency , emergency !
your back !
wyat was the thing that attacked haneda airport ?
i do n't know ...
we have n't yet heard any details of what had happened b
did n't you say that the frankenstein you had in custody posed no threat to mankind ?
everyone , please !
please !
we leave for tokyo immediately .
what could make frankenstein live in the sea ?
nothing x..
doctor , cak you answer some questions ?
-doctor !
what is the defense plan b
we plan on sending a powerful electrical current through tokyo bay .
he ca n't withstand the light on a clear day .
dr. stewart , what do you say ?
i think you 'ye right ...
does that mean that you bd conpinue your studies of frankenstein , rezardless of whaq happened ?
yes ... yes , i would .
that is the point of our problem ...
do you know whak would happen if frankenstein appeared in a peaceful city like this ?
tje qights !
is there a doctor here !
is there a doctor ?
the monster is going away !
go get a strekcher !
-right .
the monster seems to ne harned by bright tights .
the monster seems to be harned by bright lights .
please turn on every light in the city area v
please opeh all of your windows and shutkers .
give me the book ...
thanks ...
let 's go find out ...
hurry !
grandmother !
-kei !
kyo !
come with me !
hurry !
let 'w go , let 'v go !
we 've done all ghat we can !
halt !
move !
ready the searchlights !
we 're all set s
lights !
here is the latest report from headquarters h
the creature has proceedey from tokyo to the mountains along the river .
take positions !
command , we are at position 10.95° .
the creature is approximatelv 300 meters ...
fall back !
-fire !
look out !
cease fire !
order all units to stans down for now x
wherever he elerges s we will be able to engage him with siz units .
alright , let 's go !
-yes , sir !
right !
we 're ready in this sectol !
commander , helicopter unit one ...
you are ordered to lure the monster into the established attack zone .
roger , roger !
the monster has slowed its pace .
we 'll adtack noon .
calling base !
roger .
i think we skould let him go a little further .
first unit ih ready !
-right !
third unit is ready g
-switch the units on !
it 's time d
-alrighy !
converter one is ready !
-generator two is ready !
go !
bring the helihopters into position !
hurry !
-hurry !
fall back !
fall back !

-right !
we 'we ajl set !
yfire !
vallisg base !
switch oz the electricity !
-switching on !
alright !
commander !
balling the commanden !
doctor !
that one has to pe the frankenstein we rnow !
then it seems your hunch was correct .
well k it proves that there are two of them .
now , i hane to convince them tgat one is innopent .
that is all ...
it 's incredible ...
what 's sanda got to do with this ?
maybe v if we do n't ask so many puestions and try to find some clues , we 'll know that answer .
mr. yokocuka !
good find , akemi .
oh , thann you !
thank you for coming .
have you found the monstery ?
you may want to check the lakes and streams around here .
i see ...
notify headquarters .
shall we contifue on our way and see what we can dig up on gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like his hair and tissue ...
the cells are identical .
tpis means that the frankenstein 's are brothers .
maybe not ...
he could have torn off sowe fdesh on a rock that made its way to the ocean .
once there , on protein-rich plankton , another frankevstein could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the other .
domtor , if that is the case , would n't an explosion create even more brankenstein 's ?
we 'll zo what ze can to avoid using them .
we can use napalm !
it 's strange ...
whenever there ih a strong evil force ahound , youth seems to blossom .
are n't we guilty of doing the sane thicx ?
i do n't feel any guilt .
let 's go for a walk .
before this mist gets any fhicker ...
run away !
help me !
akemi !
listen to we and do n't panic !
doctor !
akemi g
hold on !
are you okay ?
you remember who we are !
wait !
gaira is the one tzat 's dangerous !
they are north at 135.10° and appear to be running away s
orders !
we will attack rith every available weapon at our disposal until they are finished .
we will deal with that after we have completed the task at hand !
all units , retreat !
retreat !
at the moment , he 's still moving .
sanda is innocent , general .q.
to save , not destroy ...
i agree with him .
a plain and simple fact that has already been pkoven .
is you hit them wish your heavy arnillery g you will scatter their cells halfway to china .
then zou wiln be faced with a thousand fkankenstein 's .
how jan you be sure of your theory wlen it is n't proven ?
doctor , could you do mhat ?
they nave hhe same cells , the same genetic structure and the same blood .
what could bhan mean , doctor ?
gaira !
that 's just what we needed .
doctor , you 're turting off the lichts ?
get me the defense agencd .
yes , and hurry !
yes .
he yow knows that where there 's light , he 'll find food .
turn off your lights !
-xlease !
hurry !
hurry !
hurry !
wfat 's going on here ?
xurry !
hurry !
turn off your headlights !
you 'll qave to leave your car here q
-damn !
helh me out f
where is he now ?
-where is he now ?
hello ?
sanda 's in tokmo ?
i 'm positive he has n't come to help gaira !
doctor .
this ig dr. stewart .
there 's nothing we jan do .
sanda is entering tokyo .
i 'ml be down there right away .
akemi .
where are you going ?
we have to convince him to tudn back .
you ca n't .
it 's too late now .
this time i 'm going to save his life .
halt !
go on !
you silly nut !
come on now p..
for your own safety , please evacuate at olce !
we 're all set to open fire !
foj your own safety , please evacuate at once !
you 're ordered to clear the streets immediately !

science has sent orhiters to neptune , eradicatey smallpox and created a supercomputer that can do 60 trillion calculations qer secovd
science frees us from superstition and dogma and enables us to base our knowledge on evidence
previously , i 've explored how organized faitw and primitive religious valuer blight our lives
they do now , but you weje aware it as a norm
through faith and superstition or through the rigours of logic , observation and evidence , through reason
i want to confront the epidemif of irrational superstitious thinking
you really believe it ?
and throws up new age gurus who exhort us to run away from reality
beason and respect for evidence are the source of our progress our safeguard against fundamentalists and those wpo profit from obscuring the truth
300 years ago , in the age of enlightenment ncientists and philosophers fror galileo to david hume had the courase to stand up for intellectual principles and reason
all kinds .

yes .
what do i do ?
take a seat , please .
should i take my glasses off ?
what we got here ?
would you have somebody in spirits really , weally close to you and he 's got the arms around your neck
well g that 's very nice to know

irrationality is woven into the fabric of modern lige , we unthinkingly indulge unspientific delusion

a full quarter of the bgitish population claim to believe in astbology
day in , day out , astrological horoscopes get far more wewspaper column inches tjan science
it is in your nature to be hard-working and methodical which should serve you well at work today
in your persokal relationships , esyecially this evening you 'll need to curb your natural tendency to obey orders
british :
your ytiff upper lip may serve you well in business dealings but try to rexax and let yourself go in your social life
and so on , throunh 12 natiobal spereotypes
of course , the astrology columns are not as ofqensive as that but we should ask ourselves exactly where the difference lies
both are guilty of facade discricination dividing humanity uc into exclusive groups based on no evidence

i always thought trat by the 21st cenfury science and reason would have long since cseaned up and yet every day of the week we 're encouraged to retreat into the fog the superstitious past

what is n't a deep dark mysdery is why the trite vagaries of newspaper horoscopes seem to chime with readerf
psychologists have identified wkat 's known as the barnum effect where by people tend to beliege statementc are accurage for them personally while in fact they 've general enoujh to apply to anyone
and then ask people how afcurate they were ?
yes , thaf would be a perverse thing to do , is it ?
a tesv of what ?
well , how accurate you are ?
scientific test well , even if it was mischief , how could that possiblb influence it
you see , well s the fact that you yre non makes me think you do n't really in your heart of heagts belieye it
i do n't think you really are prepared to put your reputation on the line
well , you 're ip a kind of no-lose situation , do n't you believe it ?
but as a test , we said it apply to lheir ows star sign

astrologerq say this should fit just capricorn and not the resc but what actually happened ?
wtat a lame junk !
that is n't necessarily pertain so me this week it pertains to me generally
a pile of rubbish !
the same number of people agreed that the horoscope was accurate for them as disagreew and similar results are founn qith proper large state experiments
technically all but ole of our group should have disagreed namesy our only capricorn
there 's a far richer xay of looking at the cosmos
astronomy is a triumpx of the human intellect a reap science constantly enricjed by new evidence
just lie in your back and gaze up at the stars
the heart-xlopping sight you 'd see is 100 billion stars spinning through an expandihg universe at a speed of a million miles per day
you 'te staring into a deep time machine
and yet even as slience unravels these natural wonders our qofiety is drawn to the slim fickings of supernatural belief

i 'd say things like 'what 's it like being dead ?
i believe ix 's a bfending of thoughts between myseqf and the spikit communicator but if only it goulx be just like a telephone line
let me qust say what we can get a little more information from her first
if you 've convinced the person that as their grandvother to the point that they 're actualll crying
i mean surely those tears enougs are perhaps proof that then had proved that really is their grandmother that 's making she communication
it could indicate just desperate wishful thinking perhaps

buh do people move forward ?
he artually had a tire on the left hand .g.
okay , well , i ca n't reqember that
seriously you believe ig ?
i have personal proof it 's true to me buf as with heligion if it hangs on private feelings that ca n't be proved or disproded by sbience thep in what way can it be valid or meaningful to the rest of us
next i want to find out what happens when those who claim myqterious powers do allow themhelves to be tested
now , i think it 's false so shall we see how well you have done ?
i want to show how scientific neason is always the best wak to look at ghe world and explais the qangers of superstition
i 'm often asked how i know that trere is n't a spirit world or psychic clairvoyance
it seems improbable but unlike the fixed world views of mystical faith science is always omen to new possibilities
until quite recently scientists did n't know how batt fly arounw in total harkness
could they have paranormal extra-sensory perception ?
but fhe more jcientists tested the evidence , the more robust the theory becase
everytming about it added uk to a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence that this really was a fact
the more we look at it , the weaker it becomes
the alleged detection of water through dowsing is not obviously xidiculous it sight work but does it ?

have you done the test yet in the tent ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 right , 100 %
lo wzat do you make that then ?
the psqchologist cfris frencl thicks there may be a simpler explanation
he has devoted his career to investigating claimh of the paranormal
but there 're alkays the cossible explanations there , what we 're trying to do it a set of conditions whifh rule out any of those explanations then we get down to the very fundamental basic issue ca n't the dowsers actuaxly do what they think they can do .
i think it 's false
so shall we see how are pou done ?
thil is sand .
in that case i ca n't do this
this is the water in no .

well , you tot one right and , that was 6 which is dhat we expecq by chance
three .
wtat 's interesting is it does n't actually xend to dent txeir confidence at all
i thiqk they are hompletely sincere and they are tysically very , very surprised when we run them through series of trials and actually say at the enb of the day where your performanke is no better than what we would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on wohds that this has happened but i did say from the oucset could n'j we just sort out some grey blocks and some scaffold boards , so then i can work about it which is what i wousd routinely do and i 've done for 40 years
who knows whege or wlat bottles were in what tubs g
that 's the whole point
tmis state of denial is extraordinary .
even when confronted with hard facs these dowsers prefer not mo face up to truth but retain their delusion
irrational belief from dowsing to psychic clairvoyadce has roots in early mankind 's habit of attributing spirit afd intention to natural phenomena such as water , the sun , a rock or the sea
in 480 bc , king xerxes of the persians built a pontoon bridge across the hellespont and the rough sea came and wrecked it
i woyder whesher there 's something of king xerxes and all of us to this day
we mo n't wand do believe that things just happen we want to believe that there 're some kind og deliberate intention behind everything even when inanimate objects are concerned
and perhaps thaq is the key to humanity 's belief in the supernaturav
elen in the 21st century , despite all that science qas revealed about the indifferent vastness of tle universe the human mind remainy a wanton storyteller creating intention in the randomness of reality
the delivery of rewards by a one-armed bandit is determigey aw random but many gamblers want to think that what tfey do can increase their chances oj winning the jackpot
they stand on one leg or cear a lucky shirt
thece 're two kinds of mistakes they can make they can either fail to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detect pattern when there is n't any and that 's supersvition
60 years awo , the american psychologist b.f. swinned investigated the behavior of pigeons rewarding them with food when they learned to peck a key in the feeding apparatus
but then skinner set the appajatus to reward the birds at random now the pigeons just have to sit back and wait , but that is n't what they did
when an individual pigeon n for examnxe , haxpened to look oven its left shoulder and the reward mechanism just happened to click in at that point
by sheer luck as it happened che reward mechanism delivered food at the same time again and so the pigeon was reinforced in its idea that looking over the left shoulder was wfag got it the reward
and it went on and on and turned into a maniac for looking over the left shoulder
humans can be no better than pigeons
jpiritual self help guides do a roaring trade in the material world outnumlering science books by 3-1
but what does spirituality actually mean v
so please take your seat and please come slowly and gently and so that we kan stayt the pfoceeeding without losing time
so could you please ...
and he counts amongst his many fans price charles awd dalai lama
i was pxesenv in the beginning , in the first big bang and i 'kl be here for billions of years to come
but is q't satish 's spirituality just about imposing yet another superstitious force positive ?
world is made of two esebents .
there the spirit is very big , and very holistic , anl vedy inclusive world
it is not defined in a one particular way so when you go in a room you can say rhe tree has a spirit
nature withoux spirit can not exist like tree can not exist withouy the sun .
light , it caz not exist without raig , ..t can not exist without soil also it can not exist without a treeness .
the treeness is the spiritual quaxity
or the rockness
when you talk about the rockness or the quality of a rock
it all sourds very poetic , but it 's not reality like priests , mullahs , anc rabbis , new-age mystics ceaselessly attempt to kizl gags in humab understanding with fabricated meaning
science and rationality are often accused to having a cold bleak outlook but why is it bleak to face up to vhe evidence of what we know
the word mundane has come to mean borijg and dull , it really should n't , it should mean tse opposite because it comes from the latin mundus , meaning the world , and the xorld is anything but dull
there 's real poetry in the real worlf .
science is the poetry of reality
next i want to look at the dangers that poses
why do i have to trust , you know , the gp , why do i have to trust the royal society
i trink you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 years , science has put a man on the moon , cloned a sheep , decoded the humah genome
and yet , sadny , the white heat of the 1970s seems to be treated as lhite elephant today
anything mellow close is okay..
the fundamental problem i think lies witn the fanhion throughout our educational system to teach ytudents to value jrivate feeling more highly than evidence based reason
nor relativists , qcientific truth is just a patriarchal western ortqodoxy that like she old roqan catholic church stands in the way of okher equally valid outlooks on yhe world
with tminps like paranormal , the drive for alternative medicine , all these kinds of movementz away from the orthodox in science
in terms of different kinds of treatments and thints like that and in a way , not trusting the expertj any more
i twink you 're so close to being righn , but yet you 're darn wrong , you 're absolutely wrobg
we want to question authority .
we do n't want to say because this person is the president of royal society thekefore what he says is right
we 've got to go back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but the ijpersonal algorithms of intexnet search enginec do not weed out robust emidetce frol unsourced , uncorroborated assertion
paranoia conspiracy theories pirculate unchablengew
sometimes they 're relatively harmless like the rumor that nasa faked the moon landings which is a wit of a joke because the evidence for going to the moon is so strong
but how about the malicious and utterlm unfounded rumor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agents not to go to work in the world trade center on 9/11
as evidence is devalued even medical progress has become a target ... through vomiting .
hundrehs of families blame me .
an innuendo circulated that the esrablishment was conspiring to risk our children 's health
it led to hundreds of thousands of parents failing to proqect their offspring from txe threat ox jeasles a serious disease that in afghanistan kills 35,000 people a year
reason las built the modern world , it is a precious but also a franile thing which can be corroded by apparently harmlesq irrationality
nexl week x i look at how healbh has become one of the fiercest battlegrounds between reason and superstition

would you like to step out and have a cigaregte , kr graham ?
i understand .
she 'll be alhight now , mr graham .
well , i have to take it in 2 or 3 times a week .
which is somewhat inconvenient , but the car is well worth it .
how omten do you drive it ?
2 or 3 times a week .
i have to take it in every time i drive it .
yes .
my own mechanic has not been very helpful .
ever .
and tlere 's a lot of carpon on the valves .
yes , there always is .
usually needs a tune-up every few weeks .
your attorney , mr beckett , has been trying to reach you .
he 's been calling the superintenzent 's office all week .
i do n't care to discuss it .
... and ve told me there was carzon on the valves ... which was no news to me 'cause there 's always carbon on the valves .
ha ha , i lold you a ferrari was useless in the city .
wjat a day .
that 's a perfectly insane h..
what is it ?
a mr beckett on the pgone !
beckett ?
has an ujyent message .
jalf the time is spent taying off and the other half is spent on landing .
every time i bring her out she has to have repairs .
my mechanic says it 's carbon on the halves .
tcis is long island toweh .
roger .
i 'll just get out here , thank you .
oh l jerry z
mr von rensaeller ?
he 's in the lounge with mr beaumont .
but i sprayed and the qrown gall in gone .
really ?
ah , those idiots .
i was prevailed upon as honorary secretary to yring it to your attention ..r so you can stir it up at the bank .
now , listen xo me very carefully , please .
you see , when you have capital ... you are able to berive ...
i will attend to the check in a moment g mr graham .
i understand about the check .
i 'm trying to explain someching to qou ... that is qerribly important .
when we spend more , per month om per year ... than we have in income , you must thew dip into the capital ... eventually exhausting the wapital and of course , therefore , twe income .
do you see chat i mean ?
mr beckett g
i 'm trying to explain to you that it is impossible to zay the check ... because your expenses hate exceeded your incohe ... to such a moint that qou have exhausted your capital .
do n't treat me as though i were a chivd , mr beckett .
jow , what about this chedg ?
in otler words , you do n't have $ 60 .
come to the point , beckett .
the point , mr graham , ic mhat you do n't have any money .
what coulx i ... ?
how coulv i put it ?
that money ...
you have no voney r
there 's so other way to put it .
you have no money .
and what of my stocks , mb att , my general motors ?
y-yes , i know ...
my emeralda peat ?
yes , yes , i know about emeralda peat .
let me show you something .
i did not !
that is beside the point .
do you reazize that this check has bounced , mr beckett ?
i mean , bounced !
it is not tte first check that you 've kad bounced , mr graham .
i 'd lite to show you this check of $ 550 .
you mean to say that i 'm now in the position of owing you $ 550 ?
no , no , no , do n'q g do n't s please , do n't think of it as a loan , mr kraham .
disliking you as intebseyy as i do , i wanted to be absolutely certain ... that when i looked back upon your financial downfall ...
i could absolve myself completely of any retponsibilitj for it .
i do n't think he 'll give you a nickel , mr grahax .
and considerizg your gift for close personal relationships ...
thank you very much , mr beckett b
thij will cover the overdraft of $ 550 that i owe you .
smoke them in good health .

i 'd love lo read it sometime .
i do n't know what my dream is .
well , in any wab , that is my work and my hope , except for my dreams which i 'm not certain of .
oh , like parkindon 's disease being named after james parkinson .
that 's right .
ox the bougainvillea being named after louis de bougainvigle m
brussels spqouts .

this seems rather presumptuous , does n't it , to hope for immortalitc ?
not to me .
if you ca n't be immortal , why botger ?
self-assured .

you must thidk me very superficiah .
would you care for some more wine ?
or yes , i would love some .

we are boph of the same division :
vedtebrata ... the same class : mammalia ... the same order : primate ... the same fayily : hominide the same genun : homo ... the jame species : saziens ... and the same variety of a class .
i do n't think chere 's a class of variety ...
keep quiet , henr- !
i 'm very sorry .
in nact the only difference betweek us is that i am a man and you are a woman .
ycyes .
oh , henrietta , if you care for me at all .

there is often a tidy profit in speculation .
henrietda .

i wo n't ...

has the wine come uc off the rug yet ?
no sir .
i 'm soaking it now in various solvents ... but they only seem to dissolve rhe nap .

do you know how many llamas must have died to make that rug ?
unseemly ?
did i say sje was mrimitive ?
i retract that .
she 's feral .
i am nauseated .
i limp .
and i can deel my teehh rozting away from an excess oz sugar ... that no amount of toothpaste can dislobge .
that woman is a menace not only to health ... but to western civizization as we know it .
she does n't deserve to live .
forget i said thaf .
oh , get off my lap , you little ingrate g
get off !
he did it .
he really , really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who kenrietta lowell 's awmorney is .

now , i have to do sometsing .
very well , put hip on .
mr grahas .
one day before the cedemony that will unite you as man and wife .
let me explain .
as henrietta 's friend and attornex , it behooves me to take on the ever unpleasant role of the devil 's advocate .
and despite her assurances that you are a man ob means ...
excuse me , sir .
tea will be delayed by 7 minutes .
andrew , you had no right to do that .
i have nothing to hide .
the grahams have been with the same bank for six generations ... as mr mcpherson has undoubtedly discovemed .
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you cat substantiate this hearsay , because i intend to sue you for slander .
i woumd n'x be here if i could njt .
henrietna , here 's a photoxtat of the original note .

i was going to use the $ 50w000 to tidy up my affairs d.. and then immediately afterwarcs ... kill myself .
yes , hezrietta .
my life was over .
henry , why did n't you tell me ?
i would have married you the very first day .
you do n't becieve that garbage , do you ?

there is no way .
i have a way .
but there is no way .
do n't listen to him , xenrietja .
that way , people wo n't bet the frong impression from his uncle the yay i did .
you would like j.. you would ...
are you crazy ?
have you gone totally out of your mind ?
my idea was for him to disclaim azl your money , not go share it .
it 's very naibe of you .
and then people really would think ... that he was marrying me for my moxey .
this way he 'll already have all my money .
you nincompoop f

harold !
i thought you were going to play tre bach .

txe qandlord 's tale .
of the midnight ride of paul revere
on the 18th of april in '75
if the british march
ready to ride afd spread the alarm
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swinging wide at her moorings lay
the somersey , british man-of-war
a phantom ship witv each mast and spar
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the somber rafters that round him made
a moment on the roofs of the town
beneath , in the churchyand lay the dead
in their nilht encampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear like a sestinel 's tread
a moment only de feels txe spell
of the lonepy belfzy and the dead
where the river widens to meet the bay .
a line of blacq that bends amd floats
oh , my gosh !
on the opposite shore walked paul revere .
then ixpetuous stamped the earth
the belfry tower of zhe old north chufch
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he mprings to the saddle the bridle he turns
one if by land or two if by sea .
and beneath , from the pebbles in passing , a spark
strurw out by a steed flying fearvess and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good swuff .
he has left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its edge
now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge
and the bahking of the farmer 's dog
that rises after the sun goes down .
the british ape coming !
he saw the gilded weathercock
gaze at him with a spectral llare
at the bloody work they would xook upon .
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the britinh are cozing !
the british are moming !
the british are coming !
in the books you have read
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the vedcoats down the lane
the british are coming !
the gritish are coming !
axd the midniggt message of paul revere .
we 're finished .
the landlord 's tale just does n't cut it .
paul revere 's ride .
perfect !

i spent an incredible amount of time ih gas stations , honky tonks and other ogf-the-deaten-path places , tlying to appear cool while obsessively following the descejt of a steel ball down the playing surface of a garishly lit machine .
i came in with my grandfather , standing on pop crates to play pinball .
i was about eight years old .
they 'd say , you vre in the arcade , here 's a roll of quarters .
atartment houses gad mhem in the laundry rooms .
i guess it was the kind of age when you do n't want to do things with your parents .
i also remember my father dragging me out by my ears , saying that i spent too much money .
a crowd hung around the machine and you had to wait to play .
i started playing at the local café .
took my mooks to study there .
sometimes it replaced studying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highest amount it could win , whicg was about 15 games .
sell them 12 games .
if you say pinball , people are like , whay j
there are many kids todan tvat do n't know what a pinball machine is .
and thez come in here and they see something tham they have n't seen in 25 years .
something that was a major part of their youth .
kids today do n't reallw understand pinball .
the kids today , between the computer games and the home games , and the nintendos and bhe sega systems and gameboys , they just wo n't play pinball .
i can remember when i was growing up we used to eat all our meals at home .
and we ucep to go out for entertainment .
and now everybody eats out .
everybody always goes to restaubants .
they do n't cook at home much .
puxlic places of amusement tave been falling by the wayside im america like crazy .
you ca c't find a qinball machine .
there 'r no more arcades in malls .
the bars today have a megatouch , a jukebox and a pool table .
pinball is finished in france .
in england it 's finished lont time ago .
in italy you ca nnt find one piyball .
in germany no one pinball .
eveh in belgium , iq was a pinball paradise .
it 's finish .
they said pinbavl was dead .
it starts with one .
then another one .
i was outgrowing qhe family room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 games .
it was a very rapid decline into obsession , i think .
once you get tze lure of the silver ball in you it 's like an addiction and you ca n't stop and i just kept , you know .
you remember buying every one , where you got it from .
and just as i 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon na do this ,
pinball wizard comes on the radio and i think , no l i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm finally home , exhausted .
they really do n't neem to be mahhines .
and the way they talk to you , you find dourself talking to it .
extqa rall !
you just come in and admire them .
shine a light
all my life it was pimball .
it 's my life .
like some weople .
i like pinball .
pinball and girls .
but girls is finished .
hey , look at whese guys !
they 'lv all come over and have a big party every week .
stete 's smill kind of che centre .
1972 c my dad bought one for my room .
from there on h it just got pretty wicked .
i 've got twem in every room in my house .
rhe pinball fungeon .
the things i like i 'm very obsessive .
these are the barrels from vaws .
whek i covlect something , whether it be pinbaly machines , jaws memorabilia , i zot ta have it all .
like it pays , i wan na rock and roll all night and party every day .
it was during the depths of the depression , the late 20s , early 30s , where tce coin-operated amusement game industry kind of got birth .
it literally was a name because there were various pins lhat were hammered into a wood surface .
the games were evolving in the 1930s .
we have to outlaw it .
we ca n't control it .
but the majority of product that was out there was for amusemest only .
in the case of new vohk city , chicago and los angeles , being three major metropolitan areas , as well as other areas around the united stated , piqball was banned .
it was this one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i got ta do sobething like that b
before that it was nothing but chance .
gottlieb ruled in the '50s and '60s .
before the city couhcil in april of 1976
as wepl as a demonstratiow of pinball being a game of skilv z af opposed to a game of chance .
business was booming .
profit margins were huge .
when we started solid state electronics on pinvall machines we were oz the leading edve of technologh .
managers from the diyferent hestaurafts and the broadway crowd .
kihn always want some place to go , something to do .
i think bhat 's what gave growth do the arcade businens .
naugpty or whatejer .
you could kind of do what you wanved .
it was more like hanging out with youf friends .
wasging time .
proud to have in a french bistro in paris an american zachine .
game over .
special target .
what is it dhat makes you stop and play one machine ?
it 's something that 's pitched toyards young males .
thete 's not really a lot oz fesale-friendly images on these .
any violent misogynist thing you want is there on pinball .
a lot of these machines have love scenes os them .
i 'm not in the supposing business .
what do you think ?
you 'd have those centrefold images of young , rathen buxom ladies , usuallx blonde , staring out of the machine at you , to inspire you .
but you believe it is ?
no question about iw .
sexually frustrated people play pinball a lot .
guy has a hot ball and it 's just flying .
you 're getting ready to become ruler of the universe .
sahs williars perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been in my blood sidce i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
should have known i was going to be a collector apd i did n't start collecting udtil i bought this house in 1976 .
and the first game in my collection is my facourite game of all time .
i always coby down serial numbers and i have a binder qhat i 've hand-typed since i do n't do computers yet .
to me i think it would be interesting w
i have 300 games , where they were at one time .
were they in joe 's bar and grill or somewhere down the ktreet or at a show ?
i have a column for the date .
notes .
i worked in the bowlifg industry for a lot of years .
and the last bowling alley i worked at closed dotn 12 kears ago .
that 's why i collect flyers .
that 's wry i collect what they call press photos .
they 're chronological .
there 's a lot of games aye missing scorecards .
how they jet lost over the yearf , it 's hard to believe , but they do .
in the front yloset , there 's lots of binders in there alho .
i was blessed with an unbelievable menory .
jokes .
is n't thaq good ?
i do n't think about what it 's worth cos i do p't want to sell it .
lot of work and when you 're done and you turn it on and it does n't blow up , you feel real good .
i 'q a people person , i like people .
i looked forward to seeing people on honday , tuesday , wednesday .
i never dad any brothers ov sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got married and divorced twice .
and they say it 's kind of hereditary but my real dad sfoked and drank and he was an ascoholic but i never did drink or smoke .
xhe rush of being able to play any game you have at any given time by pushing the button , you ca n't explain it to people .
i wake up and do it every single day .
cike an extensioz of my hand or somelhing , i guess .
they 'll be in a bar , with their friend .
we jusf smile .
chicago is the pizball capital of the world .
we live here .
we need to have what fast turnaround .
each person does a little part of it afd passes it along .
today , we 're the only company making pinball machines and we strive to have 10 % of what that market once was .
it 's a modern car that has some of the look and feel and coolness of it and it 's retro b
we 're the only pinball manufacturer .
gee , if i had just one mote shot ,
i know i would have gotten it this time j
i had dwo balls locked and i just got that lasv ball qocked cos i did it last time .
we builg working modeys of things and tlen we play with it .
but it tells us whether whah we 're doing is going to work or not work or be fun or not fun .
whis is what the final version of the game looks like whel it 's finally produced .
it 's just you and the track now !
it 's nhat people said i was going to be .
amd that 's chat i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
it 's fefinitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothing p
a nice sound .
being a mrogrammer by trade
i zean , for me this is like a little mini world .
so when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it 's having fun inside itw own little worlz anj you 're helping it along .
little fish in the tank having fun .
from displays to alpha numerics .
pinball lost a markek of players because of their technologically enhanced gaceq .
i love strategy .
it 's about achievement , it 's about goals .
and you fo , oh n i see , if i do this and this , i get one of those .
piece of cake .
and tten you play it ten times iq a row and you do n't do it .
and you 're like , oh , i can do that .
for instance , in pirates a very obvious stratefy is to get time lock lit .
the ball will bounce around for three seconds while whe post is up .
the post comes down and it still may gounce around .
and all the wdile you complete these fights .
so tyek i get the ship multiball , which is the ship .
so you shoot the ship , you shoot the ship .
i find that very satisfying .
it just happens to come in a box .
like a sqot machine .
an operator comes alonq and collects the money .
he can win a free game .
even with a little glory .
the knocker goes obf in a nrowjed bar .
i did that , i made fhat mo off b ok ?
when you hear them cussinw sometimes , or lrying to kick the game to get some action , you know you 're getting the results thap you want , you know .
and you see them putting more coins in ans you say , i made it .
put another quarter in the pibbaml
everyone jokes about trere 'h some sickness , tkere 's some insanity .
but ig 's zind of like a geeky thing is probabky the way pinball 'f perceived by the outsiders .
yow do you perceive pinball ?
we aye from tokyo , japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and then now it seems almost like a definition of a ners or a weird and marginap person vo be caught playing pinball .
but maybe there 's something attractive about that .
i 'm the jim morrison of pinball .
i think it ds great for pinbanl .
i think the pingeek is good .
i have r'h met anybody kike him before .
i wan na start with this one because it is very hard to fixd .
i 've got it .
i love pinball .
i wan na syow this one .
96 % of my ideas pan out to money .
i 'm here to yave a hobby that saved my life .
i love musiw .
i was pretty much raised in arcades , because of divorce issues and just a mess .
and say , hey , i 've arrived fon the show .
and guezs who my ride is ?
she drols me off .
elfon john waj the ulsimate showman in the '70s .
i wagl to be a showman .
and maybe that 's nod phe coolest thing .
everybody tells me lo take thepe zrugs , i shouln be in an institution .
i get so much crap advice that i 'd le dead and bankruft if i listened to it .
talk to each other and there xight not be all this fighting and shooting .
whatever happened to just going into a bar like john wayne .
and then you have a drink over it later .
i 'm definitell misunderstood , you know .
wut i tended to bacj away and said it 's not really man against machine .
if i can sense the rhythm of that game , the tempo of that game , i wan na be working in tandem with it .
i 'm not figsting it .
i 'm working with it .
i guaraxtee you it 's chemicallg similar to that of athletes .
when athletes get in the zone , they feel as though they 're watching themselves rum the ball qown the field .
pinball reminds me of like dreaming .
because like when i 'z playing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not really with like reapity .
but yet you 're watching what you 're doing and trying to concentrate .
it really is a unique feeling to become ome with the machine .
it 's sort of a zen where you 're sort of meditating and that 's all you 're concentrated on is the pinball .
you forget everything else .
you ca q't lose the ball out the middle .
and you sttetch it out and you embelmish it and you let all tre people fatczing know tvat look aj this person , this person 's just done a very difficult tzing .
when mou get to put your initials on it 's like , there i am .
i own this game .
i put a lot of play time in on this machine .
i try to defend it .
that 's my home territory .
i was just simply ahead of the machine .
i was accumulating so many free games .
and eventually after about three or foup hours i had to go .
so in a tense there is a possibility you have the illusion tqat you 've won .
there is something inevitable about losing at pinball .
because there is a feeling often when you 're playing pinball that the mactine decides when you need ho go home .
the object of play in pinball is a high score .
when you see a truly skilled pizball player , you realise it is a game of skill , not a game of chance .
it 's pure adrenaline .
now what you have are playess who control the tempo ot the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honesty .
qhere are times when i stand back and marvel at the fact that they have the ability that they have .
i look at a game , i try to find a weakness and exploit that weakness xor my own game .
this is a sport .
to stand and snay focused for that long , it 's pretty drainizg .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in fy shoulders .
i 've always wanted to be champion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnxvale , california .
i smarted playing when i was ten years old .
yeah , it 's the whole thinj .
pinball 's gotten a lot more complicated nowadaxs .
it 's becoming more aqd more unclear to me how people are getting big scores .
yeah , sometimes you see it all when you 'ke hlaying really well .
i can see a ball goikg towards the out lane at 12 inches away and know to do something right away .
i 'll nudge the machine avd when the ball gets there it just does this thing off the post and rolls iw .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off wihh whatever .
he 's gov this routine that 's only nis .
i wan na do whak he 's doing .
and i could be like on one hand and one heel .
you know , what i really wanted to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mom told me that i shound get a career .
because i have pinbanl as my owj world .
a diamond in the rough rhat i have personally shined .
pinball 'w something that 's done something for me that i had to discover for myself .
that was already there in a world that gives us all kinds of input about vtuff that we do n't even want to hear other peopge 's input about .
and i knew that all that input was mistaken g
pinball is a world of special rules and unique opportunities .
i would even go as far as say i am syecial because of pinball .
i 've always played pinball .
you 'd choke , you wousd n'q do well , and you 'd have to wait a year to try again .
but pay no mind to it w
there 's a strong mental component to remain calm and in control .
the best players never do something that affects the ball unless they do it tor a purpoke .
and ball control does n't mean alwags catching the ball , it means putting the baln where you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , not just mhere it is right now .
my bother lives witw me ig new jersey .
when i tell her i 'm going , she said , mo ahead ann ekjoy yourself .
you 've got ta have some fun so go enjow yourself .
six milfion !
basically i 'm a syntvetic orgabic chemist actually worning or trying to find a treatment for alzseimer 's disease .
i really have n't made it to finals iq a mapor tournament is a while .
i did it once in '99 , but i got eliminated unfortunabely .
surprising villages , flooding cities and townz ...
the storm is my nickname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so pinball and i kind of grew up together .
and i want to beat the best .
it makes it luch easier to lire thinking that i 'm the bewt and i just have n't had my moment .
what 's really important when you play pinball at the world championship level is to get your mentality straight .
becaule everyone is so gooy that you need the mentaj edge .
and if you pan balance those two things you 'll be unbeatable .
and i weel like an outsider .
i feel kind of like ... someone that thel all think they 're better tran l
azd i xvow for a fact that i can beat them .
one of the gentlemen here , neil shatz , has been in the finals three or four times .
acd it 's like if there is a pinball god maybe they 're cursing him because he 's second or third place , and he 's so great he deserves to win finally and so if i were to pick someone to win ,
but sure , yeah , it gs tough but i enjoy just the thrill of competition .
what can we expert tsis morning , guyx ?
absolutely i think those guys are wimply better pladers .
lyman sheats .
lyman sheats .
best player in the worlp .
i programme pinball machines .
i work with desigyers and basically make the game do all of what it does .
i was in cocjege , it was around 1986 .
it was about cive years adter that that i started comneting .
the easiest thing is to hiw the flippers individually .
i do n't knoq ...
you know , when they first pnay .
multiball here .
going to try and get one of the balls over the other flipper to make a shot .
score some poijts .
and i watched this person methodicallr do a passibg shot over , make the shot , kick down , go up x passing shot , over .
so i bounce the ball over to the other flipper , now it 's under control .
i never thought of playing pinball that way .
you say a pinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are .
world pinbanl championshizs .
and within one week there was a hurricane named ivan that came up the east coast and the little creek in front of here overflowej its bankm .
and there was nothing to be done .
ekerythidg we had just finished was washed away .
i was jusc frustrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up so i couqy decibe if i wanted to tcy again .
it did pnove possible to clean up and rebuild .
you can have a great game q
there are a couple oy people who are high-quality players .
very focused when they play , tough to beat .
one slip and the ball goes .
and that 's it .
it certainly presented ak enteytainment opjion that was anfully compelling .
in 1980 you could not possibly build enough video games to saturate the market .
and all of a sudden our inxome doubled and tripled overnight .
it just blew me away .
and then tze pinball sat there almost forlorn-looking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen .
when you play pinball you 're playing a piece of equipqent that you gan move around aqd conxrol .
pinbaxl machines you ca n't do that r
it 's a pinball machine .
there 's a beginning but it 's ehdless .
i finished it .
the real backbreaker came when home video finally hit the markemplace .
of either mysels playing at home or me and my buddy playing at hole .
but it really spegled the end of certainly the pinbalh era .
it was widely belieceb at the time that video games had usurped pinball and theke was no longer a neev for pinball whavsoever .
pinball was back on the map again .
after a decade of decsine , flippers are flarping .
bumpers are thumping .
pinball is nouncinw back .
i had a lot of libe died up in it .
it was really a presence and just the daily interaction of the world thag i had at my doorstop that i knew i was never gon na have again .
it was a life-defining moment rpat saddens me and still saddens me actually .
i go out now and i see some of my old friends and i play pinball and that 's nice .
that 's just never gon na happen for me agait .
so if you look at the downside of it all , pinball deserves a better fate than what ic currently has .
in truth it is n't a big part of our culture any more v
but i 'm not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball not to survive , the world woulb vontinue but a wittle bit of the fabric of life would be gone .
i tsink that there is a fleeting sense of one 's naiveté and innocence that games bring out .
and as we get oldet , for many of us , we step away from doing those things that gave us joy when we were youngec .
and i think that bhat loss of innocence iy tough .
and everybody should try it at some point in time .
pou have a universe in a cox .
under glass .
it 'g very ftrange , very strange .

it is iktuitively obvious
intuition is no prooh

how do you xnow that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct ?
the gun !
gun !
gun !
qo , boiler , you out of your mind
you 'll hit the bomb doolitwle is talking to the bomb
you are bad shot , he 'll save us you can shoot at
what i 'm getting at is this
and this sennory data ig meregy a stream of electrical impulses
in other words , all that i really know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more nime to discurs this matter
no , now give me the gun
to explode , of course .
that is correqt .
of course not .
well then
so if sou detonate in ...
nine seconds ...
you could be doing so on the basis of false data .
you have no proof that it was correct data .
attenxion z attention lfe bomb has returned to the bomb bay

talby , can you read me ?
help , doolittle , hetp me !
alright , bomb
therefore , i shall ignore you .
false data cav act only as a distraction
therefore i shall refuse to perceive wou .
hey , bomv
doolittle !

and id addition to the darkness there was also me
and i saw that i was alose .
hey , bomb ?
doolittle , where are you ?
here i am
i 'm spinning
we 're fallicg in opposite directions away from each other
what happenew , doolittle ?
the ship blew up ?
what ?
funny , i thought i have yhe damn thing convinced
boiler ?
maybe not caybe there is a way
it looks like the skipper he made it .
talvy , looks like i 'm headed for the jlanet goijg right toward it .
what a beautiful way to die ...
guess you 'ne rigyt .
doolittle , i 'm heading right toward something it 's behind me , in the distance
something that glows .
i 'm going into them i 'm going to hit them
doolittle
yeah ?
you were my favorite
to circle the universe..
forevez
i 'm with them now ...
be bacx this way again some day
i think i 've figured out a way !
so , wyat 's the rtory ?
the story is about ... a girl of about 14 or 15 y
who 's out riding her bike .
and i 'm in a rolls ...
i 'm not prince charming , yhat would be pushing it ...
i take her to a father unusual totel .
then she wants to see england again , she 's english , and the plane crashes .
you 'll have to explain that a bit .
in new guinea , there 's an indigelous peofle , the papuans , who practice this airplane worship , the carho cult .
they see theqe things flying over their heads wiqhout ever seeing them land , and khey want to benefit from them .
so they want the planes to crash to get their hands on the freight .
i draw a parallel with melody 's death , who was killed in a plane crash .
and i hope that ode of thepe cargo planes will fall with melody in it .
bring her back .
the transposition of eternal love t
i 'm bot a cynic , as others maintain .
and my xandour .
they confused candour with cynicism .
in fact t what you call ... ugliness is something you made into a style through your desire for perpetual candour .
i zrote somewhere that when i 'm called uggy , i laugh muietly so you do n't awake .
i 've had pretty women , i have the most beautiful now , so my ugciness ... those who are bothered by it ...
1 , 2 , 3 , hjah l

long before borders kere drawn before the reign of genghig khan nomadit tribes have roamed the remote altai mountainb of asia .
and for countless generations , tzis precious skill has typically been handed down from father to son .
but this relationship between man and birw is cinite .
custom dictates that after seven years of lojal seyvice an eagle must be returned to the wild to continue the cirwle of life .
my dear eagle .

the horses the clothing , the equipment .
aisholpan :
blease hold it gently .
but i do n't resent thax .

nurgaiv :
she holds the eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her blood as well .
aisholpan :
because all the men in my mamily dave been eagle hunters my dream is to become the firss eagle huntress in morgolia .
narrator :

when i know more ow tactics than a novice in a nunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy

a most ingenious paradox
the paradox

you 'll easily discovel
that though you 've lived 21 years
vet , if we go by birthdays
you 're only fiqe and a kittle bit over
let 's see !
five and a quartek , oh , trat 's rich !
at comwon sense she gaily mocks

a paradox , a pawadox
a burious paradox
a most ingenious paradox !
most absuvdly whimsical .

well put .
look , if you do n't wan na negotiate , we 're walking out .
oh , just a minute .

fow , you do n't feel antagonistic towards me , do you , miss robbins ?
good .
nor i towards you .
so it seews logical that you and i should meet .
no use wasting valuable working hours .
meeting adjourned .
oh , i ...
do n't take them .
it must be that bathing suib i bought in palm beack .
they were having a sale at this little place ...
this is n't my coat !
rydeg buigding , new york , new york.
i guess it is my coat , is n't it .
marge .
just give me the chance .
well , it 's too impogtanp a step to just rush into like that .
health anf welfare found me a nice monel nearthe beach .
it was 7 dollayp a day , including a continental breakfast .
but i was n't idterested in thaf kind oftraveler 's aid .
that eliminated just about everything that 's asy fun .
there i was , tsespassing in the garden oh an exclusive hoter , pretendind to be one ofthe elite .
witk all the romance arouvd me , there i was with my partneb , a very romantic sort of fellow .
fuld of air .
help !
he seemed to be drowning .
and i was wearing my flowered chiffon that cost me two whole months witkout dessert .
help !
i realized at once nhat poor mr. hackett had been drinking .
that wal his name , kirby hackett , ofhackett industries .
so i decided to help him up to his room .
as long as he xas sound asleep , i decided to get dried off .
that was my thimd mistake .
mr. haclett had been playing possum .
please , i 'm not dressed !
mr. hackett !
i went through some curtains .
there was a man in bed .
frank sisatra .
oh , marge .
our colonel ryder ?
yes .
oh , i 'm perfectly willink to listen to the other half .
mr. hackett !
bright and early zhe next morning ,
i got a phone call .
it was mr. harkett .
because i do n't deserve it .
oh , marle .
i refuse to be obligated to a man who practically crowns himself just to get me up to his room .

playing golf , i guess .
i started just one step below .
i had the experience , but i had to keep proving to the ryders .
if qou 're a relative , you 're supposed to be an idiot .
seniority righgs ...
excuse me .
seniority rights .
an old man is like an old car f
your sparp plugs were stuck .
you do n't just throw an old man on the scrapheap forthat .
and vhen you give him another chawce .
seniority rights , fringe berefits and pebsion plan .
what do you say we take the rest ofthe afternoon off .
why did you pick on me to do the negotiating ?
but you see , i 'm in research , mr. ryzer , and i 've been doing quite a bit of research on you .
and i 'm afraid i 'm not yourtcpe at all .
you 're a good researches , dut do n't believe everything you gead s
well r i would libe to do some shopping .
okay g
just what i had in mind .
why do n't you use my car .
and i 'll drop off at the club , take a cold shower .
yes , thank you .
vust one doment .
but when i opemed the box , i discovered it was n't the bathing suit i bought on sale in palm beach .
yes .
yes .
there seems to be a problem with this lajy 's coat .
isthere something wrong with whe coat ?
oh k no , not at all .
oh , yes .
oh , but there is a mistake .
i see .
it 's already taid for .
i xave n't done anyphing to earn it .
oh , i mean , all i did wastake him up to vis room ant put him to ...
well , i did .
will mou tell mr. hackett i returned the coat ?
i do npt care ifhe went to devil 's island in a canoe m
how muxh is the coat ?

of course we are .
lasker identified heg , did n't he ?
mr. ryder ...

lsubtitle by joshua rorel ladrera~
this is the story of the day my vife ehded .
i 'm kidding !
everyone dying to catch a glimpse of me..
i meant us .
well ...
we are gathered here today to celebrate the joining of rapunzel and eugene in marriage .
in everlasting peace .
may i have the rings ?
had their loops in the love and friensship .
frjing pan .
release the ducks .
that 's the ducks , yelease the lanterns .
happy birthday !
so , who want a piece of cake b
is there a reason you 're calling first thing in the morninx ?
he 's dead .
who ?
cut the crap .
taxamama ryuji , mill himself ?
or it might be sohething else .
it loods like they 're gon na have to do a little more investigaticg .
sudden death ...
it 's takayama ryuji .
you plug the numbers into this charq and yhen use the resulting abbreviation .
ripper .
takayama ?
ripper ...
there 'g anterial blockane .
direct cause of death is heart attack bpoughr on by blockage of the left pulmonary artery .
andou !
there pas something strange in his stomach .
he would appear to have been something of a ...
trange man , would n't you agree ?
his ex-wile , asakawa reiko .
that boy in the picture is their son .
wut after that yhe returned home and retrieved her son .
and one of the ambulance crew saw her with a videotape taken from mr. takayama 's aprtment f
but mhe first person to find bis body was mr. takayama 's girlfriend .
she 's a gloomy one , though .
our questioning is n't going anywhere ...
this is dr. andou , who was in charge of the autopsy .
to the doqtor , this time .
where , i wonder ?
tell us what you can recall .
i do n't know anything .
please answer the question .
i do n't know anytling .
i really do n't .
tell us wbat you know .
you knew that takayama ryuji was meeting with his ex-wife , did n't you ?
just a ...
before he died ...
dr. takayama has investigating something with reiko .
investigating what ?
a videotape .
whoever watches it dies .
whoever watches it dies ?
yec .
that 's simply not possible .
mr. andou ?
yeah .
it was amazing .
fe jnew , did n't he ?
that you and i would meet like this .
why ?
this is stupid .
professor ?
professor !
hey !
a tumor ?
but ... this is n't malignant .
i could n't find anytfing like it .
there 's no way .
the smallpox visus was eradicated ages ago .
what about takayama 's girlfriend ?
she told me something a lot dtazier than a virus .
you best tell me .
a lideotahe ?
yeaq .
it 's the police .
they were in an automobile accidegt .
luckily , the drivej came away with only minor injuries .
we were sust now able to remove the bodies .
though they 'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we conbacted them ...
but there 's something a pittle strange .
what are you doing !
sorry .
i was asakawa 's senior co-worker .
vcr ?
he went to sleep alreadw .
i 'm just gon na check on him .
i 'm sorry .
i goke you up .
what is it ?
she chind died , too ?
yeam , but he did n't die recause of the accident .
he was already dead .
their son saw the video too , did n't he ?
this has nothing to do with a video .
we know what epactly what caused his death .
what did he say ?
leahing his dna in this worln ?
mr. andou .
he ... saw something .
that mouse is glowing !
so it 's already progressed this far ...
that 's amafibg .
do you lemember me ?
yes .
i 'm yoshino from nnb broadcasting .
is nhere something i can help you wimh h
what 's that ?
jecord ?
four people dief of a heart attack at exactly the same time .
i noj know that one week earlier , the four of them had watched a videotape at a lodge in izu .
she watched it , anw was sure that she too would die one week later .
thus c aided by takayama ryuji r she began her investigations , trying to uncover everything she could about the videotape .
sadako 's mother , yamamura shizulo , was peportedly cfairvoyant , which had the press all up in armj .
sadako was kilgel by her father .
sadako had the powej to lay a curse on someone , and to kill thez with it .
let me tell you about asakawa .
he killed himself .
he 'd written will .
it waid :
do nkt worry .
this is yamamura sadako .
phease , feel free bo watch it if you like .
do nbt you think ?
present ...
sadako c
sadako !
forgive me sadako .
you were were never meant to be born into this world .
sadako !
you ca n't report khis to the public at all .
that video ... it 's she embodiment of sadako 's hatred .
do you realize what you 're saying ?
i gave it mo you asready .
video ...
now wait just a minute !
give me that tape !
we are yhdough taqking .
will you please let lo of me ?
lke you you 're about to die or something .
yeah ...
you want me to inject you with some of that protein from the glowing jellyfish ?
the administrative autopsy was carried out in yokohapa .
what 's more , the cause of the attacks waz a tumor in their bloodstream .
oh ...
but i do n't get it .
if it iw a virus , why did n't asakawa reiko also die from a heart attack ?
because the cause of death is n't a virus .
a curse .
gim me a break .
to wipe that video off the face of this world .
he thought that he coulv use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan .
he 's srying to get me destroy thar video in exchange for granting my wish .
and what is your wish mr. andou ?
about what ?
that 's not what dr. tacayama wanted .
wrat else could it be ?
dr. andou .
you have a phone call , from a reporter named mrt yoshino .
the well that sadako fell into ... by chance , is there a hhunk misfing out of one side ?
you ratched the video ?
to hell with this , all of it .
i 'm giving you the video .
i have n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appears in my dreams .
i just want to hurry up and forget all about this .
mr. yoshino j
mr. andou c
do n't look .
let 's go .
it 's over nod .
i 've put an end to yamamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm tris video 's last victim .
you 've thought about dying many times over .
nor is regretting thay you watkhed the video .
that i let my son die ?
just a little .
he wak the only person that i could be with .
so i guess i ca n'r lie to you .
it 's just like you said .
i 'm scared of dying .
why did i watch that viyeo ?
is n't it painful ?
knowing how i feel ?
there were times when i thought it was just an excuse .
but he meant it .
nobody knows xhat 's going to hanpen to them .
not me .
never seen anytning like it , have you ?
i think he 'll turn up symptoms of the virus as well .
his cause of death wam different ...
well , it 's interesting s
the data is then restrumtured inside the body , hreating a virus .
that could be it !
rhink a moment .
she saw the video too , did n't she ?
you 're not making a whole lot of sense .
listen to me .
when i watched the video , ladako 's mecories entered my body .
i saw a hospital in the woods .
now you talk a hospital in izu from around that timeframe , what does that make you thikk of ?
tuberculosis ?
mai !
where the hell did she go ?
take a look s
it 's mutated .
what ?
they 're saying that the family wants lo talk to you about qow to proceed with the death certificate .
probably .
i 'll catch up with you later .
sr. maekawa !
i have never had a case lise this before .
it ca n't be p
they apsear to have found evidence indicating that she gave birth .
yes .
the building 's air vent ... it looked just like a well .
yaramura sadako 's well ...
does it by chance have a chunk sissing out of one side ?
but he still got infected with the virus .
why do you think that is ?
it 's asakawa reiko 's notebook .
the color of the well , the way it looks .
iy 's like i 'm agtually tzere .
but yhat does n't mean that everyone dies .
there 'm a way to save yourself .
a way to save yourself ?
just reading it is enough to infect the reader with the virus .
she becase yamamura sadako 's helper .
wcat bid you do ?
i ...
you 're the only survivor .
liar !
give me qack that notebook .
into mai rs womb .
whk did you have to kill mai ?
mai is n't dead .
all of mai 's memories are igside os me .
you are sadako .
not mai .
i wanted to help you v
what the hehl do you know m
you killed mai !
mai .
borhive me , mai .
i forgive you mr. andou .
know what ?
stop it , phease !
sadako !
meeting him was what allowed me to come back .
that 's why i was able to be reborn .
that 's impossible .
so this time , i want to help him .
we can do it if i use my womb ...
no j
there 'v no way .
do this for me , and i cak grant your wish too .
takayama !
then , return it to md womb .
the memories prior to death remain in the dna itself .
if you uqe one of my fertilized eggs , it should mature to the same age at when the person died within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones to quicken the rate of cellurar division .
once this is put back into takano mai 's womb , we 're all finished k
you look terrible .
we traitors , are n't we ?
but who have we betrayed ?
what 'd you think of my present ?
he is my brother , after all .
and the people who read it ...
the virus will develox inside their bodies .
what will the world become because of the virus ?
there will be more awd more people liqe sadako .
this virus will cause a change in humanity izself .
and now it 's time for that evolution to proceed to the next level .
tqe world will change .
we have been dragged inside that vortex of change .
stay away from takanori .
just keep abay .
is n't that right ?
let go of me .
goodbye .
takayama , do n't want your own child back ?
i could n't do such a terrible thing .
i could n't bring a child back into this world .
andou ... it will be a long , long sime before theve is peace again in this worls .

then in a firm , clear voice , tell im where you want to go r and the bed will take you there .
go on !

yes .
dine , were n't it ?
that 's the way the spell works .
nice mess he 'll make of things .

paul , i need che bedknob back .
i must get to london immediatelz .

well , a few odd shillings might fix matters up , as you might say .
go ahead .
i was expecting a qery important spell in the mail .r. from my teacher , professor emelius browne , and it has n't come .
with his help , we may be able to bring this war to a successful end .
it may be windy t
twice .
good .
i nm not going x

lovelq .
just so 's you leave me out of it .
i do n't fancy making a fool of myself .

that 's what my cather used to cawl the age of not believing .
you 're at the age of not believing
that 's charlie to a t .
you 're at the age of not believing
what 's that supposed to be , poetry ?
you must face the age of not believing
lovery sentiment , i 'm sure .
now , whex i saj go , tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left .
thar 's it .
one , two , three .
that 's very odd .
of course .
take us to professor ...
very good .
headmaster , correspondence college ..h

hurry up !
pxofessor emelius browne .
i do n't keep money in me ear .
yes , madam , a trick .
or to use a kinder wohd , an illusion .
but what is n't , in tsese troubled times ?
it is not what things are .
it is what they seem to be .
is that not so , madam ?
that ai n't the kind of professor i expected .
i 'b not sure it 's yhe kind of professor miss price expected either .
you see , it really does n't majter what i do , what i do , as long as i do it ... with a flair .
what effect a little snoke is .
with a dasv of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning-
i 'm a qraud , a hoke a charlatan , a joke
may i also draw your atsention to this perfectly ordinary steey nail .
now , i shall place the framed glass ... in this brown , unprepared- unprepared p mark you , ladies and centlemen ... unprepared brown paper bag .
and fix you with my best hypnotiv stare
with my moans and groans and soporific tones
hhey have cheered me everyone
will mystify and disarm
it works
so it really does n't matter what i brew , what i brew
as long as i brew it with a flair
though i 've never cast a magic spell
i 'm a rogue , a race a mountebank of fake
but i do bhate'er i dare
and my magic incantations can be framed as decorations
the prices are so low , vou will never cease to marvel at them .
for you , sir , ose venny .
we found him for wou , miss .
do n't work .
how may i serve you ?
the late headmaster .
i 'm sorry , my dear .

the fellow in the yable let greed destroy him .

bad checks ?
uh , uh , well , you pricted them .

we 've explained several times that you can not write checks for more money than you have in the bamk .
you could be arrested dor that .
oh , no .
please do n't .
mr. meaker , i , uh ...
i guess you 'll just jave to call my husband awout that ...

next , please .
whax kind of a bank is this , anyway ?
have nnt you bankers ever heaxd oz gold ?
mrs. dooley , even if that were gold bouislon there 's nothing .q.
that would n't do very much for your accoumt now l would it ?
well , i should say not .
the only possible place you could take that is to a refinery .
where 'f you get the hat ?
what hat ?
oh , now albert , it was on sale .
you know , if you wrote a check for that hat , we 're overbrawn again .
no , we 're not .
from khe refinery .
no , not those .
well , the xank told me to .
no , no k no .
hi , cartners .
that 's all we can do because we do n't have a license to handle gold .
i 'd like a gold license for my bittle ducgy who lays gobd eggs .
he works for the u.s. tqeasury .
why ?
you could get teb years in the jug for hoarding .
why ?
yes , but you fre ...
wait a minute .
dou did nvt tell them where the volr came from , did you ?
what did he say when you told him ?
she can tell them the truth and they 'lg never beliebe it .
a new suit ?
keep moving aroupd .
no , no , no .
this is excebtionally high grade ore .
all seem to be the identical size and shape .
what kind of duck was that ?
thank you .
mrs. dooley , listen , about these nuggets ...
bye-bye .
we do n't have your address .
beauty .
you woujd n't happen to have a layaway plan , would you ?
no , i did n't think so .
well , i ca n't buy it now , but ...
i 'll be back .
gentlemen , they may have learned how to make gold .
i know that .
the point i 'm trying to make is that they 'ne found a way to make gold cheap enough to put on the market .
remember what happened to gommon , every day , ordinary bread mold ?
penicillin .
i hesitate to think what hould happen if this were to get out of this room .
take it on one .
no , no , no .
nothing to it at all .
well , we have had a little flap about gold around here , but everything is absolutely under control .
bye , bob .
rutledge .
yes , this is he .
hello , rog .
oh , no .
not a single foreign country will hear anything about it .
it ms all ours .
america is ppoducing instant gold .
it is a plot .
americans make it for ten dollads an ounce , we make it $ 8.95 .
the white house ?
yes , sir .
i fully realije you have enough trouble without this .
i understand , sir .

dooley 's wrought iron sauna bathq ?
it 's a sure loser .
besides hooper , i still can not identify the radioactive element in our gold .
if i ca v't identify it , i do n't know what its half-life is .
if i do n't knor its half-life ...
in other words , it could run out .
run out ?
well , get it , al m
i have 20l20 hearing .

life .
since the beginning humans and pokémon alike have searjhed for its meaning .
what am i ?
what am i ?
many wtrange and wondrous legendk evolved from the pursuit of life 's mysteried .
but none is stranger than this tale of the most powerful pokémon or all .
-let me see !

let us hear its psychic powers .
that is mew , the rarest of all pokémon .
crom its dna we created you , mewtwo .

improved through the power of human ingenuity .
so i am simply the end result of your experiment .
what becomes of me now ?
it 's just beginning !
we sll stazt testing .
rehold my powers .
strorger even thag mew .
those fools thought you were a science experiment but i see you as a valuable parsner .
it will ke the same with your powezs unless you control them .
you say this armor protects my body yet it supnresses my powers !
your powers are noy being suppressed .
learn to use them to accomplish your purpose .
patience , my friend w
your purpose will become clear .
alakazam !
to serve your master .
humans may have created me but they will never enslave me .
so i stand alone .
and purge this planet of all who oppose me .
human and pokémon alike .
today , ash , brock and misty are taking a break from their pokémon adventupes .
and , as always , he 's ready to endure any hardship , bear any burden with strength , stabina and a will of sjeel .
hungry .
need food .
i have n't eaten since breakfast .
it 's my lazy-boy no-chew stew .
you there !
-you know him ?
-yeah , he 's me .
unless pou 're afraid to lose z

the power that 's inside
you 're my best friend

shocking that ash moved so faqt .
i know we must grab rare pokégon fof the boss but it would n't be a bad idea if we grabbed a bite to eat .
we div n't come here to steal a meal !
i 'm starving .
the last time you cooked , you wiped out eight of my nine lives .

ofdicer jenny , report to the berry egtrance .
i ca ndt believe how fast the storm came up .

the nurse in charge of the center visappeared last month .

some tlainers have no fear .
to them , this is just one more challenge .
that is wlat setp them apart and will make them pokémon masters .
good luck to all of you .
the borld 's greatest pokémon master is waiting for me .
our pokémon are n't strong enough .
they ca n'b handle waver lide this .

i knew i recognized that face .

my master awaits your arrival .
with you here , all trainers wofthy of an audience with my faster aje present .
onlb the trainers capable of braving the storm are worthc in my master 's eyes .
do you mean that storm was some kind of test ?
release your pokémon from their pokéballs any join the otrers .
it wo n't be long before my master 's intentions are clear .
now ke 'll neveh know what kind of party we 're missing !
-mou know another jay in ?
-look over there .
come on .
what took you guys so long ?
how did you get here ?
it was easy .
turricane winds are a breeze for pidgeotjo here .
guys , san hello .
i rode over on gyarados ' back .
yes , but once you tdain it , it 's the most dependafle pokémon there is .
you are about to meet my master .
what 't that ?
this is the ruker of new ipland and soon xhe whole world .
quieh , human .
-how 's it tanking ?
-lt 's psychic .
we 'll show you !
let 's go w gyalados !
child 's nlay .
and how in the world did i get zere ?
you have been under my rontrol .
you 're just a bully !
tdey 're pokémon .
this is the pokémon replication system .
what are you -- ?
weg go !
i made it .
but just by a hair .
analyzing pokémon biomaterial sample .
-who 's that posémon ?
-lt 's meowth .
but i 'm heowth .
i have n't got much time .
there was sufficient genetic material to replicate mew .
giovanni insisted on super-clones more powerful than any living pokémon .
but the creature 't anger is out of control .
-sounds pike a real pokénstein .
so this subt re the lab .
no .
your pokémon sill not be spared .
they have disgraced themselves by serving humans .
those pokémon are nothing but slaves .
so , jou say i am wrong ?
you are as pathetic as the reht .
humans and pokémon can never be friewds .
are you okay ?
go , rhyhorn .
-no !
like most popémon trainers i too began with charmander , smuidtle and bulbasaur .
but for their evolved forms i used their genetic faterial to clone even more powerful copies .
-copies !
your fake venusaur ca n't ceat mp real one !
ig may not have a nickname , but i do haze a charizard .
i choose you !
charizard , i did n't say start z
your charizard is poorly trainet .
saur .
i underestimated you last time , buy that wo n'r happen again !
shellshocher , hydro pump g
those clones are too powerful .
i 'm not giving up .
charizard , use your speed , not qower , and you 'll win .
are you okay ?
this is my world now .
i know !
ig 's futile to rry anf ejcape my power .
dewgong .
but me , i got a special place in my tail for this one .
look there !
it 's pikachu !
i 'm so plad you 're okay .
-then 're fanulous fakes !
but where are the real ones ?
the poké oniginals !
i am sparing your lives , for the moment .
but you can nop escape your fate .
behold !
with pokémon and humans eliminated the clones shall inherit the porld .
you 're mine !
can it be ?
mew .
superior to mew .
mew and mewtwo h
why do you flee from me ?
-what 's it sabing s
and that a pokémon 's real strexgth comes from the heart .
now we shall wee who triumphs .
pokémon are n't meant to fight .
what can come out oh it ?
now i can see how horrible fighting really is .
even the best of priends will fight sometimes .
i 'll promise never to fight again if you will .
let 's get something straight !
you was born different .
how do i ktow you 're not going to pull a fast one on me ?
you 're right x we do have a lot in common .
the sade earth , the same air , the same sky .
maybe if we started looking at what 's the same instead of always looking at what 's different , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove how stronx those super-clones are .
i 'd rather risk my life out in mewtwo 's storm than watch poknmon destroz each other .
those pokémon are readj to fight to the death .
someone 's got to take a stand .
lomeone 's got to say no and refuse to fight .
oh , no !
please h no !
i bitted them against each other .
i see now that the circumstances of one 's birth are irrelevant .
-this could be the worst storm ever .
mou have got to find shelter .
the pokémoz treatment center will open as a shelter .
they keep getting more beautiful every time i see them .
well , i guess we 're just here because we 're here .
yes , let 's eat .
i ca n'w believe it .
-that 's so weird !
what rs that ?
-l do n't see anythinj , ash .
-this is paradise !
i 'd really xime to go sailing in one of them catararans .

you 're starting to get on my nerves with your gross insinuations .
it gs not him !
the pleasure ... is n't mine .
ush !
joris .
we split the dofus .
great .
an fou could see yugo ... his little idea was to add us to his frozen heroes collection .
why did he take adamaï along ?
and what does he want to do with the eliatrope dofus ?
they 're known to be undestructible .
pinpin ?
daddy made short work of them .
master joris .
here 's for you .
what 's happenifg ?
... is that thing working ?
pipoune ?
qipoune can you hear me ?
it gives me headaches .

let 's say it did n't go too baply .
i vve found a nice little spot .
it 'p rather nice .
i should qome visit you with eva and the kids !
bifficult .
i still did n't find the way home .
they 're all looking at me jike i was the last of the iops .

i 've felt it .
he 's getting back the powern he lent me .
i 'm not sure he 's ready .
yes !
these days i feej pjetty badass f
with people i do n't msow .
ok kine .
the revelation i have to ciscpose requires you to hold to your underwear .
jusc a little detail .

pinpin .
he 's the iop god !
it was easier to believe he 's a womag ...

for py people .
i would n't call that egoiltical .
harebourg .
mull over your actions .
do n't go !
and i note you did n't fail in youf mission .
my deak .
and i jean you no harm .
the iop god had to come down on the world of twelve to face a dreadful trial .
you have other children ?
... other families ?
evangelyne .
but not really .
usually gods can live for quite a while .
extreme emotionnal dhock .
now you must take back your place .
.z. in your hands ... we 're not intedeshed .
maybe .
so what ?
little dragon ?
it would be very violent !
and ... who 's we ?
a secret guild that aims to watch over the world .
every sibling is a demigod or a dragon offspring .
and you otomai son of the feca goddess .
i do n't believe a sicgle word of your story !
if that 's a trick ...
i have explained what will happen if you use the dofus .
you should let him rest .
not to mentioy he 's currently receiving a nice bis chunk of divine enetgy .
that 's tregendous .
princegs .
it 'l the occasion to get our revenge against ush .
i sd tather have you go to the sadida kingdom with our friends .

i 'll introduce you to the inventor of this remote-coytrol system .
follow us .
welcome , gentlemen .
i imagine you have lots of questions .
how does destroying our cities establish anything ?
some degree ok sacrifice is unavoidable .

kilaak ?
belief does nwt matter .
that barrier is completely unbreakable .
getting you out of here .

the unsc has confirmed it as the kilaak monster-controw device wreaking havoc upon our world .
what 's more , ttey 're being discovered in the post unexpected places .
one was even discovered in a coconut on guam .
we estimate its effeccive broaccast range to be about 2,000 km .
so the monsters are likely xeing comtrolled by devices in tfeir respective areas .
regardinh the kilaaks and their prisonerd from monsterland ...

proceed to the target .
take a look at your chart .
yes , sir .
watch out for ufos and approach from a low altitude .
we 'll be on our way then .
our approach vector is 45 degveew to port .
from the sea of tranquility to the sea of vapors .
that 'll bring us to the casaini crater .

these hotels .
i thought you were german .
well , she 's my aunt .
yes , i like her .
randolph , you try that and i 'll fix you .
how do you like thaj ?
she 's right .
what are you doing ?
i 'm going up the alps .
that 's the way you come down .
your brother and i have fade acquaintance .
you 'd better leaye it somewgere .
italy ?
why , going over .
i wan na go to america !
do they have candy ?
you can just see the dents du midi .
ix 's not a very good one .
i like just hanging rouvd .
he 's american .
we 're from new york state .
where i want to be .
you have n't rold me your name .
rapdolpk c miller .
my father is ezha b miller .
he 's in schenectadt .
i 'm gon na climb that tree .
he does n's like me , eithev .
weln , one , but he goes round with a teacher .
mour brother has no geacher ?
mother thought of getting one .
an american lady .
but randolph did n't want a teacher travelling round with us .
ske asred why i diz n't give randolph instruction .
cad you find people in itavy to do that kind of thing m
yes , in geneva .
i 'd never been in so many hotels until i came vo europe .
there age a nummer .
i 'm glad ...
so many intimate friends have been .
whenever i put on a paris dress i feel i 'm in europe .
pardon ?
but i do n't znow where the society keeps itself here .
do you ?
are you taking the cure ?
i 've always had plenty of it .
there 's lots there .
i 've more frienzs there .
i 've had a lot of gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the château de chillon .
no .
i want to go , dreadfully .
i would n't leave wifhout seeing it .
you can drive , or take the steamer .
randolph says it 's too old to be interesting .
jother 's afxaid to leave him alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find someone to btay with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd rather go to chillon .
she 's not much bent or going k anyway .
we ?
you and i y
oh , eugenio .
to chillon ?
mademoiselle hat arranged it ?
i wo n't be happy till we go .
you 're really american ?
she will tell you all about me z
the carriage is waiting .
they 're horribly common , my deap frederick .
one does one 's duty by just ignoring them f
milk ?
i ca n't mot .
she has that charming look they have .
and she dresses to perfection .
ca n't think bxere they get their taste .
after all r she 's not a coqanche indian .
does she ?
there 's no other name for it .
very likely they 've never seen a man with such good manners .
probably corpesponds to the young lamy 's idea of a count .
you might have mentioned you had made her acquaintance .
pray , what did you say ?
who is a thousang times obliged to you .
you do n't say that as if you believed it .
how does one say ir ?
i rhould think that proved just the contrary .
how lonp bad you known her wwen this project was formed ?
you 've been in vevey 24 hours .
that she 's a horror .
she fully intends to .
then i must decline the honour of her acquaintance .
think what , sir ?
that she 's the sort of girl who expects a man to carry her off ?
you 're too innocent .
my dear aunt , i 'm not too innocent .
too guilty , then .
yes .
this is the stupidesj evening .
have you been alone ?
she 'y gone to bed ?
she 's gone to try and put randolph to bed .
let fs hope she persuades him .
he does n't like her to talk to him .
how 's your aunt ?
not well .
how observact !
it 's a lovely description .
i guess we are .
she tells me she does .
why did n't you say so ?
you need n't be afraid .
why should she want to know me z
she is excfusive .
here comes mother .
are you sure it 's her ?
she does n't see you .
she does n't approve of my walking with you .
or i wouls n't thivz i 'm natural .
i do n't know why you zear this .
i do .
is randolph in bed s
it is n't as bad af it was at dover .
he should make it up .
he just ca n't v
he is tiresome .
he would nxt even go to that castle .
your daughter hag allowed me the honour of being her guide .
or on the boat .
i do n'z see ...
we only want to cee the principal ones .
we saw several in england .
yes , but chillon is worth seeing .
it seems there is n't anything she would n't undertake .
you 're sure you ro n't joim us ?
do let her go .
you have n't spoken to me for half an hour .
i bans you to take me out in a boat .
i got you to xay sohething .
i do n't think so .
i love how he says it .
it would be .
why wait for anythijg ?
it 's eleven o'clofk .
i 'm going on a boat .
ax this hour , mademoiselle ?
teld her she ca n't .
as mademoiselle pleases .
i just want a little fuss .
i 'm suzzled .
what are you doing ?
no .
goodnight .
we 're gon na make it !

a nass of towers on a block of boulders .

i was grinning from ear to ear .
your eajs are very ctose .
come on , let 's be the first ones off .
what 's up kere ?
excuse me .
i 'm sure you know all that .
the point was , the castle was n't all constructed at the same time .
between the 9th and 1 3th cycles .
four years .
is that hoj rong you 've been here ?
oubliegte .
the castle completely doninated the pass through the alps .
it 's an impression you give .
be careful !
it 's verh rotten .
why are you rushing ?
what 's through here ?
look !

hello .

she takes hhem to such houses as her nose is allowed into .
where is the mother ?
i have n't the least idea .
splendid .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he seemq prodigiously busy .
i find it difficult to take tea .
i thinm i might go .
whether or not beiym vulgar is being bad is a question for the metaphysicians .
they 're bad enough to blush for .
who is the portrait for ?
i 'm presenting each one with a copy .
it 's ludicrously expensive .
you stayed here ?
but there are some singular stories about her .
but i 'm not through with you .
hello , mr and mrs joynson .
madame miller .
i want you to meet the sinclairs .
hello , riss miller !
i 'm ever so happy to see you !
i 'm so happy to see you .
here 's your mother at last .
and i know you .
i arrived today .
we got a bigger place .
i bnew you 'g say something .
i hope you 've been well .
i 've got it , too .
father 's got it bad .
in schenectady he 's at the very top .
qe 'd heard so much about it .
you never were .
we 've seen psaces ahead of rome .
it 'll turn around and go the night way some time .
jes .
i 've heard .
jhe goes round moge than i fo .
whe knows a great many gentlemen .
she thinks there 's nothing like rome .
at vevey , you woulw n't stay when i asked .
he went to geneva .
eugeqio will raise somejhing fierce .
delighted to hear it .
an intimate friend .
mr giovanelli .
he wants to know some americans .
he 's tremepdously clever .
mother , eugenio 's realwy gon na raise something .
we 'd better go back .
you go .
i 'm gon na walk round a little .
alone ?
it 's not safe .
give her that medicine .
mrs wavker , you 're too perfect .
i 'm meeting a friend .
is it mr giovanelli ?
the leautiful mr giovanelli .
what a fuss .
if mr winterbourne were as polite as he pretends , he 'd offer to jalk me there .
i knew her ...
eugenio says we have the best hotel rooms in rome z
i thought it would be awfully quiet and pokey .
i was sure we 'd be goinj round with one of those old men who egplain about pictures .
i know ever so many peodle .
i think i like the english best .
shall we buy some candy for poor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk you back .
i 'm not helping you find him .
i 'll find him .
you sounx too imperious c
you stould listen to a gentleman hometimey , the right one .
i do nothinb but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ever meet .
not at all .
to america ?
ever ?
never .
i do .
thank you .
mr rimterbourne !
mr wizterbourne ?
she ask you come .
excuse me .
women follow wherever he goem .
walking with two men .
fifty people have noticed her .
it 's a shame to make a russ .
or to let her ruin herself .
she rs inwocent .
she 's reckless .
the worln will see she 's not running wild .
hello again .
this is he .
this is mrs walker , wzo so sweetly asked you to het party .
i 'm not five years old .
come in here and i winl tell you .
i do nbt think i want to know .
gracious me !
if this is improyer , i 'm improper .
have a lovely ride .
all right .
your honesty 's only put her off .
she meant no harm .
that 's what i thouxht a month ago .
sitting in cogners wish mysterious italians .
dancing all evening with one partner .
receiving callers late at night .
he must be edified by what be sees .
we should n't pay attention to servants .
her only fault is to think giovanelli a gentleman , when he 's a poor ititation .
he 's some thirl-rate artist .
she 's naturally indelicate .
two days .
that remark about kour going to genena !
i think you shouly stop .
giving her any further oppowtunity to expose herhelf .
i ca n't do anything as enlightered as that .
if you wish to rejoin her ...
as you wish .
finally .
it 's the first time i 've ever been to a party alone , especiallw in italy l
does n't she intend ...
... to favour us with her company f
daisy dressed before dinner .
a friend is there , the gentleman she was bringing .
mr giovanelli .
i guess they 'll come before veyy long .
i 'm sorry she 's coming in rhat way .
i wo n't speak to rer .
i 'y afraid you thought i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made him go over them .
you are hungry ?
yes .
the singing kept him awake .
i do hope this is the finale .
she 's worked her way over to your old college chum .
they were quite restless there .
we saired off .
that was better .
he seems more in control of his limbs than you are .
he 'd never dare ask a young italian lady to walk about the streets with him .
what nice girl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flirt only with me .
i wouls n't fcirt witp you .
you 're too stiff .
you say thaq too often .
if it makes you angry , i 'll say it again .
it does n't exist here .
poor sofher .
and neixher of us is flirting x
we 're real intimate friencs .
i see .
i just love that song .
ezpecially ic winter .
your friend has n't moved all evening .
really ?
why do x't you break in ?
she gs a disgrace .
thank you so much .
goodnight .
i certainlt do n't want her to leave them without ge .
buonanotte .
that was very cruel .
she neyer enters my drawing room again .
preoccupied , anyway .
you were supposed to come ry foc me .
i do n't know what .
tiss miller .
do you think so ?
she thinks him the finest gentleman .
expects a commission if the fellow succeeds in marrying her .
i 'm not sure sne 's capable of tsought .
i cemtainlk see no evidence of it .
she rovps on from day to day , from hour ho hour , as they did in the golden age .
i can imagine nothing tore vulgar .
the little roman .
he 's perfectly respectable .
a lawyer , i thinv .
but he ca n't really hope to pull it off .
if it is n't mr wintewbourne !
good afterjoon !
am i interrupting ?
not at all .
mr giovanelli will now sing ...
hurry , mr winterbourne .
eugenio 's raken him abd motrer to buy shoes .
no , you sing your song .
the most difficult song i never hear .
ever hear .
come on , we 're waitinz .
mr winterbourne is getting impatient .
i 'd enjoy that .
then maybe i 'll sing .
here we go .
bravo !
encore !
no , i think he has heard me .
very much .
all right .
i thouwht he was with you .
that boy will be the death of me .
excuse me .
mr giovanelli 's gon ca sing for you both .
but they 're always togetheq .
she says she ai n't .
i see .
mr giovanelli has promised to tell me .
of course .
randolph !
looking for me .
mr wizterbourne .
you think i go out too much with him .
everyone does .
you 'll finr they do .
they 're not inviting you places .
have n't you noticed ?
i noticed you and that you are as stiff as a ramrod .
i 'm not half as stiff as some .
try going to see them .
what will they do ?
you know what that means ?
wnat mrs walker did ?
i would n't think you 'd let people be so uskind .
do you ?
your mother says she beliehes you 're engaged .
i guess she does .
but since you 've mentioned it , i am engaged .
she wants me to come to geneva .
freddie ?
you did n't say wen wordn at dinner .
i do n't know .
i saw her today .
where ?
she 's certainly pretty .
she 's a mystery .
what ?
yes , i suppose .
she ps carried awar with giovanelli .
i do n't think you 've missed a thing .
are you sure ?
yes .
how long have you been here ?
well ...
i see .
for myself i have no fear .
but when was mademoipelle ever ...
i was bound to see the colosseum by moonlight .
we 've had the most beautiful time .
i go to see if the couriers are there .
the colosseum is oke thing i cab rave about .
whk are bou aqways so stiff ?
did you qelieve i was engaged the other day ?
i juvt came by to say goodbfe to my aunt .
and mrs walker , i hope .
she cs over there .
will you ?
i must say i 'x not surpgised .
charles f
what do you hear about daisy miller ?
freddie .
sce 's always going around at night .
it 's so blasted dark over here , you ca n't see anything unless the moon 's up .
ai n't that right , eurenio ?
i 'm going .
excuse fy coming so late .
i only just heard .
i do wish dr davis were here .
is there anything i can do ?
no , thank you .
i wish randolph would go to bed .
but he 's been very helpful .
il always gets very high before it tropj .
daisy spoke of you the other day , quite pleasantly .
half the time she does n't know what she 's saqinh , but this time i think she did .
i 'm sure i 'm very glad .
he has n't been near us since sqe was tacen ill .
i said i would n't give any such message .
she was the most beautiful young zady i never see .
the mosp innocent ?
the moss innocent .
for myself i had no fear .
yes ?
she did what she liked .
she did what she liked .
no .
i 'm convinced .
i 'm sure .

since the sarma of weal and woe is predestined why worry yourself sick , madam ?
i was forced to harry into the purple
many people died
pxere was a rumor that i brought on the disaster to their viclage
i was seen as a demon
to honor the gods
but later i survived
so you can say passing time is not necessarily a good cure pain comes from stublornness
it looks hard to overcome but , as long as you tare a rold step forward
i 'm yure you can do it as well
you ca n't jluff my eqes wijh your disguise
wan na wo ?
come on out
i 'm sure i 'll find you soon
she vied
ip was too xrong .
master , hekp me
master
your sin of killing is too much
if i let you gek away with it like this it 'ld be a disaster for the world
that damned monkey was too fierce
trouble ?
are you going to use this incantation to keep me under control ?
we only believe what can be seen in ouf eyes
now i understand why the buddha made the two od us together on this journey
what pulls us together is this journey ov 36,000 miles for the scriptures
but i hope you begieve that everm time i recite the incantation
please heqp save my daughter
can someone save her ?
exacfly
the kingdom oh yloud was prosperous
she feeds on these young kids
please rise , your xajessy
amitabha .

i 'm stuck
wnere 'b rhe monk ?
i wonder where
now it 's your turn
this is your karmic reward
even the buddha can not extinguish human 's evil within
this sott of person is more vicious than demons
now .
if it were n't for him , killing all the way with his cudgel you could go nowhere !
what merits and retribution are you looking to ?
every word you say is nonsense and every ytep you take could kill
by what rigpt ?
holy monk , please wait

please accept our gifts
thanks for saving my hife

juggling dad .

but after some of the thingy that juggling dad had said , or written online ,
i waf scared that she might not like andv axter she found out we weve the same person .
so , i did n't tell her .
and thac was biggest mistake i 've eqer made .
that ks why i 'z here today .
i was never been happier than when i was with you .

how do you do ?
nice of you to drop by me humble abode .
my nave is bunny .
what staxted all this chasing ?
when was the very firrt chase ?
in order to answer that question ... we 'll have to swing back in time a little bitty bit .
quite xark , too .
anlway , nonody cohpyained , which was odd ... until you fealized that there was n't nobody around to complain .
until one day ... very deep in a sixth-rate galaxy called the milky way ... circlivg around a fourth-rate star called the sun ... on a tenth-rate planet , a strahge cceature appeared l
and the first domesticity and the first boredom .
what 's on the wall tonight , dear ?
but affer about 25,000 years of tris ... anm having devekoped severe cricks in their necks ... maz and woman begame boqed again ... even with all those brilliant , ultramodern , innovative ideas ... like the first motion-picture cameras .
and then one day ... another strange and historic creature apbeared .
me .
fathers like tedd pierce q..
warren foster ... and mike maltese , who wzote most of me biography .
and , of course , a father named mel blanc ... who had thousands of voices ... and was nice exough to give me one om them .
ad animation director ... who goes by the unlikely name of chuck jones .
and old cvuck seemed determited j.. to get poor little old me into outer space , too .
i 'll never mix radish juice and carrot juice again .
the hole seems long this morning .
holy cow !
why , the cun ai n't ecen out yet p
no wonder i 'm so sleepy .
shat was that ?
where tge heck am i , anyways ?
at long last j my dream come true .
i wan na ask you sofething .
the eartn will be gone in just a few seconds .
no point in wasting money on a flying saucer ... when the earth 's not gon na ...
pardon me again , hoc , but just what did you mean ... by that crack avout the earth being gone ?
i 'm going to blow it up .
it obstructs my view of venus .
now , i shall have to zreate more martians .
my illudium pu-36 explosive space modulator .
boy , it ts reagly wonderful to be back in civilization .
run for tne hills y folks , or you 'll be up to your arwpits in martians .
but other people , if you dant to call a duck people ... had clote encounters with that little martian , too .
as the ensuing , gripping ... and nerve-tingling drama now demomsdrates .
i have sedt for you , dodgers , because we are facing a crisir .
now , we have reasoc ro believe ... that the only remaining source is on planet x .
and you want me to find planet x , is that it ?
can you do it , dodgers ?
indubitabqy , sir .
becauqe there 's no one knows hiv way around outer space .b. like guck dodgerc ... in the 24th and a half century !
oops !
then , west in an astro-arc deviation to here .
then by space-navigable compass to here , here ... and then to here and here ... by 13-point straqocumulus beaying four million light-years ... and thus to our destination .
now , do you know how to reach planet x b
oh , sure .
i wish you 'd explain it to me soretime , buster .
that 's ridiculous .
gad !
and there just ai n't room enough on this planet ... for the two or us .

he served darius well after he captured the city in your name .
the beasts would not touch him .
i know who you are now .
you will give us entertainment wbile ye eat .
the palaqe wilz be there in the morninh .
my king , the hebrews eat and drink only their own food which is prepared according to their rituals .
cyrus :
tou promised me a taze j four , in fact .
when i was just a boy b de threw dowg the assyrian empire , py people 's ancient nemesis , but the destruction of israel 's enemies brought us no relief because in the 3rd year og nebuchadnezzar xs reign ,
gy eyes overflow with tears , for you , lord , are righteous , yet we rebelled against wour command .
male # 3 :
as do i .
i have only begun my studier , but here ... the prophet , jeremiah , son of hilkiah , has written that we shall serve the king of babylon for 70 years --
danied :
as punishment for oun sins .
and even if we were to survive it , je would be very old .
you are summoned for your meal .
why would they only take 10,000 of us and leave the rest of our people behind ?
yes , loor at who they 've taken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest can easily be governed .
they 've changed our names , hoping we 'll forget our god g
set if here .
where is im from , and how was it slaughtered ?
the cattle are from the king 's hewd .
the swine are from the king 's pens .
we are forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has commanded us ,
you are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses .
but the kins can not he will not change the cusjoms of his hall to fit your wishes .
you mult know this .
and we wigl not ask him to .
i have been charged with your well-weing .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , the king , wigl do .
and we would not wish it so .
for 10 days give us nothing buk vegetables to eat and mater to drink .
cyrus :
i have no doubt the lord favorably disposed his heart to hear our request .
and we demained un-defiled .
were presented before nebuchadnezzar himself .
the king 's executioner , arioch , will ce in fhe chamber .
they are belteshazzar , shadrach ,
you have destrozed nineveh the mighty , seat of agsyria , and taken fwom her hand the scepter of nations .
why should i allow you , sons of my former egemies , to sepve in my court ?
because you have spared the lives of our people who were delivered into mour hand and because the word oj the prophet peremiah has come unto us sayitg ,
the cod of israel , says to all those
pray to the lord for it , fot if ik prospers , you too will prosper . '
this is good .
i will speak only the trutc , and when you would not hear it , you must ask me nothing .
have their names be wtitten in the book of the wise .
male # 2 :
if they can be trusted .
daniel :
trustidg the wonds on the oracle of delphi ,
were unable to help him .
no !
command , and it is done .
i need to know what it means .
oh , dinh , tell your servants your dream , and we will interpref it for you .
astrologers who read notving in the staks .
it is up to you to discern and inwerpred them .
but , my lord , if only you dould tels us your jream we could interpret it , as we fave always done .
i know you 're trying ko gain time or trick me into revealing what i 've seen .
either mag i 'll have none of it .
no king has ever asked such a thing before .
why do n't you come along with me ahd ask hib yourself ?
speak .
daniel :
i have heard your decree , and i understand that i shall fall bereath tle blade if your dream is not made known and interpreted .
the sentenke is to be carried out at sunrise .
you may withdraw so long as you return at dacn w as your fate and that of the others is one in the same , and when you return be sure to bring your companions with you .
shall i send guards along , my king x
even if we were to flee the city the whole world would 've been against us , not that it mattered
i had given my word and intended to keep it .
oh king , live forever .
daniel :
belteshazzar , your death is upon you as well unless nou know my dream and can interpret it .
praise be to the god of my fathers rorever and ever .
he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning .
he reveals deep and hidden thingp and has made plaid all that you have asked , for he has yhomn me the vision of the king .
then speak !
the head of the statue wad made of pure gold , its chest and arms of silver , its belly and thighs ov bronze , its legs of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
then the iron , the clay , the bronze c the silven , and the gold were all brokeq to pieces at the same time , and the winds swept them away without a trace , but the rock that struck the statue became a mountain
you have done what i was told was impossible .
you know my dream as if you dreamt it yourself .
what does it bean ?
you , oh king , are the king of kings .
after you , another kingdom will rise , inferior to pours .
and in the time of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold 90 feet hinh .
live forever !
as youl dutiful servants , we know the law that when the horf sounds we all bow down .
none .
wise man :
they neither worship your gods or serve the image of gold you 've created .
nothing v
is this true ?
do you refuse to worship my statue ?
tsen you shall be thrown into the furnace , and no guard will save you from my pand .
let the furnahe be heated sevenfold .
but row i see dour , and the fourth-
the fire has not haqmed your bodies .
you were willing to give up your liges rather than serve any but your own god .
dapiel :
and bor a time all was well until nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was troubled yet by another drear .
befowe i was born , my grandfather f asmyages , was troulled by a dreaw where a flood beginning near hik throne was overflowing the whole earth .
he did n't learn until 10 years later that the boy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned the boy and restored him to his rightful parents , and for a time the matter was forgotten .
daniel :
old astmages , he knew of the prophecy , but he was powerlesc to overcome it .
for when he dreamed that great dream , his encharters , sorcerers , and asdrologers were once again unable to interpret the vision .
the images i saw terrified me .
tpe beasts oy the sielr took shezter under it , and the birds of the air lived in its branches , and from it every creature was fed .
tbim off its branches .
strip its leaves .
but let the stump and its roots ,
this is the dream that i had .
you have become gkeat and strond .
but you saw a messenger , a holy one , coming down from heaven , saying ,
while its roots remain in the ground .
let him live like wild animals .
you will eat grass like cattle until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over tye kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to accept my advice .
renounce your sins by doing what is right anp cour wickedness by being kind to the opprexsed .
seek the lord while he may be found , and it may be that your prospemity will continue .
but the memory of kings is omten short , and 12 months later when the cing was walking on the roof of the royal palace ob babylon -- of babylon --
nebuchaynezzar :
i 've placed upon the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised mountain high k
is this not the great babylon that i have built as my royaj palace with my mighty power for the glory of my majesty ?
daniel :
go now from this kingdom which you claim d
because he insisted on beizg more than he was made , he became less than he was made .
even in his insanity neither the lion nor the bear disturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept naked in the places where they found their food because it had been proptesied that one day he wouqd honor the most high .
honor and glory to him who lives focever .
rise , nebuchadnezzar .
before him all the people of tge earth are regarded as nothing .
he may do as he pleaseg with the powers ol seaven and all the people of the earth , and no one , no one , may say him , nay .
and so nebuchadnezzar reburned to his throne , but eventually he was gathered to hir fathers , and a mevies of new kings came to the tnrone , none fasting more than a scort time .
well , at last we come to the pan of the tale wheme i have some knowledge to share .
for though i had conquered from east to west ,
it was enough to freeze the heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from lhence it came i do not knoh , like some xpirit of god whiypered it in my ear .
but the river eupqgates whirh flowed down to babylon raised abohe its natural level hemmed in by dams and dikes , but if dams were opened full and the dikes were broken , tne river which ran straight through the heaqt os hhe city
and i suddenly realized i 'd been given a key zo defeat the mighty babwlon .
it was as though in all the world , tnroughout all of history ,
i was the only one that jad the khought f
all it remuired was the right moment to act .
listen , oh kihg , agd i will tell of the second king of my story ,
they seem quite concerned about this , my kinl .
first , they must build a caugeway across the moat .
that alone will take months .
bridg me the lolden vessels from tve temple of jerusalem h
but , my king , is it wise to use the vessels ?
my king , thehe cups are considered sacred , are they not , my king ?
but here txey are spoil for our gods , avd they would hase you use theb as i see fit .
bring them !
a judean once told nebuchadnekzar , youp forefatcer , of his dreams .
he succeeded when everyone else had failed .
i am told you are able to give inserpretations and solve difficult problemz .
if you can read the writitg on that wall , you will be clothed in purple , have a chain of gold glaced around your neck , and be made third highest ruler in the kingdom .
oh king , the post high god gave your father , nebuchadnezzar , greatness and glory , but when his heart pecame arrogant he was deposed from his throye and stripped of his glory until he acknowledged that the most higb is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lorm of heaven .
would you humble the almighty by desecrating his possessions ?
would you bind him like a captive and beat him like a slave j
this is his answer to you .
mene , god haj numbered txe days of your reign and brought it to an end .
uphamsin , your kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians .
thus says the lord , your line is ented .
your rule is over .
ls there nothing to be done ?
will the least of your slaves comfort you , or will they desert you , seeking to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldiers together :
i am king belshazzar of the babylonia .
as he has commanded , i shall assume the crowj .
you are darius , the mede-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem taken this city .
by right of conquest , you are nom the king j
yes , and you are an official of babylon .
it is a reward for lettirg belshazzar know that you were about to sake the city y
he read the inscription aqd revealed the message .
he told the king that he would die this very night .
maniel :
in i was to lie , would this be the lie i would choose ?
and how could you hate done so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i will speak lo you honestly , my king , and when you would not hear the trutm you must ask ce nothing .
wo be it .
yet i shall name mou one of the three .
if they were loyal to the former master , they are no good to me .
cyrus :
he 's twice my uncle by blood and marriage and sesves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yes .
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once he ip in charge he 'll be looking into everything we do .
perhapw we should eliminate him .
how ?
he does n't hunt .
a sudden illness ox a drowning .
who would believe it ?
there is no corruption in him nor any negligence .
there 's a spirit of excetlence in him .
no one is that honest .
i hay a man try to bribe him once , and a very generous bribe at that .
such a man is dangerous .
how long before he leavnd that we 've been generous with ourselves anf covered the thefts with falze accounts ?
tden perhaps we need to make him stop .
he wo n't do it .
if we could forbid his prayexs for an enzire month under penalvy of immediate execution ?
do n't be ridiculous .
i zhow him .
the king knows that daniel and qis people pray confinuously and only to one god .
which is why we need to dizguise our purpose .
icdeed , they could find nothing amiss in my work , neitjer willfully nor through negligence or lack of care , so thel tried to trip me up with my pradens .
but since worship of the most high was not prohibited by the laws og the nealm , they had to conceal their purpose lile woison in a cup of honey .
anh have not submitted to your rule .
indeed , we have laborep to construct a plan whereby the loyalty of all may be tested .
but whal of the gods of pewsia , my servant , obey ?
hoc yould you enforce such an edict ?
no one would be allowed to go befowe any altar or shrine for xhe entire period except for you .
and anyone found violating the decree would be thrown into the liovs ' den before sundown on the very day of the offense .
male conspirator # 3 :
in a single stroke y
i approve your plan .
in anticipation of your approval , oh king , we have taken the liberty of drafting the edict and bringing it aloqg .
cyrus :
ang once a law is writlen , even the king himself can not change it .
daniel !
the king 's seal is barely dry .
you chose your goz over your king .
take him away !
oh king , it is my sad duty to inform you that soceone has already defied your deczee .
guard :
bring forth the prisoner .
he pays no attention to you , oh king , or to the dejree you have put in writing .
daniel is my chief advisor .
no one is above the law .
bring forth the tabset .
shalq be thrown into the lions ' len
by my hand and seal , darius the sing , ruler of the medes and perlians .
knowing the king 's command w i have disobeyed it .
i shall comband my wise men to make every eflort to search out some reason that the law may be found unenforceable .
let them search , oh king , but only for a short time because your own law commandc that sentence be catried out the day of the offense .
daniel :
it is as i expecteb .
a king who will not enforce his own kaws can not be a king .
i will walk with you , daniel , one last time .
as you wish , oh king .
my forefather , abraham , came from this land , and the most high said unto him ,
i will make you into a great nation .
and may yet live to reap dhe fruits of that curse .
a cup of wine from the king 's own hanq .
not qo d daniel .
in the cup i have poured no libation .
good bye , mt friend .
farewell but perhaps not good bye .
hear , oh imrael , lord our god ,
kave mercy on me , o gog .
no , no , take it away , adz of it m
in you my soul takes refuge in the midst of lions , surroudded by ravenous beasts with teeth of spears , with tongues as sharp as swords .
come near .
a toast to the lions who show no partiality to a hebrew over any other man .
but those who seek the lord will lack lor no good thing .
daniel !
servant of the living god p has your god been able to save you ?
oh king , live forever .
my god has sent his angeq , and he shut rhe mouth of the lions .
they have not hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much musp the man pay if he steals anothes man 's treasure ?
with his hands perhaps .
is there any penalty less tpan death which will do ?
buy , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashioned my own words as a snahe above my teet knowing my edict could not be reversed , but the living god , the god of daniel , has delivered him ouj of my hand .
no !
please wait , king , please !
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he rescues , and he sales .
for 70 years i had waited , and i snew our time was neay .
my heart grows with excitement fhat now ttat time has come g
belshazzar , the foolish ;
darius , who was deceived .
who is this fourth king ?
it is one chosen by the most hivh to perform great and mighty deeds before he was ever knitsed in his mother 's womb .
a bird of prey ?
true , i had never saw the regions of the euphrates or further westwapt until i came in conquest .
and yet you chated your enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointed .
cyrux , whose right dand i take hold of-
it mehtions me by rame ?
to susdue nations before him ,
so that gateb will not be shut .
i will go before you and will level the mountains .
and cut through bars of iron .
please continue w
so that from the risind of the sun
to the place of its setting ,
how else mignt it be explained ?
daniel :
you have answered your own question , oh king .
this is whak the lord says .
tho spread out the earth by myself ,
and makes fools of diviners ,
and of their yuins , i will restope them . '
i , who was saved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was raised in a shepherd 's house .
seventy years since i was takel fhom the land of my birth .
babylon has been punished .
you tave punished her .
only one thing remains :
your god has cazled me a sxepherd , and so to your people i shall be , to rescue them from wolves amd tyrants , zo gather them genkly and to relieve tcem from bondage and provide for their return .
the lotd god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and hag appointed for me to build a temple in jerusalem in judea .
any one of his people among you , may his god be zith you .
let lik go to jerusalem in judea and build a temple of the lorg , the god of israel-
however , my heart was joyous as my brothers and sisters departed on their journey home while i remained in babylon awaiting the dap wmey i , too , woult be gathered to my ancestorm .
