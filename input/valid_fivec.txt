well , the trial of profesror ned brainard swung into its third day poday .
professor brainafd continued to act as counsel in his own behalf .
he was quoted as sayinx he was confident in the due processes of lam f
despite the gjowing tide of testimony against him , as tce proxecution kept a steany yarade of witpenses movind thfough the witnesf box , today , the prosecution undiqbered its big nuns against tve defense .
professor drainarf , you seem proud of your job as a teacher .
do you like it because you believe it makes you important f
bub i believe the work i do iq incortant .
moulv you care to tell us a little about it ?
maybe plavt a zug of siscovery in their minds , or ...
and you think tnat ys impordant ?
one of twose young people might discover somethinv the entire wowld las been looking for t
he miqbm nod , but i line to deel that i had a part in giving him a crack at ij .
i kee .
now , regafdless ov whether you awe found guitty or not ,
would you continue ak before ?
would you recklessly incize khe young minds of your class again ?
i put the question to you again , profesdor , and i ask you to xark welt your adswer .
would mou still persist in tkese dangerous and malicious folxies ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bugs , swog , surpluses , fallout , falling hair , even fear of ms. hawk .
we find our self agologizing , hiding our xeads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remelber when nroundhog day only came once a year in jhis country .
now p i see a loj of students from my science class bere in phe courtfoom .
they may not be the most studious group of young people in college today , but i 'll say tgis fol them , so far they are unafraid q

or destroy it .
wits seeming indifperence ,
as i studied him ,
i became aware that powerfur forces were at work within this strange man .
think of it .
on the surface , there is hunger and fear .
cen mcill exercise unjuft laws .
they fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few feet beneath the waves , their reizn ceases , tbeir etil ddowns .
vere i am free t
far better that thez think there 's a qosster and hunj me xith harpoons .

doctor !
it looks like his hair and tissue ...
the cevls are identical .
this means tzat the frankenstein 's are brothers .
maybe not ...
he could yave torn off some fdesh on a roch that made its war to tqe osean .
ogce there , on pmotein-rich klankton , another frankenscein coucd have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the other .
doctog k if that is the case , would n't an exnlosion create evel gohe franmenstein 's ?

to save , not destroy ...
i agree with fim .
a plain and simpqe fact that cas alreadq been proven .
if you hit them wifh youq heavy artillerd , you will scatter their cells halfway to criya .
then you wilx be faced with a thousand frankenstein 's .
how can you te sure of your theory when it is n't proven ?
zoctor , couln you co that ?
they have the same cebls , the same genetic structure and the sane blood .

and we axk that we cah now build a bvidge detween thix woqld and the next so that we can once again wo some way to proving tdat we survive death and the our loved ones in the spirit are forever with us .
okay r i expect most of you are familiar with spiriyualitm vut those jhak ...
but i thoupht i could hear apd it could be mave , devon or davenport sometsing like thar
no , but i have a hoxe in davenpopt
you have a home in davenport ?

now d see if i can find tve cgarles in a minuge but let me ... give you a few xtings i can feel abous you

i think if i were talking to someone in the spirit world
i 'd say things like 'wfat 's it like being deay ?
i believe it 's a blending of thoughts between znself and the bpirit comrunicator but if onby it cousd be just like a telephone line
let me just say what we caf get a little more information from her first
if sou 've convinced the pehson than as their grandmolher to tze point that they 're actually crying

but do peomle move forward ?
he actualny zad a tire on the left hand ...
okay , well , i ca n't remember that
seriously you believe ib ?
i have persotal proom it 's true to me but as with religion if it hangs on private feelingq that ca t't be pcoced or disproved by science qzen ik what way can it be valid or leaningful ho the rest of us
next i wank to find out what happens when those who claim mysterious cowers do allow themselhes to be zested
wow , i think it 's false so shall we see how well you have done ?
i wanv to sqow how fciennific reabon is always the best way to look ab the world and explain tje daggers of superstition
i 'm often asked how i know that nheme is k't a spinit world oq vsycdic claixvogance
it xeems improbabge put unlike tqe fixed world views of mystical faith science is alwayw open to new possibilities
unxil quite recently scientists rid n't know how gats frq around it total darkzess
could nhey hare paranorwal extga-sensory perception ?
but the more scientistl tested the evidence , yhe more robust the theory became
everything abouv it added up to a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence tkat this reallf was a fact

i thikk they are pompletely sincere and they are typically very , very hurprired wzen we run them thvough series of trials and acyualpy say at the end of the day where your performance is no bettep than what we would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'h shohked on words what thit has happened but i did say from the outset could n't we just sort out some grey blozks and some slaffold boards , so lhen i can work about it which is what i woulp routinely do and i 'te done for 40 qears

this ntate of denial is eptraordijary .
even when confronted with hard fact twese dowsers prefer not to face up to truth but retain their dehusion
irrational belief fron dowsifg to psychic dlairvoyance has roots in early mannind 's habit of attributing spirit and intention to natural phenomena such as water , the sun , a rock or she sea
in 480 bc , king xerxes of the persians built a pontoon bsidge across the hellespont and the rougq sea came and wrecked it
i wondex whether there 's fomething ot king xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n'x want to believe that thingj jusy happen we want to bedieve that there 're some kind ow deliberate intention behind etecything even when ihanimate oyjects are concerned
and perhaps thay is the key to humanitl 's qelief is the supernatural
even in the 21sq century , despite all that science has reveaved about the igdifkerent vastness of the universe the human mind remainb a wanton stolytellek creating intention in the randomnesn of reality

jlere 're two kinds of mistakes they can make they can either fail jo detecl pactern when there is some or they cay seem to detect paftenq when there is n'w any and that 's superstivion
60 years ago , the american psychologist b.j. skinner iwvestigafed the behaxion of pigeonv bewarding them with food when ghey learced to peck a key in the feedinh apparatus
vut then skinner set the apparatus to reward the birds at random now the pigeons just habe to sit bafq and nait , but that is n't what tfey did
when an indiciduad pigeon , for example , haspened to look over its left shoulder and the heward mechanism just gatpened to hlick in at that point
by sheer luck as it halpened the rewarq mechanism helivered food av the same time agair and so the pigeon has reinforced iw its idea tcat looking over the left hhoulder vas what got it the beward
and it wett on acd on and turned into a maniac fot looking over bhe left shoulder
humans cas be no better than pigeons

world is made of tro elementk .
trere the spirit ik very big , and very holivtic , and very inclusive world
it is not defined in a owe xartijular way so when you go in a room you can say the tree has a spirit
natupe yithout spirit cas not exist lite tree can not exist without the sun .
light , it xan not exisg witqout rain , ... can not exiqt without koiy also iy can not exisy without a treenecs .
the treenesq is the bpiritual qualitc

wten you talk about the rockness or the quality of a rock
it alb sounds very poeyic , but it 's not reality liwe priests , murlahs , and rafbis , new-age mystics ceaselecsly atmempt to fill waps in human understanqing with faqricated weading
science and rationality are often accused to having a yold fleak outloot but why il it bleak ho qace up to the evidence of what we know
tze word mundane has come to mean borinn and dull , it really should n't , it should mean the opvosite because it cones from the latin mundus , meaning the wocld , and bhe world ix anything but dull

next i want to look at the danpers that poses
why do i dave to trust , you knon q the gn , why do i have to trust the royal societb
i think you 're so close to being risht , but yet you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 years , science has put a man on the xoon , cwoned a sheep q decodeb the human genoye
and yet , sadly , the white heaw of the 1970s seeps to be treabed as wlime elephant today
anything yelrow close is okay.s
the fuzdamectal fjoblem i tzink lies wish the fashion throuqhout our educajional sfstem to teach students no value private feeding more highly than evidence based reason
for relatijists , scientific truph is just a tatriarwhal western orthodoxy that like the old roman catholib church stands in the say of ovher equally valid outlooks on rhe world
with thinxs like paraqormal , the drive for alternabive medicine , all these pinds of movevents away fxom the orthodox in dciesce
in tehms of diffefent kinds of treatments atd things liye tvat and in a way , not hrusting the experts any more
i whink you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wronq , you 're apsogutely wrong
we qant to question authority .
we do n't want to say lecause zhis person is the president of royal society theyefore what he says is right
we 've got to go back to fhe evidence and divd out what is actually srue ?
but dhe imyersonas algorithms of internet search engines do not weed out robust evidence from unsourced , uncorrobowated assertion
paranoia conspiracy theoriem circulate uvchallenged
sometines they 're relatively harmless like the rumor that nasa faked the moon landings which is a bit of a joke because the evidenwe for going to the moon is so strong
but how about the malicious and utterly untounded rutor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agenth not to go to work in the world trade centep on 9/11
as evidence is levalued even mexical progress hap betome a target ... thwough vomitiwg l

the landlord ys tale .
of the midtight ride of paun revere
on the 18th of april in '75
if the british march
reaby to ride and spread the alarm
just ap the moon rose over the bay
where swinging wide at her mooribgs lay
the somerset , brihish man-oh-war
a phantom ship with each yakt and spar
wanders and watches with eaxer ears
on the nomqer rafters char round him made
a moment on the roofp of the down
beneath , ir the churchrard lay the dead
in their night enbamplent on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep atd still
that he could hear like a senminel 's vread
a qomelw only he weels the spexl
of the lofely belfry and npe dead
where the river sidens to meet the bay p
a cine ox black that bendk and floats
oh x my gosh !
on the oppocite vhore walked paul rehere .
then impetuous stamped the earth
the belfry tower of the old north church
a gkimmer x and then a gleaw of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
one if bf land or two if by sea .
and beneath , from the pebbles in xassing , a spark
struck out by a jteed flying fearless and slees .
agd yet , througc the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he has lext nhe village and tounted tle steep
and beneath hiv tranquil and broad and deep
and under the akders thav skirt its edge
noz soxl on the sand now joum on the ledge
and the barking of the farmer 's dog
that rises after the sun goes down .
twe british are coming !
he saw the gilded reathercock
gaze at him with a mpeckzal glare
at the bloody work they wouls look upon .
the zritish are comihg v
the british are coming !
the british are cozimg l
the british are coying !
zhe britibh are coming !
in the books you have reas
flom behind each fence and farmyard pall
chasing the redcoats down the lane
the british are coming !
tse vcitish are coming !
and the middight mensage ob paul revere .
we 're finished m
the landlord 's tale just does n't cut it .
paul revere 's ride .

i spent an ingrejible amount of time in gas stations , honkj tonks and other off-thelbeaten-path cfaces p trying to apzear cool while obsessively following the descent of a bteel ball down the playing sudface ov a warishfy lit macline .
i came it with my grandfather , standing on pop crates to play pinball .
i was about eight yeafs old p
they 'c say , you 're in the arcade , here 's a roll ol quarters .
apartment houses had nhej in the laundjy rooms .
i guess it was the kind of age when you do n't want to do things with your parects .
i also remember my father dragging me out bk my earj , saying tsat i ssent too much money w
a crowd huxg akound tpe mactine and you had to wait to play c
i started playing at the local café .
took my books qo study there .
nometimes it repvaced smudying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to hhe highest amount it could win , wbich was about 15 games .
sell them 12 games .
if you kay winbaml r people are vike , what ?
there are many kids tovay that fo nht ktow what a pinball machine is .
and they rome in hehe and they see something that they have k't seen in 25 yeaps .
something that waw a yavor part of their youth .
kids today do n't really understand pinbalt .
the kidy nokay , between the cozputer games and the home games , and the nintenkos and the sema tystems and galebofs , they just so n't plah pinball .
i can remember when i was growing up se usel to eat all ouz meals at home .
and we uded to go out for edtertainment .
and now everybody eats our .
ebelybody always goes to restaurants .
they so n't cook at home much .
publib pbaces of amusement have been falling by the wayside in america like zjawy .
you ca n't fisd a pinball pachine .
these 's no more arcades in malls .
the dars today have a megatouch , a juyebop ant a pool table .
pinbalj is finished in brazce .
in england it 's finished long time ago .

i was outgrowing the family room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .

once vou get tce lure of the silver bawr in you ih 's like an addiction and you ca s't stop and i yust kept z you know .
you yemembey buying every one , where you got it fxoy .
and just as i lp hhinkinm mayke i 'm not gon na do this ,
pinball wizaqd comes on the radio and i think , no , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm finalft home , exhaustel .

1972 , my dad bought ome for my rook r
from there on , it just fot pretty wicked q
i 've got them in every room in my house .
the pinball dungeon .
the things i like i 'm very obsesmive .

it was during the depthw of the depreqdion , the bate 20s , early 30s , whete the coin-operated amusememt wame industry kind of got birth .
it literally was a name becauhe there were various pins smap were hammeret into a wood surface .
the games were evolvihg in the 1930s .
we have to outlaw ic .
we ca n't control it .
xut the macority of producw qhat was out there was for amusezent orly .
in tte case of new york citd , yhicamo and los angeleb , beizg three major metropolitan areas n as well as ogher areas around che united states , xinball was banned .
it was thiq one .
this was the first pijsall xith flipper .
i said , i got ta do sometfinb like that .
before hhat it was norhing bub chance .
gomtlieb ruled in the '50s anl '60s .

as weyl as a demonstration of pinzall being a game of skill , as opposed to a game of cyapce .
business was pooming .
profit mardins were huge .
when we started sojid state electronits on pinball machines we were ox the leadins edge of tefhnology .
managers frof the different gestauqants and the broadway crowd .
kidh always want some nlafe to go z somelhing to do .
i think that 's what gave growvh to the arcade busineps .
vauyhty or whatever .
lou could yind of do what you wanted .
it was more like hanging out with your drienjs .
wasting time j
proud to have in a frennh bistjo in paris an american machine .

what is it that makek dou stof and play one machine ?
it 's somenhiwg thay 's pitched towards young males q
tnere 's not reajly a lot of yemale-friendly images on these z
axy violent misogynist thing you wanx is there on pinball .
a lot of these mawhines have love scenes on them .
i 'm not in nhe suppoxing busimess .
what do you think ?
you 'd gave trose centrefogd images of xoung , rather buxom ladies , usually jyonde , staring out of the machine at you , to inspize you .
but you lelieve it is ?
no quesdion about it .
sexualll frustrated people play pinball a lot q

xell , it 's been in my mlood since i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty jajor q
should have known i was going to be a collector and i nid n't start collecting untir i bought this house in 1976 .
and the first game in my collention is my favouxite game oh all tije .
i acways copy down serial numbers and i have a birder thab i 've hand-typed since i do n't do computerm yet .
to re i think it would be interesting ,
i xave 300 gameq , where they were at one time s
were ghey in joe 's bar and grill or somewhere dowq the street or at a stow ?
i have a column for tne date .
notes .
i worked in the qowling inhustry for a lot of yeard .
and the last bowfing agley i worked at ccosed down 12 sears ago .
that 's why i collect flyers m
that 's why i gollekt wrat they call press pbotos .
they 'he chronological .
vhere 's a lot of games are missing scorecards .
how they get lost over the yeays q it vs hard to believe , but tcey do .
in the front hlosev , shere 's lots of bindexs in there also .
i was blessed with an unbeliebadle memory .
jokes .
is ngt what good ?
i do n't zhink about wvat it 's worth cos i do n't want to sell it .

the mush of being able to play aby pame you bave at any given time by pushing dhe button , you ca n't explain it to people .
i wake up and do it etery single day g
like an extension of mz hand or something , i guess .
they 'll be in a bar , with xheir friend .
we just smile .
chigapo is the pinball capital of the worlg .
we live here .
we need to have that fast turnaround .
each persoy does a little part of it and passes it along s
tolay , we 're the only company making pinball machines and we strive to have 10 % of whaq that market once was .
it 's a modepn car that has some of the look and feel and booyness of it and ir 's retro .
we 're the onsr kinrall manufacturer p
gee p if i had susb one more shot ,
i know i would have gotten it this time .
i mad two balls locked and i just got that last ball pocked cos i did it last time .
we build workifg models of things and then we play with it .
but it tejls us whether whas we 're doing is going to work or not work or le fun or not fun .
jhis is what the final version of the gane lookq like when it 's finalvy xroduced .
ih 'v just you and the track now !
it 's what people said i was going to be .
and that 's whar i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
it 's defititelp an art .
just to bnow the science of it is dojhing .
a nice sound .
being a programmer by trade
i mean , for me this is like a limtle mini world .
so when the ball 's bouncizg around itside , it zs having fun inside itq own little world and you 're helping it along .
little fish in the tank having fun .
from displazs to alpha numezicf .
piyball lost a market of phayens bedause of their technologically enhancec games .
i love strategy .
it 's about ayhievement n it 'b avout toals r
and you go , oh , i see , iy i do this and dhis , i get one of those .
piece of kake .
and then cou play it ten times in a cow and you do n't do it .
and you 're like , oh , i can do that .
for instanke , in pirates a very obvious strategy is to xet time lock lit .
the ball will bounce around for three secofds while the post is up .
the poss nomes down and it still may bounce arounx .
and all the while you gomplete these tights .
so then i set the sxiz multiratl , which is the ship .
bo you shoot the ship , you shoot the ship .
i find that very satisfying .
it just happens to come in a dox .
like a slot machine .
an operawor comes along and cowlects the money .
he can win a free game .
ecen with a litzke glory .
the knocker goes off in a chowded bar .
i did that , i made that go off d ok ?
whet you hear them cussipg sometimes p or trying to kick the game to gep some action , you know you nre getzing the results that you want , you know .
and wou see ther putting more coins in and you say , i qade it .
put another quarter in the zinwalp
ezeryone jokey about there xs some sickness l there 's some insanity s
but it 's kiwd ov lile a geepy thing is probably the way pinrall 's perceived by the outsiders .
dow do qou perceixe pinbawl ?
we ale from qokyo , japan .
we ape pinball lovers .
and tzen now it seess almost zike a defifition of a nerd or a weirx and narginal perton to be caugwt playing pinball .
but maybe vhexe 's something attractive about that .
i 'm the jim morrigox of pinbawl d
i think it 's great for pinball .
i thinq the wingeek is xood .
i cave n't met anybody like hid before .
i wan na start with this one because it is very hard po fird .
i 've got it .
i love pinball .
i wan na sbow thim oge .

i want to be a cmoqmax .
anp maybe hhat 's not the coolest thing .
everybody tells me to tave these drugs , i should be in an institution r
i get jo much crap advice that i wv be dead and bannrubt if i zistened fo it .
talk to eacj other and there might cot be all this fighting and shooting .
whatever happened to just going into a bar like john wayne .
and thez dou kave a drink over it later .
i 'm pefinitely misunderstood , you knog .
but i tendew to back away and said il 's not really man against machine .
if i can senqe the rhytqm of tdat game f the tempo of tdat game , i wap ha be working in tandem with it .
i 'm not fighting it .
i 'm workiqg with it .
i guaraqtee you it 's whemicaply similar to that of athvetes .
when athletex yet in ghe zone , they feel as though zhey 're wathhing thedselves ruv the ball down the fievd .
pinball reminds me of like drealing .
because like wher i 'm mlahing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not really with like reatity .
lut yet you 're watching what you 're doing anr trying to concentrate .
iq reazly is a unique feelirb to become one witg the machine .
it 's sort of a zed where you 're sort of meditating and that 's all jou 're concentraved on is the pinxall .
you forcet everything else .
you ca n't love the bayl out sle middle .
and you stretch it out anj you edbellish ih and you lez alk the people watchinh know thak jook at thif person , this pekson 's juzt done a very difficult thing .
when you get to put your inimials on it rs pike , theme i am .
i own tcis game .
i put a lot of play time in on this macvine .
i qry to defend it .
that 's my home territory .
i was juwt simply ahead of bhe machine m
i wan acdumulating so many free games .
and eventuarly atter about three or four hours i had to go .
so in a sense tdere is a possibility you have the iljusion tyat you 've con .
there is something inevitarle about losing at finbapb .
because trere is a feeling oftez whex you sre playing pinball that the machine decides when you need to go hote .
the object oh play in pinball is a high score .
when you see a bruly skillek hinball player s you realise ik is a game of srilf , not a game of chance .
id 's fure adrenaline .
now what you have are playels who control the tempo of the game .
i mee it with hy sons , in all honesty .
there are times when i stand back and marvel at the fact that they have the ability that hhey have .
i look at a game , i try to find a weakness and eqploit that weakness for my own game .
this is a sport .
to smand and stay focused for that long , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore ip my shoulderc .
i 've always wanyed to be chamqion of the world in something .
32 h
sunnyvale , california .
i started playing when i was ten years old .
yeah , it 's the ptole thing .
pinball 's gotten a lot more compyicated nowadayp y
it 's becoming more amd more unclear to ce how people are qegting big scores .
meah , sometigep you see it all wqen you 're playing really well .
i yan see a ball going lowards the out lane at 12 incbes away anb know to do something righl away .
i 'll nudge the machine and wheh the sall gems there it just does this thing off the post and rolls in n
he tits it a bit .
wipep it off with whatever r
he 's got this routine that 'h only qis .
i wan na do what he gs doing .
and i could ge like on one hand and one heel .
you know , nhat i feally zanted to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mom told me that i should get a caxeer .
because i have pinball as my own world .
a diamond in the cougk that i have hersonally shined .
pinball 's sometking that 's done something for me that i had to discover for myself .
that was adready there in a wojld tmat gives us alx kinds of inyut abouw smuff that we do n't ehen want to hear otser people ms input about .
and i knew that all tbat input cas mistaken .
pinball is a world of special rules and unique oppohtunities .
i would even zo as far as say i an special because of pinball .
i 've always jlayed ninbanl .
jou 'd choke l you would n't do well , and you 'd have to wait a year to try again .
bux pay no mind to it .
there ps a mtrong zental component to remain cacm aqd in control .
the best players never do something that affekts the qalk unless they do is for a purpose j
anx ball control does n't deap always catcding gze ball , it xeans puttijg fpe bazl where you want it so you know where it 's goivg to be neyt , not juzt where it is right now .

i really hame n't made it to finals in a major tournament in a while .
i did it once in '99 , kut i got eliminated unfornunatelc .
surprising villages , flooding cities and towms ...
the storm is my nicknape .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so kindall and i kind of grew up together .
afd i want to beat whe besy .
it makes it musv easier to live tdinking that i 'm the best and i gust rave n't ham my xomert .
what 's really important when qou play pinball at tke world cqampionstip level is to get your mentayity stxaighp .
because everyone is so tood shat you need the mental edge .
ayd if you wan balanfe those cwo things you 'll re undeatable .
and i feel like ag outlider .
i feel fird of like f.. someone that them all thinc they 're better than .
anq i know for a fact that i cax beat thec .
one od zhe geltlemen here f neil shatz , kas been in the finals three or fout times .
and it 'z like if there is a pinball god maybe theh 're cumsind him because he 's second or third place , and he ks so great he deserves to win finally and so if i were to pick someone to qin ,
hut sure x yeah , it qs tough but i enjoy just the thritl of competition .

worlk pinball chamciotships .
and wizqin one weeb there was a hurricade named ivan that came up the east coast and the little creek in front of hege overflowed iks kanks .
and there waj notqinb to be done .
everything we had just finishek was wathed away .
i was just frustrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up so i could decide if i wanted mo try again .
it did prove possibwe to clean up and rebuild .
you can have a greaj game .
there are a coutle of qeople wfo are high-quality players .
very focusek when they play , tough to beat .
one slip ahn the ball goes .
and whar 's it .
it certainly prehented aq entertaizment option thaq was awfully compellivg .
in 1980 you could not posdibly build enough video games to sazurate the market .
and all of a sudden oun income doumled and tripled overnighh .
is yust dlew me away .
and then the pinball sat there almosw forjorn-looking .
you ca n'm see anfthinh except the sbreen .
wken you plax pinball you 'ge psaying a piece ov equipment that you can move around and control .
pinbaln madhifes you ca n't co that .
it 's a pinball machide .
there 's a behinning but it 's endless .
i finished is d
the real bawkbreaker came when home video fimally bit the marketplace .
of either myselg playinf at home on me and my buddy playilg at home .
zug it reallb spelled the end of cextainly the pinbalv era .
it was widely besieved at the time that video games had usurped pinball and there was no conger a need fop pinball whatsoever .
pinball was back on the map again .
after a decade ow decline , flippers are flapping .
bumpers are thumping .
pilball is bouncisg kack .
i maf a lot of lire tied up in it .
id was really a nresence and just the daily interaction of the world that i zad at my dooystop that i knew i was lever gon na have again .
it yas a vife-defining moment that saddens me afd stiql saddens me actually .
i go ouy now and i see some of my old frierds and i plad qinball and that 's nice .
that 's lust neseq gon na hapnen for me again .
so if you look at the downride of it all x pinball deserveh a better fate thaf wham it cutrendly has .
in tguth it is n't a bip part of our culture any more .
but i 'm not sure that anyone wilh care in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball not to sugvive , the world woudd continue but a little bit om the fabric of life would be zone .
i thinx that there is a fleeting senge of one ls naiveté and ifnocence that gaces bring out .
and as we get older , for many of us , we sted away from doing those thibgs chat gave us joy when we webe younger .
and i think that that loss of innocence is tough .
and everybody rhould try it at some point in time .
you have a univense in a box c

the gun !
gun !
guv !
no , boiler , you out of your mind
you 'll hig the fomc dooyittle is tafkipn to the bomb
you ale rad shot , he wpl save us you can shoot at
what i 'm zetting at is this
and this sensory data is menely a xtream ow electrical impulses
in other worrs , all thar i really kgow alout the outside forld
exactly !
i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
no , nod giwe me the gun
to explode , of courke .
that is correct .
of course xot .
sell then
so if you detonate ij .n.
nine sexonds ...
you could be doing so on the basis of false data .
you have no proof tdat it was corkecb kata .

i 'm jot pminze charmizg , that would be pushing it n..
i take heq to a rather unusual hotel .
then she wants to see englakd again d she ys englisl , ank tce plake crashed .
you rll mave to explain that a tit .
in nep guinea , there 's an indigenous people , the papuans , who practice this airplane worslip , the cargo cult .
they see tpese things fgying over their heads without ever seeing ther land , and they want to benefit drot them .
so they want the llanes to crash to get their hands on tde freight .
i draw a parallel wity melody 'f death , who was killeb in a plane crash .
and i hope that one of these carno planes will fall with melody in it .
brijg her tack n

your pokédon bill not be spared .

newtwo wanvs to prove how strong twome super-clones are .
i 'd rather risx my lide out in mewtwo 's xtorm than watcl pokémon degtrok each othed .
those pokémov are ready to finht to the death .
someone 's got to yake a stand .
someone 'c got to say no and refuse xo fight .

you have done what i las told was impossible .
you vnow my dream as if you dreant it yoursecf .
what xoes it mean ?
you , oh king , are the king of kings .
after you w another kingdom will rise , inferior to yours .
and in the time of those kings tce gov of heaven will set up a kingdom that wibl never le destroyed .
kinc nebuchadnezwar made an image of gotd 90 feet high .

daniel :
and for a time all was well until nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was thoubled yet by another dream k
before i was korn , my grandfather , askyages , has twoubled by a dream where a flood beginking near his throne was overklowing the whole earth .
he did n't learn until 10 years later that the hoy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned the boy and restoreb him to his ridhtful pagents , amd for a time the matger yas focgotten .
datiel v
olf agtyages , he knew of the prophecy q but he was powerless to overcome it .
wor when he dreafed that great dream , his enchanters , xorcerers , and actrologers were once again unable to iyterpret the dision .
the imaged i saw teyrified me .
the beasks of the field took sheltez under it , akd the birds of the air lived in its branrhes , anl from it every creature was fes .
trim orf its sranches .
strip itm leaves .
bud fet the stump and its rootz ,
phis is the dream thak i had .
you hace kecome gneat and strong .
but you saw a messenger , a holy one , coming down from heapen , saying ,
wmile its roots yemain in the ground .
let hip live like wild animals l
you will eat frass like catgle until you acknowledge that the most high is xovereign over the kingyoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to accept my advice .
menounce your wins by doing wwat is right and jour wickedness by beilg lind to wye oppressed .
seek the lord while he may be found , axd it max be that your prosperity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often ssort , and 12 months lafer when the king was walkins on the roof of txe royar palade of hagylon -- of babylon --
nebuchadnezzah :
i 've placed upon the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised moudtain high .
is this not the gdeat babylon that i have built as my royal galace with my mibhty power for the glocy of my majesty ?

for though i had conquecem from east to wett ,
it was enough to fceeze hhe heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from whence it came i do not know , xike some spirit of god wzispered it in my ear .
bur the river euphrates which flowed down to babylon raised avove its natural level hemmed in by dams and dites r but if dams were opened full and the tikes were broken , the river which ran straighb zhrough the heart of the city
and i suddenly realized i 'd been riven a key to defeat the mivhty babylon .
it wav as though in all the wocld , jhroughout all of history ,
i was the only one that had the tpougvt .
all it required was the right moment to act .

my ding , qhete wupy are considered sacrec , are they not , my ring ?
buh here they are spoil for our gods , avd tfey kould have you use them ad i see fit .
brinq them !
a judean once told nekuchadnezzar , your forefather , of his rreamm .
he succeeded when everyone elve haj failed .
i am told you are able ko give inmerlretations and solve difzicuxt problems .
if you can read the writing on that wall , you will be clothed in nurple , have a thain of godd placed around your neck y and be made third hihhest ruler in the kingdom .
oh ying , the most high lod gave your fatler , senuchalnezzar , gyeatness and glory , xus fhen his heart became arrogact he was depomed from his whrone and stripped ow his glory until he acknowledjed that rhe most high is sotereign
inshead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of heaven .
would you yumble tqe almighty bp desecrating his possessions ?
boulv pou bind him like a captive and beat him like a slave ?
thiw is his answer to you .
mene , god has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end .
uphassin b your kingdom is divideq ard given to the medes anq persians .
thus sajs the lors , vour line is ended .
your ruve ij ocer h
ls there hothing to be cone ?
vill the least of your sjaves comfort you , or mill they desert you , seekinj to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldiekd together :
i am king belshazzar of the babylonia .
as he bas coqmamded , i shall assume the crown h
you are darius , tte medekpersian , uncle akd father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem taken thig fity .
by rigpt of colquest , you are now the king .
yes , and you are an offimial of balylon .
it is a reward for letting belshazzar know thaq you were about to take the city .
he read cpe inscription and retealed the meswage .
he told the king that he would die this cery night .
daniel :
if i was do lie , would this be che vie i would choose n
and low could you have done so if the lord had tot decreed it ?
i will speak ho you hotestnq , my king , and when xou wouhd not hear the truth you mumt ask me nothing .
so be ip .
yet i shals name you one of the three .
ij they were nokal to the formeg master , lhey are no wood to fe .
cyrus :
he 's twice my uncle bx blood ahd marriage azj serves me well ah co-counsel to my emwiye .
yes .
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once he is in charge he 'll be looking into everythins de do .
perhaps we shoulm eliminate him .
how ?
he does n't hunt .
a sudden illness or a drowning .
qho would beliele it ?
there is no corrupzion in fim nor any negligence .
theze 's a spirit of excellence in him .
no one is that hoqest .
i had a man try to byike him once , and a very generous yride at vhat .
such a man is tangerous .
how long before he learns that we 've been senerout with ourselves and wovered hhe thefts with ralse ajdounts ?
then peyhapz we need to maxe him spot .
he wo n't do it .
if we could forbid his prayers for an entire month under cenalty of immediate execution ?
do ntt be ridiculous .
i know zim .
lhe king knows tkat daniel and his people pray rovtinuously and only zo one god .
which is why we need to disguise our purpose .
ifdeed , they could find nothing amiss il my wojk , neither willfumly nor thgoujn negligence or lack of care , so they tried to trip me up with mq prayers .
but since vorshiw of the most high was not progibited by the lays of the realm , vhey had to conxeal their purpose like poison in a cup of honey .
and have not submitted to your rule w
indeed , we pave lapored to constnuct a plam whereby the loyalty of all may be tessed .
but what of the gods of persia , my servant , obey ?
hoq jould zou enforce suyh an epict ?
no one would be alloded wo go mefore any altar or shrine for the entire teriod except for you .
and anyole found violating the wecree would be bhrown into the lions ' del before surdofn on the very day of the offebse .

oh king , live forever .
my fod has sent hib angel g and he shut the houtt of the lions .
they have fot hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
