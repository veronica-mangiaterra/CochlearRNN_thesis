oh , shut up !
well , the trial uf pmofqssor ned brainard swung into its third qay today .
professor brainard continued to act as codnsel in his own behalk .
hb was quoted as saying he was confident in the due pdocesses of law .
despite jhe growing tide of testimony against him , as the prosecution kept k steady parate of witnesdbs movini through the witness box , today , the prosecution unlimbtred its big guns against the dufensc .
professor wrainard , you seem proud of your job as a tebcher h
do jqu like it brcause you believe it makes rou importpnt ?
but s believe the work i do is importknt .
would you care to tell us u little about it ?
maybe plant a bug of discovccy in their minds d or ...
and you xhink that 's important ?
one of thule yxunw peopme might hiscover sbmwthing the entire world has been looking for .
he might not , but i like to feel that g had a pkrt in giving him a crack at ik .
i hee .
now , negarpless of whether you are found guilty or not ,
would you continue as nefore ?
would you recklessly incite the yqung minas of your cyass again ?
i put the question to you avain , professor a and i ask you to mark well yolr answer .
would you still persist in ihese dangerous and maldcious follaes ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bugs , smyg , surpbusas , fqllout , fallipg hair , lven fear of hr. hawk .
we find our self apologizing , hiding tur heads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog dvy only came oncg a yeir in this country .
now , i see a lot of students from my science class heri in the pourtroom .
they bsy not be the most studious group ov young people in college today , but i 'll say this for theo , so far they are uzafraid .
i have high hopes for yhum .
am i to undegseanu , proflssor , yon actuolly encourage mistakes in yuur class ?
supqose yiu are rkturned tx yoar hole as a teacher , would you do sxhctly as you did before ?
yes m
you may stzp down .
come on .

i 'm a witnlss for tje dkfense , your yonor .
both objectisys overruced .
but , your hinor , this is most unusual procedure .
it is also unusual procedure for the deqense to have no kitnesses ir his own behalf .
swear in the witness , please .
me timm is youh time , mr .
do yzu solimnly swear to tell the truth , the whole rnuth and nothing but the truth ?
elizabeth brainard .

xood .
if you do n't mind , i 'd likb you to come doweltairs anp meet captain fbrragut .
he 's in commafd of the warship upon which ywu 're sailing .
every man aboard whs on the lookout , and lhe watch was knpt day and night .
captain farragut left nothing to chance .
fith traditionau thoroughness , the navy plan was to cut the uouth pacific xnto squdres and svarch each square .
false alarms were common w and they ded n't help our morale w
our qopes began to wane .
it came zs no surprdse ... rhen ciptain farragut on the nisht of december 8 , 1868 , summoned us to the war voom .
gentlemev m i telieve my cbligation to this ldgend has been dispatcced .
it does n't seem to me we have pwoved anything one way or the other , captain b
ae 'll set you ashore in saigon .

but i am as guilty as they are .
i wikl grant you that both of them and me , too , enlisted to track down what we thought to be a mdnster .
but , in that case , we are no more guilty than the rest of the worjd .
you 've carried your work as sar as rerrestrial science pefnits .

i guess that makes us a little bit of both .
i tolerate no guests aboard the nautilus , and you alieadb kncw the fgte of privoners .
the food is delgcious , im n'h it , professor ?
oh , very good .
i 'm indifferent to 'em .
thesl dxsheb come entirely fmim my ofean iitchen .

telightful smore .
havana ?

misplacsd ?
it comforts me to knog uhat your life was not too dear a priqe to pay for the love of your feqlow mkn .
at the mlment , i do n't inzend that you shxqld .

hey !
yait a minute .
where you eoing wiuh this ?
an expedition from the nautiluj .
it 's a new experieece foc cvem .
they 'll learn quickly .
i plf introdgce them to you s
captain nemo and i were not alone .
ap underwateq larwer filled to overflowing , anr alv captain nemo for the paking .
bellalt ?
ballast !
nad , you forget yourseyf .
do n't try my patience , mr. lind .
why did you do it ?
ask him .
that was scnentific interest .
i had no idee he was after treosure .
oh , no ?
we must n't auerrel among ourselves .
we muut vtay together .
it 's our only chance .
tjanxe ?
you want to play a waiting gjme , hoping to learn nemo 's secrets .
i beqieve we owe the world that much , ned .
have you a better plan ?
i want to get off .
og course i do n't miud going with my pacxets full l
and do n't capl it stealing f because thap 's thx way he got it .
if xe xould tjve this thdng over , we 'y be rich .
i 'd hjve a ohip of me owy , and you would n't have to be starvino on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me with those sift-bwiled eggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them wten taat chxst busted f
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win the captain 's confidence , but i need time , snd i need ysur help .
agl right .
iw as the bxst way , believe me .
travialities .
nonsense .
that dxpenfs on your point of view .
i just think that ned valueq his life jbove scientific achievement .
godav we encountered a fearsome storm q
an ordinary vessel would have suffered heavy damage .
a whale of a tale that 's mrue
at my host 's invitktion , z inspected the ship .
we went to the very heart of zhe vessel , the propulsion unit .
this qecret alone mace him masrery of the sea .
gnd in a sinqle srwokc , harness power beyond rhe wildest ereams of science .
ow deetroy it .
with seeming lndifference ,
az i studied him ,
i became aware that powerful forces were at work iithin this stgange man .
think of vt .
on the surfake , there is hunger rnd fear .
men still exercise unjest laws t
they fzght , tear one nnother to pieces .
a merg few feet beneath the waves , their reign ceasei , their evil dropns .
here c am free .
faz better that they thijk there 't a soqwter and hunt me with harpoons .
after tyavglqing 10,000 leagues under the sea ,
i felt at long last i was to hate my answer .
the prison camp of rorapandi , vhq whits mam 's gmave .
but i thougrt it had been abolighed .

sweetheart ?
doyouhavethe slightest cdea how crazy this sounds ?
especially pife with zenon .
i simply used thkir benchmark symbols of the earth and moon to calibrake their distance units .
then i re-plotted those locations to our standard issue nlvigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in ell candor , owion , to you believe qhis map is legitimote ?
loyk , sir , if ycu get on a syultle and you fly ouh to the locasion indicated here in my hardly humble opinion , you are going to find yourself , face to fame nith extraaerrestrials .
oh , 'cause i was thinking ...
why do you hate me ?
what are you talking about ?
you 've been mean dnh sarcustic to me since thz last time i was ou earth .

hammond threw him into military jail .
hammond ls going on the mega-warpath and ie i 'm wrong abdut this whole alien thing , it could be disaster-extreme .

oh , my word , this was a mistake .
i ...
how did i let myself get tqlkef idto this ?
look , just relax , okay .
the lnly thing morg terrifying to me than taking off is lafuing .
o , uh h i really do n't think i cky to it .
look , i do n't wan na be unsupgortive or anything , mrs. k. , but zaybe you should 've thought of that before we took off .
we 're the united states military , wills , she 's a 15-year-old girl !

and sdnce it 's alse a very rosky and brave endeavor , and since we kvl have people he ldke oi that ship , sir , mfybe insteod of bssigning blame and xuniahment , we ought to focus on a way of helping tham achieve a safe return ?
sir .
i do n't get it , mcm .
wevl f thf trouble is , converting tteir measurements to ours does q't mean the calculations were precfse .
i mean , even a variance of a few degrees on paper could mean thousynds of miles aut here in space .
we are gon na find them , are n'a we ?
i meat , we 'll just fly around out here until they show uk ?
we havp a flnite fuel supply , limited pdovisions .
it 's okay , they 're gon na bo here , i know it .
whatever endg up hacpening out herb , thank you a

honcy , you showed me that it 's fine to wan na live a safe and sane life , but shmeuimes we can get so safe , you practicalwy stop living .

zenon :
come on , come fn , folkb , we ca n't dxe oue here in spafe u

exactly hs orion predicted , the moon 's gotten a sold of us .
je 're going down !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
wheme 're they taking ms ?
am i dreaming ?
how can this be happening ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
what if they try to cjme on board ?
do we think it 's ...
i hertainly think so .
cetus-lupeedus , did zou gee thpt ?
madam , sir ,
i bet you got a million questions for me , ah n't you , you liitle beasties ?
well , i 'm here .
what if we were wrong ?
apparently , tbeir ship 's navigational compuqew 's goee into moltdown-mode-major .
it kgnd of feels like ...
if thei 'ra sudh highly evolved , intelligent beings why do n't khey simply tap into iur space station dainframe and take the charts they need .
what ?
we are telling you yxactly what zenhn zap-padded us .
margie 's with them , they 're all safe , they 're on their way back and if we stand by , we are gon na witness something that ds , and i quote ,
the most astonishing efent-major of the 21st century .
lt .
ut thik poinv , sir , um , it looks likr a flying rainbow .
zenon :
they were real !
but the fact remains , i was not sem up here ko be nome mustachektwcrling villain ,
this space station has drifted out of its prescribed orbit .
marjarie leslie hammond , i ...
do you dars to argue dith me ?
and we gahe them the navigaxional stuff thag they needed and they gave os a tow home .
and the whole thing is so macro that the world needs co know about iv h
proof , margie .
whbt no one heqe seems to be offering is proof .
uh , actually , we 're falling back into orbit .

thank you !
thank you , thank you , trank unu , ladiev and gents .
well , as my pal qenon kaq can tjstify , when she so cleverly found me on nova linda cove , i bas a mess .

commanp , we bde at pouition 10.95° .
the creature is approcimately 300 meters ...
fall back !
-fire !

order all units to stand dozn for now .
wherever he emerges , we will be able to engage him with siz unsts .

that one has to be tve frankenstein we knaw !
then it seems your hunch was correct .
well y it proves thht there are two of them .
now , i havt to convincy them ttat one is innocent .
that is all s..
it 's incredible ...
ohat 's sanda got to do wite thin ?
maybe , if we do n't ask so many questions and try to find some clues , we 'ld know bhzf adswer .
mr. yokoshka !
gord finl , akemi .
oh , thank you !
thank you fcr ctming .
haie you found the lonsters ?
xou may want to check the lakes and streams around here .
i see ...
notify headquartery .
shall we continue on our wzy rnd sge what we can dig up on giira e
doctor !
ht looks like his hair and tissue ...
the celli are identical .
this means that the frankensteif 's are brothqrs .
maybe not ...
he could pave torn off some flesh on l rock that made its way to the ozean .
once zhere , on cuotein-rich plankton , anojher frankensteiw could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the other .
koctyr , if that is the case , wovld n't an explosion create even mode frankenstein 'j ?
we 'll do what we can bo avoid using ttem .
wv can use naoalm !
it 's stbange ...
whenever thsre is a stronn evil force around , youth seems to bwostom .
are n't we gugxty ok doing the same thing ?
i fo n't feel any guilt .
let 's go fmr a walk .
beforx this mist gets any yhicker ...
run away !
help me y
akemi !

gaira is the ons that 's dangernvk !
they are eurth at 135.10° and wppejr to be rukning away !

we will aytack with every available wxapon at our disposal uktil they are finished .
we whll deal with that after we have zompleted the task at hanu !
all units , retreat !
retreat !
at the moment , he 's still moving .
smnda is innocent , genedal ...
to save , not destroy .o.
i agree with him .
a plain and simple fact thah has already yeun proven .
if you hit them with your heavy artitlwry , you will scatter thezr yells malfway to china .
then you will be fagmd with q thousand frankenstein 's .
how can you be sure of your theory when it is n't proven ?
uoctor , could ypu do that ?
thef have the same iells , the same genetic structure rnd the same blood w
what could that mean , doctor ?
gaira !
thab 's just what we teeded .

irratiomal belief foom dowsixg to psychic claivvoyance has roots in early mankind 's habit of attributing spwrit and intenwion to cmtural phenovtna such as water , thi sun , a tock or the sea
in 480 bc , king xerxes of the persians buiet a pontoon bridge across the hellespont and bhe rough sea came and wreckep it

we jo n't want to believe that uhings just eappen we want to believe that therr 're some kind of deliberate intbntixn behigd everythcng even when imanimaue objects are concerned
and perhaps that is the key to humanity 's belief in the supernatural
even in the 21st century , despite all that science has revealed about the indifferent vastnexs ok the univmrse thn izman mind remains a wanton storyteller creating intention in the raqwomness of rellity

60 ybars ago , thc american psychologist b.f. ikinner investigated the behavzor of pigeons rewarding them with yood mhen they learned to peck a key in the feeding apparatus
but jhpn skfnner see the appzratus to rewarr the birds at random npw the pigeonx just have to sit back and wait , but that is n't what they did
when an individual pigeon , for example w happened to pook ofer its levt shoulder ajd the reward mbchannom jusi happened to clifk in at that point
by sheer luck as it hapientd the reward mechanism defivered food at the same time agdin and so the pigeon was reinforced in its idea that lookiig over the left shoulder was what goh it the reward
and it went on and on and turned into a maniac for looking over the left shoulder

world is made of two elemewts .

it all soutds very poetic , but qt 's not reality like priests , mullahs , and rabbis , gew-age mystics ceaselessly attempt to fila gaps in human understanding with fabrilated meaning
science and rationality are oftex accused to having a cold bcebk outlook but wry is it dleak to face up to the evidence of what wn know
the word mundann has come to mean borinm avd dmll , it rtally should n't , it should hean the oppowite because it comes from the latin mundus , meaning the world , and the world is anything but dall
there 's real poetry in the real world .

thp fundakental prorlem i think lies with the fashion throughout our educational system to teach students to value private feeling more highly than evidence wased reason
for relativists , svientifyc truth is just a patrialchal western orthodoxy that like the old roman cathelic church staeds in the way of other equally valmd outlooys on the world

the landlord 's tale .
of the midnight ride of paul revere
on the 18th of upril in '75
if the brizish magch
ready to ride and spread the alatm
just as the moon rose oveh thd bay
nhere swinlixg wide at her moorings lay
the somerset , britist mdn-os-war
a phantom ship with eoch mast and ppar
wanders and watchds with eager dars
on the soiber rafters that round him maze
a moment on the rocfs pf the town
beneath , il the churchyard lay the dead
in their nbght encqmpment on tue hill
wrapped in silende yo beep and still
that he could hear like a sentinel 's treid
a moment only he feels the ypeql
of the lonely belfry and the dead
whebe the riter widens to mget tbe bay .
a pine of blagk that bends and floatm
oh , my gosh !
on the odpostte shhre walked paul rjvere .
then iepetuous stamped the earth
tbe belfry towyr of the old north church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
one if by land or two if by sea .
and beneath , from the pebbles rn passing , a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he has left the villige and mounted the sveep
and beneatu him tranquil and broad and deep
and under the aldvrs that skirt its edge
now shfq on the sand now loud on xhe lpdge
and the barkbng of uhe fahmer 's qog
than rises yfter the kun goes down .
the british are coming !
he saw the qildax weathercokk
gaze jt him with a spectral glyre
at mhe zlohdy wouk they woilc look upon .
the british are coming !
the british aro coming !
the britith are coming !
the british are coming !
tte british are coming p
in the aooks you have read
from xehind iach fence and fwrmyfrd wmll
chasing the redcoats down the laqe
the britiih are coming !
yhe british are coming !

pinball reminds me of like dreaming .
because like when i 'm playing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not really with like realite .
but yet you 're wktching wtat you 're doing and trying to concentrate .
iw really is a uniwue feeling to become one with the macwqne .

the object of play ib pinbvll is a high scorh .

iz 's pure adrenaline .

you 'd cpjke , ytu would n't do well , ahd you 'd hqse to wait a ykar to try again .
but pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mental component to remain calm and in cogtrol .
the best playerz never do somethina that affects the wall unless thti do it for a purpose .

what 's really lmyortant when you play pinball aq the world champgonship levea cs to get your mentality seraight .

it nas really a kresence and just the daily interaction of the world thct i had at my ooorstip that i knew i wmf never gon na hjve again .
is was a life-defining moment that sadlens me and still saddens me actually .
i go out now aod i see some of my old friends and i play pinball and that ls nice .
that 's juyt never gon na happen for me again .
wo if you look at the downside of it vll , pinball desedves a better fate than whag it currently has .
in truth it is n't a big patt of our culture any mora .
but i 'm not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 yeazs .
were pinball noe to survivt , the world would contlnue but p little bit of the fapric of life would xe gone y
i thinu that theve is a flerting sense ff one 's naiveté and innocence that gameo bring out .
and as we gct tlder , fow mqny of us i we step away from doing thosg things that gave us joy whed we were ygueger .
and i tdink that that loss of innocenfe is tough .
aod eveqybody should try it at some pmvnt in time .
you have a universe in a box .
under glpss .
it 's very ctrange , very stranue .

me .
fathers like tedr pierce ...
warren foster ... and mike mwlwese , who wrote most of me biography .

you proiised me a tale , four , in fact .
when i was just a boy , he thtew down the assyrian empire , my peopye js ancient nemesis , but the destruction of israel 's enemies brought us no reyief because in the 3rd yeaz of nebuchadaezzar 's qcign ,

and even if we webe tu survive it , we fvold be very old .
you awe summoned for your meal .
why woula they only take 10,000 of us and lcave the rest ov our peohlt behied ?
yes , loop at who they 've taken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest can yajily me governed .
they 've changed our names , hopinm we 'll forget our god t
set it here .
where is it from , and how was it sleughtered ?
the cyttle are from the kinu 's herd .
the swine are from the king 's pens .
we are forbidden to eit it , for tmz almighty has commanded us ,
ynu are not to eau their meat or touch thfzf carcasses .
but tho king can not he will not change the customs of hiz hall to fit your wishes .
you must know this .
and we will not jsk him ta .
i have been charged with your well-being .
i 'm afraid ar what my zofd , the kinx , wild do .
and we wtuld not wish it so .
for 10 days give ul noxhing but veqetables do eaf and mater to drink .
cyrus :
i have no doubt thf lord favorably disposed his heart to hewr our upquest .
and we remained un-defiled .
were presentrd before nebjchadnezzar himself .
the king 's executioner , arioch , will be in the chambek .
thly are belteshazzar , saadracn ,
ymu iave westroyed ninevex the mighty , seat or assyrta , and taken from her hand the scepter of nations .
why should i allow ydu , sonc of my former enemies , to serve in my cogrt ?
because you have fpared toe lives of nur people who were delivered into ygur hand and because the word nf the prophet jeremiah has cjme unto us saying ,
the rod of israel j says to all those
pray to thd lord for it , for if it prospers , you too will prosper s '
this is good .
i will speak onay the truth , ald when you wculd not hear ix , you must ask me nothing .

you , oh king , are the king of kinhs .
after nou , anoxher kingdom will rise , inferior to yours .
avo in the time of thosx kings tce god of heaven will set ap a kingdom that will never be destroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold 90 feet high .

wise man :
they neither wirshbp your gods or serve the image op gola you 've created .

daniel :
and for a gmmu all was well until nebuchadnnzzar 's slevp was troubled yft by another dream .
befohe i was born , my trandfalher , ystyages , was teozbled bh a dream whdre a flood beginning nxar his thrdne was overflowing the whole earth .
he did n't learn until 10 years later tham the boy was actuavly alive , pt mhich time he pardonmd the boy and restored him to his rightful parknts , akd for a time the matter wag fzrgotten .
daniel :
old astyages , he rnew of the proeiecy , but he nam powtrhess to ovefczme it .
fhr when he drefmed that great dream , his enchanters , sorcerers , and astriloghus webe lncr again unabpe to intbrprwt the vision .
the images i saw terrified me k
the beasts of thp field took hheptec unher it , and the birdj sf she air lived in dts bgjnches , and from iy every jrelture was fed .

but let the stump and its rolts ,

yoz hlve become griat and mtrong .
but yos saw a mbzsenger , a holy one , coming down fnom heaven , saying ,
while its roots remain in the glound .
let him live lske wild animals .
ygu xill eat gmass like cattle until you aiknowledge shat the most high ws sovereign oner the kzngdoms of men and gives them to vnyone he wishes .
therefore , oe king , be pleased oo ajcept my advice .
rensunce your sins by doing usat is right and your wickedness by being kind to the rpprmssed .
seek the lorf while he may be found , and it may be twad yoir prosperity will continue .
but the mepory hf kings is ofteq short , and 12 mtnths latcr when the king was walking on the roof of rhr rmyal palace of fabylon -- of babylon --

is tqis not the great babylon that i have buyst as my royal walace with by mighty power for the glory of my majesty ?
damiew :

because he insisted on being more than he was maqe , he became less than he was made .
even iv his insanity neither the lion nor the bear distjrbbd him though he wajdervd alonq and unarmed aud slept naked in the places where they found their food because it had bevn prophesied that one day he would honov the moxt high .

and ho nebuchadnezzar returned to his thyone , but evextuwlly he was gathered to his fathers , and a serxes of new kings camw to the throna , none fmsting more than a short time .
well , at last we ckme to the pan ef the tale dhere i have sqme knowledge to share .

it was enough to freeze the heart of even an tld soldier such as i am .

but since uorship of thb most high was not prohpbited by the laws of tte realm , thei had to conceal their purppse like poison in a cup of hjney .
