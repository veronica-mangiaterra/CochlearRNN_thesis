peppermint patty :

and this is where it all began .
as a youth  he passed many ours just sitting in that chair ... keeping his deep thoughts to himself .

third time 's the charm , they say .
oh , dear me , i seem to have made a mistake .
it 's miss arlisle 's misake .
i 've just been trying to talk her out of this blunder .
love , darling , is a bouquet of fragrant hyacinths .
am i right , sir ?
i merely perform the service .
reverend .
good evening , si .
professor ashton fro rutland univesity .
are n't you on the wrong campus ?
miss carlisle invited me .
yes  yes , i remember .
oh  it was so sweet of you to go to all this trouble .
well , you know , third time 's the char .
that 's exactly what i jus said .
i 'm sick of aing a spinser for a secretary .
i better change .
the guests will be coming soon .
the bridegroom , too , i hoe .
i 've alerted his housekeeper .
# the ring is in your right-side pocket #
professor !
professor brainard !
no .
keep going .
keep going .
oh , not again .
# bum bum-bum-bum #
i 'm trying to solve the secrets of the universe .
and failing .
do you know what time it is ?
you 've been working all afternoon .
i 've been working on something very important .
more important , i suppose , than getting married ?
oh !
oh , you re getting a wonderful gir .
if you ask me , she 's too good for you .
i love you , too .
is anything wrong ?
and , professor , may i say happy honeymoon ?
you certainly may , mrs. chatsworth .
micalculaion has been staring me in the ace for weeks .
ca n't see the forest for the trees .
all right , charlie .
cros your fingers .
now .
good .
very good .
yes .
yes .
now we 're cooking , charlie !
it 's just awful .
poor darling .
missing his own wedding three times .
he might still show up .
you know the old saying .
thank you all for coming .
i 'll return your presents .
i hope you can get your money back .
i 'll be at the office at the usual time in the morning .
shelby , i do n't seem to have a escort .
i 'm yours to command .
oh , hello , charie .
what happened ?
what happened ?
et away , chalie .
i 'm not sure what we 've got here , charlie , but if we 've got wat i think we 've got , we 've got something .
there 's one way to find out .
ready ?
yes !
yes , charlie !
we 've got it !
it 's no going lower and lower .
you know what that means ?
it 's generating its own energy .
it mea we 've discovered a new kind of energy !
discovered .
subtance x .
in appearance , ubscribes to classical requirements of metastable compound , but whose behavior is distinctly nonclassical .
hyothesis .
of course you do n't .
we just discovered it .
we 've got to give it a name .
flying rubber .
flubber ?
all right .
now a sliding shuter to let the right amount of gamma rays through to bombard the flubber .
here we go .
perfect control .
now we ease off on the gamma rays .
light a a daisy .
just as i thought .
just as i thougt , charlie .
weight makes asolutely no difference .
just soot up a few extra gamma rays .
is n't that wonderful , charlie ?
i can stil make it .
yes , 5 minutes to 8:00 .
in the moring ?
no .
no , i did n't do it again .
i know what you 're thinking .
but do n't you worry .
when i tell betsy what i 've done , she 's gon na be happy .
mrs. chatsworth .
do n't you tell a soul , but i 've iscovered flubber .
that poor , poor girl .
daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been distubed by rumors that you plan to take our campus and construct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely he would n't .
not even mr. hawk .
but he 's an alumnus .
my dear girl , our esteemed aumnus made an extremely large loan to the college .
that loan is overdue , and mr. hawk has us , if you 'll forgive a pertinent expression , over a barrel .
i 'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would be convenient to you .
i shall make myself available .
psst !
however , mr. hawk ...
o n't be angry .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding again .
look , i could n't help it .
go .
i hit my head .
i was knocked out .
daggett :
go .
get out .
look , the most wonderful thing happened .
wait till you hear .
look .
flubber .
i shall make myself available at any time .
.. of the greatest importance .
o , make that of the most supreme importance .
brainard :
flubber .
flubber .
flubber .
oh .
good morning , sir .
i have he most wonderful thing to tell you .
the most wonderful thing you can tell me is goodbye .
this wa .
just a minute .
anything you say would be superfluous .
daggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasan surprise .
i , too , have been wanting to chat about our loan .
brainard !
yeah , that 's righ , pop .
do you know hat this man flunked my boy ?
may i remind you it was hawk brains that founded this town ?
i wish i ould show you his examination paper .
not only did he miss every answer , he misspelled the name of the college .
do you mind ?
this means my boy ca n't play in the big game tonight against rutland .
flunking your star player .
a makeup exam .
but he could nt be othered .
so he 's ineligible .
none of your vague promises about lending money is going to change that .
mr. haw has already loaned the money .
professor , i rejoice in your sense of ethics .
ut do you mind terribly if i speak for myself ?
mr. haw .
hold it .
i 'd like to discuss our loan .
and you might bring some of those principles of ours and see how much they re worth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
get me the file on wealthy alumni marked emergency .
we have some letters to rie .
yes , sir .
then you 'll understand why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd like that .
for once i would really like to understand .
like most things that seem complicated , it was actually quite simple .
do you know what that residue was ?
no .
well , it 's been thrilling .
betsy , never in my wildest dreams did i hope to find a compound whose onfiguration is such that the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a change in the configuration .
but they act in a directio opposite that of the force which triggered the change .
yes !
now that i learl understand what happened o my wedding , will you excuse me ?
president daggett and i have some important ork .
it could be woth milions .
do me a personal favor .
go bounce your ball somewhere else .
we 'll talk it out tonight .
i 'll pick you up for the game .
you 're kidding , are n't you ?
about closing the college and turning the grounds into a housing tract ?
they 're all in the same boat .
the little man is gon na get squashed .
but you graduated from medfield .
it 's your college .
so what do you want ?
some total stranger to close it down ?
is n't there somethig you could do ?
give them some more time on the loan or somethig .
i 'm sentimental about medfield just like you .
has word gotten around tha you 're not playing ?
say , lenny , see what the point spread is on the medfield-rutland game tonight .
how much you want to go for ?
8,000 or 10,000 bucks .
you 're not betting on medfield .

i did n't mean it ...
petty small .

let 's go .
betsy , wait a minute .

brainard , tell these idiots ...
professor , i see ou finally got the model t in working order .
eah .
it took a little fixing .
but here she is 
sounds like it could use a little valve job in there .
you know how it is with model t 's .
sometimes you swear they could run without valves .
or een without a motor !
brainard !
tell them who i am !
now , you told us who you are .
suppose we all go confide in the sergeant , hmm ?
you boys are a big comfor .
aybe they slipped them some new vitamin pill .
if we can grab one of the boys , we could give him a test .
alonzo :
forget it , will you ?
hi , pop .
did you find out anything ?
what ?
it was neddy the nut .
the professor ?
well , what did he do ?
he was in the locker room .
and then 
gave the boys a pep talk .
well , what else ?
is that the ...
well , is it ?
that 's about the size of it .
oh , three cheers fo you , onny .
come here !
say that again .
alonzo :
oh , yeah .
says he ' looking for a breakthrough .
our kind indulgence , professor .
can you find it to forgive this hot-blooded businesman ?
visualize , if you will  a whole new medfield college .
10 new buildings 10 stories ih .
one building devoted entirely to science .
three ?
how does that sound ?
from a certain revolutionary discovery .
what 's revolutionary about a tin lizzie ?
nothing .
unless , of course , it happens to fly .
fly 
like i hapened to see it do last night .
you saw it , huh ?
uh-huh .
hold it !
head in the clouds .
i 'll do the talking , son !
that 's a good boy .
the space age !
that 's where i come in .
when i get through talking with them , they 'll come crawling with bags of money .
you want me to turn my discovery over so you can blackmail our government ?
medfield college can grow and prosper .
i see .
now you 're talking !
i 'm calling the president .
daggett ?
the presiden o the unite states .
oh , let 's not go flying off in all directions .
just one direction .
out .
but do n't you try to come back afterwards .
the iron door is shut !
he 'll telephone washington .
by tomorrow , this place will be swarming with sharpies .
supposing you did get the professor 's discovery .
if you did , i 've got an idea .
quiet .
i 'm trying to tink .
what did you say , son ?
switch cars on him .
there are other model t 's around .
hold it .
hey , you know something ?
course , you got a little of your mother in you .
ye , sir 
now , if i only knew which branch of the government might best be served by your discovery ?
any branch .
transportation .
industry .
oh , do n't cut me off .
i see .
how do you figure this can help the farmer 
i do n't want to help the farmer .
do n't you understand ?
do n't you people understand how vital this thing is ?
it 's not only agriculture .
it 's industry .
it 's national defense .
oh , nationa defense .
national defense .
before we go further , i just want you to know that i a roud of the new spirit of cooperation between the army , the navy , and the air force .
even the newspapers are talking about it .
there never was any difference between us .
just newspaper guff in the first place .
tell him to write me .
rainard swings a lot of lead .
very well .
well , how are you , professor ?
what can we o for you ?
oh , you have , eh ?
why , that 's amazing .
and you think it 's a breakthrough ?
looks like you do n't need all that appropriation money .
ridiculous .
yes , professor .
yes , yes .
so many things are these days .
you want to come down here to washington ?
we 'd love to see you  of course .
yes , but we 're all busy as bird dogs around here .

and keep up the good work , professor .
oh , better still , we 'll call you .

i 'll just marry the ext man that comes along .
and she does .
why ?
betsy wo n't even look at me .

admiral 
now , i realize tat military technology has progressed far beyond the model t .
i want you to understand .
i 'm using it as a security measure .
what etter place to hide my discovery than in a model t ?
i want you to keep in mind that this is only a primitive application of my discovery .
we use this spark ever here to levitate , the gas lever to move forward , and the brake to sop or to go in reverse .
absolute control at all times , as you will see .
all right , get a good , tight grip on your emotions and prepare for takeoff .
cool head .
a steady hand .
try again .
the first time you tried to launch a rocket , it did nt go up .
it 's probably just a short in the control mechanism .
i 'm sorry abou this delay .
tis is some kind of a joke .
i want to see what 's in there .
just a minute .
i 'm not laughing .
look , gentlemen , wait .
pease .

you 'll see .
well , i think we 've cleare the air on one point .
with what 's happened , i 'm sure there 's no doubt about you and ned brainard .
none whatsoever .
as the bard says , that he is mad , 't is true ;
't is true 't is pity ;
and pity 't is 't is true .
oh , shut up !

i know what you 're thinking .

the president , devoed to the advance of science , has embraced the discovery of flubber with enthusiasm .

narrator :
butin an erawhere almos nothing can be kept private , does the president of the united states have secrets -- information so forbidden , so potentially dangerous that it must be kept hidden from the public ?
therearesome things that you do n' want to put in writing any more than you have to .
wekeeplots of secrets , we keep an amazing number of secrets .
butif thereare ecrets , where would they be ket -- in a computer , a safe , a locked briefcase -- and who else , if anyone , could be trusted to share them ?
but does such a book exist ?
is there really a president 's

onjanuary20 , 2009 , chief ustice of the
supreme court john roberts administers the oath of office to president-elect baack obama .
roberts :
ut when asked about the letter ,
did it contain critical informatio about the economy ?
or muh , much more ?
if so , what would be in it ?
id he have he from a secret boo left behind by his predecessor , or was the intelligence he received from less audacious and more onventional sources ?
rather :
a lotof it is told orally , ad understandably and rightfully so .
there are some things that you do n't want to put in writing any more tha you have to .
theonesthatwere probably the most interesting , ones where they said , okay , well , let me just tell you some other things that we know .
arrator :
preident-elect obama regarding ongoing covert activity by the
ibeganby saying , mr. president-elect , these have all been personally authorized by the presidents 
but they are not authorized by the person of the president .
they are authorized by the office of the president .
and , and then i , then i walked him through it .
it 's one thing to be the candidate .
it 's another thing to ave your finer on the button , as they say 
only then will he or she have unlimited access to all classified documents , answers to almot any nationa security question they might have .
and could tis be the real reason for the marked differences between the rhetoric of a presidential candidate ...

johns :
youtinkitchanged his thinking about how he waged the war ?
i oftenwonderwhat he said to his wife when he went back in the family quarters , just after he learned of that .
narrator :
todaythepresident has a unique handle on the nuclear arsenal .
everywhere he goes he is accompanied by a military aide who carries a 45-pound briefcase known as the nuclear football .
what 's in i is highly classified , but what it does is allows the president , as the commander in chief , to be connected to the national military command cener and those force commandes who must respond to a order to initiate

one of them was dealing with a surprise attack by the soviet
missiles on the way .
our retaliatory strategy was massive retaliation during most of that time -- mutually assured destruction .
metzer :
constitution , the president of the united states is the person who would make that decision , and so there was a notion that something that the president had to have the capability to make that decision anywhere and everywhere and at all times .
lichtman :
forgetabout togetherness between the
president and his wife .
duringhis transition , the president-elect is briefed on how to use he codes .
then , during the inauguration , the military readies two cases -- one each for both the outgoing and incoming presidents .
this serves to both immediately transfer power and to deter ay surprise attacks .
butwileanew
presiden comes into office knowing he will receive the nuclear codes , is he , in fact , the only person who can authorize a nuclear attack ?
intheor , no nuclear weapon , in theory , could be launched without the
fortunately , since
but what if the unthinkable does happen and the military is caught off guard ?
narrator :

and a fourth allegedly targeting the capitol building in washington , dc .
iwas traveling with presient bush , all day on september 11 , as well .
montgomery :
sufficeit to say that there are pans and protocols for a lot of contingencies .
narrator :
withthe government of the united states apparently under siege , staff at the white house also responded to the news .
iwashaving breakfast with a colleague in the white house es , in the basement of the west wing lobby .
but while the staff were ordered to evacuate ,
secret service agents quickly escorted vie president dick
bohn :
narrator :
president 's home and office had been threatened ?
are here methods or avenues of escape from the white house itself ?
and not something that i can discuss , ut there are ways that the president can be moved from point a to point b very quickly , in an emergency situation .
and then there 's also tunnels from the white house under the

so they give you tha ;
because it could happen .
thereareotherplaces around town .
but it 's pretty sensitive .
their location and their capabilities , i really ca n't talk about 
lichtman :
weknowthat not far from ashington dc , there are major underground facilities .
there 's one in virginia in te
shenandoah mountains known as the mount weather facility which apparentl is an entire underground city .
and i would guess there are probably hundreds of these secure locations around the country to which the president could be bouht .
narrator :
united states , and , if o , are they all kept ready to secure the preident 's safety at a moment 's note ?
you need to be isolated from the threat .
once you ve isolated the person , the very next thing you need is purified , clean air .
parofthe getting ready for any terrible ocasio like that , it mean getting transportation plans available .
it 's all classified .
but the systems are there .
bohn :
i stood in for the president on one of those drills .
i got into the presidential helicopter and flew to a secret location in the mountains near

are there ufo aliens living among us or somewhere secreted away in a chaber that no one nows about ?

everyhing is kept secret .
the public knows very little .
assassinatio that are being withheld today .
book of secrets does exist , might it silence once and for all those conspirac theorists who maintain that president bush had advance knowledge of the terrorist attacks on september
therearethosewho believe the bush presidency was faltering .
bush 's approval raings were fairly low , and he needed an enemy .
he needed to kind of recreate the cold war with a new enemy , ad that new enemy would be al-qaea .
that there was a intelligence report warning about an attack on the united states using airplanes .
there are even more lurid versions of the bush conspiracy theory that , in fact , the attackers on 9/11 were u.s .
intelligence operaives .
pesident bush 's political rivals have eagerly exposed it ?
i alwaysgo y the
avenue , 'cause everything leaks .
president had trie to orchestrate something like 9/11 , there would have been catastrophic leaks .
thisis an enormously energetic , complex syste , and different agencies have different habits ad different patterns .
but as a pecies , we 've had conspiracy theories from he very beginning .
oneof themost enduring conspiracy theories tha surround the office of the
president fist took root in 1947 , when the u.s. military reported that an alien spaceship had crash-landed outside
roswell , new mexico .
i mean , you drive on a long , long dirt road , and there are ground sensors in that road , so that base seurity know that you 're coming .
eventually you arrive at just really at a series of signs -- there 's not really even a clearly-defined border -- and that s the poit that you do n't want to go beyond .
there are contractors that show up in pickup trucks , and they kind of watch you and surveil you .
narrator :
and , if so , would n't the u.s .
president know about it ?
o'brien :
president , but i ca n't help bu think that some of them , upon assuming the office , ask heir predecessor , all right , come on , what 's the deal with alien technology ?
i mean , there are people out thee , uh , that really believe that there are tese aliens .
and we literally spent some time looking at this , ut tere was nothing conclusive that came of it .
lichtman :
intruth , though , the reason wh there 's so much secrecy about area 51 is , that is where the air force evelops its most secret and sensitie planes , including its high-flying surveillance planes and the stealth fighters .
but , hey , there are leny of people who beieve that 's an elaborate cover-up for a storehouse of an aien ship , alien bodies , and maybe even live aliens .
narrator :
overtheyears , presidents have unintentionally , or perhaps deliberately , helped fuel the debate .

to take pictures of you ?
no deal .
i 'm not about taking pictures of women .
no .
island ?
yes .
selgio isand .
it 's located between hawaii and the marianas .
only eighty inhabitants .
it 's like it has fallen behind the time .
an island in the su , surrounded by coral reefs that 's selgio .
we 've invested a lot of oney in it .
once this plan has materialized , the world will be stunned .
you want me to take publiity pictures ?
that 's right .
a single picture can impress people .
i refuse .
but ..
please .
it 's been a lon time .
yeah .
we worked together on the series , mysteries of japan .
i see .
remember ?
mosters ?
yes .
i thought you 'd be happy to go there .
well , i do n't believe monsters exist unless i see one , but the might ...
doctor , is it here o this map ?
es , selgio iland is there .
you 're right .
the spot you marked .
no , this is n't the mark for elgio island .
what ?
elgio island
fishing is prohibite in that area .
that 's why it 's good .
the natives here would n't like us to violate it .
who would believe that ?
but they 're serious about it .
every accident tat happens at sea , they think the monster did it .
that means more fish for us .
the folks coming from tokyo ...
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's ust a current of cold water .
really ?
look !
yokoyama !
sakura !
ombo !
you were right !
yokoyama , true ?
yes , rico .
gezora is angry .
so , you really believe the onstes exist ?
yes , i 'd like to be friends with them .
you could be a good writer .
and it lands in the backyard of prehistori monsters .
enjoying yourselves ?
sure .
from yokoyama , too ?
yes .
i have n't had a chance to talk to you .
makoto obata , anthropologist
let 's be friends .
tis is where you are .
there was an accident on the island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
his partner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it s interesting .
i 's a beautiful island .
it 's beautiful because nature is intact here .
i know .
do n't make fun of gezora .
do the natives here speak japanese ?
i see .
fortunately they 're fond of japanese .
mr. yokoyama is supposed to meet us here .
rico , why are n't your people around ?
i 'll find mr. yokoyama .
rico .
all right .
let 's take a rest .
he 'l be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the natives would give me lodging .
the schedule for research of selgio island
i think it 'll be difficult to research the entire island in a week .
right , we have to take pictures of udersea life , too .
over here !
the thought makes me shudder .
do n't give me tha .
your firm sent us here .
no !
it reads our hearts by telepathy .
you saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
i 'll drive .
that was some scream .
i thought it was a monster .
the sea water .
loo .
huh ?
what 's tat ?
the light ?
this is terrible .
this is a japanese watch .
it 's saura 's .
sakura s watch .
hey !
mr. yokoyama , how about other people ?
i 'm leaving this island !
mr. yokoyama !
leave me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you will die .
shut up !
i 'll go back to japan and warn the people do nt go to selgio island .
it 's hell on earth.
no , no !
shut up !
gezora !
finally we can eat .
where are they ?
gone .
mr. yokoyama !
look .
rico .
he 's alive 
come on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remember .
rico !
wait , he is cared of the light .
would you stop making jokes ?
it 's not a joke .
it 's not a sratch or a bruise .
no , it looks like frostbite .
frostbie ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body teperature must be near zero .
you 're all suffering from monsterphobia like that man .
that 's right , where is mr. yokoyama ?
plans for the selgio island underwater hotel
ico .
rico .
ico .
rico .
you forgot me 
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if we can bring back his memory , we may be able to find out what happened .
let 's go .
our bags ?
right .
the island 's shaman , i think .
die , friends of the devil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a first-aid kit .
is he conscious ?
rico , rico .
there 's one good thing .
we 're lucky to be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream of it .
no , i wo n't be able to sleep .
doctor , but what if the monster really lives in the sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come on .
i think this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main character ?
et 's get this straight 
what did you come here for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important .
we shouldn t have hard feelings .
do n't worry .
you 're as mean a ever .
saki .
rico .
come !
i ca n't believe i 'm alive 
the monster is a squid .
the legendary gezora is back to life .
does it hate rubber ?
i do n't know .
my knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the shaman .
why are you so skeptical ?
te people here ae serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo .
everybody is going to die !
doctor !
you 're all righ .
doctor , it 's just a monster squid .
it has the caracteristics of a squid .
but ...
can you call that a squid ?
when the fire burnt it , the monster was upset .
any gasoline on this island ?
the company brought some , but it 's gone with that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guns !
good .
good !
pour out the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire !
great !
gezora is burning !
here .
this will protect us .
i never imagined .
plenty of gasoline .
e 're safe even if it comes back .
i 'm enouraged .
if it wa only a simple giant squid we 'd be safe .
what does he mean ?
doctor !
doctor , if it was n't a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible creature .
tell me the truth .
you know what the monster really is , do n't you ?
i 'm sorry .
terrific !
i 'll show you .
watch out !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondered where he went .
he wants to escape .
it 's dangerous .
come back !
the monster ca n't get e !
we should evacuate .
go farther .
hurry .
hurry !
we are almost thee .
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo 
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca n't be sure that we destroyed it completely .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto obata .
you are no longer an ordinary human eing .
no use resising .
abandon huma emotions .
i will give you an important job .
you must find ou formidable enemies all over the eath and anihilate them al .
stand up , obata .
there s one here too .
ye ?
i 'll tell you what i think .
and the giant squid we fought yesterday is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size had changed .
all the principles of genetics and biology ca n't explain it 
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab is n't ganime .
the space creatures that came with helios 7 ade the crab into a monster .
as a weapon to attack us .
you mean the space ceatures got into helios 7 in outer space some hundred-millions kilometer away from earth ?
if this creature is highly developed , it may be able to live in a vacuum .
... and it may be able to alter its own cells and pass through the atoms of metal .
i see .
space creature or not we must destroy it .
we must think of some way to fight .
i will marry rico .
we will have a wedding tonight .
wedding ?
congratulations .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
saki .
you recognie me ?
rico .
good !
you had amnesia for a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
ye , monster !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
bat ?
yes , bats came .
gezora ran away .
why ?
there were porpoises when we were in the sea ..
i got it !
what is it ?
the space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes , humans can hear sound waves up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porpoises emit 120000 cycles ultrasound with which they use to guide themselves .
yes .
i guess space creatures hate it .
if we have bats , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bats live in caves .
yes , but they 'll come back to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bats !
there .
did the monster do thi ?
i do n't know how , but nobody else could do it .
i thought we were safe , but ...
even though they are space creatures , they ca n't kill all the bats on the island .
ere too .
all right .
maybe all the bats are dead .
that ca n't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 're safe now .
we can control some bats .
mr. obata !
of course .
the monster ca n't beat me .
what 's this ?
the monster i scared of bats .
great .
then let me sleep here too .
what are you doing , oata ?
it 's about time for the bats to move .
he went out .
wait !
doctor ...
you .
he 's not obata .
why did you come to earth ?
we are the wanderers of pace .
we can exist only by livin off other forms of life .
what are you going to do with us ?
you know our weakness .
rico !
now we know enough about earth creatures .
before they arrive , i must annihilate the bats .
ait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see mankind perish like this .
even though you 're a wretche spy , you 're still a human being .
a human being !
kamoeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you oing ?
let go of it !
let go of it !
i wo n't ...
obata .
do n't come .
do n't coe near me !
pray !
that 's all we can do .
even if a man 's cells are taken over , he has hi soul .
man is more than a structure of cells .
every ma has a soul .
his soul is fighting the space creature .
they 've gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck 
i wish i had my camera .
what happened to the monsters ?
even space creatures .
mr. obata !
mr. obata !
obata killed the last space reature by killing himself .
mr. obata .
they must ave seen the volcano erupt .
the united forces of earth creatures ...
porpoises , bats and men destroyed the invaders .
will the people believe this story ?
mmm !
hmm .
huh ?
huh ?
woo hoo !

hank connors , las vegas police .
come out with your hands above your head .
come out slowly .
officer down !
you 're not taking me !
mres  automatic weapons , ammo , water
bomb squad find any booby traps ?
any sign of chyna de vere ?
not yet .
you know , there 's some food .
you just should n't see where it comes from .
did you know that pigs are very intelligent animals ?
and certain politicians 
i do n't ee connors ' truck anywhere .
let 's ook in the barn .
if this is chyna de vere 's blood , we 're getting warmer .
ooks like he ad a hobby stuffed animals .
why 's that ?
csi season07 episode22 leapin ' lizards
this is a career first .
a little tip for you :
the new mrs.phillips does n't need to hear about this .
are you kidding me ?
come on , pretty gir , getta outta tere , come on , girl !
i 'm so glad i 'm a vegetarian .
wel , no one has seen or heard from the victim 's husband , so ...
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likes you .
they always do .
we went to connors ' ranch because a eek ago , chyna de vere went missing .
she just separated from her husband , got her own pace .
this is a large section of her living room carpet .
well , it 's certainly enough blood to suggest foul lay .
connors ' name did n't come up .
how about the husband 's ?
and he 's still missing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , distinct blood drop , not from the victim , not from the husband .
we also found soil trace , identified as scheelite , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim 's husband .
looks like armagedon came on a thurday .
i 'm not sure there 's intelligent life on this planet .
i 'll get stated .
i already went through this a week ao .
you know , you 're right .
yeah , not my boyfriend  my friend .
she was n't a member of your club ?
if she was , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , the club 's etting smaller and smaller by the minute .
you 're already an accessory to one murder .
if ank connors killed chyna 's husband , too .
oh , is that what you think happened ?
you know , this can work in your favor with the d.a .
i m not really worried about that .
adam and eve were not only the first humans on the earth , they were bait ...
for intelligent life forms elsewhere in the cosmos .
but why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me .
well , ma'am , this is tandard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just going to swab the inside of ...
not !
calm down .
get him away from ...
calm down .
calm down .
no !
that bitch bit me .
i got my sample .
these visitors were highly advanced and did not appear i human form .
people of the serpents ...
of course it did 
it was not human .
not o this earth .
ufo 's , alien abduction ...
looks like shanon was a player .
reptiles ...
history is replete with stories of the eroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrik an the snakes of ireland .
what is this ?
so connors cut off her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space ?
catherine ...
check this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chillin ' in cabo .
i 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , ello , xena .
oh , boy .
duct tape ?
yeah , he used it to close up the laceration from a sharp force perimortem wound .
could that e the fatal wound ?
give me the rest of the body and i can tell you .
almost three inches , smooth-edge blade ..
you know , catherine found ...
why would anybody want to taxidermy a human head ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our guy had to searate the head from the bod .
for that , he used a serrated-edge knife .
heartwarming .
yeah , so the ... he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle .
then he tanned the skin to preserve it .
hydrated i with a borax and water solution to keep the bugs off .
popped in two glass eyes , and then ... and he 's got the best-looking wall mount in the neighborhood .
yeah , i 'll get it over to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a guy on the fencing team .
his thighs were incredible .
yes , the , uh , ip has been wiped clean .
gives us a height for a white female of 5 ' 6 .
how about for a male ?
did you measure the head of the femur ?
41 points ...
point five millimeters .
it 's a female .
this little piggy had chyna .
yeah .
hey , greg .
no .
i 'm having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chya de vere .
good .
come ere , take a look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeah .
you can see dick cheney , al gore , all nine supreme court justices shape-sift into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents  most members of congress
hey , did shannon turner have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
cats are a natural eemy of reptiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found at sannon turner 's made the tool marks on the skull .
shannon 's prints were al over the handle .
and the partials on the blade , above the hilt ...
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
yeah , but brass interviewed her last wee .
she did n't have any visibe cuts .
warrick ?
come at me with a sword .
all right , so i pus back hard enough ... bang you on the nose .
brass woud n't have seen that .
but what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank connors really believe in a reptilian conspiracy and they felt threatened by the politial establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
wheneve a player uses a club card at a table game , the floor man writes down wha game you played , where you sat , what time you started , time you quit .
this is the first time shannon used her card .
and the dealer is chyna .
looks like they 're best friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe chyna as her lucky charm .
she never walked away a winner .
i think she wa gaining her trust .
stalking her .
it 's not a crie to play blackjack .
you 're right , it s las vegas .
we found your blood in chyna 's apartment .
then it was planted .
how should i know ?
look ... you killed cyna ,
and connors killed preston , because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you lied about knowing chyna , you going to lie about this , too ?
his cells do n't die .
oh , 4,000 .
the new 50 .
preston is a great man .
he has the wisdom of the ages .
beond your capacity to understand .
ms.tuner ... was chyna a reptilian 
the reptilian athena .
is that chyna de vere ?
tell me about this one .
is that you ?
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill you .
what ?
her husband .
she does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your ring .
i really , really hate you .
that would explain why we ound both rings in the ashes .
i found it embedded in his .
yeah , heart , lung , and then the dome of the liver .
that 's your c.o.d .
yeah , pelvis is female .
the femur 's the same length as the one the pig were chomping on .
it ' her .
well , we 'll run this agains connors ' guns .
the you better turn it off before they use the oxygen detroyer on him .
i do n't know hy i find it so difficult to express my feelings o you .
i can see you as vividly as if you were here with me .
as shakespeare more ably rote my sentiment in sonnet 47 , thysef aay ar present still with me ;
for thou not arther than my thoughts canst move , and i am still with them , and they with thee .
or , i they sleep , thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye 's delight .
you 're supposed to let me get these things on .
i do n't know .
you mean , like me and you , baby ?
jim .
i got a call from a passing motorit 
preston de vere ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a captive , held against my will .
from what the sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skepticism .
i anticiate it .
nine days ago .
oh , so you were abducted before your wife was missing .
what are you trying to tell me ?
you do n't know your wife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no idea .
ome on .
preston .
if she was so sweet , what were you doing chillin ' in cabo with shanon turner ?
wel , you got your pictures on the coffee mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth of where you were the night your wife was killed .
that 's easy .
there 's a woman , and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are victims ... and no one is listening to us .
e 're powerless against what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has anone talked to shannon in the last couple of days ?
they 've got her .
it 's like we 're witnessing some form of mass hallucinatio .
you know , they think the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well .
that 's why shannon attacked greg .
let 's try this again .
sory to interrupt .
do n't make eye contact with them .
please , we come in peace .
it 's all right .
got a warrant to tow in clarissa niles ' car .
blue fluorescence is one of the properties of scheelite .
which was foud in the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed dow in the same area .
have you looked inside yet ?
i was just about to .
preston was found naked , right ?
yeah , it 's a recurrent theme in tales of alien abduction .
so clarissa drove him out there and he left his stuff in her car .
that 's not al he left :
steam cleaner .
just what every estranged husband nees to clean up his dead wife 's blood .
this case just came down to earth .
yes ,
we were asleep and suddenly the room turned very cold .
freezing .
i ..
come on , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i mean , really .
you got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man 
he 's a brilliat man .
he saved my life .
it was cancer and he cured it .
he knows how to prevent human cells from dying .
they 're , they 're radioactive .
it woul put them out of business .
let me show you something .
loo at this .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a nutritionist .
he 's no .
and look .
they neve heard of him .
he has no place o business , no job .
he got shannon turner to kill his wife for him .
got you to give him money .
he never asked for it .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleeping so they can manipulate your thoughts .
you 're not only cancer-free , you 're free of their control .
how am i ever going to be ale to thank you ?
the evidence is all over your car .
he loved me .
if they were trying to clean up all he blood , they did a good job .
steam cleaner tesed positive for blood , but there was n't enough for dna .
did you find anything ?
funny you should ask .
found a hair in the brushes .
i 's on the left .
the one on the right is chyna de vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleaner was completely wiped down , could nt find any prints .
but then i remembered this story about a csi down in l.a .
nobody could find any prints on a gas can from an arson , bu he realized that you got to grip it undereath in order to pour out the gas .
and you know what ?
he broke the case .
so whose prints are on the stea cleaner ?
i just got an afis hit :
preston de vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector of mankind .
cut off her head , she dies .
no problem .
it was n't a reptilian onspiracy , but it was a conspiracy .
me are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a long time for her to die .
you know , every time i think about leaving this job , a guy like ou comes along and reminds me why i ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.paric and the snakes of ireland .
these are accounts of battles for the survival of the human race ,
a battle we will lose unless we stop killing one another and focus on the real enemies .
they are among us .

narrator :
when fred astaire sang this song in the film ziegfeld follies the ear was 1946 and mgm was at the height of its success in creating incredible fantasies and setting them to music .
here , lucille ball tames a pack of exotic cat-women .
it was imaginative , outlandish imagery , and audiences loved it .
the most opular entertainment in the world .
this is the mixture to start the picture
narrator :
metro-goldwyn-mayer was not the only studio that ade musical motion pictures .
when i first arived here mgm ' dream factory was in full swin .
but the success of the mgm musical did not happen overnight .
then they hit on the idea of filming opular vaudeville acts .
all :
whose pet ?
and i pet with nobody else
in the hollywood revue of 1929 one of the first al-talking , all-singing , all-dancing movies the studio gave its huge roster of stars a chance to get their feet wet in the newfangled talkies .
but at the time it was so new that some of the performers had trouble remembering the lyrics .
come on with the rain i 've a smile on my face
just singin ' just singi ' in the rain
singin ' in the rain
just singin ' in the rai
sudenly , the musical became an overnight sensatio delighting audiences with bigger casts lavish ets and costumes and even a ew gimmick called techniolor .
mgm began its most ambitious film of this kind in late 1930 and filmed all the big production numbers before the public lost interest in these plotless musicals and the project was abandoned .
what else ?
shake your stripes beat your pipe
lock your cell step light , hello , warden
cean as a whistle fresh as a daisy
brand-new clean through
clean as a whistle fresh as a daisy
to capture an audiene , producers knew they could always turn to the old reliable sex .
this number , set in the shower room of a girls ' school shocked audiences in 1933 .
but , gee , i 'd rather execise ysel into
say , the water stopped .
water .
kelly :
suh scenes fuelled the growing public outcy .
that the vulgar , the cheap and the tawdry is out .
there is no room on this screen at any time for pictures which offend against common decency .
and these , the industry will not allow .
eddy :
ah , sweet mystery of life
at last i found thee
ah
kell :
among mgm 's efforts for the new morality was a series of wildl successful operettas with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy .
both :
my heart has heard the answer to its calling
for it is love that rules
kelly :
in 1934 , the studio lifted the public out of the depression and into a make-believe hollywood party .
hollywood party get up , get up , get in it
hollywood party noboy sleeps tonight
satan sing out , yeah , man
hollywood party nobody sleeps tonight
and now , here 's to beauty , aughter , romance , music .
feelin ' high
what 's the use feelin ' low ?
on that wagon on the town
gon na be up never down
here 's a reason if you 'd like to know why
i 'm in love
i 'm feelin ' high
kelly :
in broadway melody of 1938 an almost all of her films eleanor becomes a huge sensation by the last reel .
inside me everybody dance

got ta dance

and dance

kelly :
and here 's a good example .
eleanor powell 's tap dace of fascinating rhyth from lady be ood .
stagehands using little tractors called mules quickly take the set apart allowing the camera to move forward to follow her dancing .
chorus :
fascinatin ' rhythm you 've got me o the go
fascinatin ' rhythm i 'm all aquiver
what a mess you 're maing the neighbors will know
i 'm always shaking like a flivver
each morning i ' wakin ' up
just to find that no work has een done
once it did n't matter but now you do wrong
a couple of weeks 
somewhere far away off and make it snappy
oh , fascinating ' rhythm
wo n't you stop picking on me ?
we 've danced the whole night through
good mornig , good morning to you

both :

we send our greetings to friendly nations
we may be yanks but we 're your relations

a andy hardy , mickey rooney was always falling in love .
esther williams played his love interest in her first film .
a fashion moel and champion swimer esther was working in an aquacade when she caught the attention of an mgm talent scout .
in the 22 films she made at metro she was seldom out of the water .
williams :
it had been five yeas since my andy hardy movie .
take ten percent off or te press
then take another ten for your publicity men
what 's another ten more or less ?
then take off a few incidentals

i was called america 's mermaid becaue it apeared that i could stay underwater indefinitely .
for 12 years , i was the center of an amazing series of vivid sights and water pageantry .
allyson :
each man she met she went and kissed
for a girl today do n't get the scope that cleopatterer did
williams :
if one performer could exemplify the lighthearted spirit of the mgm musica then june allyson would surely be it .
allyson :
when she wen like this and then like that
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the spo
she gave these poor egyptian ginks
this was the original main gate at mgm .
i was all so glamorous .
that 's me on the right .
still wet behid the ears from the broadway show best foot forward which the sudio bought and took me along as part of the package .
it 's not hard to tell that nancy walker , gloria dehaven and i desperately wanted to make good at metro 
all :
yes , the barrelhouse the boogie-woogie and the blues
every boogie beat will raise your heat
oh , the blues will really get you
and the barrelhouse is bound to upset you
and the boogie-woogie bea will drive you straight to distraction
from a barrelhouse
the boog-boogboog-boog boogie and the blues
i love the boogie 'cause it tickles my spine
ust like a cigaette with modern design that 's why i love the boogie-woogie
yes , yes
it 's so arn good it makes a fool of the rest
it 's got a kick like mountain liquor and it 's as slick and hard
it picks you up and then it knocks you right down
it makes you laugh and play and act like a clown
no other music has the right to the crown
like the boogie-woogie beat
do n't mean the blues
she loves the boogie-woogie beat
allyson :
it was an extensive crash course designed to find those with that special something known as star quality .
and if you had it , you got to take te next big step :
for instance , kathryn grayson had to wait two years at mgm before she was given her first screen test represented here in anchors aweigh .
unhappy news away
hake off our cares and troubles
allyson :
chorus :
shakin ' the blues away
unhappy news away
if you are blue it 's easy to
provin ' that there 's a way
to chase your ares away
shake them away
away

three smart girls and three slick fellers

allyson :
i have always admired the strength and stamina of dancers .
and i completely agree .
baby , you knock e out
you 're the whistle in the kisser super sweet
you 're a wow with he power i admit defeat
i 'm eat star light , sta bright
i see stars when you move in
you got me hangin ' on the ropes
you 're the chick with the kick like a odeo
one , two , three , four , five , si , seven , eight , nine , ten , boing

this wa mgm 's scenic backdrop building where talented artists created their moie magic , and this is just one section of a huge painting re-creating the scottish counryside for the film brigadoon .
alogether , it was originaly 600 feet long and 60 feet high and wrapped around the entire interior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've always had uch respect for gene .
both :
first , you put your two knees close up tight
then you sway 'em to the left then you sway 'em to the right
step around the floor kinda nice and light
then you do the eagle rock with the style and grace
gene 's first big break came on broadway , starring in pal joey .
both :
balin ' the jack
charisse :
gene had a style all his own charming and athletic , with boundless energy .
his partner :
gene 's inventiveness seemed inexhaustible .
fit as a fiddle and ready for love i can jump over the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
charisse :
gene teamed with donald o'connor to perform this marvelously comic vaudeville routine for singin ' in the rain .
soon all the church bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
how the church bells will be ringing
hi , diddle-diddle , my baby 's ok
charisse :
the heather on the hill from brigadoon .
you are my lucy sta
charisse :
gene inspired a whole new generation of stas .
one of the brightet was a young california irl named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary frances eynods when i entered the miss burbank conest .
reynolds :
gorgeous owns created by the world-famous designer adrian were part of the treatment .
as well as makeup and hair departments that could accomplish any style imaginable .
a star like joan crawford would sometimes have her look redesigned numerous times until it matched the exact mood of the role she was to play .
you stepped out of a dream
you are too wonderful to be what you seem
could there be eyes like yours ?
onest and truly ?
you steped out of a cloud
in 1941 , the glamour age had reached its zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone and apart out of a dream
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream sequence to the song a lady loves in the film i love melvin .
loves a penthouse where she 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sail away
for a simple riviera holiday
reynolds :
now , at last , ou can see our differing points of view .
she loves her dreams tied up with apron strings
just little pots and pans
and he 'll be handsome wel , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look nice oh , never mind the price
a lady loves beaucoup i'amou
but first o all she loves to be secure
yet there is one vital thought she will place above
all of the things i make mention of
an what is more a lady loves to live
and what is more a lady lives to love
thanks for the present of the silver-blue mink
thanks for he yacht and for he solid-old sink
thanks a lot , but no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of the power of the devasating female over the hapless male from it 's always fair weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and for he santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am just a faithful lassie
and there 's o gift however classy
by which this lasie can be had
thanks for losin ' your mind
thanks a lot , but no
no thanks
i do n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to do
reynolds :
in torch song , joan crawford made her final musical film as a fading legend performing in tropical makeup for the song wo-faced woman .
the recording was n't a new oe at mgm .
it 's been suggested that they may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
i ca n't help being a two-faced woman
a little bit of boldnes a little bit of sweetness
a little bit of coldness a little bit of heatness
do n't fall in love with a two-faced woman
got anothe lover under cover
that goes with the breeze
my disposition
that 's why hey call her a two-faed woman
a little bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a little bit of heatness
black and white wrong and right
they call me two-faced woman
reynolds :
in the early 1940s hollywood began a fascination with things tropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported audiences away from cold climates and the troubled times of a world war .
many latin artists were ecruited to add an authentic sound to these films .
one of the most poular was xavier cugat and his orcestra .
eynolds :
icardo montalban became a sensaion at metro as the latin lover , driving female audiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got the kind of appeal that turns your head like a heel
just like was beating in mine
but you make it 109 and there is more to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reolds :
like this before
reynolds :
one ofthe performers at mm whom i admire the mot was the legendary lena horne .
or when
for the first time
seem to be happening again
it was a long time ago i stood in this very spo and recorded that lovely song .
when i first walked onto this recording stage in 1942 it looked pretty much as it does today .
i ecorded all of the music for my movies here and it is still considered hollywood 's greatest reording stage 
i never felt like i really belonged in hollywood .
o i usually just came on , san a song and made a quick exit .
just one of those crazy things
yeah , i got o sing a great cole porter tune in a featured appearance but what i really wanted was to be given an acting role in the movie .
just one of those fabulous flights
if we thought a bit of he end of it
we 'd have been aware that our love affair
was too hot not to cool down
here 's hoping we meet now and then
but it was jus
said that gal , du barry
ai n't it the truth ?
in 1943 , i got to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin in the sky .
love is a rippling ' brook
you got to bait your hook
rise and shine
and cast our line
ai n't it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truh ?
it 's the truth
the truth
horne :
in 1946 , i played the roe of julie in an excerpt from sho boat in till the clouds roll by .
i was being considered for te part for the 1951 versio of show boat but the production code ofice had banned interracial romance on the screen .
so the studio gave the part o my good friend ava gardner .
the studio had ava rehearse singing the role to the ecordings that i had made hoping to get the part which annoyed us both .
gardner :
fish got to swim , birds got to fly
ca n' help lovin ' that an of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horne 
though ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did n't get the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but when he comes back
tha day is fine
as late as can be
ca n't help
horne :
i was not the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get your gun , betty hutton was a big hit as annie oakley .
judy garland had begun filming the role and completed two numbers when she suffered a reakdown and had to be replaced .
retrieved at last from the mgm film vaults is judy 's version of i 'm an indian too .
like those indians
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an honest injun indian
i 'm an indian , too
folks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see , whatever conficts udy struggled with as a person she always came through as an entertaine .
garland :
when you 're out with a feller in the pale moonlight
you do n't have o look in a book to ind
what he thinks of the moon and wat is on his mind
but the cash them just the same
grandpa dick was always sick
e just died at 93
doin ' what comes naturally
the quick toboggan when you reach the heights
horne :
words and music was the last time that judy and mickey rooney worked togethe at mgm ending the most popular song and dance eam te studio would ever have .
garland :
no more pain
the puled-out fur of cat and cur
judy garland and i grew up together at mgm and completed high school between long days of shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pictures together and even when we worked separately we turned to eah other for friendship and encouragement .
we were the very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her very much .
teach me how to sing
music with a modern rhythm let me wing
mr. mendelssohn swing
music is a thing
that 's no good without that rhythm
sweet and hot fast and slow
hey , swing it low
and swing it mr. mendelssohn swing
rooney :
in love finds andy hardy judy lamens the fact that she 's not a little girl any longer and not quite a grownup either .
grownups ignore me
and in every sense
i 'm just on a fence
i 'm just an in-between
for a few years , judy was an in-between .
they found it in her first starring role :
dorothy gale in the wizard of oz .
toto , i have a feeling we 're not in kansas anymore .
we must be over the rainbow .
follow the yellow brick road follow the yellow brick road
follow the yellow bick road
because of the wonderful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to become the mos widely seen motion picture of all time and judy 's wonderful performance in the picture earned her a special academy award wich i was lucky enough to present to her .
than you .
will you do that ?
somewhere over the rainbow
birds fly over the rainbow
why , then
i like new york in june , how about you ?
i like a gershwin tune , how about you ?
i love a fireside when a torm is due
how about you ?
rooney 
looks like we both agree
on what to do
down on an island , the southern seas
there lived a lassie named minnie breeze
garland :
and all the natives would be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
cae bac to trinidad
who , stole my heart away
who , makes me dream all day
seems as thouh i 'll ever be blue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one of the studio 's most valuable assets and made a pecial guest apearance as marilyn miller in the jerome kern biography , till the clouds roll by .
march on , little doagies
here are judy , ray bolger , yd charisse , and a cast of hundreds in a never-before-seen march of the doagies .
garland :
we do n't know where we e goin '
till we 're past the last fence rail
ou there breaks the day
oh , we do n't know where we 're goin '
but we 're on our way
me for a campfire out on the trail
me for an old cayuse
and i 'm all set to vamoose
and nobody asking me why give e a cowhand song
are marching ' on
out there lies the prairie
this is judy at the top of her career 
playing on his slide trombone
in a certain monotone
he wa known as mr. monotony
any pleasant interlude
but the same dull melody
would emerge from mr. monotony
folks for miles would run away
she would come around and say
ca n't play
today
it only happens when i dance with you
ooney :
another legend at metro was my good friend fre astaire who always romanced a glaorous partner in his motion ictures .
in easer parade , it was the one and only ann miller .
astaie :
why does it happen , dear
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks
are yours and mine
i 've danced with dozens of others
that only happens with you
but fred astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on and he put me at ease ight away .
come on , annie , let 's do i one more time .
good evening .
miss marlowe .
astaire :
i 've seen it often enough .
i 'll try .
that 's fine .
harry , give us the pickup on that gang number , will you , please ?
it was a litte more than a guest appearance for fred for he was soon to be under contract to rko pictures where they were about o eam him with ginger rogers causing a strig of hit musical to follow .
fed did n't return to mgm until even years later at which ime he starred with eleanor powell in broadway melody of 1940 .
miller :
in 1945 , fred and a new partner , lucille bremer stepped out to coffee time in yolada and the thief 
its director , incente minnelli .
tat 's for me
i 'm drum crazy , yes i 'm drum cray , yes
i 'm plum crazy for drums
miller :
fred could make music out of almost anything .
and he often found new challenges that stretched hi talents .
astaire :
fist , soft violins
when the drum takes the melody
when the drum carries the tune
miller :
hard-boiled private eyes were all the rage in the '50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse .
she came at me in sections .
more curves than a scenic railway .
she was dangerous .
i would n't trust her any farther than i could throw her .
she was selling hard , but i was n't buying .
miller :
in the barkleys of broadway  they dance the swing trot under the main titles of the picture , but with the titles removed anoher musical gem is revealed from the most beloved dance team of all time .
it 's bill and coo-y , tea for two-y
just watch your partner 's eyes row dewy
entrenous-y you 're slighty screwy
oh , what a natural they 've hit upon it gets you going till you 're really gone
and you will never rue the day
the day you realize the swing trot is here to stay
gon na leave my footsteps on the sands of time
if i never leave a dime
a dancing ' man
of rhythm
miller :
yes , i am
yes , i am , yes , i am
i can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge
i can get a sparrow with a bo and arrow
i can live on bread and cheese
ad only on that ?
yes
so can a rat
any note you can reach , i can go higher
i can sing anything higher than you
no , you ca n't
anythin you an wear , i can wear better
in what you wear i 'd look better than you
in my coat ?
yes , i can , yes , i can
i can say anying faster than you
yes , i can
i can jump a hurdle
i ca knit a sweater
i can fill it better
can you bake a pie ?
no
neither can i
i can sing anything sweeter than you
yes , i can
no , you ca n't
yes , i can
yes , i can
no , you ca n't , ca n't , ca n't
their worth in dollars , film history , enertainment is immeasurable .

keel :
in sil stockings , janis paige and fred astaire spoof the necessary elements to make a moden motio picture .
this lover boy 's technique
you got ta have glorious technicolor
breathtaking cinemascope and stereophonic sound
and stereophonic sound
there was a time when dancing was so intimate and sleek
a fella hugged his partner as they 'd cuddle cheek to cheek
because they 're in glorious tecnicolor breathtaking cinemascope and
it 's not enough today to see a dancer at his ease
he 's got ta have glorious russian ballet or modern ballet or english ballet or
and stereophonic sound
stereophonic sound

unhappy new away

in 1955 , the studio clevery ombied the new technologies with the old-fashioned backstage musical and starred doris day in the oscar-winning hit love me or leave me .

chief , we got a situation here that is absolutely incredible .
see ?
i think they 're arguing about something .
and a crockett county unit has got 'em under observation .
that 's eight shares for that .
four shares for that .
that 's 12 shares already .
then five of us went down to the wreck .
we give five shares for that .
now we add the same number of shares as there were people in eah vehicle .
that 's three for your group , two for yours , two for us and one for you .
$ 14,000 pe sare .
and that covers everything including the emancipation of women !
wait a minute .
but no matter how you figure it out , i till do n't get as much as anybody else .
right ?
we , us , we get 84,000 .
what do you mean , tax-free ?

i know he 's not gon na declare anyhing .
look , can you explain it to him , please ?
but hat he was trying to say is ...
even businessmen that rob and steal and cheat from people every day .
i give up .
anybody got a fairer pan , go ahead .
there were eight of us there , so that simply mean eight shares .
we 're gon na get noplace listening to tis old bag .
lady , are you tryin ' to split us up so it becomes every man for himsef ?
and every woman or himself ?
please do n't argue .

he 's gon na drive there and get the money , and we 're gon a have it !
that 's how !
i was gon na offer you a share , just for takin ' us to a phone .
do n't you see ?
he 'll get there first .
the rest of us wo n't get a dime .
you can believe that .
but look here .
even if she does get all the money surely it wo n't affect our agreement .
she would n't break her word .
i 'd still be entitled to ten per cent as ageed , surely .
surely ( !
and then tat dirty , rotten , slimy bum double-crossed me .
well , did you get him ?
maybe he went out for the papers .
we can keep on tryin ' .
just supposin ' we never do get him .
we just might be the last ones there .

omebody must 've taen them the other way .
besides , we ca n't be sure they 'll be there .
i do n't know what to do .
look , surely the most ensible thing is for the two o us to press on !
and even if he were the first there  he still has to find the money , has n't he ?
now , i earnestly recommend that we press on with all possible dispatch .
we 'll press on with all possible dispach .
and i do n't really think that personal rancour is going to help the situaion if i may say so .
come on , hurry up .

american men have been totaly emasculated .
in all my time in this wretched ountry , what has appalled me most is this preposterous preoccupation with bosoms !
they 've become the ominant theme in american culture .

i thank you all from te bottom of my heart .
ah .
i was on the committee that made the collection .
£5 was subscribed .
that left three shillings .
i expended it on this .
a litte extra token i thought you might fancy .
i saw it during easter week in a little window in glasow , a curiosity shop .
buy me for professor lindenbrook .
what did you reply ?
could serve as a paperweight .
it 's a scholar 's choice .
what are you eating tonight ?
this being tuesday , i 'm not eating .
i find it very healthy to eat only every oter night 
be at my house at eight o'clock .
i 'm entertaining some of the faculty .

is it those fraye cuffs that worry you ?
eight o'clock sharp .
yes , sir oliver 
eight o'clock .
lava .
i swear there 's something inside .
there 's uncle now , kirsty .
i thought it was uncle oliver .
i want it understood that not a single stitch i 'm wearing belongs to me .
i 'm early , but i trust i 'm not too early .
where is he ?
he 's never been late like this never .
i do n't know , ut , to return to the subject of m clothes , they 're my classmate 's , the young laird o glendarach .
when i returned , my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted .
you 've explained your magnificence .
there will be one more guest .
what do you expect when it takes a ommand from m uncle to bring you to this house ?
two years more i have to study for my master 's degree .
then four years more as a laboratoy assistant .
they 're paying for my schooling .
how like a scotsman .
i know one whose purse was not empty , becaue he did n't even have a purse .

i gave no permission fo visitors .
good lad .
if you do n't come now , the goose will be ...
aye , and without a pause for lunch or tea .
now then , from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged ?
mount ena ?
very lose 
the lipari island group off the coast o itay .
that 's exactly what stumped me .
but that would be icelandic peridotite .
precisely .
there 's a piece chipped off .
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
when i aw this , i stopped chipping .
looks like a letter or some notches .
three otches made by the hand of man .
what 's your conclusion ?
sciece doe not jump to conclusions .
we re going to melt off the crust of laa .
mr paisley .
not too fast , you know .
i shall write to professor goetaborg o stockholm about this .
he 's the leading authority on volcanoes .
four ours ?
eny !
are you all right ?
that was entirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't know how it could have happened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendered a iestimable service to science .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not only looks like it is a plumb bob .
can you make out what it says , professor ?
it 's in some nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possibly .
look at this sie , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ..
arne saknusse .
or do i have to go aloe ?
it 's unthinable , but it must be true .
a man took some tools and went here no human being has ever set foot .
into the inerior of the earth , alone 
the laughter soped when he disappeared , never to be heard from .
until tonigh .
get out of here , woman !
i did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shouting at me , sir oliver .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you have n't slet !
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncle oliver .
no answer !
were is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to get here from stockholm ?
answer the bell .
id it rig ?
callers , callers .
i 'm involved in something important .
more important than our university ?
what does the name arne saknussem mean to you , gentleen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study of volcanoes .
out of a volcano came this message from him .
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , was probably picked up by some peasant , gatheed dust in a curiosity shop till it came to me .
whoever descends into the crater of sneffels yocul can reach he cente of the earth .
arne saknussem .
the center of the earth ?
an extinct volcano in iceland .
but , oliver , this is sheer fantasy .
you have n't heard all of it .
at sunrise on he last day of may the mountain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scartaris ?
i 's a mountain peak near the volcano .
bu this is a student 's hoax .
let 's not take that tone .
more than aything , you must consult other experts .
and i 've written to the foremost authority in europe .
more eminent stil .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunately i 've not yet received his reply .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent ees fit to answer you .
and in the meantime we could do with a cup of tea .
think whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
just this moment , sir oliver .
look .
well , he 's got his letter from stockholm .
did you see the shine in his eyes ?
there 'll never be a better moment to tell him about our feelings for each other .
he 'll say yes almot inadvertently .
wat if he says no avertently ?
you wait and see how firm my voice can be when i speak of you .
blast and damn !
bad news , sir ?
his disappearance follows closely the date my communication must have reached him .
or too important .
mcewen , go directly to the harbor .
oliver , calm down .
you heard sakussem 's message .
oliver , you 're seriously ill .
i am seriousy well .
what are you waiting for ?
i told you to hurry .
if you 'l excuse me , i must start packin .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take time for this , sir .
what are you so urgent about ?
this is the most ugent moment of my life .
i have to be in iceland .
where ?
to te center of the earth , naturally .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i go
i wish i could sing loud enough for jenny to hear me .
it is a bit painfu to leave her on the first day of our engagement .
to come back to her as a world-famous scientist is not to be sneezed at .
come here .
i neglected to tell you , sir .
well  you 'll get over that after the first million fathoms or so .
he s been surveying here .
your revered colleague from stockholm .
he is n't wasting any time .
do you think he ' already gone down ?
no .
buy all the rope available .
you think we can prepare it all so quickly 
what 's tha you 're taking ?
jenny 's farewell gift .
back to my hotel .
já , professor goetaborg .
no , o , thank you .
nobody carries a soldier 's weapons .
and take your time .
these instruments are delicate .

i said slow down , man !
you 're out of your senses !
stop your horses  man !
slow down !
stop , you fool !
whoa !
if you 've ruined my instruments , i 'll horsewhip you , so help me .

fate took care of him .
why did n't tey tell us at the desk ?
we 'll observe one minute of silence in emory of a great scientist , even if he was a blasted thie .
alec , you mentioned fate .
slight correction .
fate plus a few grains of potassium cyanide .
he was against someone who was eve more against him 
who 
i 'm the wife of professor goetaborg .
oh , my ear .
wo n't you sit down for a minute beore you go up ?
please , my dear .
early in the morning he went to the mountain .
when he came back fo lunch he received his guest right in the lobby .
they went up to his room and ate .
hat are you trying to tell me ?
in the evening when the mai went to make the bed ...
oh , dear god !
as long as i can remember , no one ever died in my inn !
he was joking on the pier in stockholm .
madam , my deep sympathy .
my name
oliver lindenbrook of edinburgh uniersity .
professor lindenbrook .
i ee you are .
this will be difficult for you  madam , but it must be faced .
who was the las person to see him alive ?
i did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each oter every day .
i suggest that you have a autopsy performed immediately .
neither he or i coul suspect there was a third party who would stop at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deeply distressed by your husband 's death , and i fully understand your feelings .
however , i must ask you one quetion .
how o you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off your hands .
your expedition ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from me .
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encounter .
a saknussem descedant turns up acts as i he were king of volcanoes .
tries to force me o surrender his ancestor 's secret .
saknussem called again .
new complication .
must fight him somehow 
young man , would you come here a moment , please ?
who are those for ?
that 's a beginning .
what about lamps ?
lamps .
put me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in iceland ?
but i wish to apologize to you in pain english .
i went through my husband 's diary , and some of is remarks led me to believe i did you an injustie .
i 'm sorry .
i id 't know .
do n't give it another thought .
i sha n't .
began and that 's all it has done .
sir oliver , this morning you asked me for these .
if you still want them , they 're yours 
will you say that again ?
madam .
my husband had these boots made specially .
i hope they fit you .
i told your man to order some for me immediately .
good , good .
why would you need boots like this ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm coming along .
that 's why i 'm giving you all of this .
it 's a condition .
i thought you understood .
you did n't mention any condition .
then i do now .
whom did you intend to take along , besides this young man ?
then i 'll be very useful .
he does n't understand a word of english .
we 're not contemplating a stroll down iccadilly or the champs élysées .
professor lindenbrook , i have just lost my husband .
the police require your presene for the investigation into the death .
but , madam , quite apa from the appalling danger , think of the inconvenience .
the lack of privacy .
in short , you do n't want all of this .
i may be mad on the subject of this journey , but i am not stupid 
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbance to men , never a burden .
you 'll sleep where we seep , eat what we eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept y proposition .
professor , look !
now we descend into oblivion or ... we enter the great book of history .
carla oetaborg .
alexander mcewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans an who ?
professor !
professor !
hans is tying the roe on her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you have told him that ?
and then there 's alwas the blessed chance the rope may break .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how soliitous .
if only you could see your face .
you do .
perhaps this is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no other way to continue .
eureka !
thank you .
now then , a general summary .
a :
b :
as my husband 's charts indicated .
onward 
and let 's hae some music .
the last news was that they went up mount sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys .
yes ?
and then the animals came down without their packs .
oliver s lindenbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what ' it ?
a woman !
a slight tremor , coming from undefined regions .
let us proceed .
madam , i these regions i 'd never venture to say that aything is moving away or coming towards us .
the three notches of arne saknussem .
what does that mean ?
look .
we might have taken ay one of these cannels .
but our great colleague maketh a path for our feet .
let us have tea .
with a double ration of raisins .
may i omb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , madam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmares , we 'd have made different sleeping arrangeents .
someone is walking up there .
human footsteps .
te hearig of all women is extremely acute .
my wife used to hear rats in the attic , usually the nights before i had an important lecture .
alec , go up and find out .
they need rest .
moreover , it was stipulaed that i give he orders .
here 's no need to use that patient voice with me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i am a member of this expedition , and as such i itend to report any observation i make .
alec .
put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right here .
conceal these marks completely .
i ll give them some new ones .
starting from an estimated depth of 129km , limestone formation continues .
hee are the three notches again .
good .
let s see .
one heads 220º south-southwest , the other 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quite .
what 's he aying ?
hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expedition .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well , why does man freeze to death trying to reah the noth pole ?
once a question has arisen in the human brain , the answer must be found if it takes 100 years .
1,000 years .
let 's hear you render that into a few well-chosen icelandic words .
why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries ?
are you all right 
can you unook yourself ?
grab his hand .
never mind about that 
how is it possible ?
this way was clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure .
this has been here since the beginning of ime .
i was not in a positio to observe it scienifically .
but were ?
we 're upposed to stay together .
tricked into the wrog tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam ... heard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she 's saying it .
we must return .
why ?
you know that .
but if there is a madman loose ...
he s against all of us .
against the very concept of his journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to where alec fell .
but it 's not on our route .
if we 're to go ahead , we have no time for detours .
then you ait here .
madam , now that the boy has gone and hans does n't uderstand english ,
i 'm blushing already .
professor !
yes , i thought so 
alec !
i 've got to take a specimen of thi back to edinburgh , if it 's the last thing i do .
unique 
where the devil is he ?
it 's a blind alley !
keep back !
has 
good god !
that 's it .
praise the lord !
aec .
professor !
hello !
professor !
professor !
here i am !
salt .
professor .
professor , you ca n't go on this way .
i 've kept track of te passae of days 
you have n't .
we 'll try the cross-channel over there .
you wo n't find him there .
i 'e got to find him .
i 'm responsible .
i can see that this is a recent break .
if you 're dow there  give us a sign !
alec , listen carefully .
when he echoes top , you must try to answer .
pick up a pebble and scratch the rock .
just give us a sign .
how can i live with myself ?
you must continue with what you started .
it was his project as much as it was yours .
we will proceed .
down there , food and water .
so you 've lost your friends ?
just as well .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of place here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal the professor 's project ?
you need me as much as i need you .
you found me .
my friends could find me too .
very well .
you 'll carry i with one arm , not two !
it 's a multiple echo , reverberating through the rock chambers .
the last echo will give us the direction .
alec .
alec .
alec !
professor .
where was he ?
i did n't think he 'd shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers here .
you are also the murderer of my husband .
he would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of your great ancesto , put down that preposterous gun .
you 're not going to listen to a murderer ?
never interrupt a murderer , madam .
i resent that bourgeois classification .
you have my word of honor .
give me your hand on that .
a bourgeois trick .
so orry .
we have to hold court .
guilty .
guilty .
then the mandatory sentence is deah .
we will follow the route marked by the nothes .
no , no , no , no , no .
i can carry something with my left hand .
you can carry yourself for a couple of days .
that 's all we can expect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been loyal to the saknussems for generations and , well , he can not touh the gun .
this is contempt of court .
no , no , professor ...
i mean , sir oliver .
you must n' look at me .
oh , no 
you ... you could n't consider for a moment that i could do it .
afer al , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weeks you 've been denying your sex , and ow you fall back on it .
i would say the natual executioner would e the leader of the expedition .
we 're much too civilized to ...
what do you propose ?
drag him with us ?
stop fiddling with those lamps .
the lamps are giving out .
to save what we can , i insist that we leave these regions at once .
you insist ?
what 's the harm ?
the harm is , madam , that he 's wastig a lamp .
madam , make a final note , while you 've still light enough to write by .
let me , madam .
this may be our ast entry .
ans and i ca cut some rope into some torches .
what puzzles me is that the three notches of old arne saknussem still keep pointing our way .
peraps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on neither do you , sir oliver .
yes , just switch it of .
why , it 's miraculous !
look at this .
what is it , sir ?
light without heat .
a cool , chemical light .
the same principle is involved here .
256th day .
the phenomenal winds vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've aid lindenbrook expedition , you 've written mcewen expedition ?
may i remind you that months ago you gave me explicit orders to that effect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to be corrected by you incessantly .
you 're doing it with your looks , the inflection of your voice , the very posture of your body .
our entire presence is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had enough .
ell , let me tell you , you dried-up walnut of a man , if anyone 's ha enough , it 's me .
it 's i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla goetaborg !
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ...
well , at least you know i have a temper .
and from now on alec will keep the charts .
alec !
why ca n't he stay around ?
a forest of musrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grew without sun this far under the earth !
it 's toughe than leather .
it 's like an oak tee .
mushroom stea , muhoom soup , mushroom hash .
after some months of this , you 'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt bee .
if we onl knew how many more .
there ' no term to the work of a scientist .
but that 's not professor lindenbrook 's feeling .
and what is the name of the girl you love ?
the girl you love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
bu why would you want to know that ust now ?
dear alec !
professor ?
here 's some hot mushoom porridge for you , ir oliver .
i slept as i never slept in edinburgh .
i may move here permanently .
i do n't know .
is that madman still giving orders ?
the minute you fell asleep he went off in that direction , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want with all those ?
you 've come to ask me why i did n't take my rest period .
i do n't sleep .
i hate those little slices of death .
it 's a sea .
it 's an ocean with waves and currents .
the fissures closed again .
it ' the prerogative of the discoverer .
i congratulate you .
a dimetrodon !
if i had my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinne .
can he swim ?
no , thank god .
here .
i wonder if it 's cold where they are .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of y hand 
my watch !
save the instuments .
my ring !
my wedding ring .
a field of force that natches god away .
this is it !
this is it !
the junction of magnetic forces from the north pole and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness over there .
after all , we did hit the center of the earth .
he want to now where we go from here .
tired mind do n't plan well .
sleep first , plan later .
oliver , the day may come when you 'd very uch like to have that porridge .
is it incredible to you that i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , duck .
gertrude ?
gertrude 
gertrude !
gertrude !
hans !
why do you ook at me like that ?
hans !
i eeded food , so i took it .
stop his fool !
hans !
you ingrates !
what can you do without me ?
this is he sunken city .
after 5,000 years , behold a fragment of te lost atlantis .
all we kno about it comes from the greek .
the floor of the sea opened up and swallowed the whole island of atlantis .
this ust have been the market square .
eating .
well , we 've learned one thing about the inhabitants of atlantis .
stale bread .
we must speak to the baker .
madam !
madam !
já ?
exacly .
to thik that at a moment like this i 've no pad and pencil to record it all .
turn around , madam .
what is it ?
look at tat tibia .
you wo n't find anything edible in there .
the chinese eat eggs over 400 years old .
gunpowder .
it 's pointing somewhere .
of course !
this is the way up .
a direct hatchway to he surface .
and we can climb up .
e him venture 100 meters or so on reconoiter .
the updraft ca n't carry him away .
now i 'd sa let 's roll up our sleeves if we had any .
we must n't hope for much .
this light wo n't stay with us .
i 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kai-ai !
kai-ai !
flints !
i 've foud some flints .
we wo n't be walking in darkness .
i wish i had better news .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward , straighter than the one we descended .
there 's an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway .
hans said only a landslide could ever move it .
if his hopes had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , sir ?
the haversack arne sakussem 's haversack .
et it .
i guarantee tha this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly , i can not guarantee .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear go , ruler of heaven and earth ...
do n' set any limit to his realm , laddie .
god of the universe , we are in thy merciful hads .
look out !
a monster !
let me go !
it 's a earthquake of unusual magnitude !
more likely it 's a volcanic eruption .
stromboli , italy .
the capsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous explosion .
rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sea .
dammi una mano .
piano .
piano .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrown from the altar stone ... long before we hit the water .
non si preoccupi .
i 'm most grateful , ladies , but my immediate need is not a ladder .
pantaloons .
pantaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
fellow scots , if these shouts of yours express some pleasure that we 've eturned alive , i thank you deeply .
however , if they 're meant as praise fo a successful scientist ,
i must disclaim that honor .
a scientist who can not prove wat he has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
i have no records , no shred of evience .
i will never embarrass this distinguished university by asking that it take my word .
tis , i know :
the spirit of man can not be stopped .
splendid , oliver .
rofessor , here 's someone who wants to say goodbye .
hans , old friend .
did you get your injuries when the volcano blew up , in the hot lava ?
he was in such a hurry leaving the church , he fell all the way down the steps .
after all that waiting .
it 's been no marriage for you at all .
you underestimate alec .
i 'm taking the night train to london and then back to stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a job to do here in edinburgh .
i intend to write my memoirs .
what you need is a widow who can jog your emory and take dictation .
no , none of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend one 's days and nights with a man under te earth , another uder one roof in scotland .
what id i say ?
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
frau goetaborg !
yes ...
carla ...
i warn you ...

it 's this suitor business .
jasmine refuses to choose a husband .
oh !

your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals .

nothing 's any different .
only as a particle up until ow .
we can just as easily think of it a a wave .
you said so in your book .
microwave conflict .
how could i miss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
et up a phased harmonic ,
affected he nuclear matrix ,
in other words , groovy little house beat
just unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
we did it , charlie !
this is big !
we found the raviton .
oh , man !
can we do it later hough ?
i 'm kind of late for science class .
maybe you just had a good tutor .
but you are going to meet one .
i got to thinking it miht be good for you to meet a kid your age
wo 's not ashamed of being smart .
he can probably use some one-on-one
with a kid who 's not ashamed to kick his butt .
class :
yes  well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arraned a field trip oday to orthern .
doc !
doc 
i got to show you something really cool .
oh .
oh , what ?
what am i going to do ?
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
6 shades of purple ?
thank you very much .
thank you an welcome .
the youngest particle physicist
a terrible lab acident has left young mr. boyle
temporarily disfigured .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agreed to come out and talk to you anyay ,
mr. charlie boyle .
charlie ?
charlie , in gravely voice :
thank you , fellow teens .
will eventually subside .
since i am in obvious discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let professor krickstein
wel , uh ...
psst !
jut talk amongst yourselves .
what ?
how do i get the purple stuff off my face ?
it 's starting to burn .
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is -- is pretty much like te universe --
i got ta go pay the water bill .
excuse me .
krickstein :
chaz ?
this is a very valuable clue as thymine is changed to uracil .
uh , here at the university , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i wanted to meet charlie boyle .
from the head of the anthropology --
and scedule another field trip .
i 'm sure i can convince charlie to come back .
what ae you doing to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
what are you doing ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
ok .
i can do it mysef .
he 's fine , he 's fine .
really .
you kids do your homework .
bye .
i decided to move my stuff back in .
i need some help .
you ...
with what ?
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
you have everything .
i could say the same about you .
women , poise ...
women .
loing my scholarsip ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bad trade-off .
yeah , right .
look , i want more than that out of life , charlie .

hey !
wh do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the people up there think i 'm a genius ,
and then the other half think i 'm a punk .
hey , i 'm going to use the particle accelerator while you 're gone .
might as ell get some work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck down here .
mi particle accelerator es su particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcoe to northern ligts hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerator .
and i anted to say thanks for passig me .
hey , you have nobody to thank but yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
i 's from me and the guys .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goi ' down .
what if they come after you with that rumson rack
i do n't know of any way to defend against it .
i might .
go home !
to the conference championship game ,
boy :
come on , dude .
al right , now the 3 to worry about are stoker ,
now cross will usually distract the reeree here ,
while stoker and ryder rack our best player ,
which is me .
we send somebody ele out there with my number ,
that 's your plan ?
but -- but --
and you 'd ome out with a phony number .
i like it .
hey , i 'm a genius .
hugo , suit up !
ladies and gentlemen ,
yeah , eough pleasantries .
listen ,
if we beat our arch rival tonight ,
we 'd get to take hoe some sort of great big cup , would we not ?
yeah , i want that cup ...

charlie ?
his name 's not charlie .
that 's chaz .
he wore your golden goalie ma --
claire , let me explain .
explain ?
just what was all of this ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a study of the ocal culture ?
then i guess you were just having a laugh at my expense .
imagine , me thinking i could teach you .
'cause i ' a big fa liar .
i also left the particle accelerato on !
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
announcer :
do not venure onto the ice !
get off te ice !
this game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and we were this close .

well , if it is 't the con artist
formerly known as chaz .
claire :
come on , guys .
what are you reaing ?
breakaway .
i love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron finds , uh , subatomic articles
and how they 're connected to a mysterious quantum force .
oh , yeah .
but you know something ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to split a photon ,
ad even though the particles are 6 miles apar ,
whatever one does , the othe one does
cool !
and maybe unlock the secret as to how it works .
and then ...
defy gravity .
let 's get to wok .
and the output level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the ruber coating ?
they all act like superball .
and when i press this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i can make amends
well , with what we just discovered ,
i figured out a way to elp northern beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can keep hi job ,
and my friends 'll be happy with me again ,
and mabe ...
caire might like me again , too .
a little .
you have n't let me down .
you saved me !
charie , i could never have done this without you !
you 're my friend .
thanks , doc .

i need help .
i figured out a way to help the team toniht ,
keep rumsen from cheating ,
no .
wh do n't you just leave us alone ...
i ca n't do it alone .
yeah !
welcome to northern arena !
this is base ops .
video ?
roger that .
blades ?
that i am here under extreme protest ,
and i 'm only doing this so my father does n't wind up
stage managing the ice capades .
skates , rumsen bus should be in target range ...
now .
roger that , ops .
video 's in place , ops .
roger , video .
hey , deion .
how 's it going ?
where 's blades ?
right ere .
let 's just hope this works .
mike , you kow the 're comin ' after you .
first sign of trouble , i 'm pullin ' you out !
you just try and do that !
for the re-scheduled central conerence championship
how 's this supposed to work again ?
how is that possible ?
ike the super bals i showed you .
corresponding microchips with other graviton halves
whatever our skates do , their skates will be forced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c in science .
you sure did a nuber on this lab .
nah .
besides , i 've arranged his schedule so that he 'll be gone all day .
and he 's never here duri hockey games .
almost never .
this has gone way too far !
i told you i had to do what i had to do .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop right now .
you know i 'm on your side .
ahead of what ?
you can solve all the mysteries in the world ,
bu what would it mean without friends ?
the chance to make up for all the selfish things i did ...
so please ...
chaz !
odie , tight up .
omar , you 're in !
mike , get of !
we got ta stop the rumen rack .
deion , flip the switch .
take ...
that !
yeah !
power play !
number 2 !
i 'm stoker .
you 're ryder .
let 's go !
whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leaving the box .
he 's out of control !
do something !
he 's heading straight for mie !
i ca n't find it !
i have the other chip !
aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !
hey .
whoa , we 're too light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we did i !
we mus have reversed the charge of the gravitons !
the 're repelling against the positive charge of the earth !
game anouncer :
the final score -- northern 1 , rumsen nothing !
a long , long time .
yeah .
that 's what i call publicity .
ha ha ha !
i 'm proud of you .
i 'll take smithson .
then i 'll take van bonn .
man , you 're sticking me with him ?
look , i 'm gettin ' good ,
look .
it 's good , huh ?
and today he 's learning on your team .
hey , liste , if you want u to get off the ice ...

if you 'e interested .
us ?
we heard about what you did .
how 'd you find out ?
ok .
what ?
hey ...
i can float .
uh .
come on , guys , let 's go !
ca n't we mark it rest in peace ?
not as long as scientists try to prove porpoises have brains rivalig man 's .
even superhuman .
and they think that he might be teaching them ?
that 's right , lieuteant 
but admiral ...
is hat a good likeness ?
perfect .
yes .
at least hat s the way he looked before ...

how he was when ...
and this taken by one of our divers .
is there any doubt in your mind ?
no , tat 's him .
sipper !
we have no coice , lieutenant .
orders from the very top .
they 're ecalling him to active duty .
henry always lived in a world of his own .
thank you , miss barnes .
well , did you have your physical this morning ?
i ' afraid ot .
really ?
no , my eyesight .
they do n't want my blood .
well , i hope so .
and very healthy .
they may take her .
henry ?
yes , he is .
that 's nice .
they rejected me .
rejected ?
do n't hang around that pet shop .
do n't be upset , miss barnes .
there 's a fish in the water cooler .
hi , hen old boy !
george , good to see you .
do n't you look imortant ?
that uniform and all those doodads on your sleeve .
just a couple of hash marks .
do n't apologie .
you look first-class to me , george .
what kind of a machine are you mated to ?
hey , bess !
time o take over .
lover-boy 's here .
hello , dear .
hello , henry .
i forgive you , casanova .
george has liberty the whole weekend , and he want to spend it with us .
the whole weekend ?
no , i missed the subway train , but i ...
washed out completely , i hear .
you ca n't win them all , george .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks for action , go dancing ?
feel like shaking a leg , heny ?
no thanks , george .
how many times must i tel you , you do not rumba with your eyes !
now , do n' worry .
why do n't we go to the university for professor hoffmeyer 's lectue ?
you know , he 's gon na talk about the mating habits of the shellfish .
it 's a little risqué .
sort of for adults only , you know .
i 've got it !
why do n't we run out to coney island tomorrow morning ?
well , i do n' know ...
i hate to miss that lecture , but i do like the water .
water and fish .
look at him 
always drawing into his shell , going off into his fish world !
george , come here .
the what ?
devonian period of the paleooic era .
you know , it followed the silurian and preceded the arboniferous eras .
i 've given it a lot of thought .
a lot of thought .
maybe go in for parakeets .
he 's read many books on the subject .
he claims years ago there was nothig but fish in the world .
then some of those creatures became amphibians they crawled ou on land .
hope for what , henry ?
wih the war in europe and new weapons being invented what if men were foolish eough to estroy themselves ?
then the fish would deelop into a new race of men and this time they might turn out better .
fish have a better life than people .
the water !
what a mess !
you are floating yourself out of your home with this hobby !
i 'm gon na run down to the store and get a regulator for the intake hose .
you mean get rid of them ?
ut bessie !
either those fish go or i do !
which is it to be ?
who looked hurt ?
my fish .
or once .
i left out the most exciting details .
see , i do n't like to brag but , i tell you , that one morning ...
it was at night , was n't i ?
right .
good memory .
we went out ith me in the engine room ...
i thought you were on the bidge with the admiral ?
the uss elias j. starbrigt , is n't it ?
i can tel you this , though .
here are so many nazi subs below the surface you could walk to europe .
the ocean s jumping with u-boat ready to go if uncle sam gets in the fight .
i do n't want to start a panic , so you keep all this under your hat , right ?
right , bessie ?
old boy , did i ever tell you about the caribbean ?
what a liberty we had in a port near trinidad 
and miami .
did you ever do the rumba , henry ?
no , i have faulty equilibrium .
yes , sir .
join te navy and have a hirl !
barbados , kingston , the virgin islands !
lunch is almost ready .
come along , heny !
moe than anything , i wish i could be one of you right now .
i wish i were a fish .
henry !
save him !
what will we do ?
get some help 
call the lifeguards !
get the police !
police !
help !
come on .
it 's all over .
he does n't even know how to swim .
he does n't kow ow to swim !
what 's gon na happen o poor bessie ?
guess he must have lost his lases during the fall .
fish ?
oh , no .
there bessie , we 'd better get going home now .
all right , oks , back up , please .
let us through .
and i thought it all would be so beautiful .
wish i were home with bessie .
i 've never stayed out all night before .
maybe i should have listened to bessie .
i got this back from the pet shop .
well , he was so cray about it .
that 's sweet .
here 's the notice :
the body was not eovered .
limpet is survived by his widow , bessie limpet .
poor henry .
hi !
i 'm henry limpet .
i 'm ...
jumping st. elmo 's fire !
say , you 're talking o me .
you bet your binnacle i 'm talking to you !
now , hoist your tail and get !
why , you 're a splendid specimen of a pagurus pollicaris .
i 'm glad to meet you , crusty .
hey !
i do n't wan na fight !
let that be a lesson to you , you confounded , four-eyed ...
say , what are you  anyway ?
you related to the porpoise family 
no , i 'm a limpet .
i 've seen flat fish , bu i 've never seen no four-eyed flat bush .
listen , flatbush , anything i hate , it 's a smat-aleck fish .
shark !
jumping jellyfish !
just swing about and let that shark chase you full speed away from here !
did that come out of me ?
hurricane !
stand by for a blow !
that belc of yours could capsie me in the backwash .
if you sound off like that again , i swear i 'll batten your gills and lower the boom on you .
and furthermore ..
crusty ?
crusty ?
you all riht , crusty ?
got ta hand it to you .
that blob of shrimp bait 'll think twice before he fools with us again .
well , guess i 'll be off .
off ?
where are you going ?
i 'd like to see if i can locate others of my kind .
i figure i 'd better go alon to keep you out of trouble 
ey , great !
all right , flatbush , let her rip .
look !
a freighter !
hey , let ' no get too close to the critter .
do n't worry , it 's not alive .
not alive ?
suffering swordfih !
what kind of sea monster killed a whopper like that ?
a torpedo did it .
oh , they wo n't attack us , they 're just afte hips .
hey , do n't go moseyin around in this thing 's innards .
no woner this thing died !
here 's the captain 's logbook .
listen o what it says ?
i did 't hear it say anything .
if only i could help .
ome on , let 's shove off .
gangway , get me out of here !
it 's only a irror .
it 's me .
well , swab my scuppers .
another fatbush .
i 'm not a bad-iooking fish at that .
really , a prety unique specimen .
but maybe i 'm a freak !
if only there was another fish ike me .
even just one .
someone who would understand me .
listen .

i better go up topsie and have a look .
how awful !
did you see that ?
are you all right ?
thank you .

after wa you did for me , i ...
you do n't know what you 're sayig .
oh , bu i do .
all i can say is :

the first time i saw you .
remeber ?
your pop brought me for dinner .
on my nose ?
tigma-tism .

do you see that barrauda coming at us ?
oh , limpet , limpet , we 'll be killed !
ladyfish ... ?
you see , you do n't understand .
married ?
is that like astigmatism ?
oh , tha !
i do n't see why it should .
do you spawn with every tom , dick and fish that comes along ?
you see , up until ow i 've been too young .
now shall we go ?
i 'd sure like ...
well , that is to say ...
do you suppose that we could just be well , more or less friends ?
friends ?
goodbye .
gosh , i ca n't .
ladyfish !
ladyfish !
oh , ladyfish !
i 've searched everywhere .
sunday , december 7 , 1941 .
sources say the president will ask congress ...
our coutry at war ?
look , flatbush , if you 're in trouble , you can count on me .
if you 'd stay here and look out for ladyfish , i 'd be grateful .
oh , please  it 's important , custy .
if you do n't need e .
to look after her while i 'm gone .
flatbush , take it easy , huh ?
i will , crusty .
thanks .
they 're mising the u-boat !
ahoy !
a friend .
ship ahoy !
do n't be alarmed .
please do n't !
are you on a raft ?
i 'm a fish !
ahoy there !
hat are you doing ?
why did n't you identify it ?
give the recognitio signal !
give the recognition signal !
i fell in the ocean and was drowned .
only i was n't drowned , exaty .
give the recognition signal !
commence firing !
commence firing !
activate sonar dome .
you missed the sub .
left standard rudder .
the old man should hear this .
pipe it to the bridge !
all engines ahead full , left standard rudder ?
400 yards straight ahead .
a irect hit .
could be a nazi trick .
cut that light !
if you re friendly , give the recognition signal !
you could n't find it , could you ?
and then you got it , did n't you ?
we can not see you !
i 'd rather not say at the moment , you would n't believe me .
what the blasted blaes is this ?
probably a nazi trick , just as you said , sir .
you want to meet with somebody called pickle ?
not pickle !
stickle !
machinist mate second class george stickle !
on the uss elias j. starbright !
i 'll send a full report of this meeting in but i ca n't guaranee pickle .
good .
i 'l be at this same spot three days from now .
wait till this hits the navy epartment .
harlock , you 've either been drinking or you 've got combat fatigue !
we have n't time for nonsense .
whatever it is .
it led us to a nazi sub and directed our charges accurately .
all right , harlock .
what 's your explanation for this phenomenon ?
i only know that it 's friendly and cooerative .
blast it , harlock !
we ca n't elist a voice !
why ?
i 'm not going on record as the adiral who was sent away because he believed in voices from the ocean .
there 's nobody else cray enough to take i .
oh , not me , admiral , i ...
stickle .
who is he ?
the voice asked us to bring stickle out to meet with him .
i think we can arrange a leave for you immediately .
think what this means .
it could spot submarines all over .
within a year we could break the nazi u-boat threat .
all right , harlock .
until we learn the nature of his device , it will remain top-secret .
certainly , admiral .
except between stickle and yourself .
commander , you 've got to believe me !
i 'm just a machinist mate second class ...
i know all about you  pickle .
i hunted through half the navy to find you .
you have been summoned here by a voice from the sea .
i have , sir ?
yes .
i do n't know anyone down there  sir .
it did not come from a submarine .
so help me , sir , i do n't know anything about this !
when the voice hails us , you 'll talk to it until we et a fix on it .
yes , sir .
aho out there !
did you hail us three days ago ?
he 's here .
say something , quick !
talk , sailor !
ahoy there !
this is henry limpet .
george !
come on , sailor !
hello , henry .
it 's good to hear you .
limpet is dead !
we 've got four other ships closing in on him .
this is a real surprise , henry .
i 'm not , george .
i 'm just ...
well , a little different .
sir ?
radar ca n't detect anything .
secure that light !
break out a rubber life raft .
rubber ... ?
oh , no !
you ca n' make me ...
you 're the key to tis mystery , sticle .
put him in the boat .
henry , it 's me .
george stickle .
i 'm right here , george !
where ?
do n't turn that flashight on .
look , if you 're really henry , what are you doing out here in the ocean ?
remember when you jumped in the wate after me at coney island ?
i sure do .
did n't you see a fish ?
hey , wait .
i did !
no , george , that was me .
you ?
if you were a fish , you cetainly would need to wear your glasses , henry .
if you 'll pardon me now , i got ta get going .
now do you believe me , george ?
got ta go down for air .
remember how you d come over on friday nighs ?
you and bessie would play poker while i read myself to sleep ?
that 's right .
regular as clockwork , every friday night .
how about the time the three of us went o the oo ?
i got separated from you two .
i had to walk home .
bessie had my cash .
hey , wait a minute !
only henr limpe ould kno al that !
you are henry !
yes , george .
is there ... ?
is there anything i can do for you , henry ?
well  i wanted to talk to you about my helping te navy .
you , in the avy ?
yeah , i want to help .
maybe scouting around as an underseas patrol , or dozens of things .
sure , henry .
i see where you 'd be quite a help to he navy .
i do n't want to wate time on red tape .

are you out of your mind , harlock ?
how can we pay a fish ?
she ' a real woman .
i should 've thrown you out when you came to me with this story .
all right , i suppose we can fin some way to push this through the paymaster ' office .
british screening units will deploy to their assigned ports ...
there 's more ?
he also wants a lieutenant 's commission .
absolutely , no !
it 's impossible to hold two meetings here at once .
i 'm sorry .
the news harlock brought is quite disturbing .
if it concerns the secre weapo , i 'd like to hear it .
our secret weapon wants to be paid .
then adiral spewter , i sugest you pa him , and commission him .

you better get a grip on yourself , bessie .
heny 's alive ?
yes , but you see that ...
i 'm going to him .
i 'm going this minute .

why was n't i old this before ?
how long has he been alive ?
i mean , when did he ... ?
he did n't rown ?
he 's changed .
i do want to .
his work for the navy is top-secret .
just be happy with his paycheck .
do n't even mention his name to anyone .
george , there ' something very fishy about this .
a mrs .
fish ?
not a mrs .
the wife of the fish .
spewter ...
i beg your pardon , sir .
you claim he turned into a fish .
we 'll try , sir .
you 'll do nothing of the sort .
we have a weapon of effectiveness .
guard it with your life .
now , never come to me again with a request like that .
at a time like this .
when we have a convoy on our hands ready for the biggest push of he war .
if bessie could see me now .
not bad for a 4-f fish .
imagie !
my glasses .
i 'm losing the covoy .
sunk ?
it 's tha female flatbush .
ladyfish , got a message for you from limpet .
he said he loves you and other suc mush like that .
he loves me ?
oh , crusty  do you think he 'll ever come back ?
do n't get yourself into a tiy now , ladyfish .
if i know flatbush , he 'll be back .
listen 
it 's hi .
ladyfish , i 'm in terrible trouble .
i ca n't see .
any sign of him yet ?
not yet , sir .
i 'm in an awful predicament .
i need some glasses , and ...
i noticed you were missing some eyes .
i 've got to get back to my convoy !
but how will i find it ?
i 'll climb topside and serve as your navigator .
the sound of the convoy will guide me , and with you navigating , why ...
i ca n't ask you to risk your life .
risk my life ?
hold everything .
does that mean you 'l be leaving me ?
do n't you care for me at all , impet ?
but i have an important jo to o before we can talk about that anymoe .

it 's a very dangerous mission .
i 'll always wait for you , limpet .

we 're nearing enemy water , stickle .
sir , it 's not my fault .
we 've come quite a way .
i stil ca n't pick up any sound of the convoy .

just hold up a inute till i get inside .
dead ahead .
whole school o big ones , coming dead at us .
hard right .
they 're coming at us !
follo me , you beeping devil .
we 'l take it ight back where it came from .
i do n' know , sir .
migt be henry .
something big is going on down there .
them torpedoes pack a walloping thrum too .
great !
they hit their own boats .
we 'll just let them knock themselves out .
no , we do n't dare .
it 's about time you showed up .
i got ta talk to george stickle .
where have you been ?
you put me in a terrible spot whe we lost contact 
i 'm sorry , george .
i lost my glasses .
i 'll see bessie when we get back and have her get you a new pair .
aye , aye , george .

i 've got to talk to my wife first .
you and i have to make a trip to coney island .
i can be your other eyes now .
take over .
taks for all your onderful help , crusty .
i like the bachelor life .
hate to admit it , ut i 'm gon na miss him .
had to lose my best buddy to a frilly female .
i 'll help you forget .
i 've forgotten an awful lot already .
so long , flatbush .
i 'll never leave you , and i hope you 'll never eave me .
it 's always the males who leave in our species .
that 's why there ' so few of us .
in that case , there might be more before long .
there , that 's my wife .
not much to look at  is she ?
let ' get this over with , limpet .
hello , bessie .
henry , is that you ?
do n't you recognie me , bessie ?
enry , you really are ...
a fish ?
yes , bessie , you can say it .
to think you 're actually still alive , and i 'm married to a ...
a fish .
is tha so terrible ?
it does n't happen every day .
well , what 's new ?
i mean , how have you been , bessie ?
i 'm bewildered , henry .
henry , am i the widow of a man or the wife of a fish ?
let 's be logical .
you could n't keep me in a tub , could you ?
i mean , what would the neighbors say ?
i shudder to think .
why ...
oh , good heavens 
if you only knew , bessie .
i guess this is goodbye , henry 
if you 'll come up to the steps , i have something for you .
remember how you catch cold whe you get your feet wet .
do n't break up , esie .
maybe i was meant to be a fish .
maybe nature just corrected her error 
goodbye , bessie .
goodbye  henr .
goodbye , henry , i said .
i thought that was it .
bessie and i have been happy .
he chief o naval operations orered it .
do they really think that henry is teaching porpoises ?
that 's what we e been assigned to find out .
sticke .
it 's worth a try .

the secretary of defense ordered him to take command of this mission .
and now , commodore regarding porpoise activities ...

isaburo sasahara of the escort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chamerlain you oth approve .
i 'd rather see ou two duel than merely test swords 
there are rumors in our clan .
the reason you do n't fight is because it would hurt the famil of the loser .
perhaps protecting your family name rather than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
isaburo , you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
i married into my wife 's family an have been henpecked for 20 years .
would you like to look at the november border record ?
no , ot if othing unusual happened .
making rice cakes i november
but there are no customers
the god who came down in february and brought the rice harvest departs tomorrow until his reurn next year .
do you really believe that ?
no , i was jus
perhaps you want a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is the problem .
it must be soeone she approves of .
someone strong , loving and faithful .
is that the stewar 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about useless things like martial arts again .
to have the steward honor us with a visit has never happened in the sasahara family .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been dismissed from te castle .
it has been decided to have her marry yogoro , your so .
steward , hy was lady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll return for an answer in a few days .
why should we accept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa to rest .
the daugter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in charge of the castle wardrobe , was serving beside him .
lady ichi lost her hea on seeing this .
she sprang at lady tama , slapped her face , and dragged er by the hair .
how can we accept her ?
i think we should gratefully accept her without being difficul .
no matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's an order from our lord .
i 'm afraid ...
i do n't feel very enthusiastic about it .
neither do i .
but if i refuse , there may be trouble later .
yogoro has said nothing , bu he woul n't be happy marying a lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i do n't want him to repeat y mistake .
they said you 'd be at the border .
i heard everything .
the steward and chamberlain are good judges .
alert even in times of peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage and other matters ,
i suggest you keep things quiet .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief .
so be modest about it or the others will thik you 're showing of .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on you secre principles of swordplay ?
but at he last moment , you skillfully switch from defense to offense .
yet you never attack .
you wait until your opponent tires .
unworthy ?
yes .
we can not accept our lord 's favored lady .
there 's no need to be so reserved .
it 's happened before , ot just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decline the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will not be alowed .
it is our lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you kno our lod 's wish .
it 's an order !
to decline is to defy the order !
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn 
may you enjoy long life together
we 'll all be at our side as long as you live
this is a day of celebration
keep that in mind .
no .
a woman ho was disissed after bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i id n't notice your return .
mother took her along for prayer at shonenji temple .
she kindly teache me domestic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father ?
but despite that  he has borne everyhing for 20 years .
yes , right away .
you must n't .
the world never seems to go right .
i wish to retire and have yogoro , my eldest son , ucceed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm ver sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but his son as married , so
so isaburo sasahaa 's retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the time , but it 's a great relief .
i wonder what i 've done all my life , tough it 's not like me to do so .
yogoro 's arriage is a very happy one .
fear often eceeds the perceived danger .
so it was in your case .
yogoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just the same as before , but ichi is always pleasant and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like ourself , i do 't understand it either .
check the weapons in te armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appointed days .
i do n't say to always yield to them , but at times , they 're unreasonable .
rice cakes ?
enjo .
wait , ichi .
i 'm going to retire soon .
yogoro will become the head of our family , and you 're his wife 
you need n't hold back for the old woman .
take over the household duties .
understand ?
even so , she is my mother , and i will treat her as such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understand .
that she 'd gasp her lord by his clothing .
it was hard for me to believe too , so i asked her the other day .
it was the year before last .
ichi .
accept te honor gratefully .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
our lor does not do this jus to satisfy a whim .
daimyo must have heirs or their houses will be abolished .
the only heir to our lor right now is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ichi , not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one day become our lord 's heir .
she mut be beautiful and kind like you .
you are referring to sannojo kasai , your fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
then if sannojo agees , you will gratefully agree to serve our lord ?
wat do you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gave you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't boter me !
no .
you said you would erve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly agreed to it .
a summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to your wishes .
then i thought
no , it was more like a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
many , many ons .
hen other girls need never know my misery .
it would end with me .
it was like a prayer .
my thoughts were really like a prayer .
wih this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later .
then i went to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord 's orders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i could never have found a better wife .
beginning tonight ,
what ?
our lord means nothing to me .
i have been so worried about the son i bore .
so worried .
i wil forget about him too .
i ill forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wait nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would have been better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brains over this and named her tomi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a luck thing .
but sasaara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birth mother to the heir .
if she remains the wife of a vassal , there would be much talk .
you say this is our lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for yogoro to submit a request to ou lord and say he will send ichi back to the castle 
i 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
ell , i do n't blame him .
but you know very well ... that we ca n't have all our wishes granted in this world .
group head kotani came ove in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is calling you .
acting as if some criis has occurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , i must tell you something .
come ino the room .
first , father 's words .
he says he 's retired , so i am the family head , and i am to do what i think is right .
however , he also ays you 'e too important to us to send away .
that we must take the best possible care of you .
i must tell her sooner or later .
do nt worry .
no matter what anyone says ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but ou ca n't reason wit a crying child nor with your lod , as they say .
isaburo , what 's your opinion ?
it 's all up to him .
what is it ?
i 'd like him to come again now and explain in his words why we must eturn her .
hen his son 's mother proves inconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasonable .
he has no understanding of human emotions 
kotani-san , our amiy did n't accept ichi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself know yogoro or the sasahara family .
she was none too happy about it either .
but the reason they are getting alog is because they 're kind to each other and care for each other .
what ?
even if the heaven rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give up tomi and return to the castle ?
would you ruin our family because you 've lost your head over a woman ?
in this case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you wee me , would you return ichi ?
of course i would !
retrain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's he head of the faily .
right or wrong , it 's all up to him .
if you love yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy such senseless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are a wife worth protecting , even if that means ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't be the end of it .
i gave her the message .
she will be here soon .
over here , sister .
we 've eard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you want to stay with yogoro , even if it means ruining the sasahara family ?
i would like to stay .
even if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
your fathe , hyoeon shiomi , has asked our lord that you be sent back to the castle as soon as possible .
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him to send you back .
he 's done this several times .
father is father 
i am me .
i ould rather die than return .
please tell the chamberlains and steward how i feel in whatever words you think will best help my case .
we ask you again , ichi !
the family does n't matter ?
ot only the sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeopardized as well .
it can not be helped .
i see .
there s no use trying to convince a woman like this .
yogoro s to blame too .
it 's you misfortune that a woman like her has favored you .
return .
return to the castle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the sasahara family to you ?
listen to me .
in other words  i 'm a worthless , good-for-noting man .
so in order to prove myself , for these pas 20 years
i have fought to preserve our good name and soial standing .
the cruel inustice involved , for one thing .
but your beautiful love for each other has touched me most of all .
there 's never been a shred of love in my married life !
no matter what happens , never leave him !
my husband 's ith the chamberlain ?
yes , and he 's waiting for you to coe .
i saw him in the castle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you both .
he has some quetios for you .
you need n't worry .
i will accompany you .
if you lose heart now  what will it mean for my brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything new at the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nohing happens .
she went out .
what hapened to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ichi ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter how many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going home .
ichi , take my advice and return to the castle .
if you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain is willing to overlook everything .
but if you insist on returning home , not only will yogoro , but also his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervision of their hoe .
honorable lady ichi , please return to the castle .
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamberain 's orders ?
wat orders ?
go home !
but ... if i go home without
say no more !
but
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool .
yogoro .
but he did request time off due to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordere the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , olid woman .
then everything 's all over ?
yes .
we just took a roundabout path .
defying the clan gets us nowhere .
isaburo , do you really mean that ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on this matter .
to be honest , the lan 's treatment of your family and your attitude in response have weighed on my mind .
weighed on your mind ?
it 's like your swordplay .
puhed , you step back .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
it was more like force 
in fact , it was more like kidnapping .
if the shogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may proe a fatal mistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow hem to end here .
you 're saying i must formally ask the castle to take her back ?
yet i must ask them to take her ack ?
it was wise of you to hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint .
i efuse !
i do n't remember seding her back to the castle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiculous , father !
never !
she suppressed her tears , left everything behind , and quietly returned to the castle .
ow , now , yogoro .
in any case , please go for now .
ogoro ill be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will report today and say he wishes to return her ?
that 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
since it would have come to this anyway , how dare they cause all that fuss !
yogoro was wrong , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he 's always henpecked by his wife .
and defying clan orders like that
i must say he seems like a different man .
his conduct has been admirable .
it calls for a slight increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the escort roup has arrived !
i 'm glad you 've reported for duty .
yes , completely well .
taking ito consideration my father 's wishes , i have decided .
please accept this .
that 's good of you .
thank you .
fool !
petition .
this is te cruelest for of tyranny .
it runs counter to te laws of humanity and can not be condoned by the heavens .
we hereby appeal for her immediate return .
someone may use my father 's nae or my own to subit a request to return ichi to the castle .
but it will not be from us .
please keep that in mind .
thak you fo coming every day .
the mat ?
it 's a custom at times like these .
so our feet wo n't slip in the blood .
this may be the last time .
will you do me a favor ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lor !
accept obediently !
i said orders from our lord !
will you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
orders !
isaburo and ogoro sasahara  for your insolent conduct and defiance toward our lord  ou are ordered to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of our lord to permit it .
i thought men would come arrest us and then either hang or cruify us .
father .
however , we wat somehing before we kill ouselves .
bring us three heads !
those of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler of te aizu domain ,
chamberlain yanase , and steward takahashi .
bring me the heads of the villains who took my son 's wife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear ou are
isaburo 's only equal as a swordsman .
if you think he 's too much for you , take four or five srong men with you .
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in chare of border gates .
this is no time to discuss jurisdiction .
you 're wong .
if you order me to kill them , please promote me to superitendent hee and now and obtain our lord 's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku , accordin to clan rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mind .
go !
we must gather men , use force and kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsman without peer .
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alone .
it 's buzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it nice and cozy a kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the festival drums .
father !
you were pressed by our relatives at kenmotsu 's place to come here as their messenger and say ,
we 've defied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
bu remember 
each must live his own life 
as for what happened ,
each must live his ow life .
and tel everyone this for me :
have 't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
wat are you doin ?
what if other clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather some men ad take care of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervention would aggravate matters .
father , the drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i remember it too .
outside the castle , it as the inoko festival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that 's as it should be .
it 's not unmanly at al .
but yogoro , do n't e too worried about ichi .
we will die here , but she is the mother of our lord 's heir .
no one can toture her , and no one will endanger her life .
but father , are 't they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter , but te gate wa open , so i came in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
we have heard o the order to commit seppuku .
he changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insoence and attitude toward our lord , you will be confined at enshoji temple outside the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will you gatefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's wrong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
i am still the wife of yogoro sasahara .
but our lord received me in his audience .
i do n't unerstand what this i all about .
steward , it seems we do n't understand what you just told us .
if you two adit that ichi is no longer a family member ad tat she has been returned , ou lord will isten to her plea for a lighter punishment .
will you acknowledge her return and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared for he worst .
then there is no alternative ?
please return her at once !
i 'l ask lady ichi now .
or will you let their pursuers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , the sasaharas are men .
you have aleady returned to serve our lord .
if you tell them that you sever your ties with them once and for all , then all will be well !
if you do , their lives will be saved .
we need not ask them to return you .
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save thei lives ?
or wil you let them die as traitors ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ichi , does your silence mean you will do as i say ?
am i corret ?
no .
i
father ...
tomi , bid your father and mother farewell .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are still alive listen to them .
let 's listen to what they want us to do .
no , i know without beig told .
hey want us to tell the world of our clan 's cruety !
very well .
i unerstand .
we promise to do that for you .
we 'l topple the aizu clan from its pedestal !
first , tomi and i will go to edo together and see the shogunate elers .
we 'll leave immediately for edo .
tomi and i are going to edo .
if this is for the clan , show me your pass .
if it 's private business , sow me the clan ticet .
i have neither .
then i 'm afraid i ca not let you pass .
you mean to pass from this domain without having either ?
i must forbi it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quiet .
i ' like to put her in the house away from the wind .
but men we dislike are in there .
venomous men .
i fed her before dawn .
i do n't think she 's hungry .
we 'll make do with this .
you be quiet ow , tomi .
do n't cry even if i do n't return .
let me remain .
it 's better that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
no .
no matter how strong you are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll deeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ...
wihout fail .
i will win without fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance of winning .
take tomi with you to edo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
no one ill ever know the story of your father and mother now .
just one word .
whe you grow up , become a woman just like your mother .
be sure to do that .

you could put it on now , so everyone at the captain 's table could see it .
a real chick magnet .

but not too much fun , because i 'm still very upset 
goodbye , dave .
and , helo , adies !
i like my tail shaken , not stirred .
where are you going ?
to the casino .
i 'm feeling lucky .
dave said ...
we 're old enough to make our own decisions .
what 's wrong with this movie 
it 's for babies !
munk up , theodore .
alvin , please !
i say we go to salsa night !
in our pajamas ?
oh , i know !
everybody just have a good time

unbelievable .
gravy pants .
hey , hev !
do you have a problem with me 
i do n't know .
what are you doing here ?
i 'm working , dave .
twice .
you 're right , dave .
but it 's not too late to ruin yours .
if i see those chipmunks break so much as one rule ,
you 're in my house now !
although , technically it 's not a house , it 's a ship .
like a hawk !
theodore ?
please do n't eat my brain !
alvin , how could you ...
simon ?
girls ?
oh , no.no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
you 're up for an international music award .
that 's fantastic !
yeah , it 's pretty cool .
i guess .
that would make you the youngest winer ever .
i 'm not that young .
no one tells me what to do .
dave ;
alvin !
who 's alan , i wonder ?
anyway-
you can follow me on critter !
honest .
your winnings , sir .
oh , busted !
i did n't sneak out .
right .
here they are , captain .
captain .
alvin :
what 's e goin to do , make us walk the plank ?
yes , dave .
uh-huh .
absolutely .
what if we need to disobey you ?
and why would you need to do that ?
now , i would be easy for me to take my trusty old swiss army knife and cut the ropes .
yes , alvin , you do .
hat pocket knife are you referring to ?
you could cut yourself .
alvin , there 's no such word as robbage .
and it 's pillaging .
there 's got to be times when you trust us to take matter into our own hands .
i trusted you tonight and look where that got me !
that s probably just the hot gray talking .
is it hang gliding , wakeboarding , or bungee jumping ?
shuffleboard .
alvin :
man !
by my calculations , it appears to be 10 % shuffle , 90 % bored .
oh , thanks .
you know , dave , i think i 'd prefer the plank .
and i get to do something i have n't done in a long tie .
absolutely nothing .
brittany approaches her puc , adjusts her stance , looks over at me , quite annoyed , wonders to herself if i 'm ever going to shut my mouth , realizes i 'm not , and makes her moe .
oh 
you can make all the jokes you want , alvi , but not even you can make this interesting .
oh , really ?
well , care to mae it interesting that i can make this interesting ?
simon , te poor guy has n't had a moment 's peace since he met us .
he 's exhausted .
check this out .
in three , two , one .
but kept the ishment .
it 's word pay !
uh-huh .
what ?
hey , kid !
that 's a nie-looking kite .
alvin :
come on , simon , grab on .
all i ever do is try to save him and it only gets me in trouble !
this wo n't end well 
simon , do something !
oh , seriously ?
simon , help !
looks like it 's simon saving him again !
whoa !
no !
if you awake , you 'll pull out your hair
man :
whoa !
hey !
simon :

theodore :

ian :

dave ;

in retrospect , this was a bad idea .
i do n' think i can make it much loger 
no .

no nibbles .

theodore :
maybe dave is coming in a hot-air balloon .
i do n' think dave is gon na be in a hot-air balloon .
but he is coming , right ?
of course he is .
we should prepare to stay the night .
what ?
no  we used to be used o living in the wild .
we 're alway setting things on fire accidentally .
and how are you intending to do that ?
i will ceate a spark by striking this rock with my swiss army knife , which dave took from me .

psdh
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 million years to o around the galaxy once
the dinosaur era lated 180 million years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for he earth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not really .
at this time the masters of the earth are dinosaurs .
this is patagonia .
a vas region of argentinean south america as it is today .
and there was only one immense ocean ,
we are north of the south american plate , in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land during the dinosaur era .
in many places there , one walks today on te very ground these giants walked upon a 100 million years ago .
this phenomenon seems to depend on another peculiar twist o evolution .
regions that produce great dinosaurs also tend to produce great palaeontologists .
many doctoral students come to pursue their research .
sometimes younger people , like my daughter ludmila , just come to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talkin about dinosaurs with everyone , whether they are experts or no .
it 's a busy life , and it woud have been plenty for most people , but early in my career new horizons opened up for me .
thins became much larger than life .
a racher had stumbled upon a surprisingly large bone .
after several digging seasons we ended up facing the largest dinosaur ever fou .
we named it argentinosaurus
this discovery have a profound effect , on the way we look at south american dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than gapefruit .
predatos and hazard aound .
only a few will reach adulthood .
it covers more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 million years old .
we believe that it was chosen as a nesting site by generation upon generation of these dinosaurs .
the nests are so close toether , that the females could not walk between them .
it was warme than today .
a great part of the dinosaur era , there were no broad leaf trees and no flower bearing plants .
during the dinosaur era there is no arctic ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
for tens of millions of years seasons barely changed .
the water of the ocean is also much warmer .
hurricanes are frequent .
the magnetic pole changes position continuously .
professor coria has contributed to the discovery of more than a dozen of new dinoaurs .
as a scientist , he insists that each new find is important , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes he says what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hands .
i like to think that i am lucky , just incredibly lucky .
many paleontological discoveries are not made by professionals .
that 's what happened with the argentinosaurus , and it happened again with yet another dinosaur .
they were relatively big , so at firs , we thought that hey beonged o a herbivore , beause i general these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
bu instead , the bones proved to be those of a predaor ;
a very large one .
professor coria 's team had unveiled a first species of a group of fierce predators called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in tis group surpassed the famous t. rex in terms of size .
alhough rare for reptiles , caring for the young has be observed among crocodiles for instance .
in dinosaurs , this caring behaviour evolve enough to remind us of birds .
this baby female is named long tooth .
however small and vulnerable , and cute she may appear now she is geneticaly programmed to rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like her mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and the largest predator , living at roughly the same period and in the same territory .
tere is no easy answer .
evolution followed a umer of particular paths .
but a simpler interpretation rest on a warm climate and the fertile land , with all the vegetation you can eat .
yet another theory tells us tat large herbivore had to grow big enough , to accommodate a large stomach required to digest igh in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space could have led naturally to argentinosaurus , as the vas seas have led to whales .
the highest branches belong to those who can reach them , and many predators are too small to be threatening in those situation .
se is rowing fast too .
her primitive feathers have almost all disappeared .
they thrived for 180 million years .
this is a message for us here .
by the way , it is more than time to introduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is related to birds , as are to some extent velociraptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannoaurus .
big dinosaurs need space .
this is the carmen funes museum , which also happens to be my second home .
sometimes as a joke we say that it is a science filled with holes .
we have only found about 700 species of dinosaurs on the whole planet .
this is 't many fo a reign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , most of them in the last 30 years .
through technology our knowledge grows faster every day .
fossilisation is a process that requires extremely rare conditions , and even ten very litle of an organism is preserved .
we could easily conclude that a tremendous number of species just disappeared without a trace .
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you also need to be very careful before proposing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish i could travel in time o see these amazing creatures alive .
strong one has reached maturity .
for many scientists he is at full size .
he is 20-year-old , ad is at the beginning of more than a century of life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , if they were alone or in a group , if they were wandering , hunting , or being hunted
the pattern clearly show association between cotemporary secies , and this is very rare .
his work is intimately linked to natue , its intimately varied terrain and ever changing climate .
so there were hardships , but there are moments , sometimes when science just blend with the pure bliss of beig outside and wonderful places .
you just look around .
but finding required a trained eye .
with time you realise a the nuber of questions grows fater than the numer of answers .
again , like any times before ,
a good hint and an answer ame unexpectedly .
in fact , we did n't find just one specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at least seven individuals .
for me , and my canadian colleague phil curry tis was pointing at something we had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so long tuth belongs to this new species of giganotosaurus .
and a 22 years o age , she is fully grown .
srong one is unknowingly in a critical ime .
tearing off pieces of skin and etting the large prey bleed to death , or die from infection is a strategy more likely to succeed .
giganotosaurus coul wait day even weeks between meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep on drifting , he earth begins to resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature never stops changing .
we are in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolution gave it nothing to survive the impending dramatic events .
several factors could have contributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mammals became bigger and more competitive .
drifting isolated continents touched each other .
new rialries appeared .
new diseases spread .
the climate was growing colder , possibly because of increased volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable in many places .
vegetation suffered from the aci rain and also from the darkened and dust-filled skies .
but still , many dinosaurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the distance from the moon to the earth in two hours .
all te forest of north and south ameica are destroyed by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the animals that suffered most .
in a relativey short time , dinosaurs become history .
not all the diosaurs disappear .
if they have n't become extinct maybe we just would n't be hee .
more discoveries await me ere pehap but as i move forward in lie ,
and he best food in paris , some ay , is made by chef auguste gusteau .
gusteau 's restaurant is the toast of paris , ooked five months in advance .
he is the youngest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but not everyone celebates its success .
wat 's even more amusing is that gusteau actually sees to believe it .
i , on the other hand , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
thi is emile , my brother .
he 's easily impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impressed .
he also happens to be the leader of our clan .
so , what 's wrong with havig hily develope senses ?
what 's going on hee ?
suddenly , dad did n't tink my talent was useless .
clean .
cleaerific .
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad proud .
now , do n't you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we 're thieves , dad .
and hat we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no one wants it , hy are we stealing it ?
bu to my dad ..
you get picky about what you put in the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and eat your garbage .
secondly , stay out of the kitchen and away rom the umans .
it 's dangerous .
they discover , they create .
how can i describe it ?
good food is ike music you can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was right .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only one who knew about it was emile .
hey , emile .
emile .
coe on , you 're good at hiding food .
he does n't understand me , but i can be myself around him .
why are you waking like that ?
i do n't want to onstantly have to wash m paws .
did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws hat we handle food with ?
you ever think about what we put into our mouths ?
all the time .
but if dad sees you walking like that , he 's not goin to like it .
what have you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found cheese ?
and not ust any cheese .
that would go beautifully with my mushroom .
ad ...
this rosemary !
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you know , dad 's gon na ...
emile !
there are possibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep turning it .
that storm 's gettig closer .
hey , remy , you think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to taste this !
it 's got , like , this ba-boom , zap kind of taste .
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 's lihtning-y !
we go to do that again .
oka , when the next storm come , we 'll go up on the oof ...
i know what his needs !
saffron .
saffron .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na wake up .
she turns on the cooking channel , boom , she never wakes u .
you 've been here a million times ?
gusteau swears by it .
okay .
who 's guseau ?
jut the greatest chef in the world .
wrote this cookbook .
you read ?
and they have , which is why i read .
i do n't like secrets .
all this cooking and readig and tv-watching while we read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's taking those kids so long ?
ah , l'auila saffron .
italian .
gusteau says it 's excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love ...
forget mystique .
great cooking is not for the faint of heart .
you must be imaginative , strong hearted .
you must try things that may not work .
and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from .
anyone can cook .
but only the fearles can be great .
gusteau 's restaurant lost one of its fie stars after a scathing review by france 's top food critic , anton ego .
it was a sevee blow to gusteau , and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards , which , according to tradition , meant te loss of another star 
oh !
oh !
oh !
run !
no , you 'll lead her to the colony !

she left it for you .
i think she hoped it would help me , you know , get a job here .

he is part of the kitche .
he does n't cook .
uh , no .

that does n't mean that anyone should .
see ?

this i your chance .
where is the soup ?
how dare you cook in my kitchen ?
where do you get the gall to even attempt something so monumentally idiotic ?
i should have you drawn and quartered !
i 'll do it .
larousse , draw and quarter this man after you put him in the duck press to squeeze the fat out of his head .
what are you blathering about ?
the soup !
soup ?
no !
waiter .
linguini !
f-i-r-e-d !
what did the customer say ?
it was not a customer .
ego ?
solène leclaire .
she likes the soup .
wait .
someone is asking aout your soup .
what are you playing at ?
am i still fire ?
you ca n't fire him .
what ?
if she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the ook responsibe ...
he 's a garbage boy .
how can we claim to represent the name of gusteau if we do n't uphold his ost cherished belief ?
he has taken a bold risk and we should reward that , as chef gusteau would have .
oh , yeah .
you will make he soup again , and this time , i 'll be payin atention .
very close attention .
they think you might be a cook .
but you know wha i think , linguini ?
get the rat .
what should i do now ?
kill it .
no , not in the kitchen .
the 'd close us down .
take it away from here .
kill it .
go !
do n't look at e like that !
they expect me o cook it again !
i mean , i 'm not ambitious .
i was just trying to stay out of trouble .
you 're the oe who was getting fancy with the spices !
what did you throw in there ?
oregano ?
i need this job .
i ve lost so many .
did you nod ?
have you been noding ?
so i 'm not crazy !
wait a second , wait a second .
you can , right ?
look , do n't be so moest .
you 're a rat , fo pete 's sake .
whatever you did , they liked it .
do you think you could do it again ?
right ?
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not much , but it 's , you know ...
there 's heat and light and a couch ith a tv .
the best kind of dream .
one we can share .
but why here ?
why now ?
morning , little chef .
idiot !
i let a rat into my place an tell him what 's mine is his !
stupid !
he 's stolen food and hit the road !
that 's what i get for trusting a ...
hi .
is that for me ?
look , it 's delicious .
but do n't steal .
i 'll buy some spices , okay ?
an on the first day !
though i , like many other critic ,
had written off gusteau as irrelevant since the great chef 's death ,
the soup was a revelation .
olène leclaire ?
agaist all odds , gusteau 's has recaptured our attention .
only time will tell if they deserve it .
well ...
you kno .
welcome to hel .
now , recreate the soup 
take as much time as you need .
soup .
you little ...
you son of a ...
something that does n't involve any biting , or nipping , or running up and down my body wit your litte rat eet .
the biting !
scampering !
no !
no scampering or scurrying .
little chef ?
oh , you 're hungry .
okay .
so let 's tink this out .
we need to work out a sstem so that i do what you want in a way that does n't look like i m being controlled by a tiny rat chef .
would you listen to me ?
i 'm insane !
i 'm insane !
i will never pull his off !
linguini 
we got ta communicate .
i saw it !
a rat ?
yes , a rat .
what are you doing in here ?
get out .
that was close .
whoa !
how did you do that ?
that 's strangely involuntary !
one look and i knew we had the same crazy idea .
okay .
huh ?
where are you taking me ?
i 'm sorry .
whoa !
mmm-mm ...
okay 
whoa !
whoa !
à votre santé !
all right .
mmm .
but you 'll need to know more than soup if you are to survive in my kitchen , boy .
listen , i just want ou to know how honored i am to be studying under such ...
no !
how many women do you see in this kitchen ?
well , i ...
only me .
why do you think that is ?
because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon rules written by stupid ol men .
but still i 'm here .
how did this happen ?
because i am the toughest cook in this kitchen .
got it ?
wow !
gusteau makes chinese food
gusteau 's corn puppies .
bite size .
what are corn dogs ?
cheap ausages dipped in atter and deep fried .
cheap sausages dipped in batte and deep fried .
you know , american .
whip something up .
or as a big ear of corn in doggie make-up .
yes .
well , the will stipulates that if after a period of two years from the date of deah no heir appears ,
gusteau 's business interests will pass to his sou chef .
you .
what i want to know is if this letter ...
if this boy changes anythin !
there 's no resemblance at all .
he is not gusteau 's son .
gusteau had no children , and what of the timing of all this ?
highly suspect !
this is gusteau 's ?
yes , yes , yes .
of course 
she claims she never told him , or gusteau , and asks that i not tell .
why you ?
only a job ?
if he orks here , you 'll be able to keep an eye on him while i do a little digging .
find out how much of this is real .
i will need you to collect some da samples from the boy .
mark my wors .
the whole thing is highly suspect .
he knows something .
relax , he 's a garbage boy .
what are you doing ?
i 'm cutting vegetables .
you think cooking is a cute job , like mommy in the kithen ?
what is this ?
when the meal rush comes , what will happen ?
disaster .
keep your station clear , or i will kill you !
your sleeves look like you threw up on them .
like this .
see ?
alays return to his position .
sharp utensils , hot metal , keep your ams in .
i memorize all his recipe .
follow the recipe .
no , no , no .
how do you tell how good bread is without tasing it ?
listen .
symphony of crackle .
the only way to get the best produce is to have firt pick of the day and there are only two way to get first pick .
grow it yourself , or bribe a grower .
and then he get fired for messing around with the ringmaster 's daughter .
horst has done time .
what for ?
i robbed the second largest bank in france using only a ballpoint pen .
i created a hole in the ozone over avignon .
which resistance ?
he wo n't say .
apparently , tey did n't win .
so you see .
we ae artist , pirate .
more than cooks are we .

you know you do !
you know who know do whacka-doo .
hey !
what ?
ratatouille .
it 's like a stew , right ?
why do they call it that ?
if you 're going to name a food , you should gie it a name that sounds delicious .
ratatouille does n't sound delicious .
it sounds like rat and patootie .
rat patootie .
which does not ound delicious .
and finding someone to replace you for poison checker has been a disaster .
nothing 's been poisoned , thank god , but it has n't been easy .
i am sorry , dad .

we 're rats .
we make them bigger .
i 'm tired of taking .
i want to make tings .
o , eah ?
what makes you so sure ?
i 've been able to observe them at a lose-ish sort of age .
yeah ?
how close ?
close enough .
and they 're , you know , not so bad as you say they are .
come with me .
i got something i want you to see .
you want me to stay and clean ?
i that a problem ?
no .
good boy .
we 're here .
the world we live in belongs to the enemy .
what ?
no .

you ca n't change nature .
change is nature , dad .
the part that we can influence .
and it starts when we decide .
where you going ?
with luck , forward .
hey !
yeah .
stop it .
good morning 
that 's big .
that 's big .
what , you ca n't tell me ?
oh !
forgive me for intruding on your deep , personal relationship with the chef .
oh , i see how it is .
you get e to teach you a few kitchen tricks o dazzle the boss and the you blow past me ?
wake up .
i did n't have to help ou !
but ...
i wanted you to succeed .
i liked you .
my mistake .
colete .
wait , wait .
i ca n't do it anymore .
wait , wait !
look  i 'm no good with words .
at least not withou your help .
i ate false modesty .
it 's just another way to lie .
you have talent .
no , but i do n't !
it 's not me .
wha o you mean ?
i mean , i would n't have done that .
i would 've followed te recipe .
i woud ve followed your advice to the ends of the earth .
because i love your advice .
but ...
ut i ...
o n't do it .
i have a secret .
what ?
you have a rash ?
i hae this ...
little ...
a tiny chef ?
yes .
he 's ...
he 's up here .
here we go .
you inspire me .
i 'm going to risk looking like the biggest idiot psycho you 've ever seen .
you ant to now why i 'm such a ast learner ?
do n't laugh !
no !
no !
what is it , ambrister ?
gusteau 's .
more financial trouble ?
no , it 's ...
announced a new line of microwave egg rolls ?
what ?
i said , gusteau has finaly found his rightful place in hisory
right alongside another equally famous chef ,
touché .
that was my last word .
the last wod .
then tell me , ambrister , how could it be popular ?
he dna matches , the timin works , everything checks out .
this ca n't just happen !
te whole thing is a setup !
the bo knos !
look at him out there , pretending to be an idiot .
string ?
playing dumb .
taunting me with that rat .
deliberately trying to make me think it 's important .
the rat .
exactly !
is the rat important ?
of course not !
he jut wants me to think that it is .
and now he wants me to see it everywhere .
ooh !
no , it is 't , it 's here !
am i seeing things , am i crazy ?
is here a phantom rat or is there not ?
but , oh , no !
i refuse to be sucked into his little game of ...
about you ?
i ca n't fire him .
he 's getting attention .
if i fire him now , everyone will wonder why .
is n't it good to have the press ?
is n't it good to have gusteau 's name getting headlines ?
not if they 're over his face !
gusteau 's already has a face , and it s fat and lovable and familiar .
and it sells burritos !
millions and millions of buritos !
no  no , no 
well , because you ...
rat !
disgusting little creatures .
how the orld really saw me .
and it just kept getting better .
remy !
remy !
hey , hey , hey , litte brother !

emile , that 's exactly what i said not to do !
but you know these guys .
they 're my friends .
i did n't think you meant them .
look , i 'm sorry .
do n't tell me you 're sorry , tell them you 're sorry .

hmm ...
okay .
emile shows up with ...
i told him ...
he goes and blabs to ...
yeah , it 's a disaste .
anyway , they 're hungry , the food safe is locked and i need the key .
they want you to steal food ?
yes .
no !
no !
it 's complicated .
they do n't have your ideals .
ideals ?
or , tooth , i say , tooth pick ' n chicken ?
about as french as a corn dog !
coming soon !
we 're inventing new ways to sell out over here .
can you guys shut up ?
word 's geting out .
ey .

linguini ?
why would linguini be iled with your will ?
this used to be my office 
he 's your son ?

i am a figment of your imagination .

chef !

he ' not in your office .
you are in his .
bottom up , linguini !
cheers , ja .
chef !
hef !
what is the secret to your genius ?
secret ?
i am gusteau 's son .
but you were n't aware of that fact until ery recently .
and it resulted in your taking ownership of this restaurant .
how did you find out ?
the gusteau part ?
inspiration has many names .
mine is named colette 
something 's stuck in my teeth .
healh inspector .
i wish to report a rat infestation .
first opening is three months .
it 's a gourmet restaurant !
monsieur , i have the information .
if someone cancels , i 'll sot you in .
but the rat !
you must ...
it s past opening time .
he sould have finished an hour ago .
bonjour , ma chérie .
join us .
we were just talking about my inspiration .
yes , he calls it his tiny chef .
not that , dearest .
i meant you .
it 's im .
ego ?
anton ego !
is that ego ?
you are monsieur linguini ?
hello .
pardon me for interrupting your premature celebration , but i thought it only fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game .
gae ?
yes .
and you 've been playing without an opponent .
wich is , as you may have guessed , against the rules .
you 're anton ego .
if i do n't love it , i do n't swallow .
listen , we hate to be rude , but we 're french , and it 's dinnertime .
do n't give me that look .
you were distracting me in front of the press .
how am i supposed to concentrate with ou yaking on my hair al the time ?
your opinion is n't the only one that matters here .
all right , that 's it !
you take a break , little chef .
i 'm not your puppet , and you 're no my puppet-controlling guy !
you cool off and get your mind right , ittle chef .
ego is coming , and i need to focus !
you stupid ...
i have never seen that before .
you know what ?
i 've been selfish .
are you kidding ?
we 'll o after closing time .
in fact ...
yeah .
this is great , son .
an inside job .
oof !
he , little chef .
then when you were n't there , i do n't know ..
it did n't seem right to leave things the way that we did , so ...
look , i do n't want to fight .
i 've been under a lot of , you know , pressure .
i 'm suddenly a gusteau .
and i got to be a gusteau or , you know , peope will be disappointed .
i have n't been fair to you .
you 've never failed me , and i should never forget that .
you 've bee a good friend .
he most honorable friend a guy could ever ask ...
what 's going on ?
hey ...
you 're ...
you 're stealing food ?
i thought you were my friend !
i trusted you !
get out !
you and all your rat buddies !
we are what we are , and we 're rats .
steal all you want .
i 've lost my appetite .
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
come in !
you are the boss .
attention , everyone .
tonight is a big night .
i mean , ego .
the critic .
and he 's going to order something .
just ca n't leave it alone , can you ?
it 's not safe .
i 'm hungry !
observe .
no , wait !
oh , no !
no , no !
you might think you are a chef but you are il only a rat .
sure he took away a star last time he reviewed this place .
sure it probabl killed ..
dad .
this is very bad juju right here .
ego is here .
ego ?
he is here ?
anton ego is just another customer 
let 's cook !
yeah !
okay .
au revoir , rat !
do you know what you would like this evening , si ?
yes , i think i do .
after reading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook , you know what i 'm craving ?
a little perspective .
can you suggest a good wine to go with that ?
very well .
you provide the food , i 'll provide the perspective .
hich would go nicely with a bottle of cheval blanc 1947 .
i 'm afraid i ...
tell him to hit me with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 've given up .
as you are .
oh , please .
i pretend you exist so i have someone to alk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here !
what the ...
dad !
where are you going ?
they 'll fail without me .
why do you care ?
because i 'm a cook !
it 's your recipe .
i did n't write it down .
it just came to me .
because we ca 't seve thi !
where 's my order ?
ca n't we serve someting else ?
something i did n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we just opened .
i have another idea .
what if we serve them what they order !
we will ake it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the customers somethig .
then tell them ...
tell them ...
remy .
we 're not talking about me .
we 're alking about what to do right ...
remy !
get my knife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ...
well , the truth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i have no talent at all .
but this rat , he 's the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding under my toque .
he 's been controlling my actios .
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's exiting everyone .
i kno it 's a hard thing to believe 
we can be the greatest restaurat in paris , and thi rat , this brilliant little chef , can lead us there .
what do you say ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ca n't choose between two halves of myself .
i 'm not talking about cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
you tell us what to do , and we ll get it done .
stop that health inspector !
delta team , go , go , go , go !
the rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be handling fish .
tea four , roasted items .
team six , sauces .
get to your stations .
those handling food will walk on two legs .
i 'm sorry for any delay , but we 're a little short tonight .
please , take all of the time you need .
make sure that steak is nie and tenderized .
easy with that sole meunière .
only use the mimolette cheese .
compose the alad like you were painting a picture .
do n't let that beurre blanc separate .
gently poach the scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
just tell me what the rat wants to cook .
it 's a peasant dih .
i am making ratatouille .
the must be oking .
mmm 
no , it ca n't be .
i demand to know !
i asked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight .
then who do i thank for the meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait until all the other customer have gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react beyond asking an occasional question .
and when the story is done , ego stands , thanks us for the meal ...
we risk very little , yet enjoy a poition over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which is fun to write and to read .
the world is often unkind to new talent , new creation .
the new needs friends .
last night , i experienced something new , an extraordinary eal from a singularly unexpected source .
but i realize only now do i truly understand what he meant .
not everyone an become a great artist , but a great artist can come from anywhere .
it is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at gusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the finest chef in france .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a great night .
well , we had to let skinner and the health inspector loose , and of course they ratted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n' feel too bad for him .
he eems very happy .
how do you know ?
got to go .
do n't you always ?
which one woul you like ?

used to be a time when you could buy an honest icle .
they were lighting up the sky .
the kind that you can only find at a pickle cart .

he ould n't -- oh , ma !
-i am ?
yeah .
the one way to stop the mones , save the town and find the professor is to use our powers to --
better yet , watch !
-that was amaz-
gross !
cut it out .
good one , bubbles .
-girls --
-shut up !
i was afraid of this .
come .
you ill make a good power-proof vest .
-none of those monkeys had professor !
-where could he be ?
come on , girls !
look at the little heroes here to save their daddy !
no , girls !
-sorry , professor !
-we can take tis chump chimp down !
that ' better .
it 's good you little freaks know when you 're beaten .
i have to seize contro of an area and force its inhabitants to follow my way of thinking !
even if it means taing extreme measures !
-you would n't !
now i am more mojo than before !
no , as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted i , mojo jojo , have succeeded in my first , greatest and most brilliant plan ever !
and i , mojo jojo shall be king !
now let 's get out of this town !
-it 's no use .
well , now it 's time for everyone to understand .
surrender now , and we 'll go easy on you !
down here !
you 're actually trying to top me ?
that 's so cute !
-we will sto you !
who are you caling cute ?
okay , let 's la !
buttercup !
-that more mojo is no more !
someody 's mad .
look out !
i have an idea .
-do you think he 's finished ?
-no , but you are !
fools !
you dare to challenge me ?
try to destroy me ?
i , who saved you rom certain death ?
after al i ve done for you , you betray me ?
and why ?
the one who hated you ... .
none of them will ever understand you as i can .
for we are kindred spirits , whose powers spring from the same source .
so , girls , do not make e destroy you .
we are invincible !
we have the power !
all we have to do is work together .
girls , join me .
we 'd never join you , and it 's because we are stronger .
-because we are invincible .
we have to protect them from you !
you are evil !
and you are it !
girls , you were right !
we should stop mojo , and i know how !
i whipped up an antidote to chemical x !
we loe you too !
-and we 're really sorry .
-we messed up really bad .
-but we 're ready , professor .
if it was n't for them , none of this would have happened .
and maybe everyone would like us more if we were just normal little girls .
no !
irls , i think hat the mayor is trying to say is we 're sorr , and thank you .
yes , that was super , just super !
-amazing !
-stupendous !
you rock !
thank you .
can we , professor ?
okay , but onl if it 's before your bedtime .
hel !
sugar , spice and everything nice .
these were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl .
but professor utonium accidentally added an extra ingredient to the mix :
chemical x .
using their ultra super powers , they 've dedicated their lives to fighting crime and the forces of evil .
the powerpuff girls !
hey , that 's a good name for them .
powerpuff girls , yeah !
i like that .
powerpuff girls !
it all began when the silence of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound .
it was a sound like one never heard efore in this part of the jungle .
it was a man cub !
i would 've obeyed my first impulse and walked away .
then it occurred to me .
oh , i knew there 'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal instinct , but ...
ten times the rains had come and gone .
he was a favourite of al the oung wol cubs of the pack .
no man cub was ever happier .
and yet , i knew that someday ... he would have to go back to his own kind .
shere khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him .
now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy 's faher .
rama 
uh  come over here , please .
the man cub can no longer stay with the pack .
leave ?
there is no other way .
but-
but , rama , even the trength of the pack is no match for he tiger .
perhaps i can be of help .
you , bagheera ?
how ?
i know of a man village where he 'll be safe .
mowgli and i have taken man walks into the jungle together , so i 'm sure he 'll go with me .
so be it .
now here 's no ime to lose .
should n't we start bak home ?
mowgli , this time we 're not oing back .
i 'm taking you to a man village .
because shere khan has retured to this part of the jungle .
and he has sworn o kill you .
kill me ?
he hates man .
well , maybe so .
we 'll spend te ight here .
things will look better in the morning .
man cub !
now come on , up this tree .
up you go .

that 's right .

oh-

and besides , i do n't have any claw .
we 've got a long journey ahead o us tomorrow .
i wan na stay in the jungle .

keep believin ' , freshman .
i respect that .
but you know you 're still my boo 
he 's trying so hard not o like you .
and i think now would be the proper time to point out that he is extra-specialy cheetalicious .
every time he bats those long eyelashes of his , it 's just a way to bring down the hammer on our succes .
he even makes really embarrassing things look realy , reall cute .
ready , girls ?
le 's do this .
ok , here we go .
ok .
be quiet .
and she 'd ead me a story
i always was about a princess in distress

and end up with the glory
i 'd lie in be and think about
sitin ' in a dark .
cold .
dusty cellar
to come and set me free
oh .
i will survive i know somebody 's on my side
do n't wan na be no .
i 'd rather rescue myself
i can slay my own dragons
my knight in shining armour
is me
so i 'm gon na set me free
i do n't wan na be like cinderella
cold .
dusty cellar
for a handsome prince to come and save me
oh .

dusty cellar
waitin ' for somebody

when i see you girls , i see , like , little drinka clones .
galleria , when i look at you ,

i see a hot , latin , spicy version of me .
and aqua , when i look at you ,
i see myself as if i was from the sasy south .
if you were what ?
eveyone else does .
dorinda 's like me if i was shrimpy and white .
oh , yes , honey .

but , drinka , like , o we actualy have a chance of winning ?

do n't spoil this day because you did n't get all you wanted .
at this rate , you 're headed straight to your room .
you 'll be just as talented after college .
50 times over .
then you would not have the time to study , you would n't have the grades to get in , and that , my dear , is what ou call a paradox .
some college do n't even ook at grades .
some people do nt even go to college 
franco ?
papa , tell her i 'm not a knucklehead .
tell her i 'm not a pazza .
but you know what ?
you have to listen to your mothe 's advice .
silly people do silly things , mom .
i get good grades .
strong bones and teeth .

bella .
you bat those long eyelashes , and i say yes every time .
no , franco , she 's too young .
i have made so many mistakes in my life , and i 'm determined not to have our daughter make the same mistakes i did .
she 's not going to make the same mistakes .
but what if her dreams fall aart ?
cara .
no one is eer ready for their dreams to fall apart .
but when she 's older , we 're not going to be there o help her put them back together .
it 's sick .
she dangled a shopping trip in my face  and then lowered the boom .

i mean , now at least we could be down for the talent show .
and if we win , we can still have our demo .

now you 're all gung ho for the taent show ?
maybe we need to do it this way first , so we can get our shot .
he knows the business .
it 's a job singing , dancing , and making eople happy .
wat 's wrong with that ?
it 's not your song , so you wan na walk .
you 're jut mad because he wo n't do your material , right ?
our material , not that all around the world nonsense he was playing .
we make our deciions together .
you 'e just one person , and you 're not the boss of everything .
to make our dreams come true .
i wish i could believe in you , galleria , i really do , but lately you 've been all about you .
i ca n't ...

i just wanted to thank you for always keeping me in your dreams .
no matter where they take us .
the cheetah girls are over .
oh , baby , no , no , no .
i worked on our look .
i buckled everything down .
i thought that we were all on the same page .
i am sure you did what was right .
but what 's right for you may not be right for someone ese .
and it 's not worth losing a friendship over .
i mean , they want fame .
ad then there are ways .
and i want fame the cheetah girls way .
the cheetah gils way or your way ?
oh , sweetheart .
i tried so hard to protect you from getting your dreams crushed .
and let the people you love ake their own choices .

no , keep going .
it as n't entirely all tat bad .
you liked it ?
yeah .

he had other ideas for us .
listen to this 
where we stop nobody knows we do 't care ...
ok .
it was rama and kaflamma .
there were masks involved .
when he asked us to lip sync ,
i walked .
so it 's true  huh ?
the cheetahs are extinct .
ut you got the talent , and you can walk it .

k !
stick to your role !
what was all that nonsense ?
jut testing what eetu 's got in him
he 's in top for .
no need to test him
these are the tactics for sunay :
everyone will be bunched up on the irst few circuits
after 100 km or so , the pace should pick up
the steep climb at the end makes the race really tricky
and you with your famous sprint , break away on the last stretch
you 'll handle the kylmälä climb , huh ?
wha kind of an answer is that ?
i did n't ask you
this is your big break
what if i had a chance too ?
just think , if we quit , we could concentrate on training
more or less
jons 
delivery to the cable fatory !

the new address is ...
hi
have you woked out the tactics for sunday ?
up .
and i will
unless your chain breaks , like ast time
k !
the pool wil close soon .
what are you talking about ?
your mania for statistics
you 've got to eep notes so you can time yourself right
is n't that what coaches are or ?
you have to prove your skills if you want o succeed
fucking hell , i 've had enough of this
while others are training down south , we 're stuck in the backoods
we ve got to et on the national team , this season
jesus , is that your attitude ?
if i 'm assisting ou , i want to be sure you 're serious
of course i am .
of couse not .
the 0pen division district championshis are about to start
these young riders will race 175 km on a 25 km circuit ... just hen i ell asleep , they started at the fire station
it must have been the fifth time the sirens went off ...
... the final climb on the route is a real killer
eetu !
did you ask her to come ?
of course
we have a rough job ahead of us .
you know what she said about you ?
what ?
let 's concentate hile we 're all harged up
we 'll see how the chain mates with their fresh team will ...
running out of drink
i 'll get you some soon
want to win or not ?
we ca n't give in
coach will go berserk if we let them get away
k !
wait !
0nly 100 meters to the finish , we have mattson still in the lead
naakka pulls past in the nick of time .
to everyone 's surprise
he third man in is valve from kiffen
congratulations .
nineteen
you seem like a seriou racer .
more serious than those clowns
i 'm setting up the national team for under twenty-ones in the fall
you ight fit in the tea .
sounds good
ee you at the nationals
who woul have ever guessed ?
but you dropped out .
eetu , there 's no excuse for screwing up
shut up , princess , or you 're canned
shit , what a loser !
give it a break .
it 's 50 km to home
you forgot your trophy
congratulations .
just a district championship .
in honor of your first vitory
that 'll do
you resting pulse is 42 .
how can it be so low ?
but your stress pulse is just about as high as it can get
it should n't go over 210 .
slow down a bit .
nice work !
sorry about losing it after the race .
forget it .
i quit
i 've ad enough bullshit from mr .
ski
you ca n't quit now .
we can go ome other time
or two years i 've been helping you
now it s my chance , and you quit the team
you 've still got mika and jani .
stuck in the peloton forever
no !
i 'm going for a spin toight anyhow .
i expect you 're coming too
why would you want to ride with a loser like me ?
eetu searching for k !
k receiving
k. i 'll come for a spin
but i wo n't have anything to do with mr .
ski
why are you here ?
eetu asked me to come .
yup .
i can leave , if you insist
we 'll just have to take it easy
no need to hold back because of me
k !
let 's get charged .
a good idea
she 'll either come or she wo n't
did you notice , last fall i was in the same shape as you 're in now
i knew i was in top form
yet i 'd uild up the lactics way too easily
especially when climbing
started orking on my ability to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics were boiling
sounds extremely rough
it was , for months
then suddenly a week ago- a breakthrough !
i 'd bring myelf on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i won te race
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance our team has
ok .
on three conditions :
neiter of you blows the other 's chances .
some program he 's been on all spring !
if i 'd use the same method , i 'd already be on the national team
you do n't mind that your best friend kept such a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat him once more- he would have illed himself .
it can be a good thing .
taking things seriously
eetu !
oach agreed we could train together for the nationals
i 've quit .
maybe it would be a healthy change
no one asked you !
would we use your method ?
f you want
in that case , count e in
of to bed early !
heay session omorrow
oona !
is he a total moron ?
this is similar to the 25 roue the nationals will be raced on this year
i thought we were using your mehod
o.k .
each round i 'l join you on the climb
drive me as hard as you ca .
like it 's the nationals
eady for a road kill ?
you 're minute behind on this round
how 's it going ?
not bad
i 'd prefer eetu alive tonight
so you came to play nurse .
have a problem with cycling women ?
my first childhood memory is watching my mom win the nationals
i 've seen cycling women before
nice sannino .
hey , i do n't eed a coach
but your body is perfect for cycing
i mean it .
is that just a professional remark ?
last year in vaasa , remember ?
i was a zombie afterwards
i see
yea , but oona and i had planned to go kayaking tonight
looks like i 'm too weak to hod a paddle
yup .
if he goes on with your method , he 'll soon be good for nothing
it 's only temporary .
he 'll soon be back on the ball
it 's just that i booked us a kayak .
i could fill in
i 'll e fine on my own .
no , no .
i can come
well .
why not .
where and what time ?
i 'll be there
got the entrance exam in july
it 's just hard to find time for reading
i am
at the beginning focus on pacing
the strength comes years later
yeah , yeah
sae as in cycling , keep your body relaxed
now you 're telling me how to cyce , as wel ?
arms tretched out
you lost it again .
concentrate .
are all cyclists that stiff ?
or god ' sakes , shut up !
good .
i 've figured it out
kind of far for a beginner
you thin i 'm not fit enough ?
no , but ... shit , no !
where ?
directly behind us !
where to ?
shit !
my treat .
hi .
two beers
beer .

such a beautiful night .
sweet dreams .
yup .
how 's coaching coming alon ?
very well .
eetu 's really getting there
oh , are the going steady ?
she 's ... a human being
what if i sewed all three of you some nice cycling shirts ?
silk and elegance .
why not , if you feel like it .
and breasts ?
they 're there
but what size ?
it 's important with a cycling shirt
have n't measured the !
an average girl with average breast sounds promising
hey , cut it out !
man and ape descend from the same ancestors
man easily adjusts to hot climates
causes of death vary greatly ell which ofen stays inactive throughout its life cycle muscles start at the radius ...
listen , here comes a sure bet
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to rea to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
k calling eetu !
eetu receiving
are you exhausted ?
on the contrary , i feel great !
so what 's net ?
if it 's up to me , we could een tighten up
remember when the team from järvenpää went training in the mines ?
oona receiving .
what mines ?
look out for the boat !
should we check i out 
we need healamps or something .
everyone shut up , or you 're dead !
k calling oona !

the biological background of man
they can both be classified as tropical iurnal animals
but in the cold he needs facilitie suh as clothes to survive
hey !

k. there 's a job for you at the national theater ... though the back , second window on the right .
no buzzer , of course
i 'm in for the nationals next week .
it may be good that you came
there 's an odd murmur in your heart
the heart is a strange organ , though .
making exessive exertion on the heart impossible .
i just read it
and rushed over to tell me ?
and that 's what we 'll o
i 'll test you at the same time
ca n't it wait unti after the race ?
until you 've been scanned , training is banned
yes !
one for oona , one for eetu , and one for k
perfect fit .
dense but not too tight
no space for air in between .
exactly
so when 's your next race ?
thank you .
you 're welcome
i thought i 'd wait until the nationals
but i 'm getting ichy feet .
no wa .
no races until mr .
si has tested you .
you need to be in top orm then
if k has worked out a plan for you , why not follow it ?
we 'll dive 3 km down to 350 meters
they come from caves far away
i came to train here last spring .
ok .
a small front gear and a 29- teethed in the rear
it 'll put all your muscle sets to use
i 'll shout hen my heart rate goes over 200
we 'll change into light gear and keep pedalig through recovery
we 'll keep at it all week long
switch to light !
switch to heavy !
recovery !
a helluva hill !
is n't it ?
do i ?
yes .
and no wonder .
you were up all night
i 'll take it easy on the next round .
no , you 're not going at all
you 'll rest through this session .
you have to get some sleep
i 'll ski the next round
eetu , let 's roll on
he recorded m textbook
how about doing something later ?
on saturday there 's the alleycat contest and a party afterwards
we could think of something then
after you 've found 7 plant names in latin , head back downtown
the winner gets a paid day off and a kilo of russian chocolate
did you oversleep ?
yeah , my muscles are totally jammed
what the hell jewel ?
who cares .
let 's find it and split the week between us
looks like a piece of cake .
ready ... go !
sometimes small chage can make a big difference
a lousy deal !
two weeks into the job , and you already got five days off
no i can stuy for the exam .
exactly
who won ?
you always have an excuse
what ' the big deal ?
it 's just a game
if you do the same at the nationals , you 'll be the laughing stock
what the hell ?
i 'm fed up with his bitching
what do you mean ?
what 's bugging him ?
ca nt deal with disappointments and takes it out on others
feel like dancing ?
sure
it 's raining cats and dogs
nohing beat swimming in the rain .
oh yes , i love it
i know the best place in town for a night swim .
where is it ?
wan na go ?
yes !
i 'm leaving
yeah , riht .
but i 'm leaing now
how about tomorrow ?
foret it .
forget the whole summer
nothing
listen .
sounds a bit like ears humming
the two of you will just have to talk things through
i 'll call him in the morning .
i can call him as well
no , i 'll talk o him first
i 'm so appy .
so am i
eetu called at 3 am .
great laps you 're doing !
i 've been wracking my brain over the tactics for the race
i had planned that eetu would hel k to win
you can both race fo first place
it would be great if one of you gets lucky
let 's go for a swim after work .
mr .
ski is totaly mind-boggled .
he thought you were history
you called on saturday .
for a while i suspected you were hitting on oona behind my back
but i knew you would never do a thing like tat to me
especially a a time like this
that 's what i thought
if you see him ..
then what ?
you need eetu 's help
and he needs mine just the same .
he called me
apologized for his behavior .
ad ?
about us ?
about us of course
why would i lie to him .
i feel stupid enough as it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , if you did n't have the guts to tell him
and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta
your heart has to be operaed on
is it a major operation ?
yes , and difficult
if you were on the national team , maybe ...
i have the nationals on sunday .
and i forbid you to take part
consequently , the ventricles contract
seemingly laking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes apidly , unexpectedl ...
am i bothering you ?
looks like my exam went really wel .
thanks again fo the tapes .
why not
should we go some place ?
i have to finish this
do n't worry
are you mad at me ?
i did n't mean it exactly that way .
i am wat i am
here they are , 40 hungry racers , ready to ive their best shot ...
a few names stand out as promising
how 's it going ?
an you ?
busy as hell .
is the national team al settled ?
one man missing .
my guy will settle it on the road
keep an eye on this promising rider , only 19 years old
oona !
come on chain mates !
we 're doing great ime
any drink left 
lf i had , i would n't give you any
thanks
they 're coming !
k !
just go !
will you be all right ?
i 'm glad to see you eating again .
why am i packaged up like this ?
that 's why you 've got to keep stil
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a good chance of recovery
you can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spinal shock , as the doctors believe- you should be moving your legs in a month 's time
but you 'll never become a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a relief
i told the i 'd ask you first
we 're in a hurry
hi !
never seen parallel bars this long
i asked the staff to set them up
i left it to the very last moment , but i came anyway
with the under twenty-three national team
congratulations
i would n't have made it without you .
just tank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages
i 'm glad you made it
i thin oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can maage on my own .
certainly not
ey , why do n't you leave
will you just get lost !
it 's coming along
but they wo n't let me cycle for a year
strage how distances take twice as long as they used to
i passed the exam .
by the skin of my teeth .
congratulations
it must have been the sure bet
do n't you rememer ?
seemingly lackin a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly ...
unexxc ... unexpectedly .
unexpetedly
i want to apologize
i really did n't treat you right
that was then
just about to do it
a socket shock
and suddenly socked him into a real cerebral high
growing his ind into the kind
and a smile upon his face
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
totally together computer in tenis shoes
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
that turned-on , uptight , flat out-ofsight
totally together computer in tennis shoes

dean higgins , today , a computer can hardly be considered a luxury .
oh , very well .
now , unfortunately ,
medfield has quite a lon list of necessities , and a coputer just does not have a very high priority o that list .
now , it 's not tha i 'm old-fashioned .
you all know that i have an open ear for progress , and we do all that we can .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we went to he expense of live frogs .
we 're ot dragging our feet , quigley .
why , i just put an order in today for two garbage disosals and an electric dishwasher
anyting yet , bradley ?
how 's he doing ?
yeah , that figures .
thanks .
you just do n't understand the problem .
do you know what the telephone bill alone is here every month ?
i do n't want to hear about state .
yeah , but do you realize that they gie an entire course in computer technolog ?
now , i do n't like to draw comparisons , gentlemen , but if we want to keep abreast of the times and raise our academic average ,
we have got to modernize .
modernization is n't everything .
yes , uh , regent dees .
thank you ver much .
gentlemen , i , uh , i would n't like this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are down to the nitty-gritty on our budget .
why , we raffled off everything on the campus but the women 's gym .
it 's toug , tough , tough .
unrest .
oh , uh , that part about the unrest , that 's  uh , that 's off the record , mrs. winifred .
so , quigley , i 'm sorry , but i 'm ertai that you unerstand our problem .
that 's it .
now , for the next item on the agenda ...
us .
well-put , dean .
leonard ...
the not-so-gifted students ' needs are just as great as those of the gifted ones .
now , um , quigley , we do have certain ne'er-do-wells that must be seen to .
probation is no substitute for catching the iterest of the student , for firing his imagination .
come on , quig .
thattaboy .
john colligan , roger demney ,
henry fatinger ,
... myles harris ,
adam jervins ,
keith richards , dexter reilly ...
dexter , it 's not funny .
... robert ross ,
sliver roth .
he went through all the s 's .
hey , that 's right .
oh , yes  of course .
richard schuyler .
he 's sick .
you know , quig really cares , but the guy ca n't even reason with him .
well , swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive higgins right over the edge .
you guys must be dreaming .
the uy who 's selling i wants 10 grand .
a.j .
arno .
i mean , i think if we went down there and talked to him , we could get him to donate it to he college .
well , i do n't now about that .
dexter , you just cleaned up at night .
arno would n't even remember you .
kind of .
you know , that 's not too bad an idea .
no trouble at all , wexler .
i mean , i love that school .
well , believe me , if i did n't give them all that money ,
no .
aybe i can work something out .
look , just give me a little time , huh ?
you know , i like you kids .
i like the idea of a student delegation coming to see me .
makes me feel good ...
thanks .
goodbye .
goodbye , boys .
thanks a lot for giving us your time , mr. arno .
well , a.j .
arno never forgets an old employee .
um  it 's ... it 's dexter .
ah , yes , dexter .
yeah , just about , sir .
all right .
hey , they did pretty good with the horses .
750 is n't bad .
hat crap table figure okay ?
looks like a real good day for applejack .
yeah , real good .
inidentally , do n't send that 20 grand to medfield .
do n't you think ...
do n't worry about it .
146 , right .
easy through the door , you guys .
easy .
right in there .
number 125 .
take it easy .
what a slave driver .
eah , if he 'd been in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they 'd have made it .
you know , it 's a great idea doing something for the school , but next time let 's do something easy , like hijacking a cuban airliner .
yeah .
professor , can we just take a few seconds off ?
oh , sure 
take as much time as you want .
uh , dexter , there 's a box of tools in the back of my car .
would you get that for me , please ?
sure .
right away , professor .
goo morning , dean .
good morning , dean 
hi , deano .
oh , hello , there , dean higgins .
of course , we 're no really set up here yet , but very soon .
well , that 's wonderful .
i see .
and you will understand
we must withhold our yearly cash contibution .
yours in the interest of higher education , a.j 
arno.
you can say that again .
and i 'm gon na tell you this much , quigley ... in the future , i 'm gon na be watching them .
but you ca n't blame the boys , sir .
oh , good faith  bad faith , who cares ?
they 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
we still have the computer .
you know , i do 't like to brag , but if it had n't been for the fact that i used to work there ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmetic and logic , and output .
and , uh , even though it 's an imitation , in many ways , the machine we 've developed can operate more efficiently than we can ourselves .
now , in the past couple of weeks ,
i 've been , uh , working on a small expeiment , uh , which is intended to show how we can be replaced by a computer .
hey ... this may be a way of getting rid of dean higgins .
we live in hope , dexter .
now , let 's suppose that your parents are going away for the weeend , and they leave you the following instructions ...
all right ?
and being the conscientious and reliable young people
i know ou to be , you promptly forget to do it .
now , this is a rain auge , and it 's , uh , sitting on a roof of a building .
the memory bank , in turn , activates the electronic circuits , the window closes , the door opens ... hopefully the cat comes in ... and the automatic telephone goes into action , right ?
he rain ... alls .
omputerized male voice :
this is s recordig .
hmm .
that 's enough of that .
thak you .
now , another very important feature is its infallible memory .
an they were kind enough to send us this magnetic tape , which will call forth from the computer solutions to a series of problems that would occur on a simulated flight to the planet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center panel , please .
hey , quig .
hey .
well , it seems like our flight to saturn will be a little delayed .
this is dean higgins .
now , as many of you know , we came in 36th last year .
i do n't know .
what happened , professor ?
it , uh , should be replaced , but i ca n't get over to capital electronics today .
oh , that 's okay .
i ve got nothing to do .
oh , yeah , but i know all tha stuff .
cas and buses going from place to lace .
one guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes .
i got it all , prof .
yes , i 'm sure you do have it al , dexter , but if i were ou , i would look it over again this afternoon .
aw , honest , professor .
it woul n't do any good .
i 'm up to here with it .
let me go to marshfield .
believe me , the drive and fresh air will do me good .
it could n't be a .
the answer to the last two questions was a .
would never have three a 's in a row .
it 's got ta be b or c .
i have n't seen a c for a long time .
got to be c .
that 's three a 's in a row .
that ' impossible .
3 at 8-02-30 .
applejack pompey palace ,
dexter ?
dexter , are you okay ?
nah , you were beeping .
burping ?
no , beeping .
w ... nothing .
well , thee must be a short in it somewhere .
i had to call in these coputer people .
well , move along , boys .
now , ladies and gentlemen , this is a spee test .
an that means if you have trouble with any question , skip it and move on to the next one because you 'll be graded on the total number of questions you answer correctly .
you may begin .
dexter , come on .
funny guy .
i tell you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a doctor .
that 's ridiculous .
he did 't cheat , dean iggins .
now , we usually alow an hour and a half for that test .
dexter finished it in 41/2 minutes , and he did n' make a mistake .
man :
yes .
listen , at this rate , you 're gon na faint in front of all hose people .
dexter , it is n't that easy .
things are ' the same .
you have a responsibility now .
yeah .
yeah .
do 't worry about it , man 
there are goin to be 37 million viewers , quiley .
no question .
oh , mayor collins .
nice to see you , mayor .
ha !
it 's the maor .
i tell you , quigley ,
ha !
mayor collins and there 's councilman cooper over there and supervisor straight and there 's , uh , oh , he 's not anything .
hello , dean !
what 's he doing here ?
well , i do n't like it .
every time i see him , i have to hear about his building progra .
it 's enough o make you ick .
helo .
i 've been hearing great thigs .
well , you know , at medfield , the sholastic ...
nice to see you .
i would have gotten over here sooner , but i 've been tied up planning our new science building .
you know , quigley , sometimes i think i shoud have taken up cotracting instead of education .
no 
i-i mean , he 's all booked up .
uh-huh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies and gentlemen .
oh , i 'd better take my seat .
i 've bee invited to sit in the control room .
in the control room .
i tell you , he ' trying to steal that boy away from us .
i 'm sure of it .
you do n't understand him , quigley .
the man is greedy .
he 's up to his throat in state money , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each of our learned guests will be allowed 3 questions .
our first questions will be from dr. rufus schmidt , head of he department of higher mathematics at purdue university .
dr. schmidt .
well , i ...
i , uh , i guess i am .
i see .
mr. reilly , using the fundamental teoem of advanced calculus , and applying the formula that the square of a distance from the origin to 
is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared .
you see ?
he 's getting his confidence .
your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 o the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 .
the square root of that product would be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct 
hey .
man :
i must say , that was really something .
yes , i suppose it was , but would n't it speed things up a bit if we could save the aplause till te en ?
yes , uh , i 'm sure the audience would be glad to comply .
good .
your third uestion  dr. schmidt .
gentlemen , please .
i hope you 're aware that i 'm perfectly equipped to go into other fields .
of course .
uh , perhaps now e could hear rom , uh , dr. seige , professor of foreign languages at lansing university .
getting his confidence is one thing , but this is ridiculous .
i liked him better the way he wa .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
we 're awaiting the arival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
it promises to be exciting , so stay with us as our cameras follow dexter reilly on his journey through gotham .
there 's been s buzz of excitemet around te big city this past week , ladie and gentlemen .
eveywhere you go , you hear the same question ... is dexter reilly for real ?

and there he is !
well ...
uh , mr. reilly 's beig greete by two young ladies ho came all the way fom yonkers just to greet him .
this is priscilla cummings ...
queen of the yonkers botanical society ,
i always knew if he had any brains , he 'd be dangerous .
look , i know dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind of understandable .
look at that crowd , quigley .
what a boon for the college .
why coud n't the boy have been carrying a mefield pennant ?
do n' you think that would have been pushing it a little , sir ?
yes ?
from universal encyclopedias .
oh , tell him we already have a set .
e 's no salesman , sir .
he 's the president of universal encyclopedia .
the president ?
sure .
the quiz program where they ask the questions from the enyclopedia  and they give away $ 100,000 ?
it 's a real pleasure .
thank you .
who are you ?
who am ...
that 's good .
i like that .
who am i ?
and i like that set of encyclopedias of yours .
displaying again his emarkable intellectual prowess ,
dexter reilly was able to converse with each delegate to the u.n. in his own tongue .
they 're waiting for him in the security council .
earlier today , dr. suzuki o the iternational school of languages stated that with s computer-type brain such as dexte reilly has , he 'll soon be able to master every language the world has ever known .
i think he 's gien s good indication of hat today .
professor mertins , we need that boy .
he can wra up that college knowlede program for us .
of course , but we ca nt take any chances .
parsons ?
uhh , just a minute , quigley .
tremendous .
well , t-this is rather important , sir .
it 's about the college knowledge program .
dexter will chew up hose encyclopedias .
it seems that mr. van dyke is explaining the operation to the boy wonder .
only maybe we o n't have dexter .
what ?
find out when his plane arrives !
quigle , how could ou let this happen ?
the firs operation of cutting the diamond in two exact halves is the most important .

you know , i do n't understand you .
i never once met a guy who could pick eight races in a row , neer .
dexter , you and me could have the world at our eet here .
collingsgood :
you just want him for that college knowledge program , and you know it .
you know ... everyone 's just out for himself .
oh , you mean those guys ?
who are you thinking of , mr. walski ?

what are friends for ?
i 'd just like to say that i 'm sorry .
come on .
what are friends for , man ?
annie ...
that 's okay .
come on , let 's go .
that 's fantastic .
you did the s s in ...
8 minutes and 18 seconds .
that beat the r 's by 91/2 seconds .
an there were 1,200 pages in the s s and only 1,000 in the r 's .
i picked up 22.68 % .
i 'll get it .
is dexter here ?
yeah  e 's just boning up
for the college knowledge program .
time .
page 4 , paragraph 16 , line 398 , word 4,001 .
hi , professor .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't mean to interrupt anything .
yes .
well , it 's just , uh , a little thing , dexter .
it , uh , seems that we need , uh , three more members for the panel .
i see .
well , you know me , quigley , i 'm not a proud man .
if , uh , exter does n't like my suggestions , then he can have anybody he wants .
who does he want ?
hm .
schuyler , henry , and myles .
schuyler , henr , and myles ?
and i 'm afraid that if we tried o force anyone else on him , he might ...
y
i mean , we want to keep that boy happy .
but schuyler , henry , and myles .
but the answer to part one is the battle of thermopyae ,
well , lockhurst has answered two parts out of three correctly .
okay , schuyler , you answer this one .
what ?
it does 't look good if i answer all the questions .
phidias , who did a statue of athena , and praxiteles , who specialized in human figures , then there was myron , who sculpted the figure of a discus-thrower , kind of like the best thing he ever done .
okay .
you got it ?
gentlemen , you have 20 seconds .
i think i misunderstood the question , sir 
w
who 's that guy , merlin ?
no merlin , myron .
gentlemen , your time is almost u .
i think i misunderstood the answer , sir .
you did ?
that 's the last time i 'll do that .
we have time for one more question directed to ou medfield panel .
gentlemen , these are the works of the famous marcel duchap as found in the collection o the philadelphia museum of art .
thank you , iss ackerman .
number one is caled portrait of chess players.
it was painted in 1911 .
and number three is called
that 's right on the button .
very good .
that answer is absolutely correct .
so until then , good night to you from universal encyclopedia , your passport to knowledge .
you guys were great .
we re gon na win .
a nude descending a staircae.
boy , that 'd never mae playboy .
oh , dean colingsgood , nice to see you .
you 're scouting , i imagine .
and i would like to say right at the beginning ,
if you had an ounce on integrity , you 'd withdraw him .
withdraw whom ?
it 's unfair .
he ' an intellectual freak !
unfortunately , this year , medfield has e horses .
are those the horses ?
for 10 points each , could you give us the highest and lowest points in south america ?
the highest point is mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feet .
that is absolutely correct .
hey , i di n't try to get him arrested , you know .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon na be a raid ?
i want o hear this .
some of that consumption was in the liquid form .
ca you give the phrase in slang for he central unfrozen portion in a containe of frozen cider ?
tha s absolutely right .
applejack .
ey , boss , i ad nothin ' to do with this .
i swear .
what was i talking abou ?
mr. arno , if you could please relax for just a litle ...
out , out .
but ...
this is applejack .
i do n't want a trace of that opeation left .
shut down 
why ?
what 's the mater ?
whatever you say .
we got ta put tat kid on ice .
look , we need time to figure this out .
hello ?
i want the pompey palace on franklin road in charlottesvile .
yeah .
you know , if that kid ad n't been stopped , he 'd have mentioned every joint i own in this state .
take him out to the hancock place .
right .
no , i do n't know the area code .
helo , dexter .
go ahead .
start the car .
you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happene , lieutenan .
he was suposed to be at my ouse about 8:30 last night , and he never showed up .
and nobody 's seen him since .
well , we 've cheked all over .
he has n't been in an accident nor has he been arrested .
ieutenant , i wonder if he could have had an attack of amnesia .
could be miles away by now .
mm-hmm .
i 've alerted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his car .
and if they do n't pick him up pretty soon , then i 'm afraid we 'll have to suspect foul play .
foul pla , huh ?
well , that 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean colingsgood over at state ?
oh , do n't you see it , quigley ?
i mean , if dexter i nt back tomorrow for that college knowledge program , then springfield tate will get the $ 100,000 grant 
uh , wait a minute .
wait a inute .
the dean of a college , a kidappe ?
well , you do n't know him .
you do n't know him at all .
the man is ruthless .
he gets all that taxpayers ' mone and still he 's rutess .
y
yeah .
i see .
i guess that 'll be all for now .
pete ...
i just do n't think
animals 740 , tables 600 , amusements 500 .
applejack , charlie ...
gee , all those places and always applejack.
he did n't have the foggiest idea what they were .
maybe it does n't mean anything .
then all of a sudden , he mentions applejack , and wham !
just like tha , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses through a book on an oriental language , and then speaks it fuently , remembering every accent .
how come he does n't remember this ?
pete , it does n't make sense .
unless ... unless he 'd never read it or seen it or heard it before .
it was in the computer .
and now he burts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missing .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack .
... for something , something he does n't want anybody to know about .
hi .
i do n't care who believes it , just as long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell them if they look up these places , they 're gon na find out what applejack is up to .
and the reason why we know applejack is arno is 'cause it came from the computer into dexter 's head .
and that 's why dexter does n't remember it .
come on .
that 's wy pete remembered that applejack was arno .
arno ?
yeah , because it was the only thing he could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered .
because he could n' ?
exactly .

chad dylan cooper , dancing , nine-year-old girl .

yes .
yes , we till do it .
we paint everything ... the jaguar , the fish .
only after five days ... .
first we put paint ... the charcoal .
about four or five days old .
yes , i did .
i do n't remember , it was too long ago .
kuberene was kind of a sad boy , but a good person .
one was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had families .
it leads o suffering , pain , danger and death !
we do n't have ... any writen education ... we get our knowledge from our parents and families .
they teach us about our destiny , about beig an indian .. being a human being , and about life 
if we do n't respect our elders ... we 'll be lost .
during the republic they tried ... to cage us into whites overnight .
we were confused ... not knowing how to live in this new situation ... and after the years ... of white ma 's civilization ... we have to defend ourselves .
ut how ?
we 'll see if we will have to opeate .
we teach our children to read .
we want to learn only the good thigs from the whites .
that 's why we teach our children , so that wo n't happen .
yes .
i liked it very much , i was very happy .
i have missed him a lot since i lost him .
and now , when i saw him ...
i was very happy indeed .
i 've been feeling so sad ... and this was great for me .
it was great to see him alive .
when i saw him moving ...
he was steering the anoe .
the water was very low .
when the canoe passed over a crocodile ... it went crazy and attaked my father ... right at his neck .
in this village ... a lot of things have changed since your last visit .
but for me the saddest thing is that i 've lost my husband .
i miss the safety he gave me .
i reember long ago , one night he came into my hut ... and the nex morning we were husband and wife .
he was a very good person , very kind and hard working .

look , over there .
holy smurf , look at these berries .
good !
hey there , lazy !
hey !
one !
oh , i had no clue .
no one tells me anyting .
there we go .
smurfy hollow ?
the very notion of a headless horseman ...
the other smurfs do n't know how to think these things trough .
just one more bucket , then i 'm going home !
what was that ?
must have been a dead tree branch .
i 's quite common in windy conditions .
just elax , brainy 
no !
i 'm the headless horseman !
it ca n't be !
it worked !
it 's a berry bonanza !
whose meal will be clanking ' now ?
that 's right , little smurfberry !
brainy ?
oh , do n't you wor , he 'l be fine .
my glasses !
it definitely smurfed me to safety .
all right , smurfs !
lazy , how many smurfberries did you get ?
and what did you get , vanity ?
even handsomer ...
hey !
you again !
stop it !
not my cornucopia .
and you , greedy ?
brainy !
you 've outdone yourself this year !
think again , papa .
gutsy ?
ho do you lie them smurfberries ?
well , this is unexpected .
cosmurfulations , gutsy !
this is unbelievable .
and how about a victory dance ?
gutsy !
thank you !
like what ?
where 's brainy ?
that 's very strange indeed .
do you think he got lost ?
what if he fell in a ditch ?
maybe a legless weasel got him .
you know what , i think i might have spotted brainy in the woods earlier .
see you .
oh , for smurf 's sake , why did he have to run away like that ?
come on , brainy !
ey , what are you doing here , lass ?
i thought i 'd help you look for brain .
where 'd you see him , exactly ?
by smurfy rock ?
more ...
stop grilling me , woman !
i ca n't take it anymore !
it was just a wee little prank , that 's all .
it may have involved a fake headless horseman ...
what ?
i never should have gotten out of bed this morning ...
oh , my smurf , brainy !
well , i 'm trapped 30 feet in the air in a sinister gargamelian cage .
yes , come on , come on .
let ' get him down from there and get out of this creepy foret .
yes , a classic gargael tactic is to set additional traps aound ..
we do n't have time to overthink this !
utsy !
not in smurfy hollow 
i hate to further complicate things , guys , but the headless horseman is out there .
searching .
without senses .
i know it defies all rational explanations .
gutsy ?
okay , fine .
it 's not all my faul !
oh , boy .
what are we going to do ?
i have an idea .
but it 's gon a take guts and brains .
do you think you two could work together ?
two drops would be bad .
three drops ...
ca n't you see that i 'm working ?
get off of me , you frenzied feline !
what did you say ?
how many ?
three !
i do n't know where they are .
gutsy , do you ave enough momentum ?
aye , smurfette !
i 'm giving it all she 's ot .
yes !
gutsy , it 's crucial that you shift your weigh at exactly t minus zero .
it 's also making me sick !
brace yourselves !
oh , no , smurfette is still up there !
it 's okay .
we still have time before garamel shows up .
azrael !
hello , smurfs !
wait .
you know , there 's this magical new device called a toothbrush !
hey , gargasmell !
now 's your chance !
stop !
i 'm horribly ticklish !
what do we do ?
i think we might be done here .
goodbye !
it was a honor smurfing with you .
what ?
headless !
crikey !
he really does exist !
wizards and childen first !
we 're doomed !
since when do you believe in legends ?
since they started chasing me with flaming pumpkins ...
so you 're saying ...
lf we can get to the bridge , we 're safe !
brilliant !
you 're a genius !
yes , we will !
but we need better transportation !
climb aboard the red-eye !
we did it !
azrael , look at that !
he ca n't exit the hollow !
azrael !
get off of me !
let go , you foul furball !
what is a water-ball ?
azrael , are you dead ?
that 's nice ad all but i think brainy should have it .
i just want to say i 'm sorry .
for scaring you like tha and all .
i tried so hard every year , and you always won .
i 'm sorry , oo .
seems to me , laddy , that we let winning a medal get in the way of what 's really important here .
that 's true .
see , you guys , when the two of you help each other , well , that 's what famiy is all about .
negative , i have not exacly been plaing fair .
no , come on now , lad !
no , you won .
you should have it .
you take it !
no , it has to be you !
no , it has to be you !
just take it !
lazy ?
i win !
exhausting !
i love this wee little lad !
too much momentum !
very nice .
good job getting them home safe .
i gues i should change you back now .
you must be hungry .
okay , let 's go find vanity 's hat .
so the headless horseman was a goat ?
just to set the record straight ,
really ?
not even one little ...
hold me !
it 's just a bat , hefty

except for the activity up in the hayloft , the farm was pretty quiet that morning .
they could sleep through anythin .
but a lot of the other animals were awakened by all tat currying overhead .
some of them just accepted it .
some were pretty annoyed .
but the mood was ver different up in the hayloft .
she was determined to be a good mother and never yell at her ittens .
but that approach would not last very long , because milo , one of her kittens , was trouble from the very beginning .
milo , dear , his mother sai , that 's not a good idea 
come back here , milo !
you 're a strange-looking cat , milo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , all riht , a dog .
but , um , really , deep down inside  we 're all cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barked .
the kittens were now bi enough to leave the hayloft and ee the world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was te first to start calling out for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to milo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down there is the river .
everyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
milo asked .
is this ?
oh !
ah !
milo , get back ere , his mother demanded .
but milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo meowed .
i think so , milo said .
all right , be careful , his mother ordered , and began swimming .
all right .
i 'm not going to yell , his mother said .
now dry yourself off , like this :
and follow me back home .
that as fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
get over here !
the months passed , and the farm was humming with the sounds of summer .
milo had some ne hiding places he could n't wait to try out .
otis sniffed around the yard for a while .
you 're in the pipe , milo .
try again .
cat 's in the can 
and milo slipped off to another hiding place .
it was n't easy fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tried a harder spot .
but otis found him there too .
now milo needed a briliat idea .
aha .
he thought o a place where otis could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but milo wondered if it was really worth the trouble .
milo and otis went to see what all the commotion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rang out :
and all the hens left in a clucking flurry because that was loria talking , a young chicken who had scrathed and pecke her way to the top rung of the henhouse .
gloria had a goo reason for wanting to be aloe .
there it is , fellas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it finally happened .
is she staying at home with it or is she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kick it back to you , otis ?
milo asked .
otis said .
i kicked it by accident .
gloria gave us a job o do .
how long do we have to stick around this henhouse ?
until gloria comes back .
maybe you do n't realize it , milo , but this is a major day for me because ...
well , maybe you o n't realize that this is the day i 've become a watchdog .
some strange noises brought milo out of the henhouse .
what was al his about ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
come here , otis , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , come on .
at that moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog croaked .
and outside , milo and otis suddenly remembered :
ah 
the egg !
otis growled .
just try something .
probably rotten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird animal .
the noise attracted a group of local noop looking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're having a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your mommy ' a chicken .
the other animals told otis he 'd eter take the chick to gloria , and quickly , which he did .
but the chick kept coming back to otis .
now go back to gloria .
do you understand ?
woof , the chick peeped .
woof , woo , mommy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you 've got to be a rough , tough , mean , fighting dog , like this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it a try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss him .
come on , said milo .
phew .
wow , look at this thing , otis , milo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle the sore with that --
that , uh , thing .
ha , ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up , otis !
maybe milo was havin a terrific time , but otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe he could jump off the bridge into the box if he hurried .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god 
but that did n't work either .
otis just could n't swim fast enough and the river took milo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost sight of ois .
suddenly he heard something moving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo ried to duck lo in the box so the bear would n't see him .
but the bo was drifting right towards the hungry animal .
but unfortunately much too soon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
the ame otis .
hat bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the riverbank , leading the bear away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he was getting a little concerned because the river was beginning to move faster ... and faster .
he 'd lost track of otis now , and he was drifting father and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the forest .
and he heard mysterious hoots and growls and cries in he night .
he began to wish he 'd ever jumped into this box and he began to wih he was home .
it seemed to be trembling as uch as he was in he chilly , misty night .
he drifted on through the darkness , oping to find the morning waiting just around the bend .
when daylight came ,
milo saw a farm on he riverbank .
for one happy momen , he thought he was home and cried out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't know when he would ever see i again .
here coes the dog your life he -- ♪♪
the deadwood swap .
a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves or banche , and where no creature could live , except for the dreaded deadwood birds .
and one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat .
cat so sad , the bird croake .
look in the box .
otis prepared himsel and peeked in the box and saw only a solitary black feather .
in fact , milo was nowhere near the deadwood swamp .
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as quickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
te ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow where he saw a kind of animal he 'd never seen before .
feeling pretty hungry , he immediately wondered ,
is that something you can eat ?
heh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful , milo thought .
and above all , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch where he figured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah , here , my precious muskrat .
you should be safe there till dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fo run over the hoizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on a big , tasty muskrat lunch .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through the wetands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered there wa one magic word everyoe understood and that was please .
so he marched up to a clam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds were getting darker and darker and a chilly wind was whipping across the countryside .
milo was several miles from te beach aught in the same storm .
he got a little wet and he felt awfully lonesome without otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide came in so fast that the rock otis had been sitting on was completely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd never be able to swim to shore .
and the water was growing higher .
now the water was up to his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim 
he took a deep breath , but just when he was ready o dive in ...
oh , not again , the sea turtle gurgled .
every time the tide comes in some fool gets stuck out here .
otis was n't sure what this turtle wanted .
well , now you know .
now , just stay on the shoe , where you elong , the turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
next time the tide comes in , i 'll hae to rescue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , aid otis , i did n't know that .
eh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otis called out , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
i have n't got time , otis said , sensing this fox was n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis was outraged .
ha !
he marveled at this road made of woo and iron and decided to follow the road and see where it would take him .
it could 've run rigt over me .
but milo was determied .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm not sure cats know how to bound , milo said .
bound and leap , like a ephyr set free .
boud and , of course , leap .
it just does n't look right when i do it .
frolic with me , friend .
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frolicking .
i 'm frolicking .
you see ?
ahem .
you can stop frolicking now , the deer cooed .
i think i 'm a little tuckered out , milo said .
yes , it is possible to over-frolic , the deer murmured .
and the deer took milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trailed milo from the deadwood swamp o the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the friend he missed so much .
but now , it was the end of a long ay of hard traveling .
as evening was falling ,
milo decided the safest place to spend the night woul be in a tree .
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest belong to you ?
yes , and it 's not just any nest , i ll have you know .
i 'm the night bird , and that is a dreaming nest 
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone sleeping there will have his sleep flooded with dreams , he bid said .
but it 's a safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... we 'd think of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
whoo !
all right .

well , tere 's nothing unique in that .
we all have mood .
in fac , a modern writer has said ... that inside every fat man ... a thin man is struggling to get out .
well , in a literal and terrifying sense ... inside this deure young woman ... two very vivid and different personalities ... were battling for the mastery of her character .
now , their account of the case was delivered ... to the american psychiatric association in 1953 ... and it 's already a classic of psychiatric literature .
the date is august 20 , 1951 .
you all right ?
come in .
mrs. white ?
sit here , will you ?
thank you .
thank you .
how long have you known him ?
he 's the doctor we go to .
he 's a very able man , very able .
wha kind of spell ?
why , i do n't know .
i 'm not exactly sure .
well , what hapens when you have one ?
is it what they say , amnesia ?
well , amnesia means loss of memory .
is that what happens to you ?
how often does this happen ?
same thing .
yes , sir .
first i get this terrible headache ... and then i get this spell .
no , sir .
i 's more like ...
i was playin ' out in the backyard with bonnie ... and all of a sudden i got this splitting ' headache ... and then the next thing i knew ...
i mean , the next thing i was conscious of , it was the next mornin ' .
that 's my little gir .
how old is she ?
she 's four and a half .
your only child ?
i see .
yes ?
i guess not ... nothing you could say was really diffeent .
narator :
for several weeks , mrs. white was greatly helped by the psychiatric treatment .
she had no ore blackout spells ... at least none that she was aware of ... but not quite a year later , seeral things hapened ... that showed her to be in urgent need of help .
this one hurs .
where 'd you get these ?
they 're mommy 's .
mommy !
mommy !
well , did n't you buy 'em ?
i thought it was sweet , but i ...
you kno i would nt buy anything like that , ralh .
that 's wat i mean , that costs that much .
where 'd they get your name ?
i do n't know .
i thought you did it .
well , i 'll say it 's too much .
well , i 'll call 'em 
woman :
is this miss effie ?
who is this ?
this is ralph white , miss effie .
i thought ou and evie would be on your way to hollywood by now .
hollywood ?
with all those pretty things evie bought .
you ought to be mighty proud of her ... the way she looks in those dresses , especially that lila one .
i said to mr. gilmore ...
come on in , honey , and wash your hands .
tell her i 'll call her .
never mind , honey .
i 'll call you when we 're ready .
come here .
will you come here ?
what did they say ?
i do n't know what you 're talkin ' about .
will you stop that lying ?
nothing ?
se did nt say nothing else .
i do n't see how she could 'cause i did n't .
you mean to tell me you did n't go into the beehive and try on those dresses for miss effie ?
they gon na take 'em back ?
ou 're not kidding they ll take them back .
no , i 'll do it .
you better let me .

will you let me talk to her alone for a ew miutes ?
we 'll just be a few minutes .
that 's not true , what he said .
what 's not true ?
i have n't been to atlanta in nearly a year .
well , that 's what i mean .
why do you think he says things like that if they re not true ?
i thought of one .
you mean , by divorce ?
but you 're not positive ?
well , i could n't be positive of anything this quicly ... ut the act you ma be having spells of amnesia ... does n't mean that you 're , what you call , losi your mind .
does n't mean that at all .
it 's no use .. 'cause i am .
you do n't wan na tell me , but i know it now .
because now i 'm hearing voices too .
what kind of voices ?
just one voice , but that 's what that means , does n't it ?
for months .
what does this voice say to you ?
a woman 's voice ?
can you recognize it in any way ?
it sounds amiliar sometimes ... but i do n't really ecognize it .
to do things like ... leave ralph ... take bonnie and run away .
that is what it means , is n't it ?
you 've been frightened by this voice ... because you recognize it as a syptom of illness .
does n't make any difference .
you just do n't wan na tell me , but it does .
feeling better now ?
i did n't have no headache .
she had one , but i did n't .
she ?
i think she 's a rea dope , do n't you ?

i thik you better turn around , hough .
you 're kind of cute , but i do n't think i know you that well .
mabe sometime , though , huh ?
hey , you like to go dancin ' ?
would ou like to go dancin ' with me ?
so , you 're not eve white ?
you ean that was your maiden name .
that 's still my name .
ot while i 'm in my right mind she is n't .
hey !
we could get out of here without him seeing us .
wil you ecuse me for a moment ?
i 'll be right back .
it 's up too high .
excuse me .
i 'll be righ back 
is that her ?
but i can tell you this ...
whom do you suspect ?
mrs. white .
mrs. eve white 
everything all right ?

how do you do , miss black ?
how do you do ?
oh , no .
the more there ae , the better i like 'em .
and you sa you are not mrs. white now ?
i 'm not mrs. white .
then how does it happen that you remember meeting me ?
she just tells herself she does 'cause she thinks she ought to .
take the kid if she want her and beat it .
i ai n't gon na go through the rest of my life with ha creep .
and you say that bonnie 's not our child .
you mean , ralph never made love to you ?
do n't you have any fans in this office ?
it 's hot in here .
i o , indeed .
i 'm gon na come out , and i 'm gon na stay out .
where ?
the big apple .
you ever been there ?
every time i go in there , they ask me to stand up and sing .
what kind of mood 
i have to have a couple snorts first .
can you come out , as you call it , whenever you want to ?
sometimes i can , but sometimes i ca n't 
sure .
you know what i doe one night ?
you kno what i done the next morning ?
she 's faking .
listen , mrs. white ...
i regret to have to say this ... but i ...
hello , doctor .
mrs. white ?
every moment lightly shaken ...
ran itself in golden sands .
that , trembling , passed in music out of sight .
that 's beautiful .
i just like to read it anyway .
would you like to read this one ?
dear beauteous death ..
morning .
good morning , doctor .
how 's it going ?
yes , she realy does .
thank you .
what about bonnie ?
would you say that your marriage , speaking of it as a whole ... has been a happy one ?
no , sir .
well , some of it , but ot as a whole .
i do n't know .
i guess i just have n't been able to make him happy .
have you ever had the feeling tha somewhere ... deep down inside you ... there might be somebody you could n't quite reach ... but that you nevertheless knew was there ?
no , sir .
good night , doctor .
good night , madge .
hey .
got a cigarette ?
you know the rules .
come o .
no .
yes ?
it 's about mrs white .
yes ?
can you contro your emergence ?
says which ?
i 'm tired of this lace .
it 's a nuthoue , ai n't it ?
you do n't see any bars or anything like that , do you ?
is she crazy ?
i do n't know wha i have to do with it .
i 'm a doctor .
you 're cute , you know that ?
listen , eve ...
hey , look , why do n't you and i go out an have some fun ?
i can slip on somethin ' .
do you wan na be shut up in one of these places for life ... one with bars ?
wha do you mean ?
i mean simply this ...
if you try anything like that , if you get into any trouble at all .. it 'll be mrs. white that 'll be adjudged crazy ... but both of you 'll be locked up .
you 'e not gon na be subdivided by any court or board i 've heard o yet .
an asylu , with loced doors and bars and straitjackets !
i guess so .
even if i do n't come out , what do you figure to do about it ?
nobody knows too much about this ... because there have n't been too many such cases ... ut for a starter ...
i hink i 'd like to tell eve white about you .
do you object ?
i 'd say the first logical step to take in that direction ... would be to introduce them to each other , would n't you ?
introduce em ?
i do n't have to put on much .
let 's go on out and have a little fun .
i do n't underst ...
a little oe .
narraor :

that 's wat i wanted to talk to you about .
yes , sir .
have you ever head of that ?
no , sir .
well , what actualy happes is this ...
in effect , she 's now two different women ... entirely different in character .
to be more specific about it ... the girl you married , bonnie 's mother ... sweet , quiet girl you fell in love with , that 's one o he women .
the other is the one that scared bonie , the one who bought all the clothe ... the one that had that row with you i atlanta .
you know those headaches and blackout spells ?
yes , sir .

during those two weeks , ralph had left their daughter bonnie ... with the grandparents and found for himself a better job ... in jacksonville , florida ... but mrs. white was not to go with im ... for , on the advice of dr. luther ... she decided to stay in town in a furnished room ... for further and more regular treatment .
i might as well get started , i guess .
ralph , i 'm awful sorry .
you could n't help it .
breaking up everything like this .
well , he can get you wel , ca n't he ?
i hope so .
did n't he say ?
did n't he say aything ?
well , i think he will , honey .

they like to make a big thing out of it ... so 's they 'll look better when they knock it off .
the only trouble , though , i sure am gon na miss bonnie .
well , she s okay .
our folks will take care of her all right .
yeah , but if i do n't get wel , i might never see her again .
of course you 're gon na see her again ... 'cause you ae go na get well .
i mean , you ai n't really crazy , you know .
he said there was n't a thing in the world the matter with you ... except his multiplied personality ... and that ai n't anywhere near crazy .
you gon na stop worrying now ?
you do that , and you 'll be all right .
good- bye , honey .
i 'm gon na get a job .
so , what 's stopping you ?
stand back , big daddy 
wait a minute .

let 's get out of here .

ae you crazy or something ?
i did n't buy you all these drins for nothing .
oh , no , ou wo n't .
i do n't like to get hurt .
you know how much i shelled out on you already ?
when i spend eight bucks on a chick , i do n't just go home with the morning paper .
so let 's not have any more arguments about it .
maybe he 's sick .
ah , for the love of ...
i 'll bet she was gad to see you .
i wanted to surprise you .
m. foxx , would you excuse us , please 
certainly , ma'am .
i 'm not well yet .
who says ou ai n't ?
dr. luther .
i know it 's true .
i did n't know about it .
i did n't know about it .
ou knew enough to go out there and get ginned up .
you was well enough for that .
a fella i know saw you out tere twice ... tight as a tick and dacin ' , throwing your dress up , you did n't care how far !
he even showed you .
look , i do n't know which one of you is fooling ' , you or him , but somebody is .
'cause you know what i 've been doin ' ?
you know what they said ?
okay , then let it be somethin ' in jacksonville then .
if i do n't chec out of dixie motel by 10:00 ... the 'll charge me for another six hours .
ralph , i wo n't leave here until i 'm well agai ... not till i have bonnie back with me .
we 'll get bonnie .
we 'll go up there and take her wit us .
she scared he .
will you cut that ou ?
then i 'm not going !
i ' not going , and that 's all there is to it .
not until dr. uther tells me i can leave .
well , i ca n't help it .
i 'm not gon na leave here , not until i 'm well .
i would n't count on it then either , if i were you .
if you were really crazy , it 'd be different , but not this multiplied thing .
you understand ?
i ca n't help it , ralph .
okay , if that 's the way you want it .
come in .
i never saw that dress before .
well , o nt you wan na give me one ?
why , i never seen you take a drink before .
honey , there are a lot of things you never seen me do before .
you ai n't foolin ' me , you know .
what ?
you 're tryin ' to ake me think you 're that other one .
what other one ?
you know what i mean .
you ai n't evie .
you tink not ?
i never seen evie do a thing like that in my whole life before .
you do n't like it ?
come on .
i 'm not gon na bite ya .
well , i 'm not up to a thing .
you ai n't mad , ae you ?
you know what you ought to do ?
what ?
i think you ought to ask me to go to jacksonville with you .
well , you asked her .
i know , but i do n't know if this is the same thing or not .
you wanted her to go with you , did n't you ?
you are my wife .
hat 's not what you said a few minutes ago .
maybe , only not tonight , i ca n't .
why not tonigh ?
'cause i have n't got anything to wear to jackonville .
it 's gettin ' kind of old .
maybe , if you buy me a pretty one .
will you go now ?
the tores ai 't open now .
do n't you trust me ?
sure .
i just want the dress first .
does that mean you 're gon na buy me something ?
i told ou i would , did n't i ?
okay , but just a little oe .
hey !
is that what you call a little one ?
hey .
what ?
do n't take too long , though .
wo n't you even sit close to me ?
shut that door .
all i was doin ' was just danin ' .
we 're losing .
no , it 's more than tat .
i do n't believe he divorce actually affected her seriously .
a vitory for either would be disastrous ... no solution whatever .
an empty , almost abnormally nomal history .
yes ?
miss eve black .
miss eve lack in person .
you gon na protect him against me ?

o september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. whie : dear dr. luther ..
narrator :
in winter , endless arkness is brightened by the risky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 belo is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar bear families .
one hundred and fifty housand years ago some brown ears moved orth and gradually adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywhere else .
polar bears have always hunted from floating platforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctic is warming twice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the sumer sea ice covered 25 percent more ocean than it does now .
if the current trend continues the arctic ocean could be free of sea ice each summer by the year 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can low it down .
most arctic glaciers are melting faster than ever before .
the distance beween ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in search of sea ice often has further to go .
some cubs do survive especially if the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do the inuit people like simon qamanirq .
simo :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
but now the ancient weather patterns have changed .
our grandfathers fed their families well .
my faily has always depended on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
m friend adam ravetc has been coing up here for 20 years to photograph te animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years into raising their young .
walrus moms spend even longer .
they dive down from rafts of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of their favorite treat .
mothers teach their young survival skills such as scaring off itruders .
one morn sent me a very clear mesage :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
this ater is literally as cold as ice .
the salt keeps it from feezing .
down here , thee 's onl one exit and it 's pretty scary thinking you could be trapped .
each spring in alaska large herds of caribou et out on a long journey .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what the caribou mothers go through and to see this migration from their perspective .
eanne :
these newlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to their birthing grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calves are just a week or two old , and they 're easy ickings for bears and wolves .
this is the place whee the calves have their best chance to survive .
hese bug are potentially deadly to these caribou .
to get away .
caribou mothers are having a tough time as the arctic warms .
but polar bear others face an even greater struggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of this ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world and most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when you 're only 3 months old .
next year we 're coming back with stronger cases .
narrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to imossible .
then the team got lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
because the sun never sets in the summer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males prefer seals but in a pinch , they have always gone after defenseless cubs .
the mother seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finally spotted a male quite a ways off zeroing in on the mother and her cubs .
now tha seals are so hard to catch , starving males might be targeting cubs more often .
but next time things could be much different .
playul cubs can really work up an appetite .
bjorne :
when you want to grab a bite to eat up here timing is everthing .
the cubs finish everything on their plate bu the scent of fresh seal meat attracts attention 
but the male picks up he family 's cent again .
we watch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on the family .
then the mother turn to face him ... ... slowing him down just ong enough for her frightened cubs to escape .
at the moment of truth , the mother ent a ver clear message :
you can get to my cubs if you want but you 'll have to kill me first .
narrator :
but she 's powerless to save he habitat they need to survive .
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster than it has fo thousands of years and losing its dazzing crown of ice .
the mothers here nurture heir young so lovingly .
perhaps tey can inspire us to protect their hoe with that same care .

i do n't take bets from paupers , strippers or grandmothers .
uless , of course , captain , you hae some regulations against it .

i lied it when he swung on the rope .
they 're both pretty taken with sir federick .

hello , mr. lewis .
i guess that makes you the pirates who do n't do anthing .
well , tough luck .

his dad 's a loser .
i do n't know what went wong .

i should be at home right now , watching tv as a happily eployed cabin boy .
i guess guys like us will never be more than cabin boys .
see what i mean ?
free garbage .
well , what is it ?
well , it could be something valuable , ike a russian satellite .
or maybe a bomb .
i told you it was a bob .
chuck it in the river .
i think it 's a bomb .
it 's a bomb !
you did what ?
there 's something you do n't see eery day .
so , we lost our jobs  bu we got a roboat .
and i 'm living in my parents ' basement again .
the good news is , i got a rowboat .
it 's so old .
give a man a rowboat and he 'll ...
i 'm thinking we should avoid pushing any more buttons !
you got us ...
i do n't know how .
row ?
we got to even out the weight a little .
can i be the rudder ?
you 're not rowing together .
no , you 're going the wrong way .
it 's not a metaphor .
it 's a girl .
well , it 's kind of funny .
quickly , come up .
it 's splenid to meet you .
i 'm eloise , princess of monteria , and this is my butler , willory .
we have n't muh time .
ell , you 're the heroes 
any questions ?
i mean no disrespect , but these men hardly seem the heroic type .
she thinks we 're , u ..
heroes .
perhap they plucked it from the ocean or stole it from the real heroes .
i mean , loo how they 're dressed .
buy o-carts 
no , be heroes .
they do 't know that .
she called us heroes .
o , come on , how hard could it be ?
it 's kind of nice to be called a hero .
well  gentlemen , are you ready for adventure ?
point the wa !
oh , you 're not pirates , are you ?
we sure are n't cabin boys .
we 're riendly pirates , sort of .
oh .
oh , no , we do n't do any of that stuff .
that 's ight .
how comorting .
well , then , there 's no time to spare .
great .
how do you start this thing ?
what a kidder .
elliot , et me take the wheel .
you scramle up to the yard and unfurl the topsail .
certainly .
where are my manners ?
i 's he recordig ting with the tv thing in the future .
tea would be lovely .
real pointy ones .
these treacherous waters shelter many a desperate pirate .
a skilled captain able to sail this maze will find , at its center , the inn of jolly joe , a popular pirate haunt .
we can not turn back .
captain , are you up to the task ?
wh , exactly , do we need to go there ?
to find out more about this .
you can cut a an with it and still slice a tomato .
if we find out who the owner is , we 'll be closer to finding alexander .
we ust do whatever it takes to rescue my brother , willory .
does anyone know where the bathroom is ?
oh .
do n't ory about a thing , willory .
lookig good , captain .
oh , no !
what ?
quickly , my lady , you must hide .
we should rop our sails .

looking for the bathroom
oh !
how quaint .
the princess has a pode room !
locked .
all right , where 's the key ?
two ...
i 'm not getting it .
on a ig ring , just like at the gas station .
come on .
what cunning !
what bravery !
i told you they were heroes .
welcome to my kingdom , prince .
you ca n't hide , robert .
my father will send help .
oh , i would enjoy that .
wach your step .
my father will be very please that his helpseeer found you all .
you love your dad a lot , huh ?
do you have children ?
george jr .
great kids .
you are a princess , and this inn is full of treacherous pirates !
yes , thank you , willory .
even princesses can o what 's right .

argh , argh , argh  argh , argh , arg , argh , argh , arg , argh

grab a chair , and join the game !
come on in .
serve them up , pour them up , pull them up .
ahem !
is that a yes or a no ?
aye , lad .
the cutlass belongs to robert .
robert the terrible .
you have his cutlass , but you 're not he .
the othes were fooled , bu i know better .
you know where we could find this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of a island , past he rocks of malabar .
not that i 'd go looking or it .
and why should n't they ?
they do n't call him robert the terrible for nothing 
he 's the king 's own brother , but he 's as bad as the king is good .
and , for his treachery , was banished from monteria .
so he 's a little nasty .
a little ?
story says he s waiting for the king to step away , ust long enough to grab his beloved childre and take the throne for his on .
for robert to claim the throne , they must be gone !
on vacation ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enough adventure for this gourd .
clearing tables is really kind of fun when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
where ae you going ?
omewhere else .
the helpseeker brought you here , and only the helpseeker can send you back .
just get me back to 1972 .
i do n't undertand .
you 're our heroes !
brave as lions and cunning as foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
who are you ?
i do n't know .
i 'm like a sleepy little panda .
there 's no island anywhere .
i 'll leave the interpretation up to you .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work will be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to i .
great pan , george .
raise the mast on the steadfast !
we play the haddock for a ha trick
we got the hammocks on the main dec
we got the butler doing the henpeck
screaming so
we do n't know
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a relic from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're on the bad mood swing
we have n't done one thing
not even the minimum daily requirement
but if you 're feeling a little seasick
and you want to get off the guilt trip
what are you gon na show him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taking u the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheel keep an even keel
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's it .
the island may still lie ahea .
what is that ?
el remolino , the great whirlpool !
i thought it was pirate legend , but there it is .
captain george 's death cruise ,
brought to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thought you were on our side .
thank you  george .
might e a giant whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huh .
ow about that ?
water droplets in te air refecting the sky so perfectly they block the island from view .
right on time .
and look who they left behind .
do you thin there are snakes on thi island ?
'cause snakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
and spiders and bears .
i do n't follow you .
ail to the rocks , do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here with captain weather channel on my way to be sliced and diced by edward scissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i were a cave  where would i be ?
we ca 't sneak up on them in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i do n't know .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailor were to look for me ,
the east is where he ' start .
he 'd reach the isle of walking rocks
and the clapping pass would part .
then gaze with pride upon my keep ,
not found on any chart ,
till he woul spy my steely eye
ooh .
copyright robert the terrible .
oh , yeah .
so , what do we go ?
we head east to ...
holy mackerel !
what ?
pieces of eight ?
spanih gold ?
even better .
cheese curls 
i 'm not going back to the boat .
what do you mean ou re not going back to the boat ?
the way i see it , i have two coices .
but , the princess , she thiks we 're heroes .
we are n't any of those tings .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
where do i start ?
how about you , my little friend ?
what ?
she 's sailing away .
maybe she did n't need them after all .
are you beeping ?
the ball .
what ?
it means our work is done .
where 's the rowboat ?
we can go home .
hold on a sec .
how long has that been here ?
it 's one of robert 's boats .
it 's blinking !
something ai n't right .
they 've got he princess !
we got to help her !
come on !
liten , when te ball blinks , our ork is done and e can go home .
do n't you want to go home ?
but i also want them to want to see me .
you know , maybe the reason they do n't look up to me is because i have n't given them something worth looking up to .
it was wrong about that .
it could be wrong about this , too .
if you want to go home , you can go home .
but eloise needs me .
let 's go save a princess !
help is on the way !
what kind of a crazy b movie am i in ?
let 's be reasonable .
i wa n't really going to eat you  but you were impersonating a snack food !
i think you 're right .
ten we 'll just have to follow the clues .
head east to the island of walking rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like roaces !
i bet george knew about those litle things from the weather channel , too .
it is n't worth it .
eaten by his own favorie snack food .
at leas that one day , from about 2:00 o 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'd want me to come back .
what ?
sorry , boys !
gourd is off the menu !
what o you want , robert ?
indeed .
he took monteria 's wealth , our wealth , my wealth  and squandered it on strangers .
when the crown is mie , i can once again enjoy the benefits of royalty .
you 're not strong enough to take the cron from my father 's head .
of course , i ca n't ust leave them in the harbor waiting , or i 'll blow up m own ships .
he did n't say .
alexander !
surely you must know when your father is returning !
if you can manage to reember ,
you have two hours to think it over .
put them in their cell .
oh , apa s got a pork chop , nellie ,
do n't you like it ?
after he 32nd vere , it grate .
but there 's supposed to be a pass .
right .
you think that 's the island of walking rocks ?
it 's got rocks  but they do n't appear to be going anywhere .
loo at us , we 're walking rocks
la-la-la-la-la
george ?
george !
hey , eliot !
the rocks !
huh ?
there 's another one !
are you kidding ?
i think we woke up dad .
it was nice knowing you , elliot !
thanks for the adventure .
hey !
i 've been looking for you .
company ?
oh , no .
i hate these guys !
i think they like it .
oh , sure , ea .
i 'll just keep running all day .
oh , it had to be me .
it 's not ...
would you ...
somebody eat them .
would you ?
that was a good idea , swimming over here with those ...
why ?
hang on .
now , this is the guy who wants to crush us like coconuts , right ?
uh-huh .
yep .
and you 're in on this , too ?
mmm .
okay .
we go to row through before it closes .
i do n't think that s possible , and that 's coming from a guy who just swam 92 nautical miles without arms or legs .
well , you got a better idea 
yeah .
we need to get through .
trust him ?
trust the rock , he says .
guys ?
guys ?
guys !
found it .
we hould be fine .
there you go .
too easy .
it 's not guarded or anything .
hey , guys ?
there 's bubbles .
what ?
guys ?
oh , dear .
like sand through the hourglas , so are the last few minutes of our lives .
i 'm hoping this will lead up to the dungeon level , and that 's where we 'll find the prince and princes .
their dungeon has a swimming pool .
oh , no .
a what ?
hey !
so , what are we going to do when we get to the dungeon ?
huh ?
oh , i have n't figured tha part out yet .
i was thinking we had a plan .
hey , i think we 're there .
it 's locked .
yep , this is the dungeon , all right .
and look !
who is it ?
it 's ...
that is one neat toy .
it 's a labor-saving device .
come on !
huh ?
huh ?
it 's not magic .
it 's radioshack !
we got to go .
but this way is ...
time 's up .
what 's this ?
someone wanted to spoil my fun ?
surel not you ?
oh , no , sir .
then you three ?
the king 's eroes ?
he did n't mention i to us .
it did n't come up .
surely the king 's heroes would know of his plans !
tell me when the king will return , or ay goodbye o the princess .
let her go !
it was all a misundersanding .
we 're no heroes .
we work in a restaurant .
we clear dishes .
we clean up .
that 's right .
he 's so lazy , he ca n't even climb a ladder without giving up .
and george there , he 's such a wimp , even his own son thinks he 's a loser .
when all hope is gone , help will come from above in the shape of a donkey .
donkeys .
we 're not donkeys .
we 're cabin boys .
but even cabin boys can do what 's right !
folow me 
the ball !
everybody , lean !
the drain .
we 're getting out of here !
i 'm feeling flushed !
ou 've got to be kidding !
what a ride !
we 've got company !
row !
ca i ask where we 're rowing to ?
the pass is closed !
keep rowing !
unless that pass opens up , we 're doomed .
we ca n't get much further .
it 's not blinking .
they 're in range now , boys .
finish hem .
father !
it ca n't be !
you know what to do , men .
where are you going 
return fire !
against the king 's men 
o my word , brother , i 'm not finished !
for amazing tenacity , unwillingness to give up .
but the ball , it does n't work right .
we 'e no heroes .
we 're cabi boys .
the helpseeker picked exactly whom i intended .
the donkey from above .
the adventure i call you to may not e easy , but you 'll never ourney alone .
my help is always there .
that was a test , whic you passed with flying colors .
sometimes , a test helps us decide wat matters most .
the hero is the one who , no matter how hard , does what he knows is right .
monteria !
are you sure you do n't want to stay ?
i want to see my kids .
and my ellen !
fare thee well , friends .
sure enough .

as some of you may or may not know , one of the guitarists in the band , kevin zunbar , is actually the newest member of the lost and found congregation .
and , i mean , it was like i was missing something in my life , but i could n't figure out what that something was .
and i 've realized that it was god ..
who i was needing ...
and that all i needed to do was open my heart up ...
yeah !
one , two , three .
puttin  all the people to shame
show me your way
my hope is you
do n't ever give a sermon like that in my church again .
i was trying to show how we 're all connected to each other .
i will not allo you to express alternative poits of view regarding the church .
when my riches lie in ruin
on the landcape of my past
wil they uncover that i was pursuing
where
your treasure is
the thins you love are a part of you
the things you love are a part of you
wo n't end
let me see your hands .

now , now , brothers and sisters , brothers and sisters , just a quiet moment , if you will .

i feel we should take a moment and think about what we 've seen .
reflect on it .
let god put it on your heart .
amen .
let us pray .
no , you 're not .
it 's not about healing .
you 're not seeing what appened here tonight .
eah , i saw it .
you and i saw the same thing .
you know , you do n't have to do it this way .
i know you 'd like to have the faith to talk to these people .
but you do n't know what faith is .
she knows .
she understands .
i can see .
i can see .
on the wings of a snow-white dove
he sends his pure sweet love
on the wings of a snow-whie dove
he sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above
a sign from above
a sign from above
it 's a miracle 
a miracle 
a miracle .
a miracle .
i thought someone should tell you .
father tardone .
fater pat , before you start espousing yet another miracle , i advise you to take a breath .
he is with us here in auburn .
the peope from the revival of angels meeting are all talking abou it .
another miracle .
a revial tent ?
i wared you about this joshua .
hey , i 'm not the only one .
everyone says it 's a miracle .
i have kept my eyes open and my vision clear , like you advised me to ,
corrupted ?
as soon as this joshua completes the statue , i want you to end your association with him .
he 's my friend .
good morning .
good mornig , bishop .
thank you for seeing me .
i 'll get right to the point .
he seemed simple enough , but he 's shown a powerul influence over a great many people .
the protestant clergy and i would ike ...
and the purpose of this meeting would be to investigate these miracles ?
we all have better thins to do with our time .
that i 'm glad o hear .
that i 'm glad to hear .
my own father hayes follows him aound like a lost puppy .
this is a sma fire , father tardone .
this is a small fire , father tardone 
father tardone , hello .
how are you ?
it 's the artist ou have a problem with .
i 'm surprised you found time to finish your work , considering all your other chores .
i suppose i do n't thik of them as chores .
you kno , father , we could use our help down at he baptist church .
join you ?
it 's the others whose eyes are not open .
to what ?
a miracle worker ?
i have never made that claim .
a miracle worker ?
and i think it 's time for everone else to find out .
it looks very nice .
yes , they 've definitely made progress .
i know most of you .
what joshua has persuaded you to do with this church is wonderful .
but i want you all to look ...
does anyone do something for nothing ?
does a complete stranger offer to help ithout wanting something in return ?
preaching ?
i do n't think you know what this is .
it 's a love leter .
a love letter ?
what about sin and god 's law ?
how dare you asume the role of the clergy ?
wait a minute .
what joshua has done is a miracle .
living next to each oher did n't make us neighbors .
make us care about one another , did it ?
but by working together here with joshua --
led by him .
come on .
see the good in this man --
if you can look at this church and how everybody here has changed for the better ...
and say , this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no , no .
whatever i is you stand for , father tardone , i do n't want to be a part of .
i ca n't .
i wo n't wear this anymore .
i wo n't take it .
may god have merc on you .
he 's just afraid .
no .
about this .
i am part of the clergy in this town , and , uh ,
i 'm too-
so i might as wel ...
it 's not true , pat .
what do you know about being a riest , joshua ?
what do you know about the responsibility i feel ?
you 're just a guy .
you 're just a guy .
it just needs o be understood , and --
you 're wrong , pat .
hi , maggie .
made it just in time .
now , theo , since you 're the first one who came to help , you should be the one to put te bell on the steeple .
take it easy , now .
that thing is big .
theo , can you hear me ?
you 're gon na wake up .
your work 's not done .
okay , now  come on .
come on , now .
come on , now .
wake up .
that 's it .
that 's it .
what happened ?
you fell off the roof .
come on .
you all right ?
hank you .
what just happene here ?
what just happened here ?
i mean , its-it 's possible he survived the 40-foot fall ...
a certifiably dead person and you brought him back to life .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
i turned my back on my vocation .
but i have overcoe my crisis of faith .
i am not resigning .
i promise you , father pat , the vatican shall know of this , and when they do , this miracle worker will vanish .
he will simply run away .
you 're wrong about him , father tardone .
joshua ?
i 've never seen anything so beautiful .
what ?
this is n't a letter .
from who ?
i do n't know if i 'll be visiting the pope , but thaks for the etiquette tip .
hmm .
you kow , joshua was invited to the vatican .
you know , joshua was invited to the vatican .
they wo n't let you in .
i adise you to make the most of your sermon , father pat .
hi .
maggie , hi .
um , i just wanted to make sure i said good-bye .
oh , yeah , our new job .

um , i kind of wanted to see where you lived .
yeah ?
well , here it is .
wow , joshua .
thanks .
it 's yours .
come here .
look at that .
oh  it 's beautiful .

then wy are you leaing ?
why are you ?
i --
i-i apologize .
i feel like an idiot .
i just ...
mis my husband , a , um --
this is so confusing .
i -- my life is a mess .

your life is beautiful .
my life was beautiful .

that is my life , and it ca n't be fixed .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .

which nobody can deny

that is a classic rendition of hat song .
but , uh , i have to get up really early to catch a plane tomorrow , so i 'm gon na say good night .

from what i hear , you 've been doing some extraordinary thing in auburn .
i came to auburn and saw there was work to be done .
you could say that .
i started to build and eople came to join me .
you built a church , as i understand it .
for hat reason ?
so you do n't consider yourself a --
a spiritual leader ?
you do n't seem dangerous or evil .
do n't let him fool you , cardinal .
i beg a formal condemnation of him by the vatican .
ho ' come o auburn to mislead people , then i accept your condemnation .
then i accept your condemnation .
but is that truly what you see in me ?
that 's not what you 're afraid of , is it ?
you fear what 's inside of you .
i 'm so sorry .
cardinal riccardo saw what i saw .
i look orward to it .
hmm .
the cardinal saw the change in you .
here .
is that so ?
i think --
i think i 'm happier for father pat .
i brought you a gift .
thee are some tools hat i work with .
ah , yes .
e have much work to be done .
i wanted to thank you for the pledge you made as a child .
my plede ?
then the next morning she was well .
you went o the op of a hil and you ledged your life to god .
who are you ?
the world has become suc a frightening place .
it 's so overwhelming .
what should i do ?
remind them that i love them --
and that if they open their hearts to it , i will fill that emptiness , and they will be able to love one another .
that 's te message .
tell them , peter .
thank you , reverend .
giving honor and praise to god , for without his love and mercy , surely i would not be standing before you all today .

i 've seen too much of it .
i 'm not sending another winter here , snowed in for months .
what would we do without you ?
benjamin says he 's leavig .
why should they grieve ?
once is all it takes if it 's the right one .
i had such dreams about all of them living around .
dozens of children , visiting back and forth at chitmas and birthdays .
if benjamin goes , then another will go .
if you could just get a look at yourselves ...
if you 're sweet on them , why o n't you do something about it ?
they were in the same fix ou 're in .
they was opening up new territory , and women were sarce , like here .
course , this being oregon and god-fearing teritory you 'd have to capture a parson .
they he ones i heard about settled norh of here ?
no , this was in olden days .
i read about it in milly 's book .
a book !
why , this is history .
this really happened .

what would i see if i rode on a beam of light ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards fo te wire .
what ?
it is my great ambition to emonstrate that nature is a closed system ;
te people ...

it is a return to the old ways !

it auhor was a youthful albert einstein .
it 's the most famous equatio in the world 
all aboard !
but while e 've all heard of einsein 's big idea , very few of us know what it means 
we 've only got sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but first ...
diner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were no laughing at einstein .
he 'd united in one stunning insight the work of many who had come before him ...
in the early 19th centur , scientists did n't think in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature would begin to change all that .
young michael faraday hated his job .
he was uneducated , the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder 's apprentice .
bu faraday craved one thing .
all of his ree time and his meager wages were poured into his self-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of course , of course ...
pass , pass .
this way to a better life .
in he early 1800s , science was the pursuit of gentlemen , something faraday was clearly not .
he had a rudimentary education , he 'd read widely , he 'd gone to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets o hear sir humphry davy , the most prominent chemist o the age .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of teir day .
their lectures were hugely popular 
tickets were hard to come by , and davy reveled in his status .
they 're aiting .
metals ... unknown , that is , until i isolated potassium from molten otash and sodium , as i showe you last time , from common salt .
help me be part of the great circle that is your work and love .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trade , which i find vicious and selfish  and to become a servant of science , which , i imagine , makes its pursuers amiable and liberal .
really ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of a few years to set you right on that score .
look , i have n't anything at the moment .
faraday wa determined to break free fro his daily toil .
newman ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhaps ith god and faraday in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe in our place of work .
ust stick to your job and do as you 're told and you 'll be fine , faraday 
faraday became the laboratory assistant , eagerly absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excitemen of the day was electricity .
anothe carge , newman 
but no one really understood wat this strange force of electricity was .
the academic establishment at the time thought that electricity was , you know , like a fluid flowing through a pipe , pushing its way along .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showed that when you pass an electric current through a wire and place a compass near it , it deflected the needle at riht angles .
faraday , come look at this .
perhaps you can work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing finding .
now , that is remarkable 
but if the electrical force is flowing through the wire , why does the needle ot move in the same direction , parallel to the wire ?
again , newman .
what ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you that at he university of cambridge , electricity flows through a ire , not sideays to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridge , but it does n't explain what 's happeing before our eyes .
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fascination inspired by his religion .
for him , the problem was a ay to understand god 's hidden mysteries .
there is a small , almost persecuted group in london called the sandemanians .
they were a religious ...
faraday was a ember of that group .
that if you opened up one little part of it , you could see how everything was connected .
faraay was different from anybod else .
by methodically placing a compass all around an electrified wire ,
faraday started to otice a pattern .
and then he imagined that a magnet had siilar lines emerging from it and that those lines would ge cauht up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking .
yes .
this is the experiment of te century .
scale up the magnets and the wires , make them really big , attach eavy weights to them and they 'll be dragged along .
although e did n't realize it at the time ,
the chemicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in te wire , which had combined with the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these various forces there wa a common energy .
so , faraday , wha does wollaston make o all this ?
he 's written to me and assures me that he 's taken no offense , and he acknowledges tat what i published was entirely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
and what do you think ?
faraday , my dear boy , you have my vote .
it 's the science that couts .
so , tell me , ow does this wire of yours spin round its manet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
i my mind , i see a swirling array of lines of force spining out of the electrified wire like a spiraling web .
but invisible lines of force ...
it 's all a bit vague , is n't it ?
faraday , might i have a wod in private ?
listen , faraday , let 's sop this nonsense .
i want you to take down your ballot paper from the notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i will not take it down .
my father and uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing electric light to the street of germany .
from an early age , i loved to look at machines , understand how things work .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle when my father showed me a compass .
there had to be something behind objects that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whicever way they run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachers tried to rum into him , as faraday had shown , that energy could be converted from one form ino another .
they also believed that all forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein was going to prove them wrong .
deep in the heart of matter .
a hunded years before einstein 's birt ,
forget the ain .
the french revolution was just around the corner .
and they felt that one of the first tasks that lay ahead of them was to rationalize and to classify every single kind of matter so they could see how it all interacted together .
antoine lavoisier , a wealthy , aristocratic young man , decided to take up this task , to see if there was some basic connetion between all the stuff of everyday life :
all the different substances in the world .
his meticulous , even obsessive attention to detail ...
was also to be his downfall .
your precise observations commend you as a lady of scientific curiosity ,
most unusual .
for the last five weeks , i have taken nothing but milk .
i would rather die than fast on milk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the greatest of respect to a member of the royal academy of sciences , your gut must think your throat has been slit !
how dare you insult the count ?
do n't forget what the count offers ... not just marriage , but think of how you will be introduced to all the salons .
you will be the toast of pais .
do you really plan to marry damerva ?
then i must contrive to save you .
lavoisier was n't a scientist by profession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes on the simple things in life ...
did not endear him to the average parisian .
this scrupuous , fastidious young man did still allow himself the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anne paulze , the daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thu he saved her , as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 ears her elder .
allow me to show you something .
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or ion and leave it outside in the rain for months on end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metals ...
is this a verbal examination prior to an examiatio proper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let me ress you furthe .
hmm ?
every last citizen in france of sesible age knows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lighter and eventually disappears .
ah , but ...
i have not inished .
contain yourself , sir .
there is more .
in a recently published amphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoiier demonstrates that the iron combines with the air .
it , in fact , becomes heavier .
she learned english so that she could translate contemporary scientific works .
monsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheeky man .
messieurs ... it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system , that in any transformation , no amount of matter , no mass is ever lost an none is gained .
over here , please .
from this end we cool the steam but , interestingly , we collect les aer than we started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of water .
now , when we combine these two increases ..
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have colleted ...
they are exactly equal to the weight of the lost water .
so what he had one is get the oxygen to stick to the inside of a red-hot iron rifle barrel 
now , that let the hydroen , what he caled combustible air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
in the next few months i hope to demonstrate that i can recombine this combustible air with vital air and transform them both back into water .
i will re-create exactly the same amount of water that was lost here in this pocess .
it is my hope to complete the cycle ...
but to prove this , he had to perform thousands of exeriments , and he had to do the measurements with incredible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth rom being a tax collector came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the academy asked you to assess his designs .
oh , antoine , have you forgotten 
another charlatan with an idea to peddle .
monsieur .
i have invented a device hich projects an image of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device renders the substance of fire visible .
have you collected it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monsieur .
no , no .
if you will you excuse me .
i am extremely buy today .
thank you .
so that is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not conform to the version of the truth as laid down by he academy .
lavoisier .
he talks about facts , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my fiend .
they are all the same , the roal academies ...
the insult the liberty of the mind .
they think they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core ...
do n't worry .
in my next pamphlet i will expose this persecutor of ours .
the crowning glory of this opus was their remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to the french revolutionaries of 1790 ,
he was denounced by a failed scientist turned radical journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeigh as the original city and the air around it before .
a century later , all of nature had been classified into two great domains .
there was energy ... the forces that animated obects ;
and there was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mighty pillars .
the laws that governed one did not apply to the other .
but young , newly enolled physics student alber einstein did n't like laws .
extremely well , herr einstein .
all the better for seeing you have escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that ' about all you ever do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein maric .
would you care to take a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell you what you have missed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just incredible determination .
we know from his letters that einstein , even from the age of 16 , was literaly osessed with the nature of light .
everyone he could speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on this beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us just imagine we two are oung ...
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to understand .
what would we see , do you think ...
with light he would reinvent the universe an find a hiden pathway that would unite energy and mass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long before the 19th century , scientists had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what light actually was .
invisible lines that can emanate from electricity in a wire , from a magnet or ... even from the sun .
for it is my contentio that light itself is just one form of these vibrating lines of electomagnetism .
maxwe and the aging faraday became close friends .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that magnetic charge oves , i creates a little piece of electricity .
electricity .
electricity and magnetism are inerwoven , like a ... a never-ending braid .
so it is always pusing forward .
michael .
670 million miles per hour .
that is the speed of light !
well , that eans you were right all along .
maxwell had proven faraday right .
we have lectures in half an hour .
we ca n't .
come ith me , we 'll read maxwell and think about the electromagnetic theory of light 
she 's very pretty .
they said you could never catch up to a beam of light .
even if you were traveling at 670 million miles an hour , you would still see light squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an hour .
yes .
you see how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveling at the same speed .
but relative to her , it just sits tere .
so is light like that ?
common sense would say that if you caught up to a light beam , there would be a wave of light ust sitting there .
maybe it would be shimmerin , a bit of electricity and a bit of magnetism .
so if she was traveling alongside the light wave , it would n't be moving .
it would be static .
but maxwell says you ca n't have static light .
maye maxwell is wrong .
the light travels from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
hat does n't make sense .
einstein as about to enter a sureal universe where energy , mass and the speed of light inermingled in a way no one had ever suspeced .
lon before the french revolutio  scietists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtelet 's translation is still the standard tet in france today .
muse , my meory causes ...
for what offence the queen of heaven began
to persecute so brave , so just a man !
only the other night ,
i fear , however , that my wit is only a curiosity to others .
if only my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and the world will fall at your feet .
no ...
in one sense , she is a woman utterly out of her true time and place .
du câtelet married a general in the french amy at age 19 and had three children .
she ran a busy household , all the while pursuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mathematics .
she enthusiastically took lessons rom one of the greatest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expert on newton , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they had a brief affair .
a fierce ritic of the king and the catholic church ,
voltaire had been in prison twice and exiled to england , where he became enthralled by the ideas o newton .
du châtelet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltaire out of jail .
and it is also true hat émilie du châtelet did have several affairs of a fleeting nature .
bravo !
she created an institution to rival that of france 's royal academies of sciences .
ah , monsieur ...
you are youg .
i hope that soon you wil judge me for my own merits , or lack of them , but do not look upon me as a appenage to this great general or that renowne scholar .
i am in my own right a whole person , responsible to myself alone for all that i am , all that i say . all that i do .
du châtelet leaned from the briliant men aroud her , but she quickly developed ideas o her own .
uch to the horror of her mentos , she even dare to suspect that there was a flaw in the great sir isaac newton 's thinking .
newton stated that the energy of an object , the force with which it collided with another object , could very siply be accounted for by its mass times its velocity .
he proposed that moving objects had a kind of inner spirit .
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be buil up by four slabs along one edge and four along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplication , this building up by squares  is something you find in nature all the time .
it is a return to the old ways !
it is the occult !
so all leibniz is asking is , where does all this force come from ?
you 're infuriating !
criticize this , denounce that .
i discovered you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been droppig lead balls into a pan of clay .
so , messieurs , care fo a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
messieurs ,
i feel mr. newton 's reputation dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis !
well ... the ball travels fo times further .
it 's the best way to express the energy of a moving object .
if you drive a car at 20 miles an hour , it takes a cerain distance to stop if you slam on the brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
eally ?
do be careful  madame .
do you think the academy is ready for such an opinio ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm araid that ..
nor is it your husband 's .
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du châtelet knew that in the 18th century for a woman to become pregnan at the age of 43 was realy very dangerous , and all the while he was pregnant she had terrible premonitions about what was going to happen .
in the ed , it was an affair wih a young soldier that led to her demise .
six days after giving birth to her fourth child , she suffered an embolism and die .
einstein pursued light right through university and beyond .
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors tat no one would write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the young family struggled .
but , listen ...
abou your promotion .
i 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very carming , but kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the word fits in around him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't bother im .
i 'll tell you what is truy mysterious :
the mathematics are ine , if a little unconventional , but this only works for big ystes .
i disagree .
here we go ..
what would happen if one applied those formulae to electromagnetic radiation ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bit of physics and aply i without proper regard to a ompletely different area .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linkages , the big theories , but would n't things be better all round if you just ot going in some small area ?
spoken like a true bourgeois .
they had cornered the question of light from every possible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on ho much time i would take light to reach them from clocks at different distances ,
tank you .
what einstein did was completely turn the problem on its head .
that light would always move away from you at 670 million miles an hour , even if you , too  were traveling really fat .
his extraordinary insight is that time ... as you approach the speed o light , time itsef will slow down .
it 's a monumental shift in how we see the world .
you see , before then people had assumed that time was like a wristwatch on god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throughout the universe , no matter were you were .
that the tick , tick , tick of this wristwath was actually the click , click , click
of electricity turning into magnetism turning into electricity .
it stars with his publication of a paper on ow to work out the true size of atoms .
two months later is the publication of his paper on the nature of ligh ...
that 's what will earn him the nobel prize 
in it einstein sets out his theory of light , time and space .
it was te teory of pecial relativity .
in einstein 's new world , the one true constant was not time or even space , but light .
in one last great 1905 paper , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from our point of iew , the train actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even einstein is amazed by it .
i tink i have foun a connection between energy and mass .
if i am right , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he simply stated that energy and mass were connected by the square of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year jourey into light .
there is a deep unity between energy , matter and light .
you multiply that by itself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science ends in silence .
the articles are published to resounding .
i think the gods are laughing at me .
for four years einstein swered each inquiry dutifully , trying to explain his difficult , complex ideas to a confused physics comunity .
here are these universe-changing papers circling around , and the world is ... struggling to come to terms with them .
luckily it happened to be the most important living physicist .
he has se his assistant .
after four years of aiting , he is appointe professor of physics at zurich university .
fro there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vast reserves of energy locked deep inside the atom .
but he ha n't banked o te second world war and the genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-yearold austrian lise meitner was painfully shy .
despite her anxiety , the young doctor of physics arrived in berlin determined to pursue a areer in the exciting new field of radioactivity .
german universities did not employ female graduates .
otto hahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i hik i could really help with the physical analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematics .
studying radioactive atoms has become so much a collaboration between emistry and physics these days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
at this time , not a lot was known about the atom .
but then ... in what are called radioactive metals , thigs like radium and uranium ..
the nucleus itelf seemed to be unstable , leaking out energy and particles .
the ass of a nucleus turning into energy .
he was given a laboratory .
she was forced to work in a wood shop .
i see ou hae n't set you hair on fire .
good day , herr ahn .
good day .
yes , where would we chemists be without the steadying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
yes , well , i have , um ... asked her to marry me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was war-hearted by nature .
she had many friends and she may have wanted to have a closer relationship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclea research .
meitner and hahn were leading the race to see if even bigger nuclei coud be created by adding more neutrons .
so .. the atom , pretty familiar :
the nucleus , made up of protons ... and neutrons .
now , the larest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers our institute .
e was hounded out of germany in 1933 .
she was abe to stay because she was austrian .
what is it ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ..
we 're speaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn , who was known fo his anti-nazi views , did his best to protect her , at least initially .
not no , i 'm too busy .
we have to protect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon e forbidden to leave germany .
lise ...
horlein demands that you leave .
you ca n't throw er out .
horlein says you should not ome into the institute anymore .
well , i have to write up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to ome in .
you 've given up .
when it became lear that meitner would be dismissed and probably arested , physicists all around europe wrote leters inviting her to conferences , giving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague travele to berlin and illegally took lise back with him on a train to holland .
she had lost everything ...
her home , her position , he ooks , her salary , her pension , even her native language .
she had been cut off from her work just at the time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
no matter what privatios she suffered ,
aunt ?
lise  how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getting strange results .
he ound no evidence to suggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons ad caused it to increase in size .
from afar , she was starting to suspect that something very different was happenin in their experient .
hahn and strassman are getting some strange results with the uranium work .
really ?
a couple of months ago , hahn told me that they were fining radium amongst the uranium products .
and now he writes to me and tels me that it 's not radium , it 's barium 
but that ' even smaller .
it i at least possible that barium is being produced .
so hahn still eeds you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done what you told him to .
it turns out that a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now for four years , meitner and hahn and all other physicits had thought that if you pump more neutrons into this nucleu , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
realized this nucleus might just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so big that it has troule staying together , then could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but something has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no , no ... you 've split the aom .
of course , in the laboratory we 're talking about tiny amouns of uranium and correspondingly tiny amounts of energy .
but the point is that the amount of energy release as relatively large and that came from te mass of the uranium itself .
meitner and frisch published te discoey o what they called nuclear fissio
to great acclaim .
but betrayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it was he and not meitner who had discovered nuclear fission .
shall y scientific past also be taen from me ?
and why is it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enough .
in 1942 , an intense effort to build an atom bomb was begun .
all over ameria , secret installations sprang up under the code name the anhattan projet .
she refused to have anything to do wih the atomic bomb .
but robert frich was different .
vast amounts of energy , in the orm of electromagnetic radiation , were released from a few pound of uranium and plutonium .
today , young physicists carry on einstein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been used to delve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest question of all ...
in the first moments of creation , the universe was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed apart and expanded , huge amount of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atoms and it eventually formed the first stars .
it comes out a energy .
the whole process actually creates life itself .
eventually , a massive star dies , the debri floats around , clusters together , gets pulled into the orbits of another star and becomes a plaet .
building on the work of scientists through the ages , new enerations are searching for anws .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyful .
it i as old as human curiosity itself and never , ever ends .

ｄａｄｄｙ， ｈａｖｅ ｙｏｕ ｅｖｅｒ seen a dragon ?
are dragons scary ?
they 're scary .
but they 're kind gods .
do n't eat things like fireflies .
they 've come .
what ?
but i wan na go too 
no !
you can give it to him .
does n't this carp look delicious ?
you 'll be able to catch something like this in no time .
you reckon ?
yeah .
something feels weird tonight .
i apologize sincerely for keeping you so late .
i stayed too long .
do n't say such things .
no !
but you 'l never know whe they 'll suspect you ... the superiors are so bothersome these days .
indeed .
i did n't mean to scare ou !
please excuse me .
i wo n't take much of your time .
about what ?
accordig to there 's a pla to reclaim the ryuujin swamp and turn it into a paddy field .
that lan ...
this is beyond a meek monster like yourself .
p-pease forgive my rudeness 
you !
kappa ... were n't you ?
but you were talking and looking pleased ...
stop lying !
you 're going to tell is n't hat right ?
what are you talking about ?
stop pretending that you did n't hear !
forgive us !
forgive us !
forgive us !
do n't come here !
this !
give this and
forget it and go back !
so please do n't get angry with us !
please forgive daddy !
be quiet !
n-no !
just us !
daddy ?
am i the only one without a holiday plan ?
this is serious .
it 's already july .
you 're not planning to visit them ?
where 's bali island ?
what 's there ?
i 'll find out once i get there .
damn you !
lame kikuchi !
hey !
i 'm heading off !
that hurt ...
a fossil of a tortoise ?
uehara-kun !
can you climb up ?
are you alright ?
you are n't hut ?
wha—
it 's troublesome enough that the laundry 's not drying properly at the moment .
do n't increase the amount of aundry !
understood ?
mmm ...
o n't mmm me .
now go get chaged .
yes ...
huh ?
what 're you doing ?
kouichi ?
what 're you doing ?
umm ...
open this door !
'cos this kept getting in my way .
what ?
wha is it ?
hey !
no !
o !
anywhere !
what ?
quickly !
is n't this a kappa ?
so in this kind of situation you come home early ?
dunno .
you 're early !
amazing !
it realy looks like a kappa !
where id you find it ?
at kurome river .
yeah ... but it got bigger as i soaked it in water .
coo !
so i hought i 'd name it coo .
no way !
you said the same thing when you picked up the dog on the street .
i do sometimes .
really !
it 's surprisingly cute !
please .
geez !
do n't .. kil me .
save ... me ...
sure .
so you could talk ?
did you feed it anyhing ?
i heard kappas are usually associated so i gave it a few .
you know .
you have to feed it with something that will give it more enegy !
like what ?
let 's see ...
hey !
eh ?
what shall we do ?
let 's keep or the time being .
wat ?
are we keeping it ?
your brother wants to keep it .
why do n't we help it 
she 's really annoying .
get lost .
geez 
thank you very much .
n-no problem .
is it close to kurume river ?
what ?
coo was born in the edo period ?
they wore their a top-knot .
what are you doing ?
what about samurai ?
swish !
slash !
something 's wrong with it !
is it the samurai ?
are you scared of samurai ?
i see .
my condolences .
there was an earhquake .
so you have been buried till now ?
why ?
that 's because ... and the era of the samurai ended more than a hundred years ago already .
i 'm greatly indebted to you .
thank you so much .
i shall return to ryuujin samp .
but the outside world 's changed a lot since you last lived in it .
there are a lot of dangers too ...
there are 't !
i 's best if you do n't go out there .
but mineral water !
sure !
this is spring water .
can you tell 
i ca n't tell you that .
what ?
i 'd get defiled or cursed by the human .
coo !
what ?
i 'm not alking about you .
you have to cook this for 10 minutes .
it 's starting to smell good .
using seasoned vegetables .
the second dih is-
ideo tape :
is the tv interesting ?
it 's iteresting .
coo ...
oo ...
how can you stea this much everday ?
that 's true .
excuse me !
thank you .
ell then ...
bye-bye !
what 's that 
nails !
ossan !
go away !
do 't bully it .
it 's a mai-mai .
stupid !
wha ?
i s eaten it !
you did n't catch it for coo ?
there are cases but ...
what ?
you do n't eat it raw !
i 's called escargot ...
i do n't !
stop it .
worms .
what 's this ?
something you ride on .
something 's coming !
that 's a car .
is this kurume river ?
yeah .
is there an evil kappa in it ?
of course not !
where 's ryuujin swamp gone to ?
yourvoice is too loud .
this is where
daddy and i used to live .
maybe it was buried ?
there are n't any swamps around here ...
a huge vehile !
the area around here is n't that is it ?
can i come out ?
no you ca 't !
there are n't ay of them around here anymore .
kappas ... a few hundred years have passed .
just stay here .
you 'll be safe .
dinner !

i do n't want you to be scared of it .
so what 's bent about this agari-ya ?

george , shoot !

yeah , i did it !
he just looked so small out there .
so lacking in bigness .
we hae to give him room to grow .
i let him slice his own baaa .
no other mother does that .
with george walking beside him every step of the way .
a bit more than you 're giving him now .
maybe mum was right .
i guess it 's y fault .
that 's okay .
you on the game .

bogeys , 12:00 !
would n't it be cool if i actually flew this ?
yeah .
there 's only one problem .
mum .
hello , mrs little .
he 's with stuart .
hi , will .
you want to take a break for a while ?
i brout my ps2 .
i want to play with will for a while .
sounds like a lawnmower .
i 'm not doing aything !
get the book !
it says , on takeoff , pull back on the throttle .
snowbell , get out of the way !
please , do n't urt me !
what 's going on ?
stuart 's just flying in the house .
flying in the house ?
hit the dit !
duck !
everything ' fine .
stuart , you destroyed it .

it 's much too dangerous .
thanks , stuart .
why do n't you take te boys home ?
coe on , boys .
she treats me like a baby .
i 'll fix you both some lunch .
she just loves you so much .
but every cloud has a silver lining .
no , it 's an expression , stuart .
the hing aout being a litle is that you can loo at any situation no matter how bleak , how hopeless and still see the bright side .
so you could find a new friend , too .
meantime , keep your chin up your back straight and your heart open .
then what 
and canada is separate from the united states because canadians like to be alone .
and please take your leftover lunches with you .

i 'm sorry , stuart .

maybe this means i 'm not really a little .
there is no silver lining !
oh , o .
my plane !
the silver lining !
this is it !
all right , george , where is he 
it 's wrong to promise your brother you 'll lie to your parents .
but if he was in danger , that would matter more to me than the promise .
how would we all feel if anything happened to stuart ?
mum , dad , i 'm really sorry .
or , he could be fine .
we do 't have to assume the worst .
yes , you 're right .

ell , do you believe it ?
i knew it all the time .
what do you think of the rumor of a chimp selecting our tv shows ?
riiculous .
well , you know how those rumors get started .
maybe a chimp is behind this mess .
oh , no .
you 're all in on it .
i am so sick and tired of liking a show and having it pulled off the air or put in another time .
it drives you crazy .
i 'm getting to the point , i 'd like to take the tv and throw i out the window .
the last show i liked , they took off the air .
the minute i got to like it , off the air .
how do i know what happened ?
i do n't know what happened to john .
that 's good .
gentlemen , television has had problems before .
i have ..
mr. crampto .
we 've had a tacit understanding to share technological advances .
we have not .
just a minute .
i must speak for the justice department .
then there is a chimp ?
gentlemen , please .
admittedly , there is a chimp .
and it seems he does prefer the top-rated shows .
gentlemen !
i have a simple solution to the whole problem .
yes ?
oh , no , no .
we ca n't do that .
oh , no .
we could n't ...
why , we 'd have those societies for the prevention of things all over our backs .
i hope it 's beter than the bananas .
it 's practical and humane .
that 's the problem .
that 's the one .
every man 's got his price .
forget this whole rat race .
i ca n't be bought .
that 's a ...
well , of course it 's a lot of money .
your future is on te line .
now you listen to this .

this will be our final offer .
take it or leave it .
one million dollars .

you do n't trust each other .
it 's just tat we 're getting together to have a little , uh , outing .

yeah .

i 've only been out here for a short time .
but i ' putting together an oganization bigge than anything the west has seen :
land , mining , cattle , freighting , speculation .
that does soun big .
and it ounds like it 'll take a lot of doing .
you 'l find i 'm pretty well-connected here .
i can show you a shortcut to the whole proposition .
he got here first .
the pecos river runs through the middle of his land .
so ?
that s a chessboard .
and if another man makes the right moves ... there might just be a new king of the pecos .
sheriff brady , jess evans , this is alex mcsween .
howdy .

'blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
'blessed are they that mourn , for they shall be comforted .
'blessed are they wich do hunger and thirst after righteousness ...
'blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see god .
'blessed are the peacemakers , fo they shall be called the children of the lord .

valverde , i think 
i 'm isuing warrants for the arrests of both of those men .
john , i ' empowering you and your men to bring back those two ...
hat are their names ?
deputies morto and baker ... dead or alive .
i 'm afraid of what he might do .
whatever he does , it 'll be legal .
jess evans rode up right afte the shooting .
it 's hard to believe about henry tunstall .
yes , and it 's har to believe he carried a gun .
resisted arrest .
that 's too bad .
it 's just too bad .
would you excuse us , jess ?
all right , lawence .
howd .
have n't seen two men that look like hey 'd rode just as far ... a day or two ahead of us , have you ?
fed up their horse here yesterday .
where 'd they go ?
hold it up .
you 're gon na shoot us , ai n't you ?
i thought about it .
saw him hang .
said it was ghastly .
and that 's the word :
ghasly .
you two are gon na hang .
pat , ake 'em on in to lincoln .
let 's go .
ello , pat  charlie , tom .
you should n't be up and around , billy .
they wo n't be for long .
and you believe that ?
john chisum does .
we 'll see .
pat , i never did thank you for hauling me ou of that river .
what promise ?
so long , charlie , tom 
it wa the kid .
all right , cut 'em loose .
i 'm forming a posse .
damn .
the governor is not to be disturbed .
but , sir ...
wake up , sam .
good god !
get rid of that damn fool , will you ?
what ?
him !
it 's all right , george .
now , what in heaven s name happened ?
believe me , you re in the firin line .
you better do something ... before president hayes decides you ca n't handle this territory .
wat do you suggest that i do ?
firs , justice wilson is chisum 's friend .
you 've got plenty of grounds .
what else ?
goveror axtell has appointed a new sheriff :
and i 'm adding a further reward ... of $ 1,000 , dead or alive .
have you got anything you want to add to that , sheriff ?
john , since governor axtell hung me out to dry ... there 's nothing i can help you with .
i 'll head back to mesilla in the morning .
all right , j.b .
i 'm writin president hayes a letter asking for an impartial investigation ...
by that time , murphy 'll have his name on everything between arizona and texas .
mr. murphy ... just how much of lincoln county are you after ?
you have anyhing to sa to that , mr. chisum ?
you 're not just geting started .
the line 's been drawn .
but if one of your men cross my land , or even touch one of y cows ... or do anything to that store ...
i 'm coming to see you .
mr. chisum , that sounds like a threa .
wrong word :
fact .
billy , why did you come back ?
all of lincoln county 's looking for you .
they ai n't go na find me .
i 'm gon na get anybody who had anything to do with it .
they 'll try .
maybe he wants the reward .
you know pat garrett etter than that .
look , pat , you saved my life ... and i 'm sorry i had to clout you .
put it own , pat .
you two walk away .
billy , all you 've done is bollix things up .
the governor 's appointed another murphy man sheriff .
so ?
but you 're affecting the lies o a lot of oher people .
maybe it funnels down to er , too .
there was a girl once ... back in texas .
i knew that the best thing for me to do was to turn my back .
let her marry a man tat 'd make her happy .
i 'll ride .
i did n' intend that you should hear that 
helps me understand a lot of things .
your father was a good man .
yes , he was .
i know you di what you thought was right for all of you ... and that 's what you 're doing now .
aye you should have let moter make her own choice .
she did .
so will i .

i should 've killed him when i had the chance down in guadalupe .
let 's get tarted .

and while you 're visiting the bank ...
i 'll be visiting mr. murphy .
i want you and some o the boys to deliver 'em to tucson .

i 'm gon na find him , and i 'm gon na see him dead .
hell , you know we 're going in the saloon with you .
whose move ?
wind 's from the north 
comaches call it tahnimara .
you know , pat ... here have been a lot of stories about john chisum .
about how wild he was .
those were wild times .
uncle john , billy bonney .
do n't ou ?
not in te important things .
like what ?
mr. chisum 's changed with the times .
about the indians and the territory .
he 's inependent ... and he likes to o things his own way , but he cares .
but you heard him , all he ares about is getting those men .
in a way , does n't it amount to the same thing ?
billy wants revenge .
and there 's a big difference etween love and infatuation .
johnny !
who is it ?
who 's don there 
billy ?
no , sir .
we just need the loan of a little dynamite .
dynamite ?
do n't you think you 've done enough ?
bonney .
billy , listen to me .

his whole thing is a travesy .
i do n't know what tavesty means , but i made a promise , too .

the arm has no jurisdiction here .
sheriff ...
i 'm unarmed , and i 'm coming out alone !

mr. mcsween , it 's our wife .
she 's going for chisum !
exactly , we 'll fight him on our own ground .
get some men  the river in case they come in that way ... and throw a barricade across that steet .
mr. mcsween .

going to warn the noon stage .
that 's what we 're doing .

and this is our national pastime , the game of baseball as played y the pittsburgh pirates .
i did n' know a thing about baseball .
the sports editor wanted the woman 's angle .
all i knew was tat pittsburgh was losing .
e 's out !
maybe even angry .
what 's the matter with you ?
he was safe by that much !
all right 
... on one base was too many .
you 're out !
great , that 's te irst time you three guys have been together all season .
the score at the end of the game was cincinnati 21 pittsburgh 2 .
you through , jenny ?
you hit them on a bad day .
yeah ?
yeah , they had a good one back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should talk to mcgovern .
everybody should talk to mcgovern once .
how do i get down there ?
you see that second tunnel here ?
yeah .
the door on the right is the pirate clubhouse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates ' exhibition this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the national league .
by the way , i ll not be with you for the balance of the season .
steps have been taken and briefly  your announcer has been canned .
i 'll still have my regular tuesdayniht broadcast and wednesday television and i shall continue to call the plas as i see them .
this is fred bayles saying , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
no , no , lady .
press .
gangway .
he 's unhappy .
i think it was a waste of time to send me .
i do n't know the gae and i have n't any story .
but i can tell you what 's wrong with the pirates that mcgovern person .
and all those nice , clean-cut youg men and he way he bulies them .
no wonder they make mistakes , anybody would .
i you ask me , the pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him .
hey , write it .
but he 'd sue us .
do your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anybody die out there ?
what a depressing job .
mr. kirney must have liked the story .
by jennifer paige  'household hints ' editor .
every morning about 1 1:00 , he left for the field .
this is the only hack in pittsburgh ?
you know the law , sonny .
you 're supposed to stay with your cab .
the bums do n't start until 1:30 .
his afternoons were spent like this .
the only place he was seen in public , outside the ballpark was john 's steak house .
i 'm going over and talk to him .
oh , stop .
well , there he is , cornered 
aiter ?
i 'm jennifer paige .
i wrote that story about you this morning , in the mesenger .
well , i began this way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evil-tongued orator of the baseball field , is a surly , unbred goat whose mouth shoul be washe out with a strong detergent .
you 're not mad ?
i do household hints on the ladies ' age .
but i have a few facts and figures about your --
a few staistics that might be interesting .
for instance , last season , minelli had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i 'll have to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's average is way down too , 93 points .
he 's the obituay editor .
what do you hear from want ads ?
well , i realize figures can be misleading but when an entire team goes as sour as the pirates well , i loo around for a reason , and i look right at you .
how are things in seveh place ?
catc me tonight , i 'm on in an hour .
i 'm gon na run you out of his town , maybe right out of organized baseball .
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in here a minute , huh ?
before i say good night , i would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unbiased observer who has the best interest of baeball at eart 
there is nothing personal in my feud ith guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final score :
the pirates had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all by yourself .
did you think that was second base ?
you re gon na catch a fly ball some of these days and knock your front teeth .
you fellas may not believe this but saul once pitched a two-hiter in a world series .
but he 's still in thee pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do n't you think you 're old for this patime ?
we used to have a guy like that in the three-i league .
put gunpowder in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern always bee like tis ?
sixteen years ago .
where 's my good-luck piece ?
well , where is it ?
of all the empty-headed , buck-braine trainers .
close your fat mouth .
i wan na talk to you .
an angel .
how 's that ?
i 'll mae him an angel .
where do you sit ?
sure , sure , gabriel .
trumpet player .
none of your lip , or i 'll boot you over the wall .
now you 're getting warm .
keep talking .
someone down there has been sending up prayers on your behalf .
one punch !
before he answers those prayers he 'd like to clean you up .
there 's certain rules .
i 'll give them to you fast .
quit making life miserable for everybody around you .
why ca n't i see you for one moment ?
stay where you are .
stand still and listen or i 'll blast you with a bolt of lighting .
now , do n't rile me , boy .
just behave yourself and we 'll get along fine .
lay off swearing and fighting , and i 'll win you some ball games .
you 'd like to win a penant again , would n't you ?
how about that ?
all right , aloysius , you trusting soul .
what kind of a miracle ?
wait a --
you 're out .
safe .
out .
i was about to suggest that possibly you erred on that decision 
yes  sir .
on the road , they won 10 games straight .
the team was sixth when they played the braves in boston .
a hard-fought game .
boys , boys , please , take it easy .
now , i 'll handle this .
let me --
ten straight games , and ou had to go and blow it .
now , look , i --
take off your hat .
i heard hat you said .
do n't repeat it .
now , look , the guy called me an ape .
certainly .
i 'll be tongue-tied .
shakespeare was n't .
okay .
i keep my trap shut , i win all my games ?
yes , it would .
but when you eed us , we 'll be in there pitching .
who 's we ?
me and my boys , the heavenly coir nine .
in heaven ?
there ' plenty of ball players in heaven .
what do you know .
but very few managers .
how do your boys help ?
who s on your squad , the heavenly choir ?
not bad .
we miht have run into each oher .
on what base ?
come on , a guy 's got a right to know his own angel .
your broken-down ball club is inning ball games .
i 'l see you around .
listen .
goodbye , and keep your nose out of things that do n't concern you .
all right , all right .
do n't go away sore , huh ?
sorry , mr. mcgovern .
sit down , son .
well , i told minelli i 'd have dinner with him .
i do 't know .
a left-hander ?
i do n't know , just call it a hunch .
he 's reading shakespeare .
the tempest , i had it in english iii .
he asked me to sit down with him .
yeah , tis morning he said hello .
he has n't chaned ...
waiter ?
you do what i said 
this is all right ?
thanks , but i 'd like to digest my dinner .
you did all right in the old days .
remember how we used to tear around ?
i do n't wan na think about you .
do you mind ?
your steak all right , sir ?
stay in there and keep it high .
if he feeds it to modbury low , he 'll put it in our laps .
oh , dear .

i 'd like to see a little girl .

he 's looking for a little girl .
i think you should talk to some of the others too .
oh , mr. mcgovern .

i came about the story in the paper .
yes , i read it .

well , i just want to ask er a couple of questions .
bridet , wait in my office .

yes .
federal case .
yeah .

would it do any har just to talk to her ?
i do n't want the child excited .
yes 
well , that 's just it .
why , it would be completely unexpected .
rothberg 's fast .
he 'd have made home easily .
yeah , well , rothberg happens to have a bad ankle .
oh , i 'll light a candle fo him .
it says yesterday you saw angels .
are you sure ?

if you want to know about angels , ask her .
she wrote the story .
look out , now , i 'm getting out of here .
now what did i do ?
what ca i do for you ?
honestly , i had o idea tat story would raise such a fuss .
if i had , i never would have -- o , what a mess tis place is .
i never would have written it .
oat , monkey , i 'm used to it .
if i were you , i 'd rotect myself , mcgovern .
ake a statement .

why not ?
miss paige , you 're ruining my carpet .
stuff them with newspaper , turn on the oven ad put them underneath .
yes .
did you teah it ?
what else does he say ?
joe , say goodbye to the lady .
goodbye .
hat 's wonderful .
but does n't he ever -- ?
miss paige , a man only swears when he ' annoyed .
well , frankly , i do n't see how you can be in a shambles lie this .
there might be an idea in that .
even when you were little ?
you had a boyhood , of course .
sounds like a nice little town .
did you play bal there ?
they had one of the saloons .
and one day they gave you a ball and a bat , and that 's how you got sarted .
not exactly .
any more down-memory-lane stuff you 'd like ?
no .
of all the stupid , asinine --
and how do i get to the cab ?
i weigh 110 pounds .
when the cleaning woman comes , tell her to bur te old papers .
put an air wick in to get rid of that cigar smell --
scour the ashtrays with ammonia .

burgundy .
she can call me at the office , extension 1173 .
there .
i could be a big help to you .
just what i always neede , a girl with turned-up shoes , 110 .
yeah .
if i took her to the ball game and we sat in the grandstand out of the sun she would n't see any angels .
i 'd write the story just that way , and hat 'd be the end of it .
can i ?
all right , run along .
comb your hair , put on a hat .
bridget and i go pretty chummy during the game , exchanging girlis confidences .
vanilla oay ?
mac , i think that 's enough .
oh , jenny , how about dinner after the game ?
well , have fun .
that must be nice .
i mean , instead of having a lot of kids around all the time .
it depends .
i always say , why not live alone if you can live alone ?
take like if you have someone around the house all the time you could n't even come to the ball game when you wanted .
not unless i brought her with me .
wha 's the atter ?
who ?
tere they come , out on the field .
there 's no one .
you could n't possibly see anything here , do you hear me ?
they 're going .
jenny .
jenny  wait a minute .
honey .
honey , did you see any angels ?
how many were there , bridget ?
take this .
thank you .
what did you do to her ?

why 'd you wat to drag her out there ?
i did n't drag her , she was dying to go .
ine ep .
mcgovern 's angels srike again .
what you tring to do , laugh me out of baseball ?
were they boy angels or girl angels ?
sore , huh ?
they were n't groundkeepers ?
or they were peanut vendors ?
mr. mcgovern and miss paige , they 'd like to ee bridget .
oh , please .
organically , se 's fine .
he can do no harm , he 's an excellent man .
you understand , do n't you ?

miss paige too ?
me too .
now , i thin you better get some sleep .
this story became a national issue .
everyone was taking about angels .
if mcgovern eeds any extra angel , we 'd be glad to give him a couple of ous .
ty cobb , one of baseball 's all-time greats .
well , all i can say is that this game of baseball has certainly changed .
songwriter harry ruby , composer of three little words america 's numbe one baseball fan .
you now , i think this angel stuff s pretty sound .
thanks .
ow , if you 'll just go back to your seats so everybody can see .
just turn this knob , see ?
now watch .
the monster is rying to put on a leg-crusher .
very educational .
eah .
when the pirates climbed into third place , the newspapers laid off mcgovern .
wait , let him hit away .
stay in there , lou .
safe .
do n't you like it ?

thattagirl .

yeah , brignole smells great .
mrs. harkrider oates of rawson avenue .
is that so ?
ell , we won again today , did n't we ?
yeah , we did .
i 've heard some talk .
just a few weeks ago we were lat .
wonder how it happeed .
angels .
right thee .
me ?
sure , the pirates are playing as a team .
because you 're not osing your temper , and yeling your head off and swinging on eople .
you should turn the other cheek .
there 's two schools of thought on that .
my school recommends getting in the first punch .
well , what do you now , a baseball .
jennifer sent it into the clubhouse and all the pirates signed it .
see 
all except mr. hellman .
it 's just what i wanted .
what about grace ?
grace who ?
you lead off .
o , lord , make us truly thankful for these thy gifts which we are abou to receive .
amen .
no , no , it 's delicious .
oh , no do n't .
keeps men at home , does it ?
could it have been racid ?
how long have you had it ?
in the bottle in the cupboard .
i rub it in my glove .
keeps the leather soft .
i got ta put it someplace .
well , it certainly does n't do anything for veal .
the peas ae fine .
i should have looked at the botle .
now , wait , wait .
do n't lose your head .
how 's that , all right ?
yeah , yeah , keep moving .
i do n't like to intrude , but may i have your autograph , mr. mcgovern , on a check ?
repairing bridgework , $ 180 .
just send me the bill , first of the month .
look at my --
will you stop ?
i thougt you 'd like to see what you 're paying for .
look , blow , huh ?
please .
oh , sure , sure .
do n't worry .
what ?
no .
great shape .
sure , be a nice guy .
nobody 's bohering you tonight .
nobody will .
if any party tries to bother me , i 'll hook him in the mouth 
now , wait a minute --
you stay where you are .
you 'll have to carry her .
up e go .
thank you .
oh , no , no , i just --
right up to bed now , dear .
good night .
tat 's a sweet kid , that one there .
nices time i ever had .
well , thanks .
they all seem to want tiny babies now .
i 'd be afraid .
well , it woud present certain problems .
there 's no law against it , of course .
thanks .
well , like a fathe .
oh , well , i do n't have to tell you , but that 's all over , believe me .
it 's a thing of the past .
no language , not even one fight .
good night , sister .
good night , mcgovern .
she 's really a sweet child .
have you ever thought of adopting her ?
who , me ?
well , this is where i live .
what kind of problem ?
problems .
bet that 's the first black eye you 'e had in years .
you 'd better go home and fix it .
look , you make a move , i 'll make a move , huh ?
there wa a girl in saint paul , the nicest girl i ever knew .
i can imagine .
good night .
sister ?
in september , the pirates met the giants in the final series .
tay there , oy .
make him pitch to you .
two and two , boy .
make him pitch to you .
how do you feel ?
it 's nothing .
did it again , id n't i ?
why did i have to go and wave at you ?
were am i having dinner ?
you 're not oing anyplace except home .
hi , guffy .
nice catch .
you okay ?
i 've been hit in the head 20 times .
i feel fine .
you speak to angels ?
where they runnig ?
is n't it wonerful ?
his latest peccadillo , an admission to the pres that he converses with angels ... .
you could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he now commands .
i would like to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us your name , please ?
i 'm a groundskeeper at braves field , up i boston .
will you please tell us what you saw in braves field about seen weeks ago ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern .
after the game .
sitting on second base .
and what was he doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
there was n't anyboy there .
and when he was sitting on second base talking o somebody who was n't there , where was he looking ?
up .
but one thing he said was , i have a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. comissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable an to hang around second base at night and talk to angels ?
muc as i hesitate to say this i think that mr. mgovern should take a long , log perhaps permanent rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a bal game , so hooray .
i tell you , it 's making me jumpy .
every time i go after a ball , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over something .
for two cents , i 'd quit right now .
shut u .
you watch mcgovern looking over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trying to be a right guy .
your job is to got out and play ball .
keep your mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he comes .
and here 's a flash that was just handed to me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh tonight .
with he pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon .
with this hanging over their heads , there 's no telling what they 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
they 're getting nervous .
not that i blame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't worry much about it .
it 's only natual at a time like this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , that so ?
you know , i used four thi afternoon .
who do i start tomorrow ?
yeah .
well , i would nt worry about it .
even i could n't ake im look good 
they wan na send him to the minors .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around next season .
yeah .
at least , we used to be .
i was there .
excuse me 
good night , guffy .
this wa  commissioner 
gentlemen , i have an appointment with all parties concerned tomorrow a 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidence , i have nothing to say .
... tomorrow for the ennant .
i 'm aare of that .
think this is the proper time for the investigation ?
my dear lady  any time 's the proper time when the situation warrants it .
baseball is for the people who support it .
from new york , sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to them ?
originally  ma worshipped the sun , the moon , stones , trees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child will run to its parent so will a man turn for comfort to a belief in angels .
and en this belief takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professioal opinion ?
m. commissioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eusace danforth , trinity church .
rabbi allen hahn , temple israel .
how do you do ?
father o'houlihan , church of our lady , queen of the angels .
getlemen , just ake yourselves comfortable .
mr. commissioner ?
well , what do you think ?
do you suppose there might be angels ?
right to left .
to deny te existence of angels is to deny the word of the holy bible which is specific on the subject .
from the ancient hebrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sons of god .
thank you , rabbi .
it was an angel who guided the children of israel to the promise land .
the angel of the lord ecampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them .
seeing as ho thee are coves of angels flitting through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new testamets i do n't see how i can get out of aying i believe in them .
i imagine the commissioner oes too .
oh , please , just leave me out of this .
mr. commissioner ?
is i likely one of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like gufy mcgovern ?
is it possible that angels would aid and comfort such a man ?
thank you , gentlemen .
if dr. blane would care to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
however --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?
mr. mcgovern , what are you afraid of ?
all ight 
bridget white , 8 years old .
st. gabriel 's home for orphan girls .
does n't everyone ?
no .
they were helping the pirates .
you 're quite sure about that ?
you would n't just make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certainly , certainly , certainly .
no .
because mr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angel would be proud to talk to a nice man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , please .
what are you talking about ?
i will decide what is evidence here 
suppose i did ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nothin definite .
i do n't know if the cout will let me have her .
i 's touching .
coe on , stop that .
stop that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think , in view of the facts all things cosidered this case is dismissed .
hey , fellas , what 's with guffy ?
sure  sure .
he was okay all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , you heard what the fella said .
just stick to your driving , will you ?
i ony hit him once or twice .
because when you busted that bridgework  you also buste our agreement .
from now on , you 're on your own .
it 's o joke 
you ca n't walk out o me now .
i need you .
do n't worry , you 've been on your own a ot the last eight week .
i do n't like to be on my own .
you used to be .
you 've learned something , guffy .
we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , ca n't make it .
tell that cab driver to slow down .
so long , guffy .
come back here a minute , will you ?
the boys in the press box are asking .
hey wan na know who 's gon na pitch .
let ' do it , boy .
for new yok , barberry catchig , toley pithing .
hellman ?
take care of the bullpen , will you , boy ?
yeah , sure .
ad it 's over the let-field wall for a home run .
safe .
there 's another hit .
see any angels ye ?
new york 1 , pittsburgh nothing .
ome on , vince boy , let 's go to work .
get a hit , boy .
you 're out .
all right , only one away .
lay into it , tony boy .
ay into it .
knock it out of the park .
mandekic pulls up safe at second .
two away and rube ronon coming up .
all right , rube .
all right , let 's get out .
let 's go .
here we are at the to of the ninth , the fina frame with a score still pitsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
one away .
seems to be giving him some trouble .
either it 's pain or those giant averages .
and he takes his base .
hit by a pitched ball .
well , helman seems to be losing control in there .
leaping high in the air and spearing the ball .
he 'll never make it .
ball one .
take him out !
get him out of there !
the fans are yelling to take hellman out .
get him out of there !
get him out of there !
and those pirate fans are reall mad now .
get him out of there !
take him out !
yank him !
what do you think , saul ?
i 'm tired , but i 'd sure like to try .
it 's your ball game .
he 's leaving hellman in .
coming up to the plate now is dobbie roscalla who leads the eague in runs batted in .
if he bats one now , mr. mcgovern had better leave town .
strike !
oh , if he ever connected with tha one ... .
he 's a very tired pitcher right now .
for what ?
pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
and of course , a pennant for the pirates .
well , somebody must have helped me , not only on the ball field either .
i wonder who they were .
walter johnson , john mcgraw , christy mathewson eddie collins , lou gehrig , babe ruth .

de nada .
ood morning , ms. bartlett .
ooh , this ca n't be good .

it 's not something i 've kept u with .
did you know we have a ninth-grade dace team
and our squad 's been a bit , uh ...
ok , we have a statewide reputaion
they have the enthusiasm .
all they 're lacking is a coach .
dancing 's a part of my past .
studies show that participating
in extracurricular activities
i understand .
well , do me a favor .
um ...
are you gon na do it ?
are you gon na coach us ?
i really think i should become more proficiet
some of the really popular teachers around here do it .
i 'd like tat .

all of you , take a eat .
i can not dance sitting down .
white ocks , and clean tennis shoes .
like i 'm really gon na be scrubing my sneaks .
she 's worse than zavala .
is this dance team or boot camp ?
sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i had to drop off my brother at my aunt 's house .
tardiness is uacceptable .
no excuses .
that leaves us out .
let 's get out of here .
anybody else wan na leave ?
come on down and play your usic .
choreo -- what ?
somebody had to be .
as i was trying to tell you the other day ,
if we do n't have a little faith in these kids ,
how can we expect them to believe in themselves ?
where do you suggest we go ?
well , i do n't -- sir , it was your office
we 'll take the north end .
you can have the south end ,
ok , guys 
player :
sorry !
whoops .
obviously this is n't gon na work .
obviously .
you were here first .
ood point .
â™ª come on â™ª â™ª come on â™ª â™ª come on â™ª â™ª ai i â™ª
â™ª yeah â™ª
that was great .
what about me ?
well , i aleady know you can dance , miss salinas ...
what i do n't know is whether o not you can be part of a team .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
oh , and one more thing ...
i do n't compete unless i plan to win ,
so tomorrow we 'll meet on the track .
3:30 sharp .
if you 're gon na be late , do n't bother to come at all .
one more lap .
did we join the track team or the dance team ?
oh , ms. bartlett , i seriously do n't mean any disrespect ,
but our first dance competition is in 2 1/2 weeks .
well , considering i have n't been around this kind of meet
i was sort of hoping we could figure that out together ...
my sister taught it to me .
go , yoli .
go  yoli .
go , yoli .
that 's so tired .
sorry , do n't think so .
like , up !
yeah , girl .
let 's ty it .
guys , she 's just showing off to make the rest of us look stupid .
well , you know what ?
wy do n't you pack up your attitude and get lost .
why do n't you back off before i make you back off .
hey !
excuse me !
thank you .
mr. zavala 's looking for them .
i hear a lot of schools do that .
either way , we 're toast .
what are you talking about ?
please .
excuse me , but it makes more sense o start out modestly
than it does o get in over our heads .
you 're the coach .
ms. barlett ?
i 'd like to introduce you to my parents .
hi .
this has been so good for alyssa .
with our high hopes for college ,

i do n't hate it , esmeralda .
is that how it seems ?
what ?
well , me and the other girls were talking ,
and do n't take this the wrong way or anything ,
but it feels like there 's a whole lot more you could teach us ,
and for soe reason ...
you 're holding back .
i just need to get my backpack .

yeah , i know what you mean .

ohh .
what if we raise the money ourselves ?
and we can sell food and stuff .
we have a lot to do in the next 2 weeks .

by taking advantage of your background ?
i did i since i was old enough to walk .
the washing machine .
a-and how 'bout the merengue , like this ?
anybody else have something ?
my parents do the cha-cha .

exactly .
he 's now one of the hotshots on te web .
and music ites .
and ?
and tey 're looking for a hea
hmm .
enough .
boby 'll double it -- at least !
but no one with your skills or experience .
now with this teaching thing on top of it ...
they even have an offie in london .

it 's only the term progress report ,
not an actual report card .
yeah , but even he would n't kick her off
it 's always been a pain !

yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,
and i 'll check her calculations 
then you can talk to her math teacher ,
see if he 'll raise her grade to a d .
that could work .
but you have to get her to take it very seriously .
if yolanda does n't deliver an accurate tabulation ,
she 's off the dance team .
i like your optimism .
thanks 
boy :
enjoy .
hey 
yolanda !

uh  welcome to my ... home .
boop .
it 's rainy season .
ah , so good for the skin .
oh , uh , no shoes in house .
buffrog , wonderful home .
oh , thank you .
is a bit of a mess right now .
please take a seat .
oh !
i thought everyone knew that .
yo , buffrog , where them babies at ?
babies , say hello o queen butterl .
star , i have been so worried about you .
why ?
i 'm good .
well , when ludo took your castle ,
toffee is dead .
toffee not dead .
toffee inside ludo .
papa !
we have to go save him .
he is your husband !
star , i 've made my decision .
we stay here .
ecuse me .
yes .
thank you .
i 'm sorry .
yeah , we all are .
of course .
you have plan 
i ave plan .
okay .
distract me from wat ?
bad choices in past .
uh , we could smash bugs .
great idea , buffrog .
our dauhter is very strange .
we have many option of board game .
mmm , interesting .
okay , the rules of pudle defender are , uh ...
um ... the rules are ...
yes ?
the evil bloodthirsty mewan , that 's you , mus ty and sneak past watchful monster parent , that s me .
that is horrible !
one , two , three , four , fie , ix , seven .
you are filth mewman .
for better eating of monster babies .
is this fu ?
did you hear something ?
i hear nothing .
can you name a time when monsters have ever done such a thing ?
that idea had to come from somewhere .
because it was in a children 's board game ?
i just think that monsters would have less of a reputation if they did n't act so bloodthirsty all the time .
monsters only act that way to protect their babies from mewmans .
you a not understand , but monsters ill do anything for our children .
do n't talk to me about what i 'm willing to do .
to protect star from toffee !
but i have o keep my child safe at all costs !
you insult me , queen moon .
my buffbabies , they are my life .
i should have realized .
you 're a parent , too .
i ca n't believe you 're taking her side .
kids .
what 's their plan , huh ?
just avoid your problems to death .
great plan .
it 's a errible plan .
i 've got big plans .
but no , they suck me in here .
i 'm thinking .
i have n't told my dad yet .
there 's something else i have n't tod him .
all clear .
wow .
so what 's te big plan ?
the plan for beating toffee ?
i kinda just go for it .
oh , my precious little ribbit babies .
do n't you worry .
i 'm very worried .
i 'll see you after i destroy toffee .
this is my astle .
i do nt want to see a single butterfly face .
what am i lookig at here ?
no butterflies .
get that out of here .
is that the last of it ?
and with that , everything in my kingdom is in order .
no , no , not again !
okay , a fe kinks to work out , but overall , the citizens of mewni love me .
those especially .
here , i 'll show you .
greetigs , young man 
no , my lord , they just do n't like you .
oh , honey , look at all that great stuff .
wow , we should load up .
finally , someone with tase .
his will look great in our foyer .
it 's not for sale .
that 's it .
now , how about a nice king ludo coffee mug ,
yeah , we do n't like you ;
nobody likes you , dude .
see what i 'm dealing with here ?
what do you want ?
i 'm not going anywhere with ou .
that 's too bad .
it 's urgent royal business .
why would i do that ?
i do n't even like you .
say good-bye to your freedom .
ha ha !
ho ho .
ludo .
dude , ludo 's gone completely nuts .
you 're telling me .
oh , i can ... almost taste it .
a ha !
ha ha !
nice work , marco .
butter yourself up , and i 'll see if i can figure a way out of here .
the dungeon has air conditioning ?
it 's a dungeon , not a torture chaber .
nice .
how are those shackles coming ?
i do n't think this is going to work .
river , did you eat the butter , river ?
this is n't your fight .
sh .
ruberiot ?
quiet , dude .
whoo , how 'd i ever live without a solid gold toilet ?
what the heck is going on here ?
she was miming that we seep in his royal bed .
those illagers are so ungratefu .
i 've got that whole levitatoing king river to do .
i 'm gon na have to stop you right there .
a heavy burden , es , but that 's what it means to be an artiste .
and you 're a buffoon .
the buffoon is merely the facade for my pointed social commentary .
that 's what makes me a true artist .
no as much of an artist as the mime .
i 'm not a soldier either , but there ' a time when you have o get off the sidelines and get involved .
if the four of us work together , we can save the true king of mewni .
no , see , i would n't use that hand gesture .
it 's just been done to death .
you all make me sick .
what ?
who 's here ?
who 's in my royal edroom ?
you wroe a song about me ?
uh , shone his grace upon us all
i did do that , did n't i ?
to protect us
great kig ludo is great

and meni has never een better
oh , great king ludo is great
what ?
i 'm the buffoon ?
you 're te buffoon .

yeah , well , yours are hack .
oh , good one .

spider !

she 's a princess winning battles

the cure for cancer has been discovered .
te cure for virtually evey form of chronic disease was discovered even earlier , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
although his discoveries were adhered o by hitler and the nazi party ,
dr. gerson 's family paid the ultimate price .
r. gerson 's seven sibling perished in the holocaust .
dr. gerson 's unprecedented gift of healing the hopeless lives on .
narrated by dr. a.f .
tese scenes before your eyes would be incompehensible 100 years ago .
arm air moves north and airborne transport of dioxins eventually reache the once pritine arctic .
artic peoples are showing major health problems , from bioaccumulation of dioxins .
and from there , the poisons travel up the food chain to polar bears , seals and whales , and then to people 
oe thousandth of one millionth of a gram of dioxin can cause harm to the body 
trees , the very living organisms that clean the air and produe the oxygen we breathe , are sliced off at the ground with the most careless abandon if there is a limiteless supply .
at one point , it had been said that a tree squirrel could jump from tree to tree following the ardwood with coniferous forest belts fro the east coast to the west coast .
they do not develop special functions .
as a boy in germany , in he lae 1800 's ,
day by day , he gained insight in the relationships between plants and the nutrients they gained from the soil .
under a microsope , actively cells known as chloroplasts , busily undertake the poess of manufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculous pocess of photoynthesis begins .
thee live cells and enzymes in vegeation are the nucleus of what we need to ingest to heal a sick boy or maintain a healthy one .
max gerson suffered from severe and repeated migraine headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days .
after three years of experimenting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved , but a skin tuberulosis also disappeared .
446 of the 450 patients recoered .
dr. gerson ad his wife gretchen had three daughters :
joanna , gertrude and the youngest , charlote .
of all the children , charlotte took a special interest in her father 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had spread throughout europe .
when dr. schweizer was 75 years old , he came to dr. gerson with diabetes and was also cured .
lighting up the switchboards at abc non-stop .
out of control !
unbelievable !
and the pepper neely aticancer bill of 1946 , document no .
now married , she had a son , howard , and a daughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her father to publish his first book in 1958 :
at the time of his death , in 1959 ,
te files have been preserved by his dauhte charlotte who is now in her eighties .
charlotte carries on te work of her fathe through the establishment of the
we have some letters here from albert schweitzer ... and they had a very active correspondence , my father , dr. gerson and albert schweitzer , and his family were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter , he epressed his admiration of the specific cancer researh that dr. gerson did .
of course , all the letters are in german and i 'm trying to translate some .
as well a the remarkable results that he saw , not only ith cancer patients , but with his wife , who had tuberculosis , and their daughter , who had a very undecipherable skin disease .
laws in virtually all the united states prohibit any other treatment for cancer other than radiation  cheotherapy and surgery .
on this particular day , two medical doctors from czechoslovakia , consult with anita wilson , who is executive director , about the possibilities of opening a ospital in czechoslovakia .
... you boost the immune system , you rid the body of those years and years of accumulated toxins from the way we lie ...
not a day goes by that we do n't hear something from a patient or a physician , or a group of people perhaps interested in staring a clinic or a support group .
in high school i was in one of those dieters anorexic and bulimic ... bulimia when it was n't really written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fight for that .
a year later , that same tumor , the one that they thought coul be a metastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 years old , my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
after being on the therapy for about a year , i noticed oe day when i was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bone in the right side of my nose for the first time .
another staff member , susan brant , charlotte gerson 's niece , at one time , was diagnosed with an inoperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 years ago , and so ,
i can sit here and say hat i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and the biopsy .
they determined i ha three sections of cancer , malignant cancer in the rostate and they wanted to take the prostate out the next day .
i talked with gerson institute and with the hospital in mexico , and talked with the doctors and the patients .
after three months , i found that i was loosing weight readily , lost 27 pouns , and after 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me was the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the dotor thought i was great , he said i had a better psa than he did .
i am not an easy one to get along with , because i 'm a maverick ..
a particular type juiing method must be utilized , however , implementing a grind and press device .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as fast as alcohol .
this juicer was originally designe in the 1930 's by a scientific researcher , name dr. norman walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be captured in a lass of juice in minutes and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the patient .
as you an see , an entire day with the juices is euivalent to an enormous amount of food , which weights in a little over 20 pounds a day 
but just eating different is ot enough to hea a seriously ill patient .
nutrition is only half of te equation .
resolving the acumulaed toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentless .
realizing this , charlotte gerson included a chapter aout it in a book about the gerson therapy , that uderlines , in layman 's terms , the priciples of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily toxic ingestion or precursor hi be when you get i your automobile prior of even starting the engine , you have already ingested dioins
) given off rom the dasboard to the ancy ?
suppose you continue your journey and sop at a motel for the evening .
once inside , from the power switch activating electromagnetic fields , to the microwae radiation leaking rom the oven , as it peares your plastic wrapped , heavily salted and preserved nutritionless instant dinner , to the carcinogenic cemicals in the soap on the bathtub brim .
you are inundated with hits .
the soap and shampoo are just the start , however , of what will be absorbed through your skin once you turn on the bath tube faucet , which will provide chlorinated and fluoidated water to help you get clean .
chlorine and fluorine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toilet seat as been sanitized for our protection .
but what oes that mean ?
the toilet paper will also smear chemicals from solvents to dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroom sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water fom a cheaply manufactured plastic cup , that allows serious toxins from the plastic itself into the water .
the artificial sugar and the artificial cream as a nice touch to the mix .
) that was the cell phone repeated , lengthy uses have shown to interfere with and challenge the neuroransmitters of the brain .
as we finally turn off the light to sleep , electromagneti fields from the clock next to your head will almost imperceptibly influence the slumber and dreams one hopes to have .
even the film to make his movie uses extremely poisonous chemicals in its manufacture and processing .
as ridiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one more hit for your boy to fight .
the good news is that most of these toxins can be removed with strict adheence to the gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comes into play .
uless it gets some help .
when coffee enemas are utilized in conjuction with juice drinking it i detoxification at its finest .
three tablespoons of dip ground coffee are dropped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is turned down .
once the cofee is done , it is strained into a measuring cup .
additional water may be added to make up for water lost in steam in making the coffee .
once he coffee cools to body temperature it is poured into the enema bucket .
tat time , the plastic stopper at the end of the hose is slit back to release the air in the end of the tube .
simultaneously , he liver in turn excretes poisons into the colon for expulsion .
hundreds of olistic physicians , in the u.s. and around the world , have been trained by chalotte in the gerson institute 
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united staes to treat and cure a diseased patient in a hospital with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides in southern califoria , it 's easy to her for drive regularly to advise and encourage the endless numers of patients that arrive at the hospital in tijuana , mexico .
under the care of a staff of physicians and nutritionists , most patients who came in with inoperable cancers and with no hope of recovery , leave within 1 to 4 weeks to continue the treatment at home .
afer only 2 weeks on the therapy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer now .
do you have chilren ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i wa in alaska , here i am from and i was diagnosed with a ...
you were diagnosed how , did you had a biopsy ?
he ordered the biopsy and the pathology came back with a carinoma .
and you had ascites sweling ?
i had 10 pounds of ascites swelling in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy could also dry it up .
now several doctors have told me that .
how much ?
one course .
after i as finished with my chemo and it did n't ork .
then ou came here .
wow !
and then it 's been about 2 cm a day .
ever since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typical and norma one .
always seeking new ways to cheer up , empower and restore hope to the supposed hopeess ,
within the pages of each booklet are personal biographies and the medical records of recoverie .
healing lung cancer respiratorydiseases
my dad ha told me about the gerson theray .
m daddy told me about this , and during the research , i found out that the best way to cure yourself is to do it the healthy way .
not put more poisons into your body that would kill you .
and that what chemo did ... it kills your boy , the good cells and the bad cells .
whe i go down to ucla , i too did all my blood work and my ris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ca 't believe you 're one of m cancer patients.
that just reall made me feel good every time i went in tere .
i did not look like a normal cancer patient .
to me , i have charlotte and the gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heart , just do n't think i 'd be here .
when i was diagnosed with cancer ,
i knew of three other ladies that had the same cancer i had .
i as 12 years old when my mom was diagnosed with cancer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart
i 'm steve , debbie 's husband .
when i firt came into debbie 's life , it was several years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ...
there is for charlotte the reluctance to get emotionally attached to any single case , since there have been thousands , but occasionally , a phone call would leave her effervescent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cance seen only in children .
it was disovered that the lung was too ridden with cancer .
and more horrifying still was the reveation that the cancer had made it all the way to the ight chamber of her heart .
the sureon than opened her sternum and started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from thee , he moved to her heart and a openheat surgery removed the tumor from the right heart chamber .
again and again , with a vengeance 
now , even her liver was invaded by cancer .
) the doctor said , ( ?
) children told us that she is not gon na be able to ahm ... the ancer is back and she is not gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or oething , we were down , at the gerson , and ahm ... and e were doing the diet there for about 2 or 3 eeks , i think .
) i had come down there sick myself ... ?
i had regular disinfections all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and e 've been doing the treatment for two years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and life began to change for the entire family .
een the dog was happy again .
but the poisons are now being excreted and er body is building itself back up with powerful enzymes and the nutrient forces .
ut where stephanie 's orthodox medical doctors had only given her 6 months to live two years ago , she has now astounded them , and of course , confounded them .
i feel very healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
charlotte observed that they run around playing and enjoying life  as thoug the scourge of cancer had never visited this resilient chil .
there are also non-toxic , non-pharmaceutical supplements called biologicals , tat are utilized in a greater or lesser measure , depending upon the patient 's condition .
one of the most important of these is a natural potassium , mix of potassium gluconate , acetae , phosphate in equal amounts , that dr. gerson put together after doin nearl 300 experiments .
this is extremely beneficial to restoring the potassium in the body 's cells systems that was lost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sodium , such as found in table salt and hidden within everything , from processed foods to toothpaste .
table salt is a poison .
the use of iorganic sodium causes displacement of potassium found naturally in human cells , leaving them vulnerable to attack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's poassium supplement is dissolved in a quarter of distiled water and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , essentially the leftovers , are used for fertilizer and animal food .
a true miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did in the past , really understood the value o flax oil .
that as n't anything that ...
actually , they educated us more than we could even educate tem on the value and the benefits of how flax oil really helped the modaities .
the use of these atura , holistic supplements on the gerson therapy is part of customization to the specifi degenerative conditions of the patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but they ca sometimes fortify gerson 's therapies effectiveness .
when it omes to helping the body recover , whether from a common cold or cancer , today , ove half the medical visits in the u.s. and canada are to alterative therapies , despite the efficacy .
and in the u.s. especially , it is estimated that our understanding and acceptance of holistic medicine is still 75 years behind the rest of the world .
medically , we trail many third world countries .
it is imperative that patients have access to such food choices .
the organic food market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , ainl as the result of the eonomic la of supply and demand .
mass-produced commercialy grown fruits and vegetables produced with chemicals and sprays are fertilized with only hree minerals :
but the plant , like te human body , really needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertiization process of commercially gown cops , the plants were sick and ust be kept on life support with more toxic chemicals until market .
this proess is now repeated in the consumer , in simplified terms .
i know that in the past people ad diffeent prospectives of what was truly organic , and we would have some growers come in and say well , their grows are organic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules ad regulations such that anybody who did want to become organic would truly be in the same playing field and would have to abide by the same sets of rules .
we have found that the atributes of truly doing a certified organic is beneficial not only for the people , but also for the ground , etc .
so , that 's something that we truly ook forward to expand upon and to provide for the local community  and aso for the people throughout the united states and world wide .
by popular demand , undoubtely based largely on the discovery of the incomparable better flavor o fresh organic produce , oganic farmers frequently start popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their produce for their neighbors benefit , before shipping their product to an ever increasing world market .
charlotte gerson follows the gerson therapy herself as a life style of prevention .
she as no one as millions of others have discovered that the principles of the gerson therapy raise the bar for getting the most of life .
now , in her eighties ,
using the gerson therapy , one need never again worry by dieting to loose o gain weight .
obesity is almost alwas nothing but hunger .
and people are very hungry because , eve though they are full , they are not truly nourishe .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , where the dead food lies in state .
for many , it also grants tem a higher ibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life .
dayto-day life experiences are fraught with perpleities that can be addressed to a negative or a positive way .
for eample , cocaine and heroine addicts destroy their craings for drugs in usually less than 72 hours on the therapy .
the only obstacle that arrests or commences to subtract those books is long term lack of nutrients and environmenal toxicity .
when the brain detoxifies , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional fo lift .
the body is a miraculous in its design ad flexibility .
these chemicals are foud in virtually all municipal drinking water and inflicts severe damage in the body 's endocrine system , particularly the throid gland .
but there are other semi hidden dangers i ingestion of daily poisons that can be avoided .
well , the dental amalgam is now comig more and more into the floor , even while dentists used to dispute it .
but in your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clearly demonsrated that lot of children have seizures and all kinds of mental disturbances from the detal amalgam .
the danger of the illegal street drugs in public and private schools is heavily publicized .
he trouble with ritalin is sometimes ... first of all , it 's never been tested on hildren under 6 .
and they 're giving it now to children in preschool and kindegarden .
and the american services like the army , navy and the air force , will not accept any person into the service ho is ever been on ritalin , because they 're uncontrollable .
during sleep , not only is te nervous system replenished like a storage battery being charged , but the bod rids itself of poisons , in a way that only sleep can accomplih .
an with the bombardment in daily life of hits to their ystems in modern society , repeated lack of it can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a child 's bain development .
the developing brain of a child at this time in human hisory , must clear a number of hurdles in a bid for genetic normalcy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially lead fom older homes , where leaded paint was used pirated in the 1970 's .
remodeing and sanding of older homes produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
these airborne heavy metals , along with numerous other chemicals in the food and water , are now unintentionally passed on to the nex generation .
but the removal , known as chelation , of such toxins , even heavy metals , such as lead , is possible with close adherence to the gerson theray .
even the body itself can overproduce a substance tha becomes poison in excess , in stressful situations , if the liver is unhealthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called adrenaline .
in an occupation that demands split second life or death decisions , the adrenaline flows in excess , and if not neutralized , can poiso the body into illness .
the potency of this substance is profound .
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands , which are located on little caps on top of each kidney , it enters the bloodstream an is diluted instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength 
the purpose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and proect oneself in threatening situation .
the largest gland of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able to neutalize the secretions .
many people have liver disease and do n't even know it .
for the detection of a liver problem via illness requires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity before symptoms become detecable .
like many others who do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in the wildlife center , their health an reproduct ability must be maintained at highest levels .
eventually , they were unable to reproduce successfully .
clearly , all carnivore animals such as these ere designed to hunt and kill and survive on prey composed of flesh .
their teeth , somach acids and short digestive tract bear this out .
but the dissimilarities between wild meat eaters and humans do not end there .
invariably  some of them does n't pass through at all , but instead get snagged inside tiny pockets in the colon putrefying not for hours , but days , months and even years .
the pancreas wa never designed to break down animal protein or meat .
when meat ust be digested , the pancreas is diverted from its important protective purpose .
if we only eliminated the animal products from our diet , the odds of getting cancer , diabetes or heart disease and the pandora 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almot vanish .
but the tandard american diet , referred to as sad for short , has totally flipped that scientifically verifiable statistic uside down .
looking under a microscope , it is easy to see red blood cells floating around free .
surprisingly , some foods , like legumes , oybeas and soy products are either deficient in nutrients , or cause health degeneration , by blocking absorption of nutrients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespread .
it 's caused by milk drinking .
and the doctors give it for supposedly curing osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the body has to maintain homeostasis , it has to maintain a very exact level of alkalinity versus acidity .
where is it going to take calcium ?
it is not absorbable from milk , because in the milk with pasteurization and all , the enzymes are missing .
ad te body ca n't use it .
so , on the contrary , that adds to the problem .
i had canceled my health insurance when i wa 34 years old .
and he reason was not that i was very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not interested in a kind of hospital or medical treatment that might be covered by insurance because it s toxic , it 's drugs , it 's chemicals , and i have , you know ,
and over the years , i 've saved an average of us $ 2,000 a year .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .
even now , his application of this therapy is unrelenting .
today , gerson 's name and therapy is know ad honored world wide by holistic physicians , nutritionists and chiropractors .
he also authors features stories for the bi-monthly
thank ou very much , my pleasure .
nice meeing you .
charlotte 's daughter peggy , along with husband giuliano and daughter etha , who live i italy , also follow the gerson protocol .
giuliano , a poet , journalist  lecturer and author , recently wrote his own tribute about dr. ma gerson 's life , set as a novel .
this film would not e complete without a representative recovery from one of the most deadly cancer of all .
meet pat annie from british columbia , in canada .
she remains extremely busy .
pat radiates good health and has a deep conviction about certain priorities in her life .
ironically , he developed cancer after pat had recovered on the gerson theray .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas cancer , which is spread to my liver , gallbladder and sleen .
my husband jut would n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 days , the bleeding had stopped , the pain had stopped , i came home  get the therapy for 2 years ...
after three months , my doctors here wondered why i was still living .
he asked me if i would have a cat scan , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't want to know what you 're oing , just keep doing it .
i hope they appreciate me .
at the time i was fighting the pancreas cancer , we got a call from michael landon , you may remember him , he was on little house on the prairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
he would 't go down to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his family .
he went on to the toight show and e looked wonderful , and he said he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after he did this treatment
and said he knew that was the end , that he should have stayed with he gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind that he would be alive today if he had stayed with the gerson .
it is a medieval castle .
finally , after 75 years and tens of thousands of healed people , the world at last is embracing this answer to cancer .
and in recorded huma history there 's also triump ad hope over seemingly insurmountable ocietal , individual and environmental illness .

the purity and soundness of food is taking on a wole ne meaning and with every meal we are either digging our own graves with a silver ware , or ensuring a healthy , productive life for not only us , but our progeny .
your wealth , fame and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance .
your grudges , resentments , frustrations and jealousies will inally disappear .
so , too , your hopes , ambitions , plans and to do list will expire .
it wo n't matter whee you came from  nor on what side of the tracks you lived at the end .
even your ender and skin color will be irrelevan .
so , what will matter ?
how will the value of your days be measured ?
what will matter i every act of integrity , compassion , ourage or sacrifice that enriched , empowered and encouraged others to emulate your example 
what will matter is not your competence , but you character .
on nursing himself bac to health , he found the manuscript missing .
it took d. gerson a full year to reconstruct the manuscript for his towering classic cancer therapy , results of 50 cases.

his a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for the governement but mostly ...
mostly for a ... a hollywood studio .
this what at the time of the 'good neighbor ' policy ... and it was my task to make a large technical documentary o the subject of the carnival .
samba orchestra .
voodoo ceremonies , particularly in shango which are practiced ... up in the favelas , those strange , native settlements on the ... mountain , which ae right in the midst of rio .
he came to my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happens not only in south american governments , but also in film studios .
and the witch doctor assured me that this ... was deeply offensive and ...
and , i said i wa mot sorry about it myself and ...
i did want to finish the film and i did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the time ...
uh ... already areed on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finih , since so much effot had gone into it and i was pleading my cause for some time .
praying that we would be able to .
and , i came back to the office and found tha the doctor had gone ..
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
this was the mark of the oodoo .
the first story , 'my friend bonito ' , began shooting in mexico under the direction welles associate , norman foster .
as producer of 'it 's all true '
at the same time he was preparing to produce an act in the thriller 'journey into fear ' , ut his plans were about to change , dramatically 
and brazil 's dictator , getúlio vargas , ad nazi sympathizers in his governement .
so , the state department appointed welles , special ambassador to brazil .
we , the people of these united atios of america , now stand together .
we ought to know each other better than we do .
it was more of a cultural interchange .
i was told that it was my patriotic duty ... to go and spend a million dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
he had to get to rio in time to film the carnival .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent ambersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoining soundstages .
he did n't even have time to change his costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , the first part of the new latin ameican verion of 'it 's all true ' , was temporarily suspeded .
never to be resumed .
he inished shooting both films in time to leave for rio , but it was a real cliffhanger .
i went to the projection room at about two in the morning , no , four in the morning , and then gone on the plane and off to rio .
ask me again ... in six months .
the lights failed to arrive  so he filmed 'carnival ' with anti-aircraft lights borrowed from the brazilian amy .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to capture a hurricane .
people get tired , they fall asleep  they 're going to lean against a house , that 's it .
as it turned out i ecame fasciated with samba .
what was interesting were the samba clubs , and all of hat which would have organized and told to people , explained what it was , socially and all the rest of that .
welles had discovered what the true subject of his film would be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's backyard is n't exatly gala it 's even gayer than rio 's front lawn .
it 's set to music , but the music 's all its own .
rich ...
deep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vargas had demolished praça onze to build a new boulevard .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicolor cameras to commemorate the carnival of the streets now passing into history .
welles joined the people in their protest .
at the same time he began filming the story of anoter rotest which would be the third story of 'it 's all true ' .
a cry of outrage from the poorest of the poor that electrified al of brazi .
he first read about it in time magazine .
four poor fishermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demand that brazil 's president give their people , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazilian workers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the northeast , a incredible 1650 miles , without the aid of a compass , stopping along the way to find food and water .
jacar was the leader of the expedition but jerônimo , a man who ould neither read nor write , was the pilot .
their jungada was arried in triumph trough the streets .
three months had passed since their voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangaderos were still national heroes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnial ' the jangederos story would complete his latin america tilogy ... but jacaré 's politial activitie had made him a cause of concern for the vargas governement .
i think that the vargas govenement began to recognize the fact that this was not going to be a film that would bring tourists to brail .
i remember the night we tried to hotograph one of the tenement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us and after a siege of beer bottles , empties of course , stones , bricks , and i hate to think what else ...
we retreated to a more photogenic district .
and , it occurs to me that since man and the world have to live with one another and get along somehow ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , and the reaction is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and down 
they did n't even hear the samba music because it had n't been synched up .
and all i kept getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it might have been welles ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... the picture itself destroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a sunny , beautiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was full of sailboats , putting up sail , getting ready to reenact the jangaderos ... triumphan entry into rio harbor .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we were evastated .
he must have ade the decision at that point that he would make this film no matter what 
i 'm sure ... was haunted ... by the feeling .. that the picture did hae a curse on it .
a vice president wa sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and send everybody ome 
when we were recalled from brazi there was till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i took that and went up with dick wilson an a cameraman ... and we made the 'jangadero ' documentary .
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , following their voyage and all that 
and , it was tragic because they did not get .. what they ... went for .
it kept them poor , no matter how hard they worked .
it as to ... remind him of his promises .
welles devised a little love story .
to get extreme low angles , he would put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performances from people who had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a warime flight to the states .
once back , e learned that rko was not going to let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
and ... they ... made a great publicity of point of the fact that i had gone to south america without a script and thrown all this money away .
that ...
i never recovered from that ... from that attack .
he hired himself out for the first time as a movie star to option the footae from ro .
for four years he desperately sought financing to finish it 
i tried everything .
i was near it , near it , near it , an i wasted many ear of my life .
if i turned my back like they did on it , i would have been much better but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i went ad had one of the cans rinted u and found out that yes , there was some things of 'bonito , and there was some things of 'carnival ' .
it was orson welles .
ladies and gentlemen , here comes the samba now .
of course , we all live with our past but i try not to ... encourage it to misbehave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unpronounceable .
surdo ?
corret !
ladies and gentlemen , the ... tambourine is not a ... tambourine !
it 's just a rough frame with some kind of ( ?
cat skin !
pandeiro ?
-yes , something wrong , senor welles ?
oh , no ...
it 's all right now .
ladies and gentlemen , this instrument odly enough , is exactly like our tambourine !
well , that 's the way things are .
i ...
why ?
why ?
-well , because of the sound it 's making .
that 's a ..
yeah .
ganzá .
the gentleman here handles it with all the flare of a bartender shaking a cocktail shaker .
now ... we hear the cuica !
what 's that , carmen ?
cuia !
the cuica .
-cuica 
however , as you notice , it is n't beating like a drum .
one end is open .
when ou yank it back ad forth the ... that 's what you hear .
there you have it !
the rhythm of the samba .
brazilian babies can beat out samba rhythm before they can talk !
adio :
we 've spotted what appears to be a spacecraft just outside te surfline .
alert rescue and advise to remain on station for 45 minutes .
and we 'll squat 7700 for a radar ix .
radio :
oger .
effec pickup ad reovery .
base radar will vector .
come on !
let 's go !
ha !
ha !
yes , sir !
all right , open her up .
open it up !
welcome , gentlemen , to the united sta --
did you all the zoo ?
yes , sir , we 're in luck .
the apes will be hidden from the public .
they 'll be quarantined .
they need medical attention , it 's available right on the spot .
they are dressing up !
suitcase ?
uh ...
why did he do that ?
here you are , old fella .
have a banana .
zira !
i 'm yours .
i think they 're trying to be kind .
this cage stinks of gorilla .
cornelius , where are we ?
what 's appened ?
i know where we are .
i know what has happened .
in some fashion -- and i lack the itellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from earth 's future to earth 's past 
but we saw the earth destroyed .
only since seeing it , we have pased through a backward disturbance in time .
did you notice the date meter clickin down after the shock wave hit our ship ?
we have returned to earth nearly 2,000 years before its destruction .
apes , at this insant in time , can not yet talk .
oh , the driver gave me this report from te air base .
yeah , it 's the usual imitative behavior .
mimicking salutes , handshaking , siting on chairs , eating offplates with knives .
there was sort of
hi , dr. dixo .
the female 's a bit uppity , sir .
oh ?
i see you 've prepared the wisconsin multiphasic .
we 'll begin with tat .
all right , we 'll take the female first .
artur , would you set up a cha --
not a bite .
jut as you ordered .
we 'll offer the banana .
well , why does n't she take it ?
because i loathe bananas !
arthur , i think dr. branton needs some air .
zira , are you mad ?
i did not call her mad .
i hate deceit !
and how in the name ofgod are we to know hat unless we communicate ?
and we can lisen !
an we can watch .
primitive ?
ould n't test the intellience of a newt !
i am calm !
zira !
zira !
we 'll need a full autopsy .
let us know when he report comes in .
we will not hurt you .
poor d. milo .
doctor .
you killed him !
no , i did n't .
he did .
one of your own kind .
e 's a gorilla !
well , ook , there 's noing to be afraid of .
do you understand that ?
humans ?
i 'm a pyhiatrist .
my name is cornelius .
lewis dixo .
nobody 's going to believe this .
believe what ?
that primitive apes can talk .
primitive ?
uh ... well , i mean that in our , um ... primitive , um , civilization , apes just do n't talk .
may i say something ... personal ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm awae that what i ave to tell you may conceivably create
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was one of two that have been mising in space for over 2 years now .
have they identified the bodies , mr. president ?
zoo ?
what would astronauts be doing in a zoo , mr. preident ?
reporters :
general !
no commet .
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a little later , please .
reporter :
later 
and if the questions become less simple ?
and i am the animal pychiatrist who has been in charge of these 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
ha ha ha !
ha a ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect your wok , but if you think you 're going to turn a presidential inquir ino a entriloquist 's act , i have to inform you --
and i have o inform you , sir , that these two apes have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i repeat that they have the power ofspeech .
well , may we be told which is the female of the species ?
have you a name ?
certainly she can articulate , which , in itself , is extraordinary !
what is your name ?
zi-ra !
mechanial mimicry .
unique in an ape vocally , without a doubt , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
mr. chairman .
we 'll take that up later , your eminence .
cornelius , do you and your awfully wedded spouse speak any anguage other than english ?
what is english ?
i speak the language taught to me by my father and mother , who were taught by their
it has been the language ofour ancestors for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins , who can be sure ?
nonense !
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkered , pseudoscientific geese !
i 've examined thousands of them .
and until now , i 've only discovered 2 who could talk in my life .
god knows who taugh them 
where we come ro , apes talk .
humans are dumb 
i 'm not sure .
when the spacecraft first landed on our seaboard , it was dr. milo who salvaged it .
he studied it and halfunderstood it .
half ?
enough for dr. milo to be murdered in your zoo .
enough for my wife and i to be here now .
from where , cornelius ?
of course the female knows !
that does n't make any sense .
cornelius , you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpazees are pacifists .
in a spaceship .
gentlemen , do you have --
no comment .
no comment .
as head of this commission , it will be our duty to sit though the facts of this bizarre affair and pass our conclusions onto the president of the united states for implementation .
what a load ofhogger mogger .
dr. hasslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
no , gentlemen , no comment ... yet .
doctor .
you were marvelous .
they loved you .
but oly to lewis and stevie .
oh , zira .
well  you see ... we id know colonel taylor .
i mean , as a scientist , i sympathize , but i agree that tat 's a revelation the masses would not take kindly to .
i think you did the ight thing in denying knowledge of colonel taylor 
what ?
they would have asked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the windows of the spaceship ... we saw the earth ... destroyed .
i repeat , talke to the presidential commission of lquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the ale ape where he was from , the female replied , from your future .
would you believe that ?
i hink it is the only explanation .
but still something is missing - and that something is still his real self painting the second picture .
so he regresses further and paints a tird .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that time is like a freeway with an infinite number oflanes , all leading rom the past into the future , however , not unto the same future 
thank you very much , dr. hasslein .
it 's certainly the most incredible story this reporter ha eer covered .
they will , however , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be given an extended tour of the city .
this is bill bonds reporting for eyewiness news .
good night .
your luggage , ma'am ?
addess , please .
the zoo .
madam zira , i represent furand feather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is your favorite fruit ?
ha ha ha .
and later , she 'll accompany dr. hasslein to the museum of natural history .
now , for a look at the weather .
sunny california will not be exactly that tomorrow .
the downtown --
tired ?
how is that ?
we have heads as well as hands .
i cal upon men to let us use the !
beastly .
and dimas which means body frame .
its scientific name is a compound of the greek kampto , which means flexible or bent ,
its generic name , thereore , i flexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i insist .
now , is there anthing i can get you , zira ?
well , i have a srange craving .
grape juice plus ?
lewis said only a sip .
especially in cases ofpregnancy , you now .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorillas ' war .
we stayed beid .
we never saw the enemy .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there was a tornado in the sky .
i feel magnificently sleepy .
the date meter on the spaceship .
and before -- before the white light and the tornado ?
before the white light and the tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr. president , that one day , talking apes will dominate this earth and evetually destroy it by 3950 something .
and according to the nasa experts , who are still subjecting the spaceship to microscopic scrutiny , the precise year ofwhat you merey inferred to be earth 's destruction is recorded on the flight synthesier as 3955 a.d. , presumably .
alter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents 
or rather 3 , now that one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked our facilities .
he also became very unpopular , historically unpopular .
and we do n't want that to happen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 visitos seem to be charming , peaceful people -- or rather creatures -- ad that the voters love them .
o you want them and their progeny to dominate the world , mr. president ?
well , not at the next election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by thei own testimony we know that apes one day will acquire the power of intelligent speech .
by zira 's testimony , we know that she is pregnant with child .
by my own testimony we know tat it 's genetically possible for this child -- provided , of course , always that we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a talking ae by a umb one in a present-dayjungle or a present-day zoo .
yes , mr. president , i do .
i do n't ow .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i hi enemy or his instrument ?
an assassin would say the latte .
well , mr. president , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because e was evil 
we have no roof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mr. president , there are very strong indications .
are you suggesting that they were improperly interrogated ?
le us say unprofessionally .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
haig convened in secret session at the request of the president , the commission makes the following interim recommendations --
he pubic should be informed
that the apes , afer their arduous space voyae ,
and the fatigue arising from its intended publicity ,
there is justifiable cause for suspecting
o the installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we were in space , we saw bright , hite , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of the earth elt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me .
but isomebody had asked ..
only the gorillas and the orangutans .
what 's the difference ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do not use the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys man .
all we want to find out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , this as intolerable .
so humans took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alert to the concept ofslavery , and , as their numbers grew , to slavery 's antidote , which , of course , is unity .
they learned the ar of corporate and militant ation .
he articulated .
he spoke a word which had been spoken to him over time without number by humans .
no .
so that ' how it all started .
cornelius :
where we come from , apes talk .
you recognize your husband 's words to te commission ?
yes .
so humans ere dumb .
zira :
zira :
i 've examined --
i ca n't remember .
complete the word !
call for dr. dixon , please .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothal .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the commission 's authority .
and that of the president .
zira , i 've been asked to give ou an injectio --
-killing ?
will it harm my baby ?
lewi , you ca nt use that on zira !
really .
no , you must n't !
zira !
zira !
you do n't have to tell me !
now count backward from 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this .
hmm ...
not so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an --
anata --
whose anatoies did you compare ?
apes and humans ?
ye -- yes ... when they died a natural death .
available ?
gorillas hunted them for sport in nets and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the vaious reflexes .
of the living .
you ca 't make a dead man 's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you were advanced enough to perform experimental brain surgery on living humans ?
of course not .
when you left , was colonel taylor alive ?
we loved taylor .
we did all we could to help him --
cornelius and i .
she needs a nap .
we must get this to the commission .
if you 'll be seated , we 'll get down to busines .
by either ape towards the human ace as it is presently constituted in this year , 1 973 .
the male 's attitude is hat
of a deeply interested academician
with the true objectivity of a good historian .
the female 's case is differet ,
will have become dumb brutes
with the intelligence of animals ?
it 's been noted that what apes will do to humans
to dr. hasslein 's convictio that these apes ' progeny
this is a isk we dare not ignore .
therefore ...
the commission unanimously recommends
that he birth of the female 's unbon child
i now declare this commission dissolved .
they are savages !
jabbig neeles into my pregnant wife .
i 've done that too , dear , and worse .
they made me tell them everyt hing , cornelius .
brutes .
shall i tell you something ?
we a n't live with lies .
how long ?
a week .
they treated you like dirt .
ma'am , sir .
chow time .
i 'm not hungry .
well , maybe somebody else is who ca n't talk yet .
oh , come on , ma'am .
it 's pure vitamin c .
grr !
nobody makes a fool out ofmy wife .
you 've got to come help me .
i 'll come right away .
itjust seems so cruel and horribe and-
i 'll see you 
unbelievably .
so do i .
but dead .
you 'd prefer the parents dead too .
gate four.just a minute , sir .
the lieutenant has n't checked in yet .
gate four .
well , i 'm sorry , sir .
good night , charlie .
okay , sir .
i 'll be of duty , but he relief comes on at 0430 hours .
yes , sir .
i ...
oh , my dear .
it 's urgent .
the apes killed their orderly .
on the run .
for that , they must be killed .
i has to be done before we start a stone rolling that 'll gather enough poison moss to kill us al !
i 'll find lewis and get hep .
i just lost my temper with the boy .
science regards these apes as unique .
i want them take , yes , but taken alive .
is that clea ?
quite clear , mr. president .
oh , it 's you , dr. banton .
the monkeys have killed
what ?
i do n't believe it .
drive carefully .
i did n't mean to kill him .
i hit him with a tray .
where 's zira ?
stevie ... she 's in labor .
get in .
stevie , you wo n't take us back to the camp ?
now , wait a second .
let me get this straight .
you are asking me to risk imprisonment for the sake of two fugiive apes ?
i do it for you and for stevie and for you two distinguished friends .
uh , notorious now .
the hell with notoriety .
stand by and see his wife insulted ?
lewi !
sain francis would have
never .
the first hip ever born in a circus .
los angeles is n't a circus .
lewis , i was not responsile for the death --
look at heloise .
mama .
mama .
zira , do n't waste your breath .
you know the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak .
mama .
mam --
that 's good .
hi ?
milo ?
milo .
congratulations .
but , sir --
evidently , we were wrong because you have nt found the !
if that 's close , she ca n't have gone far .
where do apes go ?
captain , i want you to start an immediate search ofevery menagerie , zoo , and circus .
i 'll augment your force with the city police , and i want to be ket informed about all results .
you might have ived happily ever af ter .
but now ...
i did it because i hate those who try to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him be dominated by you .
all i can now do to help you is give you this for the baby .
es .
we 'll hang it around the baby 's neck for protection , huh ?
yes .
and now , my dear , dear friends , before he police come and the audience gathers , you and your pretty baby must go .
lewis is on his way .
armando .
i should like to say good-bye to heoise irst .
this is as far a we dare to take you .
the police have roadblocks on every main exit .
here are your supplies .
can you read a map ?
we 're at the city limits at the southern edge of this oil field .
over this ill , you 'll pass through more oil wels , an abandoned refinery , and you 'll be looking down at a harbor .
it ' a graveyard for old ships .
you can hide here for a week .
a week ?
then you can travel with them to florida , found a colony in the everglades , and live happily ever after .
it 's time that you were oving on .
lewis .
you 're the second human i 've kissed .
and you are the first .
she 's been with the circus seven years now .
the baby 's birth was registered 1 6 days ago .
ha ha ha !
we 'll catch them sooner or later .
later we 'll do something about pollution .
later we 'll do something about nuclear war .
we think we 've got all the time in the world !
like tars in space .
is n't it beautiful ?
yes , it is ... from here .
hmm ...
why do n't we get moving ?
we 've alled in for helicopters .
how long till they get here ?
what 's the matter ?
they found zira 's suitcase .
oh , no , no , no 
you do n't like them very much , do you ?
who ?
mama .
give it to me .
cornelius !

well , we do know this much : his name 's chambers , he 's now in indian territory , we think he was with lucky ned peppe robbing a mail hack
tuesday down on the poteau river , e 's a mediumheigh man with a black mar on his ceek .
that 's a desription of tom chaney , there 's no chambers to it .
he got tha black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under the skin .
why are 't you out looking for him ?
i ave no authority in the indian nation .
i 'd have to say l.t .
where would i find this rooster ?
he 'll be at the federal court this afternoon .
your father 's gu , you 'll want to take it home , i expect .
i wo n't rest until tom chaney 's barking in hel .
yarnell you say with papa .
when you et him home , you put him in a better coffin , and you bury him in mason 's apron .
your ama ai n't gon na like you not comig home with me .
mama knows i can take care of myself .
people ill take it wrong that i leave this to you , yarnell , but i got paa 's business to attend to .

mr. cogburn !
mr. cogburn !
i said you come back here !
if mr. cogburn thinks i 'm gon na be put off by a locked door , he does not know me !
i will be here hen it opens .
best time for ou to nail rooster would be tomorrow .
he 's due to testify before judge parker in the wharton case .
i appreciate your kindness .
at the rate o 25 cents per meal , i might just as well .
i was hoping you were enjoying the dumplings .
i ca n't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease .
the french is la boeuf ,
i call it la beef .
a right fancy rig , sir .
watch out for the chicken and dumplings .
they 'll hurt your eyes 
they 'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken !
you squirrel-headed bastard !
i 'd like o go to bed now .
but first i 'd like to see my father 's tras .
i 'll take a uess ad say your name is mattie ross .
how do you suppose he guessed my name ?
we 're short of rooms on acount of the hanging .
now , do n't you worry about grandma turner , she 's used to doubling up .
this is your father 's tras .
the watch and the knife are inside .
what is your opinion of a federal marshal called rooster cogurn ?
rooster cogburn !
he loves to pull a cork , i know that !
all rise !
yeah .
he 's a tough customer .
there 's no appeal from his court except to the president of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 're still sworn .
defence will cross-examine .
now , in order to refresh our memories , alow me to summarise what you said .
according to your story c. c. wharton grabbed a shotgun and killed marshal potter .
then you say the father swung his axe , and you shot him , too .
just winged him , or he would n't be here to pay up .
how long have you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot sice you became a marshal , mr. cogburn ?
that was not te question .
how many ?
twelve to fifteen ?
so many that you can not keep a specific count .
i have examined he ecords , mr. cogburn .
a uch more accurate figure is available .
come now , how many ?
counting them two whatons , 23 .
how much more dangerous for those arrested by you ?
was this revolver loaded and cocked ?
just answer my questions , if you please .
yes , sir .
i always go backward when i 'm baing away !
aaron wharton was standing y a pot when you arrived ?
he was stirring the fire under the scalding pot .
how far did you back away ?
something like that .
mr. goudy  do you have anymore questions for mr. cogburn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogburn .
cal the next witness !
raise your right hand .
mr. rooster cogburn ?
it 's pretty loose because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .
well , who 's he ?
well , who are you ?
my faily has 480 acre of good bottomland near dardanelle in yell count .
my mother 's home looking after my baby siste and my brother , little frank .
well then , why do n't you go home and leave me alone ?
mr. cogburn !
you can get a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a ile for each of you , and i 'll give you $ 50 reward .
well , you 've looked into this right smart .
i mean business .
it belonged to my father .
well this 'll sure get the job done , if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim 
i 've got some horse-tading to do , i 'll have it by tomorrow .
well , i hink tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medicine .
i 'd like to meet your family .
you want more , missy ?
i 've never een chopsticks work before .
chopsticks save your fingers .
give me your cup .
i do n't drink coffee , hank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lemonade , neither .
yes , sir .
sounds like a mighty easy way to make $ 50 to me .
do n't crowd me .
do n't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and hink of this detective business all at the same time .
and $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advantage of me .
it is n't going to be easy smoking old ned out .
well , i hope you o n't think i 'm going to keep ou in whiskey .
no , thank you .
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , sis , my price is $ 100 .
i ill hink about your proposition and talk to you again .
now , i wan na go to the monarh boarding house .
you better walk me over thee .
you can never tell what 's in a chinaman 's mind .
that 's the way he bests you at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i have a writ here says you 're to stop eating chen lee 's cornmeal forthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first place .
you ca nt serve apers on a rat , baby sister .
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rats .
give them rats a fair show , they say .
well , what kind of a fair show di they give old man potter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i had a big horse pistol ike that ,
i 'm not scared of no boogerman .
crea ?
i 've been waiting to have some private words with you .
i find a sweet distraction , as i suppose most men do .
i saw your mother yesterday .
wat business did you have with her ?
it s a likeness of tom chaney .
i 'm looking for him and i hear you 're looking for him , too .
i ony take one step at a time .
i 've been on his trail the best part of four month now .
i 'm a sergeant in the texas ranges .
chelmsford or haney as you call him , he shot and killed the senator 's bird dog .
bibbs threatened o whip him , and chaney shot the old gentleman while he was sitting in a porch swing .
well  you need not wor about chaney anymore .
the sheriff informed me that you were lookin for a man to go after chaney in he indian territory .
i 've already found one for the job .
his name is rooster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal fo the ederal court , toughest one they have .
you 'll have to talk that over with rooser cogburn .
it 's at least a two-man job to take him alive 
we 're aking him to fort smith and hang .
well  more so to me .
now , would n't a hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pay for killing my father , not for some texas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt .
one would be as unpleasant as the other .
lay a hand on me and you 'll answer for it .
the children of texans are brougt up to show a little more respect for their elders .
you 'll push that saucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no regard fo you , but i 'm sure you have enough for yoursef to go around .
they are all for sale except tose four scrubby ones .
the heirs of the late frank ross .
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that is out of the question .
that hardly concerns me .
your father bought four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an en of it .
om chaney stole it while it wa in our care 
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he wil make money , and i will make money , and your lawyer wil make money .

lawyer daggett ?

g. , yes .

my awyer would not wish me to consider anything under $ 300 .
for that , you get everything ecept the saddle .
i woud like to have that in writing , for what i is worth .
when i have it in my hand , i 'll remit the extortion money .
you 'll find it in order .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
it seem such a shame to render such spirited horseflesh into soap .
good morning .
sleep late .
you ai n't such an early bird yourself , baby sister .
i just about give up on you .
i figured you 'd gone home .
yeah .
well , trouble i , there 's no slats in it at all .

mama !
i 've left off crying .
i 'll find somebody who is .
now , i know you can drink whiskey and i saw you kill a rat 
but all the rest ha been talk .
i 'm not paying for talk .
i o n't know how you propose to do that from the hog wallow you 're sunk into .
if i smeled as bad as you , i would n't live near people .
i 'l be more than ready 
there 's an old saw that says , one white foot , buy them two white feet , try them .
i thought perhaps it was you .

i will call him little blackie .
what is your offer ?
i will pay the market price .
tell me this do you enterain plans of ever leaving this city ?
yes .
i m off early tomorrow morning or the indian nation .
how did you light on that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with grit .
well , i suppose he has that .
i woul n't trust him too much .
it ma prove to be a long , hard journey .
a good christian does not flinch from these difficulties .
neither does he rashly court them .
the good christian is not wilful or preumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong ?
i think you are wrong-eaded .
i 'm having a little onversation with the marshal .
he 's gone behind my back .
well , a fellow that carries a big-bore sharps carbine might come in handy , if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something .
we do n't need him .
got eveything ready ?
all but the grub .
there 's no hurrahing in it .
how much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
five hundred dollars ?
yep .
bibbs was a little senator .
well , i guess i ll just stick with sis .
the bibbs family 's put up another $ 1,500 for chaney .
have they now .
what are the ters ?
ell , you can tell him to his face , you can spit in his eye , you can make him eat sand out of te road , you can shoot him in the foot , and i 'll hold him for you .
she ai n't going , anhow .
she 'll make nothing but trouble .
maybe i 'll catch this chaney by myself and take all the money .
how 'd you go about that ?
i ' dispute your claim , i 'd muddy up the water .
i ai n't never seen nobody from texas i could n't shade .
la boeuf , you get crossways of me , and you 'll think a thousand of brick have fell on you .
that reward money 's just a pig in the poke .
look at him grin , he 'll cheat you .
we 'll ge your man , that 's the main thing .
you sorry piece of trash .
i 'll send it to you .
that 's a big story .
you 've not heard the last of mattie ross .
you may well hear from my lawyer , daggett .
lawyer dagett ?
who 's lawyer daggett ?
red .
the river looks kind of high 
yeah .
well now , red , if i was to tell you that , you might tell him .
i would say , tom chaney  loo out .
ca 't you get anything through your head ?
you 're not getting on this ferry .
i have paid my 10 cents for horse and rider .
red , take this girl into town to the sheiff .
there 's also a $ 50 reward .
ask the marshal .
oh , he 's a runaway , all right .
lawyer daggett again .
she draws him like a gun .
i will do no such thing .
right .
they 're loaded down with fat men and iron .
i 'm going to raise welts on you like worms .
drop that switch , la boeu .
you 're enjoying it too much .
you 'll find that i go ahead wit what i start .
just leave her alone .
get on our orse .
it 's not dinnertime by now ?
presbyterian , huh ?
southern or cumberland ?
southern .
my folks are cumberland .
i was raised in an episcopal hurch myself .
figured you for ome kind of kneeler .
well , ned was sighted at mcalester 's store about hree days ago .
shortest way to mcalester 's .
how far is it ?
around 60 miles .
do n't be looking around for me , i 'll be right here .
you look like a hog on ice .
i 'm stronger than i look .
what did you bring for us to eat ?
salt red pepper taffy .
what are those things ?
how many you got in there ?
you re lucky to be where water 's so handy .
how long you boys down there been mounted on sheep ?
go ahead and have your little joke , but i 'll tell you one thing , that little fellow there will still be running whe that ig american stud of yours is winded and collapsed .
sheep .
yeah .
hey  listen .
now , one of you 'll have to play the caller ,
i 'll tell you what to say and i 'll play all the other parts .
let it go .
that , baby sister , is no trade .
least little blackie likes the corn dodgers .
i 's the salt in them .
we wo n't get to mcalester 's by dark , so we better head for a dugout i know .
it 's empty , and we can shelter in it .
what do ou want ?
well , there 's no room for you here .
try that on the chimney .
speak up .
who 's in here ?
we do n't know any emmett quincy !
emmett , this is rooster .
one more minute , and you 're going to drink it .
well , now , do 't you bet your life on it .
what kind of papers you got on me ?
you better move .
tell those others to be careful with their guns .
we 're coming out .
hit the dirt .
belly down .
spread-eagle .
put the horses in the lean-to .
cuff them .
get down there !
well , not by name , but i got a few john does .
i do n't remember any ned pepper .
got a messed-up lower lip .
a funny lip ?
was n't always like that .
in the loer lip ?
his upper lip .
ned 's got a new boy running with him with a black powder mark on his fae .
that do n't bring nobody to mind either .
you do n't know anything i want to know , do you ?
how about you ?
i always like to help the law as long as it do n't arm my friends .
pretty good idea , 'cause otherwise i 'll turn you in back at fort smih .
and then if you live , i 'll get you three or four years
they 'll get that ball out of your leg , and i 'll give you two , hree days to get out of the territory .
do n't go flapping your mouth , moon .
i 'll do the talking .
do n't let im spook you !
right good mounts to me .
cut that up for frying .
what are you looking at ?
she 's after the man that killed he father .
his name is tom chaney .
led to killing in the end .
now , if you 'll just answer the marshal 's questions , he 'll help you .
i do n't like the way you look .
yes .
i do n't like the way you look .
i hope you go to jail .
my lawyer will not help you .
it 's a shame , a kid like moon losing his leg .
too young to be hopping around on a log peg .
we seen ned and ace two days ago at mcalester 's .
i 'm played out , quincy .
i got to have a doctor !
i 'll tell what i know .
do n't leave me laying here .
i 'll see you get buried .
they 're goin to rob the katy flyer .
id you see a fellow with them with a powder burn on his face ?
no .
george garrett ,
methodist circuit rider out of austin , texas .
when 's peppe due here ?
send that money to my brother .
i ll meet him later , walking the streets of glory .
quincy ?
let me have a cool drink of water .
look .
it 's one of papa 's gold pieces .
are you sure ?
yes .
worth a little over $ 36 .
grandpa sperling gave papa two of thee when he marrie mama .
at least we 're on ned 's .
now , go saddle the horses .
sraighten up the place .
now , what we want to do is get them in that dugout .
i 'll shoot the last man through the door an we 'll have them over a barrel .
and so does the governor of texas .
all i know is there 's a lot of them and only two of us .
why do n't i try to nick chaney before he gets inside ?
but if they break  i 'll nick chaney .
yes .
remember the turkey ?
hat does ne look like 
so i wo n't shoot my foot off .
what for ?
well , i do nt want any .
what did you do before you became a peace officer ?
what did you do after the war ?
you never told me you had a wife .
my friends was a pack of river rats .
she did n't crave their society , so she upped and left me and went back to er first husband who was clerking in a hardware store in paducah .
goodbye , reuben , he says ,
well , i told her , i said , goodbye , nola , and i hope that nailselling bastard makes you apy this time .
did you have any children ?
why , i did n't consider it stealing .
i never robbed no citizen or taken a man 's watch 
i had to flee for my life .
no horse could ru him into the ground .
when that posse thinned out , i turned old bo around , and taking them reins in my eeth , i charged them boy firing two navy sixes .
they must 've all been married men that loved their families 'cause they scattered and run for home .
you do n't have any family , do you ?
general price do n't belong to me .
looks like moon was telling the truth .
you see chaney ?
that 's him hollering .
here 's a younger one , but he ai n't a patch to this one .
oon !
quincy !
i 'm hit !
they do n't call him lucky ne pepper for nothing .
yeah .
well ...
well , what 's your story ?
i was on the move to a better place .
i heard the first shot , and i thought you 'd opened up .
more likel asleep .
you know who they are ?
the oe on the sand pit is old hayes .
the boy i do n't know .
he 's not much older than i am .
why do n't you go make us some coffee ?
let it go and go on inside .
why are you being so foolish ?
well , la boeuf , you 're quite a horse sooter .
i was trying for ned pepper .
well , next time , try for the horse and maybe you 'll hit pepper .
hat are we waiting for ?
and i say no .
you ca 't take men by watching hem run away .
we 'll take the horses and the dead in to mcaleste .
some , for now .
do n't think about you at all .
i was told in fort smith that you rode with quantrill and that border trash .
but a bunc of murdering thieves .
i heard they murdered women and children in the lawrence raid .
freeport , with kirby smith .
i served with eneral kirby smith .
i do n't have to hang my head when i say it , either .
go ahead and make another joke about it .
and i do n't like your conversaion about captai quantrill .
otherwise , leave it alone .
you know , i 've een thinking about lucky ned pepper .
maybe he planned on murdering those two stock thieves so they would n't inform against him .
ned does n't go around killing people for no reason .
sue , marshal .
yeah , about half the load i was looking for .
why do n't you go in and meet mrs. mcalester ?
maybe ms. mcalester can fix that poor little hand of yours .
rooste , what are you doing here ?
o ahead .
that 's what texas calls a peace officer .
i have a pretty good idea where ned 's holed up .
if he is where i think he is , it will take 100 marshals to smoke him ou .
his name 's tom chaney .
i want you to bury them for e .
what about la boeuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 're of no good use when you 're handicapped .
why ?
go wash , gaspargo .
that 's moon .
i know this boy , bily walsh .
he comes from a good family down by the south canadian .
sell the horses and get what you can for their coats , guns , and saddles .
his brother 's a preacher named george garrett .
boots , send this man $ 10 , and tell hi his brother ot caught and is buried here .
i 'll do that .
o this is te man who shot ned pepper 's horse from under him .
yeah , this is the famous horse killer from el paso .
fewer horses , fewer horse thieves .
both rifle and hand are ready to shoot again .
you stay here with the mcalesters .
that 's far enough .
you think i 'm gon na quit when we 're so close ?
there 's something in what she 's saying , cogburn .
i 've said my piece .
there 'll be no more talk about
ho won whose spurs .
i 'm going .
now , we 'll have no more tal about it .
what are you oing ?
you could n't see it if you saw it .
he put his oot wrong .
he 's tired .
i 've freighted iron stoves up harder grades than this .
i was a pretty fair hand wit a jerkline when i was freighting in colorado .
worked for a fellow that was always down with something .
he was carrying around a 21-foot tapeworm , along with his busines responsibilities .
that aged him .
lord god , how they hate to pay up .
what about the $ 25 i paid you ?
i wil not bandy words with a drunkard .
we have come near about 50 miles from mcalester .
tomorrow we 'll take him .
if we 're as close to ned pepper as you say ,
i o n't think too much of making that fire .
whee are you going with that canteen ?
we got no water to spare for foolishness .
tae a drink and let it go at that .
i 'd say there 's a stream down below there .
should n't one of us go dow with her ?
might not be safe .
well , safer fo her than whatever she meets , man or eat .
well ...
i know you , little mattie , the bookkeeper .
there 's no oney for you to squeeze around here .
i came to fetch water .
an i think i will not go .
now , how do you like hat ?
how many officers ?
i 'd sa right around 50 , and they mean business .
so you just walk rigt in front of me , up that hill .
i think i 'll oblige those officer to come after me .
if you refuse to go with me , i 'll have to shoot you 
you better cock your piece .
all the way back until it locks .
now , you mean to say that you wo n't go with me on your own free will ?
now you will follow me .
sis !
i 'm down here !
i just did n't think you 'd do it .
one of my short ribs is broke .
you 're just a piece of tras !
you little busybody !
i 'll teach you a lesson you 'll never forget !
sis !
sis !
hurry up !
down here !
take her and go !
up the hill with the horses , and do n't stop .
who all 's out there ?
they 're all arme and they mean business .
who 's out there ?
rooster , can you hear me ?
you better answer , rooster , or i 'll kill this girl !
you want me to kill her ?
she 's nothing to me .
nothing but a runaway .
i wo n't give you any more .
i wo n't trust you .
all right , we 're moving , but we 'll need more than five minute .
i 'm mattie ross of dardanelle in yell county 
where are your wounds ?
bob , you and harold stay here , keep a watch out below .
keep this turkey cock quiet , or we 'll have hi for supper .
is that man simpleminded ?
all the parmalees is touched  but harold 's the worst .
but they re all good shots .
get there !
farrell , lend him a hand .
they better show .
tom chaney shot my father to death in fort smith .
i hired him to go after the murderer .
if i 'd killed him , i would not be in this fix .
my revolver misfired .
if i did , i 'd have one that worked .
i 'll give him a little more time .
was that rooster and the ranger waylaid us last night ?
did hey take quincy and moon ?
it was a terrible thing to see .
do you need a good lawyer ?
i need a good judge .
that man called hayes , he 's dead , too , and the boy that saved your life .
goes for your good friend rooster .
rooster cogburn is no good friend of mine .
he led us right into your hands .
you lost the horse .
when we get out , i 'll send somebody back to fetch you with a fresh mount .
he wo n't harm you 
ou understand that ?
you do n't get paid .
et me ride up with you , farrell .
no .
harold ?
we 'll see you tonight at ma 's .
a little smut wo n't hurt you .

hang on right here .
damn that texan !
i ai n't dead yet , ou buswhacker .

no , but i do want that other gold piece .
forget the gold piece .
but it 's mine , and i want it .
once after he was dead .
we 're going to have to do something about tis snakebite in a hurry .
we ca n't leave him like this .
if i do n't ge you a doctor , you 're going to be deader than he is .

you 're addressing him , chen lee , and general sterling pice .
i 'll be damned .
you 're a little ...
you 'e shrunk .
i 'll tell you fankly , sir ,
i fully intended to have you jailed , and i 'm just the man who could do it , but when mattie told me the straight of the matter ,
you have my thanks an , with certain reservations , my respect .
how nice .
well , how is sis ?
she commissioned me to pay you the balance of the $ 75 due in the matter of tom chaney .
lawyer j. noble daggett , are you a etting man ?
on occasion .
oh , no .
i still do n't see why you did n't look up la boeuf 's girl when you were in waco .
i took the boy home to be buried in is ranger suit .
i do n't believe there was one .
well , i was just a little busy .
them texians fogot how much money they offered for a reward .
i had to help them remember .
papa 's marker was not what was ordered .
i think it 's only right that you have papa 's gun .
well , i 'm not so sure about that .
almost got you killed when it isfired once .
well , then i suppose i ought to get you to sow me how .
trust you to ride another tall horse .
you 're too old and too fat to be jumping horses .
well , come to see a fat old man sometime .
