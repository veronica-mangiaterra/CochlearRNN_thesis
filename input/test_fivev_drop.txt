and john kerry , future senator and prsdential candidate , ws  year ahead of me , presidnt of the yale politicl union .
yal daily news .
and then i went to law school , and in my thrd yer , i met
secrets contan nformation about a secrt organization that is pulling the strings n th whit hose ?
secrecys a very , very powerful tol of wieldng power  right ?
if yu 're able to do thngs and nt tell ther pople about it , this represents an enormous , really knd of monarchical power .
narrator :
skull nd bones has become renowned perhaps as th mst elite nd powrful of all the secrt societies .
yal university campus n nw
bones has cunted mng its mmbers presdents  senators
members get power .
they can get money .
oneof thethings that feeds the legnd about
and and/or vy legue schools .
n , that 's just  conspracy theory .
narratr :
butconspiracy theries notwithstanding  the fct is prsidents - just lke everyone els -- are mad of not only skulls and bnes bt also flesh and blod 
and , fr this reason , it is likely that one of the most important chapters within th book of secrets wold concern not only the presidency , bt the physical , emotional and mentl stablty of the
narrator :
perhapsthefnal chpter in the president 's bok of secrets would cover the most carefully guarded isss related t th unted stats ' chief
prsdent s physical and mental halth .
lichtman :
so one could argue ther is a nationl security and economic reason to conceal the
presidnt 's health .
no other leader has the power to projct the knd of force and inflence around the world that an american
president does .
ragan 
mr.gorbachev , tear dwn this wall !
lichtman :
healthis relvant , but presidents hve been as unfrthcoming as they pssibly can abut their health .
chief xecutive 24 hours a day .
yu need to take care of that .
one of the chllenges of white
house physcin s dealing wth th legacy that yu ve nherited frm the prior administrations , manng there were medicl issues that you did not revel to the press , that you hid  that you even dnied .
narrtor :
inthepast , some
presidents have gone t great lngths to hide illnsss from the public .
while in office , fdr conceald nt only hs pralysis cused by polo , but also the heart disease that ultimately led to his deth in 1945 .
kennedy :
his back was giving him so much pan on a regular basis that if he did n't receive pin medication every day , on a regular schedle , he 'd be flat out n his back .
and consequently during his
presidency , he was either a little bit doped up or in excruciating discomfort .
nbdy knew about it at the time .
sowulda
marno :
wedo havesome equpment tht we ca n't talk about in detail , such as fr biochemical warfare .
bethesda naval hsptal that is armored  that has its own air spply , ts own watr systm ;
that is bombproof and it 's locked .
it s calld th metu , which stands for medical evaluation
tretment unit .
the hspitl goes on , bsiness as normal .
butwhatif  president fails to hed his doctor 's advice ?
house physician 
marno 
you get pretty good complianc aftr that .
forthemen and women who actively seek the naton 's highest offic , it is certinly no secret that the physical changes from inaguration to departure can be startling 
th type of knowldge contained within a presidnt 's book f of secrts ?
on janury 8  2009 , during the last days f his presidency ,
george w. bsh invited four men to  private reunin t the white house .
alter :
gerge h.w .
it 's sch a small clb of pople who have been president of the united states -- and only a handful still livng -- that they do have a connection to ach other , evn if thy 're from different parties .
all of us who have served in this ffce understand that the office itslf transcends th individul .
kaufman :
but ach presdnt , i think , uss the former presdents , 'caus who bttr can explan wht t 's lik to be in some of these circumstancs ?
thy'rebletogiv a unique perspective bcause thy ve been there .
they knw what the pressures are , they know what th issues ar .
nd to have  president-t-
narrtor 
fivmen .
theprblemwith ptting that kind of information together in one journl is that it can be stolen , coped , cmpromised .
 'd be very nervos if i wer th president and i knew some othr people had access to that .
gingrich :
but we kep lots of secrets .
we keep an mazing number of secrets 
i have my doubts that there is such a book .
presidentsthemselves certainly kep secrets .
it s not even power , per se .
it s information .
and thos that do n't hav  are n't .
one thing is certin :
i 'dsaythat thre ar thngs that george
bush 41 and i know that not too many ther pople know .
gezora , gnme , kamoeba
the progress of science is endless .
so is the dream of man t explore spce 
hlios 7 , the new unmanned rocket t xplore jupiter .
its misson is to fly 600 million kilometers , gathr data and return in but three and a half years .
earth bres m .
are yo dreaming ?
you could n't get any pictures , so yu 'r trying to covr up 
wait a minute .
wake up , boy .

fly to brazil again , or no job .

only eghty nhabitnts .
it 's lk it has fallen behind the tme .
an island in the sn , srroundd by coral reefs that 's selgio .
we 'v invested a lt of mony in it .
once this plan has materialized , the world will be stunned .
you want me to take publicity pictures ?
tht 's right .
a single picture can impress people .
i refuse .
but ...

it 's been  long time .
yeah

no , this is n't the mark fr selgio island 
what ?
slgio island
fishing is prohibited in that ara .
that 's why it 's good .
the natives here wold n't like us to violate it .
who would believe that ?
but thy 're srious about it .
every accident that hppens at sa , they think the monster did it .
tht means more fish for us .
the folks coming from toky ..

this crab is n't ganime .
th space creatures that cam with helios 7 made the crab into a monster .
s  weapon to attack us 
you mean the spac creatres got int helios 7 in uter spac some hundred-millins kilmter away frm erth ?
if this creatur is highly developd , it may be able to live in  vacuum .
.. and it may b able to lter its own cells nd pass through th atoms of mtl 
i se .
space creature or not w must destroy it .
we mst think of som way to fight

yes , bats came .
gezora ran away .

there were porpoises when we were in the sea ..
i gt it !
what is it ?
the spac creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes  humans can hear sound wves up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porpoises emit 120,000 cycls ultrasound with which they se to guide themselvs .
yes .
i guess space creatures hate t .
if we hav bats , they ca n't come near s .
yes , mny bats live in cavs .
yes , but they 'll come bck to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bats !
thre 
did th monster do this ?

they 've gone mad 
hurry !
watch out !

i wish i hd my camra .
what happened to the monsters ?
even space creatures .
mr. obat !
mr. bata !
obata killd the last space creature by klling himself .

till deth do s part .
whenever a plyer ses a club card at a tble gme , the floor man writes down what game you played , where you st , what time you startd , time you quit .
this is the first time shannon used her card .

two weks ago .
maybe chyna was her lucky charm .
sh nevr wlked away a winner 
i think she was ganing her trust .
stalkng her .
it 's not a crim to ply blackjck .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
we found your blood in chyna 's apartment 
then it ws planted .
how shuld  know ?
look ... you killed chyna ,
nd connors killed preston  because he was obsessd with you and wanted to eliminte the competition .
you lied bout knowing chyna , you going to le bout this  too 
his cells do nt die .

yeah , pelvis is female .
the fmur 's th same lngth as th ne the pigs were chompng on 
it 's her 
well , we 'll run this ganst connors ' guns .
then you better turn it off before they use th oxygn destroyer on him .
i do n't know why  find t so dfficult to express my feelings to you .
i can see yu as vividly as if you were here with me .
as shakespere more ably wrte my sentiment in sonnet 47 , thyself way rt present still with me ;
for thou not farther than my thoughts cnst move , and i am still with them  and they with the .
or , if they slep , thy pictur in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye s dlight .

if she was so sweet , what were you doing chillin ' in cabo with shnnon turner ?
well , you got yor pctures on the coffe mg .
you better come p with an alibi on planet earth of where yu were the night yor wife was klld 
that 's easy .
there 's a woman  and it is romantic  very romantic .
we are vctims ... and no one is listening to us .
we r powerless gainst what 's going on .
we 're nt crazy .
has anyon talked to shannon n th last couple of days ?
thy 've got hr .
it 's like we 're witnessng some form of mss hallucination .
you know , thy think the cops ar part of this reptilian conspircy as well .
that 's why shannon ttacked greg .
let 's try this again .
sorry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contact with them 
plese , w come in peace .
it 's all right .

you 'r not only cancer-free  you 're free of their control .
how am i ever going to be able to thank you ?
the evidnce is all ver your car .
he loved me .
if they were tryng to clean up all the blood , they dd a god job

williams :

this was mgm s scenic backdrop buildng wher talented artists creatd their movie magic , and this is just one sction of a huge painting recreating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was riginally 600 feet long and 60 feet high and wrappd around the entire interir of mgm 's stag 15 .

fit as a fiddle and ready for love
charisse :
gene teamd with donald o'connor t perform this marvelously comc vadevlle routine for singn ' in the rain .

gene inspired a whole new generation of stars .
one of the brightest ws a young california girl named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i ws only 16 and stll mary frances reynolds when i ntered the miss burbnk contst .
reynolds :
gorgous gowns crated by th wrld-famus designer adrian were part of the treatment 
as wll as makeup and hair dpartments tht cold accomplish any style imaginable .
 star like joan crawfrd would sometimes have hr look redesigned numrous times until it matched the xact mood of the rol she was to ply .
yo steppd out of  dream
you are too wonderfl to be what you sem
could there be eyes like yors ?
honest and truly ?
you steppd out f a cloud
in 1941 , the glamour age had rached ts zenith with tony martin and an all-str cast in zegfeld girl .
martin :
lne and apart out f a dram
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got th glamour treatment in a drm sequence to the sng a lady lovs in the film  love mlvin .
loves a penthous where she 'll be cntent to stay
finds little gifts n her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sail away
for a simple riviera holidy
reynlds :
now , at last , you can see our differing points of viw .
she loves her dreams tied up with apron strings
just little pots and pns
and he 'll be handsome well , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look nice oh , nvr mind the price
a lady loves beacup i'amur
bt first of ll she loves to be secur
yet there is one vital thought she will plce abve
all of the thngs i make mention of
and what is more  lady loves to live
and what is mor a ldy lives to love
thanks for the prsent of the silver-blue mink
thanks for the yacht and for the solid-gold snk
thanks a lot  but no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon n this spof f the powr of the devastating female over the haplss male from it 's always fair weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and for th santa fe lne
bt i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for  am just a faithful lasse
and thre 's no gift hwever classy
by whch this lassi can be had
thanks for losn ' your mind
thanks a lt  but no
no thanks
i d n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to d
reynolds :
n torch song , joan crawford made her final musical film s a fadng legend prfrming in trpical makeup for th song twofaced woman 
th recordng was n't a new one at mgm .
it 's ben suggested that they my have dropped the wrong versin .
crawford 
i do nt belng
crawford :
 ca n't help being  tw-faced woman
a little bit of boldness  little bit f sweetness
 little bit of coldness a littl bit of hatness
do nt fall in love with a tw-faced woman
gt anther lover under cver
that goes wth the breeze
my dsposition
that 's why they call her a two-faced woman
a little bit f dy
and a little bit f bright
a little bit of hetness
black and white wrong and right
they call me twofacd woman
reynlds 
in the early 1940s hollywod bgan a fascinatin with things tropical and south of th brder , and mgm was no excepton .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported udiences away frm cold clmates nd the troubled times of a world war .
many latn artsts wre recruited to add an athentic sound to thes flms .
ne of the most ppular was xavier cugat and hs orchestra .
reynolds :
ricardo montalbn became a sensation at metro as th latin lovr , drivng femal audiencs wild 
reynolds 
h 's got th kind f appeal that turns your head lke a wheel
just like was beating in mne
but you mke it 109 and there is more to it yet
bt yu ll never forget
reynlds :
like this before
reynolds :
n ofthe performers t mgm whom i admired th most was the legndary lena horne .
or when
for the first tme
seem to be happening agin
it was a long time ag i stood in this very spot and recorded that lvely song .
when i first walked onto this recording stag in 1942 it looked pretty mch s t dos tday .
i recorded ll of the musc for my movis here and it is stll considered hollywod 's greatest recording stage 
i never felt lke  really belonged in hollywood .
so i usully just came on , sang a song and mde a quick exit .
just one of ths crazy things
yeah , i got t sng a grat cole porter tne in  featured appearnce but what i really wantd was to be given an acting rol in the movies .

horne :
in 1946 ,  playd the role of jlie in an excerpt from show boat in till the clouds roll by .
i was being consdered for the part fr the 1951 version of show boat but the production code offce had banned intrracial rmance on th screen .
so the studio gave th part to my god frend ava gardner .
the studo had ava reherse snging the role to the recrdings that  had mad hpng to get the part which annoyed us both .
gardner 
fish got to swim , birds gt to fly
ca n't help lovn  that man of mine
horne :
gardner :

hrne :
though va was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did nt gt the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but when h coms bck
that dy is fine
s late as can be

horne 
i was nt the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get yor gun , betty httn was a big hit as annie oakly 
judy garland had begun filming the role and completed tw numbers when she suffered  brekdown and had to be rplacd 
retrieved at last from the mgm film vults is judy 's versin of i 'm an ndian too .

hrne :
as you can see , whatevr conflicts judy strggled with s a person she lways cm through as an entertaner .
garland :
when you re out with a feller in the pale moonlight
yo do n't hve to look in a book to find
what he thinks of the moon and what is on hs mind
but they cash them just the same
grandpa dick was always sick
he just did at 93
doin ' what cmes naturally
the quick toboggn when you reach the heights
horne :

rooney 
in love finds andy hardy judy laments the fact that she 's nt a little girl any longer and not quite a grownup either .
grownups ignore me
nd in every snse
i m just on a fence
i 'm just an in-between
for a few years , jdy was an inbetween .
they found it in her first strring role :
dorothy gle in th wizard of oz 
toto , i have a feeling we 're nt in kansas anymore 
we must be over the rainbow .
fllow the yellow brick rad fllow th yellow brick road
follow the yellow brick rod
becase of the wonderful things h does
rooney :
the wzard of z was to becm the most widely sen motin picture of all time and judy 's wondrful perfrmance n the picture earned her  specl academy award which i was lucky nough to presnt to her .

rooney :
another legend t metro was my good friend frd astaire who alwys romanced a glamros partner in his motion pictures .
in easter prade , t was the one and only ann mller .
astair :

it was a little more than a gest apparnce for fred for he was soon to be under contrct t rko pictures wher they wr about to team him with ginger rogers causing a string of ht musicals to follow .
fred did n't rturn to mgm until sven years later at which time h starred with eleanor powell in broadwy melody of 1940 .

that 's for me
i 'm drum crzy  yes  'm drum crazy , ys

mller :
fred could make music out of almost anything .
and he often fund new chllenges tht strtched hs talents .
astaire :

when th drum carries the tune
mller :
hard-boled private eyes were ll the rage in the '50s .

i wuld n't trust hr any farther than i culd throw her 
she was selling hard , but i was n't buying .
miller :
in the barkleys of broadway , they dance the swing trot undr the main titles of the picture , but with the titls removed nother musical gem is revealed from the most beloved dance team of all time .

quarters ?
yo three each get a quarter , and bnjy and i have to split a quarter ?
what are you tryin ' to pull ?
t seems fair to me 
it just cheats us , that 's all 
$ 350,000 divided by four is ..
so yu three would gt 87,500 bucks nd bnjy and i hav to split it .
yeah .

my wife and i wold be happy with ..
hold it .

either one quarter for each car , incldin ' the van , or one fifth for ech guy 
one qurter r one fifth .

chief , w got a situation here that is absolutely incredible .
see ?
i think they 're argng about something .
and a crckett county unit has got 'em under observation 
tht 's eight shares for that .
four shrs for that .
that 's 12 shares already .
then five of us went dwn to th wreck .
we give five shres for that 
now we add the same number of shares as ther were pople in each vehicl .
that 's three for your grop , two for yurs , tw for us nd ne for you .
$ 14,000 per share .
and that covers evrything including the emncipation of womn !
wait a minute .
but n matter how you figure it ut , i still do n't gt as much s anybody lse .
right ?
we , us  we get 84000 .
what d y mean , tax-free 
i mn , if we go down to this park and we uncover the money and we ...
 'm sure he 's not gon na declre anything .
i knw he 's not gon na declare anythng .
look , can you xplain it to him , please ?
but what he ws tryng to say s ...
even businessmen tht rob and steal and cheat from people every day .

anybody got a firer plan , go ahead .
there were eight f us there , so that simply mans eight shars .
w 'r gon na get nplace listnng to this old bag

pssibly .
look at ths side , sir

rne saknus .
arne sknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable , bt it must be true .
a man took some tools and went where n humn beng has ever set foot .
into the interir f the earth  alne .

until tonight .
get out of here , woman !

more mportnt than our university 
what ds the name arne saknussem mean t you , gentlemen ?
just a second 
his real fam rsts on his study f volcanoes .
out of a volcano came this mssge from hm .
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , was probably pcked p by some peasant , gathred dust in a curiosty shop till it came to me .
whoever descends into the crater of sneffels yocul can reach the centr of the erth .
arne saknussem .
the center of the erth 
an extinct volcno in icelnd .
but , olvr , this is sheer fantasy .
you have n't herd all of it .
at sunrise on the last day f my the mountin scrtaris will pnt the path .
i 'm mr mystified than ever 
scartaris ?
it s  muntain peak near the volcan .
but ths is a student 's hoax .
let 's not tak that tone .
more than anything , you must conslt other experts .
and i 'v written to the fremost authorty in europe .
more eminent still .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and wht dos he sy ?
unfortunately i 'v not yet recived his rply 
i suggest w relx on the mtter until yr fmous correspondent sees fit to answr you .

yo wait and see how firm my voice can be when i speak of you .
blast nd damn !

# and chasing the roe
 wherever i go

i 'm the wife f prfessor goetbrg .

oliver lindenbrook of edinburgh universty 
professor lndenbrook .
i see you are .
this will be difficlt for yu , madm , but it must be faced .
who was the lst person t see him alive ?
i did n't ralize the saknussem famly stll xisted .
they saw each other very day .
 sggest that you have an autopsy performd immedately .
neither he nor i could suspct thre was a third party wh would stop at nothing to forestll s .
posoned 
this s now a matter for the polce .
 am deeply distrssed by your husband 's death , and  fully understand your feelings .
however , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan t dispose of the quipmnt your husband assembled up there ?
what dos it mattr now 
i 'll take it off your hands .
your xpedition 
i have a right to that equipment and i clim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from me .
tht is a lie .
madam ...
incredibl encounter .
a saknussem descndant turns up cts as f he were king of volcanoes .
tries t force me to surrendr his ancestor 's secrt 
saknussem clled again .
nw complication 
must fight him somehow .
young man , wold you cme here a moment , plese 
who are those for ?
that s  beginnng .
what abut lmps ?
lmps .
put m down !
put me down !
are we to be abductd every day in iceland ?
but i wish to aplgze to y in plin english .
i went through my hsband 's diry , and sme of his remarks led me to believe i did you an injustice .
i 'm srry .
i dd n't know .
d n't giv t another thought .
i sha n't 
bgan and that 's all t has done 
sir oliver , this morning you asked me for thes .

will y say that again ?
madam .
my husbnd had thes bots made specially 
i hop they fit yu .
i told your man to order some for m immediately .
good , good .
why would you ned boots lke this ?
do n't say it .
natrally , i 'm coming along .
that 's why  'm givng you all f this .
t 's  conditon .
 thought you understod .
you did n't mention any condition .
then i do now .
whom did yo intend t take long , besides this young mn ?
then i 'll be very usful .
he does n't understand a word of englsh .
w 're not contemplating a stroll down piccadilly or the champs élysées .
professor lindenbrook , i have just lost my husband .
the polce requre yur presence for the investigation into the death .
but  madam , quite aprt from the ppalling danger , think of the inconvnienc .
the lack of privacy 
in short , you do n't want all f this .
i my b mad on the subject of ths jurney , but i am not stupid !
to burden myself with a femle is sheer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbnce to men , never a burden .
you 'll sleep where we slep , eat what we eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept my proposition .
prfessr , look !
now we descend into oblvion or ... we enter the great book of history .
carla goetaborg .
alexnder mcewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans nd wh ?
professor !
professor !
hns is tying the rope n her .
i 'm a fool 
i should have told him t ti hr to a mul nd send her back where she blongs .
in what language would you have told him that ?
nd then there 's always the blessed chance the rope may break .
are you all right  ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only you could se yur face .
yu do .
perhaps this s the wrong entranc .
but there 's n other way to cntinue .
eureka !
thank you .
nw then ,  gnral summary .
a :

as my husbnd 's charts indictd .
onward .
and let 's hav some music .
the last nws was that they went up mont sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys .
yes ?
and then the animals came down withut their packs .
oliver s lndenbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what 's it ?
a woman !
a slight tremor , comng from undefined regions .
lt us proceed .
madam , n these regns i d never ventur to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us .
th three notches of arn saknussem .
what does tht mean ?
look .
we might hav takn any one of these channels .
bt our great colleague maketh a path for our feet .
let us have tea .
with a doble rtion of raisins .
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , madam ?
if we 'd knwn that you had nightmres , we 'd have made diffrent sleeping arrangements .
someone s walking up ther .
human fotstps .
the haring of all wmen is xtremly acute .
my wife used to hear rats in th attic  usully th nghts before i had an imprtnt lecture .
alec , go up nd find out .
thy ned rest 
mreover  it was stipulated that i give the ordrs .
ther s no need to use that patient voice with me .
wld you rather i used an impatient vice ?
professr lindenbrook , i am  member of ths expdition , and as such i intend to report any obsrvation i make .
lec .
put it down in the rcord that a member of the xpedtion rported ... rats in the attic .

hans is wonderng about th ultimat goal f our expedition .
lec , suppse you tell him .
well , why ds man freeze t death trying to reach the north pole ?
once a quston has risen n the humn bran , the nswer mst be found if t takes 100 years 
1,000 years .
let 's her yu rendr that nto a few well-chsen icelandic words .
why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their blfres ?
are you all right ?
can you unhook yourself 
grab his hand .
never mind about that .
how is it possible ?
this wy was clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure 
this hs been here since the beginning of time .
i was not in a psition to observe it scentificlly .
but where ?
we 're supposed to stay togethr .
tricked into th wrong tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam .. heard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she s sayng it .
w must return .
why ?
you know that .
but f there is a madman loose ...
he s aginst all of us .
against the vry concpt of this journey .
wht 's happened ?
he said we shuld go back to wher alec fell .
but it 's not on or rute .
if we re to go hd , we hv no tme fr detors .

you must n't look at me .
oh , no .

hans and i can ct sme rope into som trchs .
wht puzzles me is that th three ntches of old arne sknussem still kep ponting our wy .

may i remind you that months ago yo gve m explicit rdrs to that effect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to be crrected by yo ncessantly .
yo 're dong it wth yur looks , the inflecton of your voice  the very postre of your bdy .

fellow scots  if these shouts of yurs express some pleasure that we 've returned alive  i thank yo deply 
however , if they 're meant as praise for a sccessfl scientist ,
i must disclaim that honor .
a scientst who can not prve what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
i have no records , no shred of evidence .
i will never embarrass this distinguished university by asking that it take my word .
this , i know :
the spirit of man can not be stopped 
splendid , oliver .
professor  here 's someone wh wants t sy godbye .
hans , old frind .
did you get your injuries when th volcano blew up , in the hot lava ?
he was in such a hurry leving the church , he fell all the way down th steps .
after ll that waiting .
it 's been no mrriage fr you at all 
you underestimate alec .
i m tkng the night train to london and then back to stockholm .

oh .
hey , dad ,
hey , come here .
i want to show you somthin ' .

um , push that button right there 
and she 'll be smoth as a baby 's butt .
oh  one more thing .
cver your ears .
oh , that is som trick .
i have a feeling that they 're fnally gn na lt me play today .
see y .
yeah .
charle :
let 's go !
go , tem !
xcuse me .
may i talk to yu for a second ?
i wold like to play .
what maks you think w 'd ever let yu play ?
oh .
i do n't know .
hey !
oh !
how 'd you d that ?
designed it myself .
ok , brainic .
you 're in .
great .
you know , it 's my ambition to smeday design
yah .
of gravitons .
great .
he 's kinda my hero 
he nd sergei federov .
oh , mn .
so  'll tll yo what .
oh ...
asy does it .
well , hllo there .

yah !
come on n .
broght you some brain food .
do n't need it .
gt any cool  popular , socilly well-djusted food 
at all that .
to spnd yor evening in the rom futzing with  hockey stick

dd n't want to jinx it .
all expenses paid .
i just have t tach  few classes .
charle .
evry n of these is ll expenses pid .
all right .
the truth is 
there 's this guy at northern .
is n't that the guy you 've been readin ' about ?
right .
h 's this close to discovering the graviton .
if we can figure out how th gravitn works ,
defy t .
where brdges wo n't collapse ,
where planes wo n't crash .
mother :
ha ha .
positive .
th lab wher i 'll b workng --
to cool hs particle accelerator 
my 2 favorite things in th world
both : charle 's gin ' to nrthern
charlie 's goin ' to northern
if yu 'r sure abt this , sn ..
dd .
ow !
all right , laddies .
now , you nw guys need to be aware that good ol  rumson
ai nt always so good ,
specially when they execute th rmson rack .
what 's th rumson rack ?
oh  nothin  much , really .
they just create a distraction .
and when yu ai n't lookin ' ...
uhh !
mre work to do ths year .
playr :
what the ...
man , i thought they wer gon na give ol ' crick-in-theneck the bt
nd let us have or arena back .
they were ...
until they recruited som supergenis kid
t help him solve the mysteries of the univrse
or some such grbage .
charlie boyle !
been lokin ' all over for you .
i 'm dean wallace .
hmm ?
evryone 's so excited to have you hre at northrn .
well , nt everyne .
i think thy hate me .
what , that bunch f losers ?
it 's good-by , coach no-wn- big-game 
gkktt !
or facilities her wer bult in 1954 , chrlie 
beautiful , ai n't they ?
best in the country , i think .
here we go .
right down here .
it 's kinda chlly .
anyway ...
stuff to do .
professor 
charlie !
welcome , my friend .
com with me .
got a lot to show you , bddy .

she looks kinda old 
but it 's not bout loks .
it 's wht 's undr the hood that counts 
shh !
if you 're so sure , i 'm sure , too .
got your own lb cat .

se ya later .
hllo .
the lair .
what re you ding here ?
but ths is my housing ssignmnt .
the lair just became the diaper den 
what are you laughing at , pintstein ?
it 's a physcs lab .
what do i got to do , drw you a rad map  son , hh ?
come n 
i 'm charlie , nd i 'll b teching this class .
supposedly , the party strtd in the quad ,
nd then it went to the arena ,
nd then it ended up in the common re
h  tht sounds like fun .
hate my big , red shiny nose .
i men , they just do nt lik me 
come on .
do n't like you ?
you sur ?
i 've had this problem before .
it never works .
well , why do nt you try something dfferent ?

ha ha ha .
frm a guy tht 's been lone in the lab for the last 15 years .
good point .
i 'll se you after my workot .
hey , one thing 
what i relly ment ws that a god scintst
dos n't keep rpeating th same experiment ver and over
expecting t get different results  right ?
yeah .
you know what i mean ?
k .
have a good workout 
i 'll se you in the lb .
all right .
ok , buddy .
bye .
whew !

but if sh wants the gold , dick ...
she 's got to nl the duble to loop .
ys 
yes !
i did nt realize anyne was hre 
i 'm claire .
ch ...
a good scientist does n't keep repetng the same experiment over nd over
expecting to get different results .
ch-chaz 
chaz from chcago .
so , wher do you go to school ?
excuse me ?
whre do yu go t schol ?
where do yu go 
franklin .
well , there 's yur nswer .
cl .
cool .
chz anthony 
amy abrahms ?
clire addison ?
her 
chz anthony ?
chaz anthony ?
i 'm so glad you decded to join us .
i said tke a seat , young man .
i see first mpressions re yur strong suit .
paul o'donnell .
frends call m odie .
you 're hard cre  man .
settl in , chaz .
i 'll be tachng this class ll year .
nd  'll be disrupting it .
and it tok many , many years
before glileo could prove his theory to be corrct 
that , indeed , the planets travel around th sun in  circular orbit .
well , i 'm very impressed .
uh , i was , uh ...
skating nd some geek told me tht the ic rink was ellipticl .
while i was sticking his tongue to the ice 
tacher :
all right , all right .
as you may or may nt know ..
hey  chicago .
this is din .
odie says you 're down .
mind if we join yu ?
i mn , yo 
experiment ?
uh , yeah , expriment to see how long i can sty in school
without ever ctully going to school .
he 's th bomb 
hey , how 's t going ?
i fnished the calculatons for tody 's experimnts .
yeah  the dat 's right there on yur desk
nderneth your eighth grad gemetry bok , chaz .
so , how 'd you find out ?
my computer told m .
so , who 's chaz ?
 guy who has a lfe .
 've gone through life so far as charlie boyle
and it is n't any sleigh rd .
who thought he ,  was cool 
me .
that has never , ever happned to me before .
ever .
and i 'm going back .
ok .
charlie , i 'm not yr dad .

big finish 
i just wish yu 'd use yur powers for good , not evil .
what are yu talking abot ?
there are geniuss your age , you know .
 was talking to a collegue ver at northern .
he was telling me about a yung man --
who ws it tht helped you ?
lke i said , some loser in scince club .
nw  who wnts to come up here
and finish chrting these pints on th polar graph for me ?
ooh  bitter rony .
with a crude cricature
you know ...
oh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students hav bcome openly hostile .
not to mention the dorm fod .
well , the only fatherly advic i can give you about the science stuff
is just keep plugging away .
a ttr !
dad , you 're a gnius !
gnius ?
my first f .
your frst f .
what am i sayng ?
but why ar you so hppy about gettng your first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i guess they re gn na kick me out of schol
if i do nt get bttr grdes .
nd  would care because ...
you 're pretty ok .
c n't yo find anyone else ?
i men , wll , yo were the first one on my list 
mayb we could work something out .
thn i guess i should start practcing .
oh , great .
jst what i want t do after school ,
more school .
take it 
fine .
how nothing lasts forever
well , they re wrong
yeah
you stod strong
you 'v got the key to my heart
cuse i
it sems s long ago
when my world was upsdedown
hey , nice ..
i got you somthing .
me ?
yeah , you know , jst to say thanks nd all .
that 's good , s n't that ?
i mean , that s wht w 're supposed to be listening to , right ?
thank you .
hey , so , what 's with the museum ?
he s the hckey coach ovr t northern .
hey  daddy !
i want yo to meet ...
jason ..
i m just going to gt my things here .
chaz ?
i do n't knw , charli .
althogh  i would have loved to have seen coach addison 's face .
i m glad he dd n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over with claire , to .
that was 20 miles f rough road n th aplgy turnpike .
hey  doc ?
you ever have a girlfriend ?
yeah , sure .
maybe .
nothing gain .
i do n't get it , chrlie .
and still , there s no sign f  grviton .
wll , mybe if we tke ur minds off it ,
you know , f we sit back , relax ,
and , h , hav  little fn .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
whenever h had a problem tht he could n't solve ,
eureka !
cme on , dance with me .
oh , no  i do nt think so .
h , you do n't want to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any differnt .
only as a particle p until now .
we can jst as esily think of it as a wave 
you said so n your book .
microwave conflict 
how culd i miss this ?
ok , k , wht dos this mean ?
um ...
set up a phased hrmonic ,
affected the nuclear mtrix ,
in othr words , groovy little hous beat
jst unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
we did it , charlie !
this is big !
we found the graviton 
oh , man !
can we do it later though ?
i 'm kind of late for science class 
maybe you just hd  good tutor .
but you are gng to met one .
i gt to thinkng it might be good for you to meet a kd your age
who 's not shmed of being smart .
he can probably use some one-on-on
with a kid who 's not ashamed t kick his butt .
class 
ys , well , not just yu , the entire clss .
i 've arranged a field trp today to northern .
doc !
doc !
i got to show yo somthing relly col .
h .
oh , what ?
what m i going to d ?
wait .
wit , wait , wait , wait .
6 shades of prple ?
thank you very much .
thank you and wlcome .
the youngest particle physicist
a terrible lab accidnt has left yung mr. boyle
temporarily disfigured .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agreed to come out and talk to yu anyway ,
mr. chrli boyl .
chrlie ?
charlie , in gravely voice :
thank you , fellow teens .
will eventually subside .
since i m in obvous discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let professor krckstein
well  uh ...
psst

how do i get the purple stuff off my face ?
it 's starting to brn .
i do n't know .
off .
many tmes i think that an atm is -- s prtty much like the universe -
i gt t go pay the water bll .

chz ?
this s a vry valble clu as thymine is chnged to uracl .
uh , here t the universty , we have , uh  t-1 lines , bt --
man 
yo 're the main one i wanted to met charlie boyle 
from th head of th anthrpolgy --
and schedule nothr field trip .
i 'm sure i can convnce charlie to come bck .
what r you doing to me 
and h has to do that 
for his esphags 
what are you ding

he 's fine  he 's fin .
really .
you kids do your homewrk .
bye .
 decided to move my stuff back in .
i need some help .
yo ..
with wht ?
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
you hve everything .
i could say the same about you .
women  poise ...
women .
losng my scholarshp ,
n  cheese factry .
not a bd trde-ff .
yeah  right .

hey !
why do n't you just g upstairs and watch the gme ?
'cuse half the people p there thnk  'm a genius ,
nd then the other half think i 'm a punk .
hey  i 'm going to se th particle accelerator whil you re gone 
mght as wll get som work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck down here .
mi particle accelratr es su particle ccelertor .
it 's the only one we got .
welcom to northern lights hockey .
iglo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerator .
and i wanted to say thanks for passing me .
hey , you have nobody to thank but yurslf 
so , uh ..
hre 
t 's from me and the gys .
hey , good luck tday .
so rumson 's goin  down .
what if they come after yo with tht rumson rck
i do n't knw of any way to defend against it .
i might 
go home !
to the confernce chmpionship game ,
by :
come on , dude 
ll right  nw the 3 to worry about are stokr ,
now cross will usually distract the referee here 
while stoker and ryder rack our best plyer 
which s m .
we send somebody else out thr with my number ,
that 's your plan ?
but -- but --
and you 'd come out with a phony nmber .
 like it .
hey , i 'm  gnius .
hugo , suit up !

charlie 
his nam 's not chrle .
that 's chaz .
he wor your golden golie ma --
clar , let me explan .
explain ?
just what was all of this ?
was it one of yur experiments ?
wre you mkng a study of the local culture ?
then i guess you were just having a laugh at my xpense .
imagn  me thinking  could teach you .
'cuse i m a big fat liar .
i also left the particle accelertor on 
get off the ice !
gt off the ice 
annoncer :
do not venture onto the ice !
get off the ice !
this gme is postpond until we can repair th ice .
2 mnutes left , and we were this clse .
this close 
ths is bad , coach .
thanks , kid .
yu probably just cost me my job .
i nevr wnt to see yu again .
the game has been suspended .
please check with the ticket office
for th rscheduld date and tme .
claire ?
claire !

frmerly known as chaz .
claire :
cme on , guys 
what ar yo reding ?
brakaway .
i love breakaway .
and sves quen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zron finds , uh , sbatomic particles
and how thy 'r connected to  mysterious quantum force .
oh  yeah .
but yu know something ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to split a photon ,
and even though the particles are 6 mles apart 
whatevr one does  the other one des
cool !
and mayb nlock the secret as to hw it works .
and then ...
defy gravity .
let 's get to work .
and the utput level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 ntigravity halves .
why the rubber coating ?
they all act like superballs 
and whn i press this buttn ,
yeh 
ok !
no ...
it mans i can make amends
well , with what we jst dscvered 
i figured ot a way to hlp northern beat rumsen 
and claire 's dad can keep his job ,
and my friends 'll be happy with m again ,
and maybe ...
clair mght lik me gain , too .
a little 
you have nt let me down .
yo sved me !
charli  i culd never have done this without y !
y 're my frind .
thanks , doc .
but i got ta go .
why are you here ?
i need help 
 fgured out  way to help the team tonight ,
keep rumsen from cheatng ,
no .
why do n't y just leave us alon ..
i ca nt do it alone 
yeah !
welcome to northern arena !
this is base ops .
video ?
roger that .
blades ?
that i am here under extrm protest ,
and i 'm only doing ths s my fathr dos n't wind p
stage managing the ic capades .
sktes , rumsen bus should be n target range ...
now .
roger tht , ops .
video 's in place , ps .
roger , video .
hey , deon .
how 's it going 
where 's blds ?
right hre .
let 's just hope this works

first sign of troble , i 'm pullin ' yu out !
you just try and do tht !
for the re-scheduled central confrence championship
how s this supposed to wrk again ?
how is that possible ?
like the super balls i showed you .
corrsponding mcrchips with other graviton halves
whatver our sktes do , their skates will be forcd to do .
exctly .
cheating 
and i helpd you get  c in science .
you sure did  numbr on this lab .
nah .
besides , i v arranged his schedule so that he 'll be gone all day .
and he 's nevr here during hckey games .
almost nver .
ths hs gone way to far !
i tld you i had to do what  had to d .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop rght now .
you know i 'm n your side .

bt what wold it man without frinds ?
the chance to mk up for all the selfish things i did ...
so please ...
chz !
odie  tight up .
omar , you 're in !
mike , get off !
we got ta stop the rumsen rack .
dion , flip the switch .
take ...
that !
yeah !
power play !
nmber 2 
i 'm stoker .
yu 're rydr .
let 's go !
whoa !
let go of me 
cross is leavng the box .
h 's out of control 
do smthing 
he 's heading straight fr mike !
i ca nt find it !
i have the other chip 
aah !
re thre any brakes ?
doc 
hey 
wh , we 're to light !
hey !
hey 
whoa !
w did it !
we must have reversed the charge f the gravitons !
they 're repllng gainst the psitve charge of the earth !
game annuncer :
th final scr -- northrn 1 , rumsn nothing !
a long , long tme .
yeah .
that s what i call pblicity

it 's an order frm our lrd .
i m afraid ..
i do n't feel very enthusiastic about it .
neither do i .
but if i refuse , there may b trouble later .
ygro has said nothing , but he wold n't b happy marrying  lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i do n't want him to repeat my mistak .
they said y d be t the border .
i heard verything .
the steward and chambrlain re good judges .
alert even in times f pec .
but , sburo ... as for the marriage and other matters ,
 suggest you keep thngs quit .
you ll probably receiv a largr fief 
so be modest about it or the others wll think you 'r showing off .
 happy vent .
he 's not thinking of yu or yur family .
will yu draw on your secret principles f swordply ?
but at the last moment , yu skillfully switch from defens to offense .
yet y never attack .
you wat until your opponnt tires .
unworthy ?
yes 
w can not accept our lord 's fvored lady .
there 's no ned to be so reserved 
it 's happened before , not jst in the aizu clan , but in evry clan 
i m well aware of that , but even so , i wish t dcline th hnor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will nt b allowed .
it is or lord 's personal wish .
 mean no dsrespect .
yo know our lord s wsh .
it 's an order 
to decline is to defy the order !
no   'd never do that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wsh to accpt the honor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn .
may you njoy long life together
we 'll all be t yr side as long as you live
this is a dy of celebration
kep that in mnd .
no .
a woman who was dismissed aftr baring a child 
i 'm sorry i did n't notice your return .
mother took her along for prayer at shonenji temple .
sh kindly teaches me domestic duties .
i do n't belive it 
fathr 
but dspite that , he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes , right awy .
you must n't .
the world never sems to go right .
 wish t retire and have yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my request wll be granted .
sashara , how ar your son and his brde doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but hs son has married , s
so isburo sasahar s retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the tme , but it 's a great relef .
i wonder what  'v done all my lif , though it 's not like me to do so 
yogoro 's marriage is a very happy one .
fear oftn exceeds th perceived danger .
so it was in yor case .
yogro 's wife .
she 's a fne wife .
suga 's just the same as bfore , bt ichi is always plesant and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like yurself ,  do n't undrstand it eithr .
check the wapons in the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appointed days .
i do n't say to always yield to thm , but t times , they 're unreasonabl .
rice cakes ?
enjoy .
wait  chi .
i m going to rtire soon .
yogor will become th head of our family , nd you re his wife 
you need n't hold back for the ld woman .
take over the household dutis .
nderstnd ?
even so , sh is my mther , and i will treat her as sch .
excuse me .
that 's enough bt yur duties , yogoro .
how about some rice ckes ?
but  do n't understand .
that she 'd grasp her lord by his clothing .
it was hard for me t believe too , so i asked her the other day .
t was the yar befre lst .
ichi 
accept the honr grateflly .
i was more angry than surprised 
a man over 50 ws infatuated with m .
i shuddered .
our lord does not do this just t satisfy  whm .
damyo must hav heirs or their houses will be abolished 
the only heir to our lord right now s young lord masamto .
ven so  miss ich , not just anyon can become our lrd 's mistress , for her son may one day become our lord s her .
she must be bautiful and kind lik you .
you re referring to snnojo kasai , your fiancé ?
kasi ?
yes .
or parnts arranged ur ngagement .
then if snnojo agrees , yo wll gratfully agree to serve our lord ?
what d yu say 
but he bwed to our lrd 's wishes and gave y up 
so you hd no chice ?
i stll did not wish to g .
do n't bother me !
no .
yo sad you wold serve our lord if snnojo gred .
he has clarly agreed to it .
as summned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to your wishes 
then  thought
no , it was more like a prayer 
i would bear him sons .
many , many sns 
then other girls need nver knw my misery .
it would end with me .
it was lik a prayer .
my thoughts were really like a pryer .
with ths prayr ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later 
then i wnt to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord 's orders .
b friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i culd never have found a better wfe 
beginning tonight ,
wht ?
our lord means nothing to me 
i hve been so wrried about the sn  bore .
s worrid 
i will frgt about him too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
y 've made m wait nearly two yers  but at last .
 by would have been bettr 
and what 's her nm ?
ygoro and  racked our por brains over ths and nmed her tomi .
post-hrse messenger !
yes !
it s a lucky thing 
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's hir .
so ichi s birth mther to the heir .
f she rmains the wife of  vassal , there wuld be much talk 
you sy this is our lrd 's wish ?
yes 
and our chambrlain here and the edo chamberlain agree 
the best thng is for ygoro to submit a request to our lrd and say he will send ichi back to th castle .
 've been at him since th day before yesterday , but h rfuses .
naturally .
well  i do n't blame him .
but you know very well ... that we ca n't have ll our wishes granted n ths world .
group head ktani cme ovr in the afternoon 
but i cold n't bring myself to tell you 
fther is clling yo 
acting as if som crisis has ccurred nd hiding it from m .
ichi ,  must tell you smething 
come into the rom .
frst , fther 's words .
he says he 's rtired , so i am the family head , and  am to do wht i think s rght .
however  he also says yo 're too important t us t send away .
that we must take the best possible car of you .
i must tell hr sooner or later 
do n't worry .
no matter what nyone says 
 will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is not a dll .
yes , you 're right .
but yu c n't reson with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo , what 's your opinion ?
it s all p to him .
what is it ?
i 'd like him to come gain now and explain in his words why we must return her .
when his son 's mther proves inconvnient , h forcs her to marry  vassal .
this is cruel and unreasonable .
h hs no understanding of human emtons .
ktanisan  our famly did n't accept ichi prtcularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself knw ygor or the sasahara fmily .
she was none too happy about it eithr .
but the reason thy re getting along is because they re kind to ach other and car for each other .
what ?
even f the hevens rain fir ...
and blood ?
ktansan , i think this is nugh for today .
i beg you .
wuld you give p tomi nd return to the castle ?
wuld yo ruin our family becaus yu 'v lost your head ver a woman ?
in this case
brother !
i m 
bunzo , if you wer me  wuld you rturn ichi ?
of course i would 
restrain yorself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the head of the family .
right or wrong , it 's all p to him 
if you lv yogoro and tomi  be prepared to defy such snseless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are a wife worth protecting , ven if that means ruining our family .
i am nt worthy of it .
but ths wo n't be the nd of it 
i gve her the messge .
she will be hre soon .
over here , sister .
we 'v heard all bout what has happned .
we 'd like to know how you fel about t .
do you want to stay with yogor , even f it mans ruining the sashar family ?
i would like to stay .
even if you ruin the family ?
ich .
your father , hyomon shimi , hs asked our lord that you be sent back t the cstle as son as possibl 
i 'm sure you re war of that .
h lies in wait when yogoro travels t and from the castl to plad wth hm t send you back .
he 's done this several tmes 
fthr is father .
 am me .
i would rthr die thn retrn .
please tell the chamberlains and stwrd how i feel n whatever words you think will best help my cas .
we ask yo again , ichi !
th family does n't mattr ?
not nly the sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeoprdized as well .
it can not be helped .
i see .
there 's no use trying to convinc a woman like this .
ygoro 's to blame t 
it 's your msfortune that a woman like her has favored you .
return .
return to the cstle .
why do you say that nw ?
what 's the ssahara fmily to you 
listen to m .
in other words   'm a worthless , good-fr-nothing man .
so in rder to prve myslf , for thes past 20 years
i have fought to preserve our god name and scial standing .
the crel injustic involved , for one thing .
but yor beautiful love for ech other has touched me most of all 
ther 's nver been a shrd f lv in my married life 
no mattr what happens , never leav hm !
my husband 's with the chambrlain ?
ys , and he 's witing for you to come .
i saw him in the cstle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you bth .
he has some qestns for you .
you ned n't worry .
i will accmpany you .
f you lse heart now , what will it mean for my brother ?
hurry !
father  where did you go today ?
t see tatewaki .
anything new t the castle ?
no , nothing yt .
i hope nothing happens 
she went out .
wht happned to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ichi ?
bunzo , yo trickd her .
no matter how many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going home .
chi , take my advce nd retrn to th castle .
if you go back to the castle obedntly without mkng a fuss , the chamberlan is willing to verlook everything 
but if you insist on rturning home , not only will ygro , but also his father , saburo , be ordered to commt sppuku fr lax suprvision of their home .
honorable lady ichi , plase rturn to the castle .
ys .
my name s kku .
th chamberlain 's orders ?
what rders 
go home !
but ... if i go home wthout
say no more 
but
fool .
tomi  you fool 
tmi , you fool .
yogro .
but he dd request time off du to illness .
and tmi ?
the chamberlan ordred th wif of fotman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twce a day .
a god , solid wman .
thn everything 's all over ?
yes .
we just tok a rundabout pth .
defyng the clan gets s nowher .
isaburo , d yo really mean that ?
i cme to make sre f your thoughts on ths matter .
to be honest  the clan 's tratment f yur fmily and yur ttitude in response hv weghed on my mind .
weighed on your mind ?
it 's like yor swordplay .
pushed  you step back .
but it 's not like you t give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
it was more like force .
in fact , it ws more like kdnapping .
if the shogunate officals in edo hr of it , or even the daimyo , it may prv a fatal mistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll allw them to end here .
you 're sayng i must frmally sk the castle to tak her back ?
yet i must sk them to take hr back ?
it was wise of yo to hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint .
 refuse 
 do n't remember sending hr back to the castl .
why d n't you do as h says ?
that 's ridiclous , father !
nver 
she suppressed her tears , left evrything behind , and quietly returnd to the castl .
now  nw  yogoro .
in any case , pleas go for nw .
ygro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
ygoro will report today and say he wishes to return her ?
that 's wnderful .
now we can look forward to the suw shrin festival tomorrow .
since it would have come to this anyway , how dar thy cause all that fuss !
yogoro was wrong , but isaburo was insolent s well .
h s always henpcked by hs wif 
and defyng clan orders lik that
i mst say he seems like  dfferent man .
his conduct has been admirabl .
t calls for a slight increase in his fief .
ygoro sashara of the scort group has rrived !
i 'm glad you 've rported for duty .
yes , completely well .
taking into considration my father 's wishes ,  have decidd .
plase accpt this .
that 's good of you .
thank you .
fol !
petition 
this is the cruelest form of tyranny .
it rns conter to the laws of humanity and can not b condond by the heavens .
we hereby ppeal for her immediate return 
somne may use my fathr 's name r my wn to submt  rquest to return ichi to th castle 
but it will not be from us .
please kep that n mind .
thank you for coming every day .
the mats 
it 's a custom at times like these .
so our feet wo n't slip in th blood .
this may be the lst tme .
will yo do me a favor ?
wll you cok th rice after you feed tom ?
just cok the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excus me !
orders from ur lord !
accpt obedintly !
i said orders from our lord !
will you not bey ?
let s hear what the orders are 
orders !
isaburo and ygoro sasahara , for your insolent conduct and defiance toward ur lord , you ar rdered t commt seppuku .
seppuk ?
t is gracious of our lord to permit it .
i thought men would come arrest us and then ther hang or crucfy us 
fathr .
however , we wnt something bfre we kill ourselves .
bring us thr heads !
those of lord msakata matsudaira , ruler of the izu domain ,
chamberlin yanase , and steward takahashi .
bring m the heads of the villains who took my son s wif !
vassal tatwaki asno in charge f boundary gates has arrived !
i her yu re
isaburo 's only eqal as a swrdsman .
f you think he s too much for you , take four or fve strong men with yu 
ar they not nw criminals in th yes of our clan ?
yes 
i m in chrge of brder gates .
this is no time to discuss jurisdiction .
you 'r wrong .
f yu rder me to kill them , please promote me to suprintendent here nd now and obtain our lord 's promise t increase my fief to 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mnd .
go !
we must gathr men  se frce and kill them .
a foolsh dea .
saburo 's a swordsman without peer .
what ?
cold , s n't t ?
what time is it 
past 9:00 , i think 
that should be enogh for yu .
from the footsteps , he 's alne .
it 's bnzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father 
is it nice nd cozy at kenmotsu 's place 
listen to the festival drums .
father !
you were pressed by our relatives at kenmtsu 's place to com here as their messenger and say ,
we 've defied or lord long enogh .
bunz , do n't hate us .
bt remember :
each mst live his own life .
as for what happned ,
each mst live his wn lif .
nd tll everyne ths for me :
have n't you takn cr of sashara yt ?
what re you doing ?
what if other clans hear f this  sanzaemon 
gather some men nd tak cre of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlin 's intervention would aggravat matters 
fthr  the drum from th suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late 
i remember it to .
outside the castl , it was the inoko festval , when th harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the day befr the suwa shrin festival 
father .
what is it ?
tht 's as it should be .
it 's not unmanly at all .
bt yogoro , do n't be t worred bout ichi .
we will die here , but she is the mother of our lord 's heir .
n one can torture her  and no ne wll endnger hr life .
but father , ar n't they late in coming ?
i meant to sk for permission to entr , but the gat ws open , so i came in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
we have heard of the order to commit seppku .
he changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara  fr your insolence and attitude toward ur lord  you will be confned at enshoji temple outside the cstl .
why the sudden chng ?
will you grtefully ccept ur lord 's new orders 
no .
no , he s wrong !
t was nt as the heir 's mother .
i am still the wife of ygoro sasahra .
but or lord recived me in his audience .
i do n't understand what this is all about .
steward , it seems w do n't understand what you just told us .
if yo two admit that ichi is no longer a family member and that sh hs ben returned , ur lord will listen to her pl for a lighter punishment .
wll you acknowledge her return and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which wll it b ?
we are prepared for the worst 
then there is no alterntive ?
please return her at onc 
i 'll ask lady ichi now 
or wll you let thir pursuers cme and kill thm ?
lady ichi , the sasaharas are men .
you hav alrady returned to serve our lord .
if yo tell them that yo sever your ties with them once and for all , then all will be well 
if yo do , their lives will be saved .
we need not ask them to return you .
wait !
do n't move !
d n't move 
lady ich , will yo sever your ties with them and save their lives ?
r will you let them die as traitrs ?
what will yur answr be ?
lady ichi  does your silence men you will do as i say ?
am i correct ?
no .
i
fathr ..
tmi , bid your fther and mother farewell .
have  good look at them .
they ar your father nd mother .
let us who are still alive listen to them .
let 's lsten to what they want us to do .
no , i knw withut being told .
they want us to tell the world of our clan s cruelty !
vry well .
i understand .
w promse to do that for yu .
w 'll topple th aizu clan from its pedestal 
frst , tmi and  will g to ed together and see the shogunte lders .
we 'll leave immediatly for edo .
tomi and  are going to edo .
f this s for the clan , show me your pass .
if it s prvate business , show me the cln tckt .
i hve neither .
then i 'm afraid i can not let you pass .
yo mean to pss from this domain without having eithr ?
 must frbid it 
that ca n't be helped .
sh is very quiet .
i 'd like to put her in the house wy from th wind .
bt men w dislik are in there .
venmous mn .
i fed her before dawn .
i do n't think she 's hungry .
we 'll make do with this .

do nt cry even if  do n't retrn .
let me rmain .
it 's better that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sak .
no .
no matter how strong you re , how perfect your defnse ,
i 'll defeat you nd go to edo with tmi .
thn ...
without fil 
i will win without fil .
tatewaki !
i had no chnc of winning .
take tmi with yu to edo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
no one wll ever know the story of yor fathr nd mother now .
jst one word 
when you grow up , become a woman just like your mother .

this is or galaxy , the mlky way .
our sun taks 225 million years to go rond the galaxy once
the dinosur era lasted 180 millin yars .
this is a comet .
it s all ice and rock 
ts 10 miles wide , and it 's heded for the erth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not relly .
at this tme the msters of the arth are dinosaurs .
ths is patagoni .
a vast region of rgentinean south america as it is today .
nd there was only on immense ocean 
we are north of the sth american plate  in the sa that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some spcies of chthyosarus grew up to 75 ft 
extreme forms f lf also appered on land during the dinsaur era .
n many places there , one wlks today n the very ground these giants walked upon a 100 mllion years ago 
this phnomnn seems to depend n another pecliar twist f evoluton .
regions that produce grt dinosaurs lso tend to produce great palaeontologsts .
many doctoral students come to pursue their reserch .
sometimes younger peple  lik my daughter ludmil , just come to satisfy their criosity .
 lve talking abut dinosaurs with everyone  whether they are experts or not .
it s a busy lif , and it would hav been plenty for most people  but arly n my career new hrizns opened p for me .
things becme much larger than life .
a rancher had stumbled pn a surprisingly lrge bone .
after several dgging seasons we ended up facing the largest dinosaur evr found .
we named it rgentinosaurus
ths dscovery hav a prfound effect , n th wy we look at south amercan dinosaurs .
on a personal levl , it took a big place in my life to say the least .
yt it starts its life in eggs jst a little bigger than grapefruit 
predators nd hazards abound .
only a few will reach dulthood .
it covers more than 15 miles and it is pproximately 80 millin years ld 
we believ that it was chosn as  nsting site by gneration upon generaton of these dinsaurs 
the nests ar so clse together , that the females cld not walk between them .
it was warmer than tody .
a great part of the dinosaur era , there were no broad lef trees and no flower bearing plants .
during the dinosar er thre is no arctic ic caps , and antarctica is sb-trpicl .
for tens of millions of years seasons barly chnged .
the water of the ocean is ls mch warmer .
hurrcanes are frequent 
the magnetic poles changes positon continuously .
professor coria has contributed to th discvery f more than a dozen of new dinosaurs .
as a scientist , he insists that each new fnd is important , n matter how big or small .
and sometimes he says what plays th biggest part is smply not in our hands 
 like t think that i m lucky , just incrdibly lucky .
many pleontlogical discoveries are not made by professionls .
that 's what happned with the argentinosaurus , nd it happened again with yt another dinosaur .
they were rlatively big , s at frst  w thought tht they belonged to a herbvore , bcause in general thes dinosaurs tend to be lrger .
but instead , the bones prved to be those f a predtr ;
a very large one .
professor cora 's team had unveiled a first species of  grup of fierce predators clled giganotosaurs .
the 3 species in this group surpassd the fmous t. rex in terms of size .
although rare for reptiles , caring for the yong has be observed among crocodles fr nstanc .
in dnosaurs , this caring behaviour evolve enugh to remind us f brds .
this baby female is named long toth .
however small and vulnerabl  and cute she my appear now she is genetically programmed to rpdly become a 45 fot long , eight tnne prdtor like her mothr .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbvre and the largest predator , livng at roughly the sam period and in th sm territory .
there is no asy answer .
evltion follwed a number of particular paths .
bt a simpler interpretation rest on a warm climate and the fertile land  with all the vegettin you can eat .
yet anthr theory tlls us that large hrbivores hd t grw big enough , to accommodate a large stomach reqired to digest high in fibr , low in protein vgtatin .
finlly , larg spans f flat space cld hve led naturally to rgentnosaurus , as the vast seas have led to whales .
the highst branches belong to those who can rach them , and many predators re to smll to be threatening n those stuation .
she is growing fst too .
her primitive feathers have almost all dsappered .
thy thrvd for 180 mllion yers .
ths is a message for us here .
by the way , it s more thn tme to introduc sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pond mal rptor .
he is related to birds , as are t some extent velocirptors , giganotsaurus nd tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs ned space .
ths is the carmen funes musem , which als happens t b my second home .
sometimes as a joke we say that it is a science filled wth holes .
we have only found abot 700 specis of dinosurs on the whole planet .
this s n't many for a rign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of thse dinosaurs were found n argentina , most f them in the last 30 years .
thrgh tchnology ur knowledge grows faster every day .
fossilisation is a prcess that requirs extremly rare conditions , and evn then very little of an rganism is preserved .
w could easly conclude that a tremendous number of species just disappeared withot a trace .
f course , science fiction can be fun , but you also need t be very careful before propsing a new wy of looking at dnosaurs .
i wish i cold travel in time to see thse amazing creatures alive .
strong on hs reachd matrity .
fr mny scientists he is at full size .
he is 20-year-ld , and is at the beginnng of more than a century of lfe .
they tell s , if the animl was wlking n tw lgs or four , if they were alne r in a grup , if they wre wandering , hnting , r being hunted
the pattern clearly show assocation between contemporary spcies , nd this is very rare .
his work is intimately linked to natre , its intimately varid terrin and ever changing climate 
so there were hardships , but there ar mmnts , sometmes when scenc just blend wth the pure bliss of being outsid and wondrful places 
you jst look round .
but finding rquired a traind y .
with time you realise that the number of questions grows faster than the number of answers .
gain , lke many tims before ,
a good hint and an answer came unxpectdly .
in fact , we did n't find just one specmen but a chmber of bones belonging to t least seven individals 
for me , and my canadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at smething w hd cnsiderd , bt have no evidence for until then .
so long trth belongs t this new species of giganotosaurs .
and at 22 yars of age , she is flly grown .
strong one is unknowingly in  critical time 
tearing off pieces of skin and letting the lrge prey bleed to death , or die from infection is a strategy more likly to succeed .
giganotosaurus could wit days evn weks btween mals .
millions f years pss  and as the continents keep on drifting , the earth begins to resemble more what it is today 
speces emerge , evolve , disappear .
natur never stops changing 
we ar in north america .
aprt from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with brds
and evolutin gve it nothng to surviv the impnding dramtic events .
severl factrs cold have contrbuted to the dmise of dinosaurs 
mammals becam bigger and more comptitive .
drifting solated continents touched each othr .
new rivalries appeared .
new diseases spread .
th climate ws grwing colder , possibly becase of ncreased volcnic activity .
the air was unbrathable in many places 
vegettion sufferd frm the acid rain nd lso from the darkned and dust-filled skies .
but stll , many dnosars mad it through for a little while longr 
t covers the distance from the moon to the earth n two hors .
all the frest f nrth and south merica are destroyed by fir .
already weakened , dnosaurs are the animals that suffered most 
in a relatively short time , dinsurs become hstory .
not ll the dinosars dispper .
if they have n't become xtinct maybe we just would n't be here .
more discoveres awat m here perhaps but s i move forward in lif ,
and the best food in paris , some sy , is mde by chef auguste guste .
gstea 's restaurant is the toast of paris  boked five months in advanc 
he is the youngest chef ever to achieve a fvestr rating .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cok !
bt not veryone celebrates its sccess .
what 's evn mre amusing s that gsteau actually seems to believe it .
i , on the othr hand , tke cooking srously 
this is me .
i think it s apparnt i need to rethink my life  littl bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugr , vanill bean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon 
who , you can smell all that ?
this s emile , my brother .
he s easily impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never imprssed .
he also happens t be the leader of our clan .
so , what 's wrong with having highly dveloped senses ?
wht s going on here ?
suddenly , dad did n't think my talnt was seless .
clen .
cleanerific .
cleanerno .
nevr mind .
well  it made my dad proud .
now , d nt you fel btter  remy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we re thievs , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't steling f no one wants it .
if no one wnts it  why re we stealing it ?
but t my dad ...
you gt picky bout what you put in the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and at yur garbage .
scondly , sty out of the kitchen nd away from the humans .
it s dangerous .
thy dscover , thy crete .
how cn i describe it ?
good fod is like msic yu cn taste , color yo can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it 
oh , gusteau was right .
h  mmm , yeah .
ach flavor ws totally unique .
so now  had  scret life .
the only one who knw about it was emil .
hey , emle .
mil .
come on , you 're god at hding food .
he does n't undrstand me , bt  can b myself around him .
why are you walking like that ?
 do n't wnt to cnstntly have to wash my pws .
did you ever think about how w walk on the same paws that we handle food with ?
you ever think about what we put into our moths 
all the tme .
but if dad sees you walking lke that  he 's nt going to like t .
what hve you got thre ?
ah , oh , oh ..
you fond cheese ?
and nt just any cheese .
that wold go beutiflly with my mushroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we re suppsed to retrn to the colny before sundown or , you know , dad 's gn na ...
emile !
there are possibilites unexplored her .
we got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cok this is th real question ...
the key is to keep turning it .
that storm 's getting closer .
hey , rmy , you think that myb we should n't be so ...
you got to tste this !
it 's got , like  this ba-boom , zap knd of tast .
do nt yu thnk 
lightning-y 
yeah .

we got t do tht again .
okay , when the next storm comes  we ll g up n the roof ...
i know wht this neds !
saffrn 
saffrn .
do nt lik it .
she s gon na wak up .
she turns on th coking chnnel , boom , she never waks up .
you 've been here  million times 
gusteau swears by t .
okay 
who 's gustea ?
just the gratst chef in the world .
wrote this cookbook .
you read ?
and they have , which is why i read .
i do n't like screts .
all this cookng and rading and tv-watching while w read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's taking those kids so lng ?
ah , l'aqula sffron .
italan .
gustau says it 's excellnt .
god thing the old lady is a fod lov ...
frget mystiqu .
great coking is not for the fant of heart .
you must b imaginative , strong hearted .
yu must try thngs that may not work .
and yo must not let anyone dfine your limits because f where you com frm .
anyone cn cook .
but only the fearless cn be great .
gusteu 's restaurnt lost ne of its five stars after a scthing review by france 's top food critic , anton eg .
it was  sevre blow t gustu , and the broknhearted chf died shrtly afterwards , which , according to trdition , ment the loss of another star .

and on the first day !
though i , like many other critic ,
had written off gusteau as irrelevant sinc the great chef 's death 
the soup was a revlation .
solène leclaire ?
gainst all odds , gustau 's has recaptured our attention .
only time will tll if they deserve it 
well ..

then who do i thnk fr the mel ?
y must be the chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait until all th other custmr have gon .
at first , g thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react beyond asking an ccasional qustion 
and whn the story is done , ego stands , thanks s for the mel ..
we risk very little , yet enjoy a position ovr thos who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative critcism , whch s fun to write and t read .
the world is often nkind to new talent  nw cretions 
th nw neds friends .
last night , i xperincd something new , an extraordinary meal from a sngulrly unexpected source .
but i realiz only now d i truly understand what he meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a great artist can cme frm anywhere 
it is difficult to imagine more humble orgins than those of the gnius nw cooking t gustau 's  who s  in ths critic 's opnon , nothing lss than the finest chef n france 
i will b rtrning to gustau 's soon  hngry for mre .
i wll be rturning to gustea 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a great nght .
wll  we hd to let skinner and the health inspector lose , and of course thy rtted us out 
the fod did n't matter .

he seems very happy .

you know , i do n't lik to brag  but if t had nt been for the fct that i used to work thre ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmetic and logc , and otput .

now , in the past couple f weeks ,

hey ... this may b a wy of getting rid of dean higgins .

each of our learnd gests will be allowed 3 questions 
our first questions will be from dr. rufus schmidt , head of the deprtment of highr mathematcs at purdue university .
dr. schmidt .

i see .
mr. reilly , using the fundamntal theorm of advanced clculus , nd applying the formul that the squar of a distance from th origin to p
is equal t x squred plus y squared pls z squared .
you se ?
he 's getting his confidence .
your next qestion , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 .
the squre root of that product wuld be ... 102,978 .
 'm afraid that 's quite crrect .
hey .
mn 
i must sy  that ws really something .
yes  i suppose it was , but would nt it speed things up a bit if we could save the appluse till the end ?
ys , uh , i 'm sur the audince would be glad to comply .

except for the activity up in th hayloft , the frm was pretty quiet that morning .
they could slep through anything .
but a lot of the other animals wer awaknd by all that scurrying overhead .
some of them just ccepted it .
some were pretty annyd 
but the mod ws very dfferent p in the hayloft .
she was determined to be a gd mother and never yell at her kittns .
but that approach would not last very long , becus milo  one of her kittens , ws trouble frm the very bginning .
milo  dear , his mther said , that 's not a good idea !
come back here , mlo !
you 're a strange-looking cat , milo said .
oh ,  'm not a cat .
milo tried to figur this out and sid ,
oh  all right , a dog 
but , um , really , deep down insde , we 're all cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barked .
the kittens were now bg enogh to leave the hayloft and see the world beyond the barn .
s usual , mlo got into trubl .
he ws the first to start calling ot for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemd to mlo she yelld a lot .
milo , did you har me ?
this s th dock and dwn there is the river .
vryone understand ?
what 's to close ?
milo asked .
s this ?
oh !
ah !
mil , get back here , his mother demanded .
but milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept way by the river .
right now .
and behave whle i 'm gne .
oh , mlo 
are yo all right ?
eh  yes , milo meowed .
i think so , milo said .
all right , be carefl , his mother ordered , and began swimming .
all right 
i 'm not gong to yell , his mother said .
now dry yurslf off , like ths :
and follow me back home .
tht was fun .
h , h .
milo !
gt over her !
the mnths passed , and the frm was humming wth the sounds of summr .
milo had some nw hiding places he cold n't wait to try ot .
ts sniffed arund the yard for a while .
you 're in the pipe , milo .
try agan 
cat 's n the cn !
and milo slipped off to anther hiding place .
it was n't asy fooling a dog 's nos .
mlo tried a harder spot .
but otis found him ther too .
now milo needd a brilliant ide 
aha .
he thoght of a place where ts could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but mlo wondered if it was really worth the trouble .
milo and otis went to see what ll the commtin ws about 
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rng out :
and all the hens left in  clckng flurry because tht was gloria talking , a young chcken who had scrtched and pckd hr way to the tp rung of the henhouse .
glria had a good reason for wanting to b alone .
there t is , fellas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
s it fnally happened .
is she staying at home with it or is she going back to work 
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kick it bck to you , tis ?
milo asked .
otis said .
i kicked it by accident .
glori gave us  job to do .
hw long do we have to stck around ths henhouse ?
ntil gloria comes back .
maybe you do n't realize it , mil , but this is a majr day for me because ...
well  maybe you d n't realize that this is the day i 've become  wtchdog .
sme strange noises brought milo out of the hnhouse 
wht was all this about ?
hey !
your snging stinks .
com her , otis , a frog croaked .
otis sid .
otis  it 's yor cat buddy .
otis  come on .
at that moment , ml was tasing a crab that was wddling through the farmyard .
h deserved it  the frog croaked .
nd outside  milo and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis growld .
just try something .
probably rotten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird animal 
the nise attractd a group of locl snops looking to dig up some scandal 
i think we 're hving  baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your mmmy 's a chicken .
the other nimls told otis he 'd better take the chick to gloria , and quickly , whch he did .
but the chick kept comng back to otis .
now g back to gloria .
do you understand ?
wof , the chick peped .
woof , wof , mommy .
okay  you want to b a dog ?
otis barked 
you 've got to be a rough , tough , mean , fighting dog , like ths .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it  try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , otis thught .
i 'll mss him 
i 'll miss him .
come n , said mil 
phew .
wow , look at this thng , otis , milo said .
oh .
ots dried off and came back to settle th scor with tht --
that  uh , thing .
h  ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up , otis 
maybe mlo was having a terrific time , but tis was pretty scared .
then tis saw a bridge up ahed .
maybe he could jump off the bridge into the box f he hurred .
but he ws to late 
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work either 
otis jst could nt swim fast enough and the rvr tok mlo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried untl he lst sght of otis .
sddnly he heard somthing moving in the bushs .
was it otis ?
dfinitely not .
milo tried to duck lw in th box so the bear would n't see him .
but the box was driftng right towrds the hngry animal 
but unfortunately mch to soon .
the bear saw what was n that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size 
h ran up on the rverbank , leading the bear awy from milo .
milo kept drifting along , bt h was gettng a little concerned becase the river was bginning to move fster .. and faster .
he 'd lost track of otis now , and h was drifting frther and farther from home .
by the time the mon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the forest .
and he heard mysterios hots and growls and cries in the night .
he began to wish he 'd nver jumped into this box nd he began to wish he was home .
it smed to be trmbling as much as h was in th chilly , misty night .
he drifted on through the darkness  hoping to find the morning wating just arund the bend .
when daylight came ,
mil saw a farm on the riverbank .
for on happy momnt , he thought h was hom and cried ut fr joy .
but he lokd again .
he dd n't know when h wold ever see it again 
here cms the dog yur life h -- ♪♪
the deadwood swamp 
a bg whre skleton trees grew wthout laves or branches , and wher no crature cold live , excpt for the dreded deadwood birds .
and on f them ws prching on a familar wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
thre s the box 
poor ct 
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
look n the box .
ots prepred himself and peked in th box and sw only a solitary black fether .
in fact , mil was nowhere nar the deadwod swamp .
aftr his box gt stuck thre , he ran .
he ran from thos birds as qickly as he could .
now he found himself n a burning valley .
th ground was hot nd the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to n open madw where he saw a kind of animal h 'd nevr seen before .
feeling pretty hungry  he immediately wondered ,
s that something yo can et ?
heh .
hell , somone there ?
ha , ha .
i must b very careful  milo thought .
nd above all , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox flt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch where he figured no one would evr be able to find it .
yeah , here , my prcious muskrat .
you shuld be safe ther tll dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crpt slowly down the tr and watched the fx run ovr the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on a big , tasty muskrt lunch .
otis , meanwhle , had traveled thrugh the wtlands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered there was one magic word everyne understood and that ws please .
s he marched up t a clm hle and sid ,
aww .
th cluds wer getting darker and darker nd a chilly wind was whpping acrss th cuntryside .
milo was severl mles from th beach caught in the same storm .
h got a little wet and he felt awfully lonesm without otis , but at least he was safe 
the tid came in so fast tht the rock otis had been sitting on was completely surronded by watr .
ah , he 'd nver be able to swim to shore .
and the water was growing higher .
now the wter was up to his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he took a deep brath , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh , not again , th sa turtle gurgled .
every tme the tde coms in some fool gets stuck out here .
otis was n't sre what this turtle wanted 
well , nw you know .
now , just stay on the shore  whre you belong , the turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
next tme the tid comes in ,  'll have to rscue somebody else .
yo savd mine .
no , said otis , i did n't know that .
heh 
otis resumed his search for mlo .
ooh , mch better .
excuse m , otis called out ,  m looking fr a frind of mine .
i hve n't got time , otis said , snsing this fox was n't gon n be ny help .
how cn you be a dg 
otis was outraged .
ha !
h marveled at this road made of wood and iron nd decided t fllow the road and see wher it would take him 
t could 've rn right ovr me .
but milo was determined .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired nd thirsty , a deer whispered .
 'm not sure cats know how to bound  milo said .
bound and leap , like a zephyr st free .
bound nd , of course , leap .
it just does n't lok right when i do it .
frolic with m , frend .
come , frlic .
frolic .
i 'm frolicking .
i 'm frolicking .
you see ?
hem .
you can stop frolcking now  th deer cooed 
i thnk i 'm a little tuckered ot , milo sid .
ys , it is pssible to ver-frolic , the deer murmured 
and the deer took mil to a soft , mossy spot on the forest flor .
and mlo was asleep within moments .
h had trailed milo from the deadwood swamp to th fox 's meadow .
nd now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finally fnd th friend he missed s much .
but now , it was the end of a long dy of hard traveling .
as evening was fallng ,
milo decided the safest place t spend the night would be in a tre .
nd what are you doing up here ?
hiding frm th screch owls , i suppos .
does this nest belong t you 
ys  and it 's not just any nest , i ll hve you know .
i 'm the nght bird , and that is a dreaming nest .
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear ct , anyon sleeping there wll hav his sleep floded wth dreams , th bird said .
but it 's a safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... w 'd think of a clver plot dvice .

narrtor :
fr severl weeks , mrs. white was greatly helped by the psychiatric treatment .
she had no mre blckout spells ... at last none that she was ware of .. but not quite a year later , several things happened ... that showed her t be in urgent need of help .

a woman 's voice ?
can you rcognize t in any way ?
it sounds familiar sometmes ... but i do n't really recognize it 
to do things like ... leave rlph ... take bonnie and run awy .
that is what it means , is n't t ?
yu 've ben frightend by this vice .. because you rcogniz it as a symptom of illness .
dos n't make any dffrence .
you just do n't wan na tell me  but it does .

mrs. whit  dear dr luther ..
narrator :
in winter , endless darknss is brghtned by the frisky dance of the northern lghts .
and 30 blow s the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar ber families .
ne hundred and fifty thousand years ag some brown bars moved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bears cn not thrive anywhere else .
polar bers have always hunted from floting platforms f sa ice .
that 's why the arctc is warming twice s fast s any other rgion .
n 1980 the summer se ice covered 25 prcent more ocan than it dos now .
if th current trend continues the arctic ocean could be free of se ice each summer by th year 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss  w can slow t dwn .
most arctic glacirs are melting faster than ever bfore .
the distance betwen ce packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bar in sarch of se ce often hs further t go .
some cbs do survive especially f the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do the nuit peopl lke simn qamanirq .
simon :
polar bears surprise us n camp .
but now the ancint wether patterns have changd .
our grandfathers fed their families well .
my famly has alwys depndd on snow and ic .
sometimes we fall throgh .
my frend adam rvetch has been coming up here for 20 yers to photgraph the animals .
these ddicated mothers pt ver two yars into rising their yong .
walrus moms spend vn longer .
they dve down from rafts of ic which drift lng and carry thm t fresh supplies of their fvorite tret .
mothers teach thir young survival skills such as scring off intruders .
one morn snt me a very clear messag :
thy 're testing each other 's skills .
this water is literally as cold as ice .
the salt keps it frm freezing .
down here , there 's only one exit and it 's pretty scry thinking y culd be trapped .
each spring n alaska large herds of crbou set ut on a long journey .
karsten :
we 're gn n do this trip to see what the cribou mthers go throgh and t se this migration frm their perspctiv .
leanne :
these newlywds will follow the cribou ll the wy to their brthing grounds .
yh , just over ther ...
krsten :
this is climate chang slowing down the herd .
some of thes calves are just  week or two old , and they re easy pickings for bears and wlves .
ths is the place whre the clves have their best chance to srvive .
thse bgs are potntially dadly to these cribou .
to get way .
caribu mothers re havng a tgh time as the arctic wrms .
but polar bear mothers face an even greater struggle .
my nam is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of this ship .
narrator :
there re ovr 20,000 polar bars in the world and mst of them are camera-shy .
one ber was espcially helpful .
it s hard to kep up when you 're nly 3 months old .
next yar we 're coming back with stronger cases .
nrrator :
bars nearly alwys avoid people which mad filming them next to impossible .
then the team gt lucky .
for five days , she never lft ther bat .
because the sun never sets in the summr bedtime is anytime 
bjorne 
hungry males prefr seals but in a pinch , they have alwys gon after defenseless cubs .
the mother seemed to pick p the scnt f a male .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finally spotted a male qite a ways off zeroing in on the mother and her cbs .
now that sals are so hard to catch , strving males might be targetng cubs more oftn .
but next time thngs could be much dffrent .
playful cubs can really work up an appetit .
bjorn :
when yu want t grab a bite to eat up here timing is everything 
the cubs finish everything on their plate but the scent of fresh seal met attracts ttention .
bt the male picks up the family 's scent agin .
we watch helplessly as th male sneaks up .
the male kps gining on the fmily .
then the mother turns t face him ... ... slowing him down just long enough for her frightnd cubs to escpe .
at the moment of truth , th mothr sent a vry clear message 
you can gt to my cubs if yo want bt yu 'll have to kill me first .
narrtr :
but she 's powerless to save the habitat they ned to survive 
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
bt the arctic s warming fstr thn it has for thousands of yers and losing its dzzling crwn of ice .
the mothrs here nrture their yong so lovingly .
perhaps they can nspire us to prtect their home with that sam care .

they do n't call him robert th terrible for nothing .
he 's the king 's own brother , but he 's as bad s the king is good .
and , for his treachery , was banishd from monteria .

fr robert to claim the thron , they must b gone !

it did n't come up .
surely the king 's heroes would know of hs plans !
tell me when the king will rturn , or say goodbye to the princess .
let her g !
it was all a misunderstanding .
we 'r no heroes .
we work in a restaurnt .
we clr dishes .
w clean up .
that s right .
he 's s lazy , he ca n't ven climb a ladder wthout givng p .

what wuld i see if i rode on a beam of light ?
perhaps some srt of electrical force is emanating outwrds from th wire .
what ?
it is my great ambition to demonstrate that natur is a clsd system

it is a return to the old ways !

thank you .
its athor was a youthful albrt einsten 
it s the most fmous quation in the world :
all board !
but while we 've all heard of einstein 's big dea , very fw of us knw what it means .
we 've only gt sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but frst ...
dinnr !
hmm ?
food  thn talk .
the gods wer not laughing at insten .
he 'd united in one stunning nsight th work of many who had come before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't thnk in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drve t understand the hddn mysteries of natur would begin t change ll that .
yung michel faraday hated his job 
he was unducted , the son f  blacksmith .
he 'd ben lucky to becme a bookbinder s apprentic .
bt faraday craved one thing .
all of his free time and his mager wages were poured into his selfeducation .
can  pss , please 
can i pass ?
of course  of curse ...
pass , pass .
ths way to a better life .
in the arly 1800s , science was the pursuit of gentlemen  something farady was clearly nt 
h had a rudimentary education  he 'd rd widely , he d gne to public lectures , but in 1812 h was given tickets to hear sir hmphry davy , th most prominent chemist of th age .
nineteenth-century scntists were the pp stars f their day .
ther lecturs wer hugely popular .
tickets were hard to come by , and davy reveled in his status .
they 're wating 
metals .. unknown , that is , until i islted potassium from molten potash and sodium , as i showed y last time , from common salt .
help me be part f the great circle that is your work and love 
my desire , sir , is t escpe from trade , which i find vicius and selfish , and to become  servant f scence  which , i magine , makes ts pursuers amibl and librl .
really ?
well , i shall leav t t the experienc of a few yers to set yo right on that scre .
look  i have nt anything at the moment 
faraday was determined to break free from his daily toil .
newman ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhps with god and faraday n charge of the chemicls , yo and i will b safe in our place of wrk .
just stick to yur job and d as you 'r told nd you 'll be fine , frady .
faraday becme the labortory assistant , eagerly absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy degned to imprt .
the big xcitement of th dy was electricty 
anther charge , newman .
bt n one relly understood wht ths strange force f electricty was 
the academic establishment at the time thought that elctricity ws , you know , lke a fluid flowing through a pipe , pushing its way along .
but in 1821 , a dnsh researcher showd that whn yo pss an electric current thrugh a wire and plac a compss nar t , it deflcted th nedle t right angles .
faraday , cme lok at this 
perhps you cn work t out .
oersted 's rported an amazing finding .
now , that is remarkable .
but if th electrcal force is flowing through the wire  why does the nedle not move in the same directon , parallel to the wre ?
gin , newmn .
what ?
perhaps some sort of electrcl force is emanating utwards from the wir .
oh , my dear boy , let m tell yo tht at the university of cambridge , electricty flows through a wire , not sidwys to it .
that may be what they tech at cambrdge , but it does n't xplain what 's hppning befre ur eyes .
no , nw , let 's just get on 
it was a fscintion inspired by his relgion .
for him , th problem was a way to nderstand gd 's hidden mystries 
there is  small , almost persecutd group in london calld th sandemanians .
they were a religious ...
faraday was a member of that group .
that if yo opened p one little part of it , you culd see how everything was connected .
faraday was different from nybody lse .
by mthodically placing a compass ll round an electrifid wire 
faraday started to notice a pattrn .
and then he imagined that a magnet had smilar lnes emerging from t and that thse lines would get caught up in this flw .
i 'm shaking , newman .
nderneath , i 'm shakng .
yes 
ths is the experment f the century .
scale up the magnets and the wirs , make them really big , attch havy weights t them and they ll be dragged long .
although he did n't realze it at the tme ,
the chemcals in the battery had been transformed int electricity n the wire , which had combined with th magnt t prodce motion .
behind ll these various forces ther was a cmmon nrgy .
s , faraday , what does wllaston make of all ths ?
he 's written to me and assures me that he 's taken no offense , and h acknowledges that what i pblshed was entirely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemently oppsed to you being electd a member of the socety .
and what do you think ?
faraday , my der boy , you hav my vot .
t 's the scence that counts .
so , tell me  how dos this wire of yurs spin round ts magnet ?
ther seems to be an electromagnetc nteraction .
in my mind ,  se a swirling array of lines of frce spinning ot of the electrified wire like  spiralng web .
bt nvisible lines of force ...
it 's all a bit vague , s n't it 
faraday , mght i have  word in prvt ?
listen , fraday , let 's stop this nonsnse .
i want yo to take down your ballot paper from th ntic board .
sir humphry , i se no reason to take it dwn .
it is thy who pt the paper up 
i wll not tak t down .
my father nd uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing electrc lght to th streets of germny 
from n early age , i lved to look at machines  understand how things work 
he 's going to kll himslf 
i xprenced a miracl whn my father showed me  compass .
there had t be smethng bhind objects that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
n yur feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whichver way they run  herr professor .
instein 's tachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shown , tht nrgy could be convrted from one form into another .
they also beleved that all forms f energy had already been discvered .
einstein was gong t prve them wrng .
deep in the hert f matter .
a hundred years before enstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolutin was just around the cornr 
and they felt that ne of the first tasks that lay head of them was t rationlize and to classify vry single kind of matter s they cold see how it ll intercted together .
antine lavosier ,  wealthy  aristocratic young man , decided to take up this task , to see if thre was sme basic connction betwen all the stuff of evryday life :
all the different substances in the world .
his meticlous , ven obsssiv attentin to detail ...
was also to be hs dwnfall 
your precise observations commend yu as a lady of scentfc criosity ,
most nsual .
for the lst fve weeks , i have taken nothing but mlk .
i would rthr die than fast on mlk fr five weks 
monsieur , with the greatest f respect to a membr of the royal cademy of sciences , your gut must think your thrat has ben slit !
how dare you insult the cunt ?
do n't forget what the count offers ... not just marrage , but thnk f hw yu will be introdced t all the salons .
you will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to mrry d'merval ?
then i must contrive to sve yu .
lavosier was nt a scintist by profession .
he was the had of tax enforcement in pris .
but his taxes on the simple things in life ...
dd not endear him t the avrage parisian .
this scrupulous , fastdus young man did still llow himself the ccasional act f passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anne paulze  the daughter of his clleagu in the tax offce .
thus he savd her , as he had promised , from an rranged marrage to  count 40 years her elder .
allow me t show you smethng .
what will happen if i tke a bar of coppr or iron and leave it utside n th rain for months on end ,
madme laviser ?
mmm ...
monseur lavoisier ?
the metals ...
is this  verbal xamination prior to an exmintion proper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let me press yo further .
hmm 
every last citizen in france of sensibl age knows that whn a metl rusts  it wastes away , it gets lighter and eventually disappears .
ah , but .
i have not finished .
cntain yourself , sir .
there is more .
n  recently pblished pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antine lavosier dmonstrates that the iron cmbines with the air 
it , n fact , becoms heavier .
sh larned english s tht she could trnslate cntemporary scientific works .
monseur , that is a terrible thing to sy .
yu ar a cheky mn .
messieurs .. it s my great ambition to demonstrate that ntur is a closed system  that in any transformation , no mount of matter , no mass is ever lost and none is gined 
ver here , plase .
from this end w cool the steam but , nterestingly , w collct less water than w started with .
so clearly we lse  certain mount of water .
now , when w combne these two increases ...
the nw wight of the iron barrel and the gas we have cllected ..
they are exactly equal to th wight of th lost water .
so what he had done is get th xygn to stick to the inside of  red-hot irn rifle barrl .
now  that lft the hydrogen , what he called combustibl r , and that was just floating around as a gs .
in the nxt few months i hope to demonstrate that i can recombine this combustibl air with vtal air and transform thm both back into water .
i wll re-creat exactly th same amount of water tht was lost here in this process .
t is my hope to complete the cycl ..
but t prove ths , he had to perform thousands of expermnts , and h had to d the measuremnts with incredbl accuracy .
tht 's where his gret wealth from being  tx collector came in .
ntine .
i 'm sorry .
th cdemy sked you to ssess his dsigns .
oh , antoine , have you forgottn ?
another charltn with an idea to peddle .
monsiur .
i have invented a device which projects an mage of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device renders the substance of fire visible .
have yu collcted it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monseur 
no , no .
if you will you excus me .
i am xtremely busy today .
thank yo .
so that is all ?
the king s scientfic despot has decreed that yor inventon des not conform to the version of the truth as lad down by th academy .
lavoisir .
he talks about facts , h worships the truth .
listen to me , my friend .
they are all the sam , the royal acadmies ..
thy insult th librty f the mnd .
they think they ar the sole arbters of genius .
they ar rtten to th core ..
do n't worry .
in my next pamphlet i will expos ths persecutor of yurs .
the crownng glory f this opus was their rmarkble use of static electricity to cuse oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back int water .
to the french revolutionaries f 1790 ,
he was denounced by a faild scientist turned radical journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the xact sameeight as the originl cty and the ir arund it befre .
a century lter , all of ntur hd been classifid into tw great dmains .
there ws enrgy ... the forces that animated bjcts ;
and ther ws mass .
the whl of 19th-century science restd on thse two mighty pillars .
the laws that governed one did not apply to the ther .
bt young , newly enrolled physics student albert einstein did n't like laws .
extremly well , herr einstein .
all the better for seeing y have escaped the physics labratory with your lfe .
that 's about all yu ver do .
t 's getting a little stuffy in her , fraulein maric .
would yo care to tak a walk wth me ?
perhaps yu 'd like me t tell you wht you have missd in lectres this week ?
he would purse his fascnations with just incredibl determintion .
w know from hs lettrs that insten , even from the age of 16 , was lterally obsessed with the nature f light .
everyone h cold spek to .
what ?
 beam of light ?
by what mthod do you propose to ride on this beam f light ?
the methd is not important .
let us just magine we two are young ...
ridicule you ?
i merly want you to help me to undrstand .
what would we see , do yu think ...
with light he would renvnt the univers and find  hdden pathway that would unite energy and mss .
it stands for celertas ..
long before the 19th century , scientsts had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what light actally was .
invisible lines that can emanate from lectricity in  wir , from a magnt or ... even from the sun .
for it s my contntion that lght itself is just one form of these vibratng lines of electrmagnetism .
maxwell and the ging faraday became close friends .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as tht mgnetic charge movs , it creates  littl piece f electricity .
elctricity .
elctricity and magntism are interwven , like a ... a neverendng brid .
so it is always pulsing frward .
michal .
670 millon miles per hour .
tht is the speed f light !
wll , that mans you were right all along .
maxwll hd proven faraday right .
we have lecturs in half an hour .
w ca n't .
come with me  we 'll read maxwell and think about the electromagntc theory f lght !
she 's very pretty .
they sd yo could never catch p to  beam of light .
even if you were traveling at 670 million mls an hour , yu wld still see light squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an hour .
yes 
you see how for her it s sttic ?
yes 
she and the wve re trveling at the same sped 
but relative to her , it just sts there .
s is light like that ?
commn sens wuld say that if you caght up to a light beam , there would b a wve of light just sitting ther .
mayb it wuld be shimmering , a bt of electricity and  bit of magnetism .
so if sh was traveling alongsde the light wve , it would n't be mving 
it would b static .
but maxwell says you ca n't have static lght .
myb mxwll s wrong .
the lght travels from my face to the mirror and i see my fc .
that does n't mak sense .
einsten ws abot t enter a surreal universe whre energy , mass and the speed of light intermingled n a wy no one hd ever suspcted .
long before the french revolution , scintists were not sre how t quntify motion .
d châtelet 's translatin s still the standard text n france today .
muse , my memory causes ...
for what offence the queen of heaven began
to persecute so brave , so jst  man 
only the other night ,
i fear , however , that my wit is nly a curiosity to others .
f only my mind were permtted pportunity 
my dearest mili .
se them bth and the world will fall at yur feet .
no ...
in one snse , sh is a woman tterly out of her true tim and place 
du chtelet married  gneral in th french army at age 19 and had three children .
sh rn a busy household , all the while pursuing her passion for scienc .
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mathematics 
she enthusiastically took lessons from one f the gretest mathemticans of the day ,
he was an expert n newton , and she was his eager young student ;
t sems thy had  brief affair .
a ferce critic of the king nd the catholic church ,
voltaire had been in prison twic and exiled to englnd  where h became enthralled by the das of newtn .
du châtelet hd hm in hr country hom .
he went to hs publisher t plead voltire s case to kep voltare ot of jail 
and it is also true that émilie du châtelet dd have several affirs of  fleting nature .
bravo !
sh creted an institution to rival tht of france 's ryl academes of sciences .
ah  monsieur ...
you re young .
i hope that son you wll judge me for my own merits , or lack f them , but do not look upon me as n appendage to this great genral or tht rnowned scholr .
 am in my own right a whle prson , responsible to myslf alone fr all that i am  all that i sy ... all that i do .
du châtelet learned from the brilliant men arond hr , but she qckly devlopd deas of her own 
much to the horror f her mentors , she even dared t suspect that there was  flaw in the great sir isac newton 's thnking .
nwton statd that th nergy of an objct  the force with whch it collided with another object , could very simply b accounted for by its mass times its velocity .
he proposed that mving objects had a kind of inner spirit .
if you say a garden s four squre , you mean that it might be built up by four slabs along one edge nd fur along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multplication , this building up by squares , is something you find n nature all th time .
it is a rturn to the old wys !
it is the occult !
so all libniz is asking is , whr des all this frce cm from 
you 're infuriating !
criticize ths , denounce that 
i discovered you !
s'gravsande in leiden hs been droppng lead balls into a pan of cly .
so , messieurs , cr for a lttle wger ?
lebniz sks us to square that sped .
if he is correct  the ball will travel nt two , but four tmes as fr .
messieurs 
i feel mr. newton s reputation dwindlng ever so slightly .
h , muprtuis !
well ... the ball travels f times further .
it 's the best way to express the energy of a moving object 
if you drive a car t 20 mles an hour , it taks a certain distance to stop if you slam on th brakes .
yu 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
relly ?
do b careful , madame .
do you think the academy is redy for such an opinion ?
quit , quite .
voltaire wrte that she was a great man whos only falt was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor is it yur hsband 's .
oh  milie .
émilie .
émile du chtelet knew that in the 18th century for a woman to become pregnant at the ag of 43 ws relly very dangerous , and all the while she was pregnant she hd terrible premonitins about what was going to happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a yong soldier that led to hr demise .
six days aftr giving birth to her fourth child , she sufferd an embolism and died 
einstein prsed light right through universty and beyond .
unfrtnately , he 'd upset so mny profssrs that n one would write hm a reference 
h accptd a low-payng job in the swiss patent office .
th young family struggld .
but  lsten ...
about your promotion .
i 'm srry .
all will be fn , you 'll see .
come on .
all will b fine .
there really is a very charming , but kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in around him , that 's fine , f they ca n't , it does n't bother him .
i 'll tll you what is truly mysterious :
the mathematics are fine  if a little unconventionl , but this only works fr big systems .
i disagree .
here we go ...
what wold happen if one pplied those formulae to electromgnetic radiation ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bit of physcs and apply t without proper regard to  completly different ara .
why not ?
i know you lik th grand linkges , the big theries  bt wuld n't things be better all round if you just got going in sme small area ?
spoken like a true bourges 
they had cornered the qestn of light from every pssible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it would tak light t reach them from clocks at different distnces ,
thnk yu .
wht einstein did was cmpletely turn the problem on its head .
tht light would alwys move away from you at 670 millin mls an hour , even if you , too , were travelng really fast .
his extraordinary nsight is that tim .. as you approach th speed f light , tim itself will slow down .
it 's a monumental shift in how w se the world .
you see , before thn peopl had assumed that tm was like a wristwatch on god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throghout the universe , no matter were you were .
that the tick , tck , tick of this wristwatch was actually th click , click  click
of electricity turnng into magnetism turning into lectrcity .
t strts with his publication of a paper on how to work out the tre size of atms .
two months later is th publiction of his paper on the nture of light ...
that 's what will earn him the nobel prze .
in it einstein sets ot his theory f light , time and space 
it was the thory of special relativity .
in einstein 's new world , the one tre constant was not time or even space , but light .
in ne last great 1905 paper , he would propose n evn deeper unity .
it has to go somewhre .
from or pont f view , the train actually gts heaver 
it 's an incredble idea .
even einstein is mazed by it .
i think i have found a connction btween nrgy and mass .
if i am right , then energy nd mass are not absolute .
thy can be convertd into one another .
einstin sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publicton .
in thre pges he simply stated that energy and mass wer connected by the square of the speed of light ...
e = mc2 .
the culmination of hs ten-year journey into light .
there s  deep unty between energy , matter and light .
yu multiply that by itself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science nds n silence .
the artcles are published to resounding .
i think the gds are lghing at me .
fr four years einstein swrd ach inqury dutifully  trying t explain his difficult  complex ideas to a confused physics commnity .
her are thse unverse-changing papers crcling arnd , nd the world is .. strugglng to cme to terms with them .
luckily it happned to be the most important living physcist .
he has sent his assistant .
fter fur yers of wating , he is appointed professor f physics t zurich university .
from there his carer is meteoric .
n 1919 he divorced milev and marrid hs cousin .
his fame led to numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vast resrvs of energy lcked deep nsid the atom .
but he hd n't bnked on the second world war and th genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germny .
28-yar-ld austrian lise meitner was pinfully shy .
despite her anxiety  th young doctor of physcs arrved in berlin determined t purse  career in the xciting new field of radioactivity .
grman universitis did not employ female graduates .
ott hahn .
yes  he suggsted tht i speak wth yu .
i think  could rally help with the physical analysis .
yes , ys ..
and the mathmatics .
studying radioactive atoms has become s mch a collaboration between emstry and physics these days .
yes , yes 
i 'll ask fischer for a labratory , then 
at this tim , not a lot was known about the atm 
but then ... in what are calld radoactive metals , things like radum and uranim ...
the nclus itself semed to be unstable , leaking ot energy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus turning into energy 
he ws given a labortory .
she was forcd to work n a wod shop .
i see you have n't set your hair on fire .
good day , hrr hahn .
good day .
yes , whre would we chemists be wthout the stedying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
yes , well , i have , um ... asked her to marry me , and she has accepted 
oh ..
oh , dr hahn , cngratulatons .
i 'm vry plsed fr you .
vry pleased .
lise meitner was warm-hearted by nture .
she had mny friends and sh may have wanted to have a closer relationshp with ott .
the 1920s nd '30s wre the golden ge f nuclar research .
metner nd hahn wer leading the race to see if even bigger nucle could be created by adding mr nutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty familr :
the nucleus  made up of protons ... and netrons .
now , the largest ncleus that we know is that of the uranium tom .
the jewess endngers our institute .
he ws honded out of grmany in 1933 .
she was able t stay becse she was astrian .
what is it ?
what s happened ?
i , um ..
we 're spaking tmorrow .
it 's lt .
we 'll fnish up .
hahn , who was known for his anti-nazi views , dd his best t protect hr , at least initially .
not nw , i 'm too busy .
we hav to protct her .
what can w do 
and she may soon be forbddn to leave germny 
lise ...
horlein demands that you leav 
you ca n't throw her ot .
horlein says yu shuld not come int the insttute nymr .
well , i have to write up the thorum irradatn tomorrow  s i have to come in .
you 've given up .
when t became cler tht metnr wuld be dismssd and probbly arrested , physcists all round europe wrt letters inviting her to confrences , giving her an excuse to lave grmany .
in july of 1938  a dutch colleagu traveled t berln nd illegally took lise back wth him on a train to holland .
she had lst everythng ..
her home , her position , her books , her salry , her pension , even her native lnguge .
she had been cut off from hr work just at th time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
n matter what prvatons she sufferd ,
ant ?
lise , how are yu , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help 
back in berlin , hhn ws getting strange results .
he found no evidnce to suggest that bombrding the ranium nucles with netrons had cased t t increase in size .
from far , she ws starting to suspect that smething vry different was happening in their experiment .
hhn and strassman are getting some strange results with the urnium wrk .
really ?
a couple of months ago , hahn told me that they were finding radum amongst the uranum products .
and now he wrts to m and tells me that it 's not radim , it 's barum .
bt that 's even smaller .
it s at least possible that barium is beng producd .
so hahn still neds yo to interprt the data .
well , i ca nt be there , can i ?
h has n't done what yu told him t .
it turns out tht a big nucleus like uranum is just like that .
now fr four yars , mitner and hahn and all other physicsts had thought that if you pump more neutrons into this nucleus , it 'll jst get bigger and heavir .
realzed this nuclus might just gt so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so bg that it has troubl staying togethr , then could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but somethng hs to spply tht energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 
200 mllion electron volts .
no  no , no ... yo 've split the atom .
of curse , in the labratory we 're talking bout tiny amounts of uranium and correspondngly tiny amounts of energy 
but the point is that the amont of energy rlased was relativly large nd that came from th mass of the uranium itself .
meitner and frisch published the discovery of wht they called nuclear fission
to great acclam .
but betrayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it was he and nt meitner who had discoverd nclear fission .
shall my scientific past als be taken from me 
and why is it happening ?
she 'd only brokn apart a handfl of atms , but that was enough .
in 1942 , n intense effort to build an atom bomb was begun 
all over america  secrt nstalltions sprang up under the cod name the manhattan project .
she rfused to hve anything to do with th atomc bomb .
but rbert frsch was different .
vast amounts of energy , in the frm of electromagnetic radiaton , were released from  few pnds of uranium and plutonum .
today , young physicists crry on einstein 's qust .
ever since ts brth ,
e = m.c2 hs been used to dlve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest question of all ..
in the first moments f creation , the niverse was this immensely dnse , immensely concentrted eruption of energy 
as it rushed apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atoms and it eventually formd th first stars .
it comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creates life itself .
eventually , a massiv star dies , the debris floats around , clusters togethr , gets pulled into the orbits of anther star nd becomes a planet .
building on the work of scntists through the ges , new generations are serching for answs .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of dscovry is smetmes pinfl , sometmes joyful .
it is as old as human curiosity tself and never , ever ends .

i do n't know the game and i hav n't any story .
but i can tell you what 's wrong with the prates that mcgovern person .
and all those nice , clean-cut young men and the wy he bullies them .
no wonder they make mstkes , nybody wold .

this is the nly hack in pittsburgh ?
yo know the lw , sonny .
you 're supposed to stay with your cab .
the bms do n't start until 1:30 .
his afternons were spent lke this .

well , i begn this way , quot :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evil-tongued orator of the baseball fild , is  surly , unbrd goat whose muth shold be wshd out with a strong detergent .
you 're not mad ?
i do household hints on th ladies ' page .
but i hav a few facts and figures abt your -
a fw sttistics that might be nterestng .
for instance , last sason , minelli had a btting avrage f 0.310 .
does n't it prov smething ?
i 'll have to speak to minelli .
cruckshank 's average s way down too , 93 points .
he 's th obituary edtor .

ther is nothing persnal in my feud with gffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final scre :
the pirates had a totl of thre hits , seven rrors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all by yourself .
did yu think that was second base ?
you 'r gon na catch a fly ball some of these dys nd knock yur front teeth 
you fellas may not believ this but sal nce pitched a two-hitter in a world seres .
but he 's still in there ptching .
one walk and fur hits on 10 pitched balls 
do n't yo think you 're old for this pastim ?

nice catch

you speak to angls ?
where they runnng ?
is n't t wonderful 
his latest peccdill , an admission to the press that he cnvrses with angls ... .
you cold say nything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he nw commands 
i wold like to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us your nam , please ?
 'm a groundskeeper at braves field , up n boston .
will you please tell us what you saw in braves field abot seven weeks ago ?
well  i see mr. mcgvern .
fter the game .
sitting on second base .
and what was he doing ?
he was tlking .
talking to whom 
there was n't anybody there 
and when he ws sittng on second base talking to somebody who ws n't ther , where ws he looking ?
up 
but one thing he said was , i have a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir .
thn he said again :
i sk you , ladies nd gentlemen and mr commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable man to hang arund second base at night and talk to ngls 
much as  hesitate to say this i think that mr mcgovern should tke a long  lng perhaps permanent rest .
wht 's eatng you ?
so we won a ball game , so hooray .
i tell you , it 's makng me jumpy 
every time i go after a ball , i 'm afrd i 'll trip ver smething .
for two cents  i 'd quit right nw .
shut p .
yo watch mcgovern lokng over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's tryng t be a right gy 
yur job s to gt ut and play bll .
kep your mouth shut , undrstand 
watch it  here h comes .
nd here 's a flash that was just hnded to m .
arnold p hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh tonight .
with the pennant hanging n tomrrw 's game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty togh spt 
th pirtes played mighty shaky ball out there this afternon .
with this hanging over their heads  ther 's no tellng what thy 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
they 're getting nervous .
not that i blame them  bt if it keps on lke this they 'r apt to come apart tomrrow .
i would nt worry much about it .
it s nly natural at a time like this .
how re yu doing ?
 'm in the pink 
i do n't sleep nights ,  do n't at .
oh , tht so 
yu know , i sed fur this afternoon 
who do i start tomorrow 
yeah .
well ,  would n't worry abot it .
even i could n't mak him lok good .
they wn na send him to the minors 
that wo n't mke any difference  he wo n't b around next season .
yeah .
at least  we used to be .
i was thre .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
ths way , cmmissioner .
gentlemen , i have an appintment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
ntl  hr all the evidence , i have nothing to sy 
.. tomorrow for the pennnt .
 'm ware f tht .
think ths is the prper time fr the investigation ?
my der lady  any time 's the proper time when the sitation wrrants it .
bsball is for the people who supprt it .
from new york , sir ?
and two  is it possible to talk to them ?
orgnally , man wrshipped the sun , the moon , stnes , trees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child will run to its parent so will a man turn fr comfort to a blief in angels .
and whn this belief takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professonl opinin ?
mr. commissioner .
ys ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustac danforth , trinty church .
rabbi allen hahn , tmple israel .
how do y do ?
fathr ohoulhn  chrch of our lady , queen of the angels .
gentlemen , just make yurselves comfortble .
mr. commissoner ?
well , what d you think ?
do you supps there might be angels ?
right t left .
to deny the existence of angls is t deny the word f the holy bible which is specific on the subjct .
from the ancient hebrew text , we have the words bnei elohim the sons of god .
thank you , rabbi .
t was n ngel who guided the children of srael to the promised land .
th angel of the lord encampeth rond about them tht fear him and dlivereth thm .
seeng as how there ar coveys of ngels flitting through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how  can get ut of saying  believe in thm .
 magin the commssioner does too .
oh  please , just leave me out of this 
mr. cmmissioner ?
is it likely one of your ngels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like gffy mcgovern ?
is t possibl that angels would aid and comfort such a man 
thnk yu  gntlemen 
if dr. blane would cr to see me n my office , i 'd be very happy ndeed .
i know i would .
howver --
mr. commissioner .
sster , will yu please gt her out of here ?
mr. mcgovern , what are you afraid of ?
ll right 
bridget whit , 8 years old .
st. gabril 's home for orphan girls .
dos n't everyone ?
n .
they were helping the pirates .
yu 're qute sure abot that ?
you wuld n't jst make up a stry , wold yo 
oh , n .
certainly , certainly , certanly .
no .
becuse mr. mcgovrn sid s .
of course .
any ngel would be prud to talk t a nice man lke mr. mcgovrn .
qiet .
quiet , plase .
what re yo talkng about ?
i will decide what s evidence here .
suppse i dd ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nthing definite .
 d nt know if the cort wll let me have her .
it 's touching .
come n , stp that .
stp that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think  in view of the fcts all things cnsidered this cas s dismissed .
hey , fellas , what 's with guffy ?

he was okay all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy thn i am .
hey  guffy .
lok , you heard what the fella said 
just stick to yor driving , will yo ?

yu ca n't walk out on me nw .
 need you .
do n't worry , yu 've been n your wn a lt the last ght weeks .
i d n't lik t b on my own .

sorry .
the cure for cancer has ben discovered .
the cure for virtually every form of chronic dsese was dscovered even earlier , purely by ccdent .
by one man .
a grman jew named dr. max gerson .
although his dscoveries were adhered to by hitler and the nazi party ,
dr. gerson 's family paid the ultimat prce .
dr. gerson 's sevn siblings perishd in the hlocaust 
dr. gerson 's unprecedented gift of healing the hopless lives on .
nrratd by dr. .f .
these scenes bfor your eyes would b incomprehensible 100 yers ago 
warm air mves north and airborne transport of dioxins eventually reaches the once pristine arctic .
arctic peoples are showing major health prblms , from biaccumulation of dioxins .
and from there , the poisons travel p th food chain to plar bars , seals and whales , and then to peple .
on thousndth f one millionth of a gram of dioxin can case harm to th body .
tres , the very living organisms that clean the air and prduce the oxygen we breathe , are slicd off at the ground with the most carelss abandon if there is  lmitelss supply .
at one point , it had been sid that a tree squirrel could jump from tree to tree following the hardwd with coniferous forest belts from the east cost to the west coast .
they do not develop special fnctions .
as a boy in germany , in the lat 1800 's 
dy by day  he ganed insight n th relatinships betwen plnts and the ntrents they gained from the soil .
under  micrscope , actvely cells known as chloroplasts , busily ndertake the process of mnufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculous process of photosynthesis bgins .
these live cells and enzyms n vegetation ar the nucleus of what w need to ingst to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy one .
max gerson suffered from svr and repeated migraine headaches , leaving him essentially unble to functn for dys .
after three years of exprimenting ,
not only had th migraine been relieved  but a skin tuberculosis also disappeared .
446 of the 450 patients recvered .
dr. grson and his wfe gretchn had three daghters :
joanna , gertrude and the youngest  chrlotte .
of all the chldren , chrlott took a special interest in her father 's wrk .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame hd sprad throughout europe .
when dr. schweitzr was 75 years old  h came to dr. gerson with diabtes and was lso curd .
lghting up the switchboards at abc non-stop .
out of control !
nblievable !
and the pepper nely anticancr bill of 1946 , documnt no .
now mrred , she hd a son , hward , and a daughter , peggy .
charltt encouraged later her father to publish his first bok in 1958 :
at the time of hs death , in 1959 ,
the files have been prserved by his daughter charlotte who is now in her eighties .
charlotte carries n the work of her father thrugh the stablishment of the
we hve some letters here from albert schweitzer ... nd they hd  vry activ correspondence , my father , dr. gerson nd albert schwetzr  nd his family were patients .
and he also expressed , in ths letter  he expressed his admiraton of the specific cancer resarch that dr. gerson did .
of course , all the letters are in german and i 'm trying to translate som .
as well s th remarkable results that he saw , not only with cancer patients , but with his wfe , who hd tberclosis , and thir daghtr , who had a very undecipherable skin disas .
laws in virtually all the united states prohbit any ther tretmnt fr cancer other than rdiatin , chemtherapy and surgery .
n this partcular day , tw medical doctors from czechoslovakia , conslt wth nita wilson , who is executive director , about the possbilities of opening a hospital in czchoslovaka .

not a day goes by tht we do n't hear smething from a patnt r a physician , r  grup of pople prhaps intrested in starting a clinic or a support group .
in hgh school i was in one of those dieters anorxc and bulimic .. bulmi whn it was nt rally written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fght for that .
 year later , tht same tumor , th on that they thought could be a metastass , was gone .
when i ws 16 years old , my face hit the windsheld and i had ver 150 sttches in my face .
after being on the therpy for bout a year ,  noticed ne day whn i was rubbng my nose , that  could feel the bone in the rght side of my nose for the first time 
anothr staff member , susan brant  charlott gerson 's nece , at ne time , was diagnosed with an inperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 years ago , and so ,
i cn sit here nd say that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prstte cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the srum gram and the biopsy .
they dtermined i hd three sctins of cancer , malignant cancer in the prostt and they wantd to take the prostate out the next dy .
i talked with gersn institute and with the hospital in mexco , and tlkd with the doctors nd the patents .
after three months ,  found tht i was loosng weght readily  lost 27 punds , and after 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me was the end of the tretment .
i was cured , the doctor thought  was grat , he said i had a better psa thn he did .

when juice is drnk , it cn entr the blodstream almost as fast as alcohol .
this juicr was originlly designed in the 1930 's by a scientific researcher , namd dr. norman walkr .
an enormous amount of ntrition can b captured in a glass of juice in minutes and in a few more minutes  be flowing wthin the veins of the patient .
s you can see , n ntire dy wth the juices s quivlent to an enrmous amont of food , which weights in a little over 20 pounds  day .
but jst eatng different is not nough t heal a srously ill patient .
ntrition is nly hlf of the equation .
resolving the accumulatd toxicity in th body is the second half .
it is slw , relentless .
realzing this , charlotte gerson included a chpter abot t in  book bout the gerson therapy , tht undrlnes  in lyman 's terms , the prncipls of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily txic ingestion or precursr hit be when yu get in your atomobile prior of even strting the engine , you hav already ingested dixins

suppose yu contine your journey and stop at  motl for the evening .
once inside , from the powr switch activating lctromgnetic fields  to the microwave radiation leaking from the oven , s it prepares your plstic wrapped , heavily slted and preserved nutritionless instant dinner , t the carcinogenic chemicls in th soap on th bathtub brim .
you are inundated with hts .

but what does that mean ?
th tilt paper will also smear chmicals from slvents to dyes into yor bloodstream .

even the film to make this movie uses extremely poisnous chemicals in its manufactur and processing .
as ridiculous as this scenaro may sound , it is on more hit for your body to fight .
the god news is that most of these toxins can b remved with strict adherence to th gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comes into play .
unless it gets some help .
when cffe enemas are utilized in conjuction wth juic drinking it is dtoxfication at ts finst .
three tablespoons of dip ground coffee are dropped in there .
after a few minutes the brner is turned down .
once the cffee s dne , it is strained into a mesuring cup .
dditional wter may b added to make up for wter lst in stem n making the coffee .
once the coffee cools t bdy temperature it is poured into the enema bcket

hundreds of holistic physcins , n the u.s. and around the world , have been traned by chrlotte in the gerson institute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united sttes to treat nd cure a diseased patient in a hospital with gerson therapy .
bcause charlotte resdes in southern california , t 's easy to her fr driv rgularly to advse and encourge the endless nmbers f patients that arrive at the hospital in tjuana , mexico .
under the care of a stff of physicians and nutritionists , most patients who came n with inoperable cancers and with no hpe of recovery , leave within 1 t 4 weeks to contne the treatment at home .
after only 2 weeks on the therapy 
 find after the pathologist report , that i 'm fre from cancer now .
do you have chldren ?
it has saved my lfe .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaska  whre  am from and i was dignosed with a .
you wre dignosd how , did you had a biopsy ?
he ordered the biopsy and the pathology came bck with  carcinoma .
nd yo had ascites swlling ?
i hd 10 punds of ascites swlling in my abdomen .

now sveral doctors have told me tht .
how much ?

my dad had told me about th gerson therapy .
my daddy told me about ths , and during the research , i found out that the best way to cre yorself is to do it the healthy way .
not put mor poisons into your body that would kill you 
and that what chemo dd .. it klls your body  the good cells and the bad cells .
when  go down t ucla , i too did all my blood work and my mris to check , to see if verything was ok ,
i jst ca n't belive you 're one of my cancer patients.
that jst rally mde me fl good evry tm i went in there .
i did not lok like a normal cancer patent .
to me , i have chrltt and the gerson thrapy to thnk for that , because .
i trly , truly n my heart , just d n't think i 'd b here .
when  was dagnosed with cancer ,
 knew of three other ladis that had the same cancer i had .
i was 12 years old whn my mom was diagnosed with cancer .
she would wake me up lik 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'm steve , debbie 's husbnd .
when i first cam int debbi s life , it was sveral years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ...
there s for charlotte the reluctance t get emotionally attached to any single case , since there have been thosands , bt ccasionally , a phone cll would lve her effervscnt wth cheer .
as in the cas recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seen nly in children .
it was discovered that the lung was too ridden wth cancr .
and mor horrifying stll was the revelation that the cancer hd made it all the way to the right chambr of her hart .
the srgeon than opened her sternum and started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from there , he moved to her heart and an open-hrt surgery remved th tmor from the right heart chamber .
again and again , with a vengence .
now  even her liver was invdd by cancer .
) the doctr said  ( ?
) children told s that she s not gon na be able to ahm ... the cancr s back nd she is not gon na make it .
we went back home and thn , i think it was jnury or something , we wr down , at the gerson , and ahm .. and w were doing the diet thre for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
) i hd come down there sick myself .. ?
i had regular disinfections all th time .
fter having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and we 've been doing the tretment for two yars , about .
from that point on , hope returned  and life began t change for the ntire family .
even the dog was happy agan .
but the poisons re nw being excreted and hr body is building itslf back up with powerful nzymes and the ntrnt forces .
but whre stephanie 's orthodox medical doctrs hd only given her 6 months to live two years ago , she has nw astounded them , and of corse , confunded them .
i feel very healthy , and stronger and much bettr than i did .
charlotte observed tht thy run around playng and enjying lfe , as though the scourge of cancer had nevr visted this resilient child .
thr are also non-toxic , non-pharmacetical supplements called biologicals , that are utilized in  greater or lessr measur , depending upon the ptient 's condition .
one of the mst important of these s a natural potassium , mix of potassium glucnate , actate , phosphate in equal amounts , tht dr. gersn put together fter doing nearly 300 experiments .
this is extremely benfical to restoring the potassium in the body s clls systems that was lost in most people on relenting s of inorganic sodium , such as found in table salt and hidden wthin everything , frm processed fods to toothpste .
table salt s a poison .
the se of inorganc sodium causes dsplacement of potassum found naturally in human cells , leaving them vulnerable t ttack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's potassium supplemnt s dssolved in a quarter of distiled water and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a plesur t show you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , essentially the leftovers , are used for fertilizer nd animal food .
a tre mircl oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did in the past , really understod the vlue of flax oil .
that ws n't anything that ...
actually , thy educated us mor than we culd even educate them on the vlue and the benfits of how flax oil really helped the mdalities .
the use of these natural , holistic supplements on the gerson therapy s prt f customization to the specfic degenrative cnditins f the patient .
none in and of thmselves can , for example , cur a cancer , bt they can sometmes fortfy gerson 's therapies effectvenss .
whn it comes to helping the body recovr , whether from a common cold or cncer , tody , over half the medical visits in the .s. and canada are to alterntive therapies , despte the efficacy .
and in the .s especially , t is estimated that or understandng and accptance of hlistic medicine is still 75 years behind th rest of the world 
medically  we trail many third world countries 
it is imperativ that patints have access to such food choices .
the organc food markt has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , manly s the rsult of th economic law of supply and demand 
mss-prodced commercially grown fruits and vegtbles produced with chemicals nd sprays re fertilized with only three minerals :
but the plnt , like the human body , really needs ovr 50 more .
as a consquence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertlzation procss of commercially gown crops  the plnts wre sick and must be kept on life support with more toxic chemcals until market .
this process is now repeated n the consumer , in smplified terms .
 know that in the past people hd different prospectives of what was truly organic , and we would hav some growers come in and say well , their grows are orgnc but basically just by virtue of neglect .
s that st forth a set of rles and reglations such tht anybody wh did want to become rganic would truly be in the same playing feld nd wold have to abde by the same sets of rules .
we hav found that the attributes of truly doing a certified organic is benfcil not only fr the people , bt also for th ground , etc .
so , that s somethng that we truly lok forward to expand upn and to provide for the locl community , and als for the people throughout the united states and world wide .
by popular dmand , undoubtedly based largely n the dscovry of the incomprable bttr flavor of fresh organic produce , organic frmers frequently strt poplar local farm stnds with delicious samples of their produce for their neghbors benfit , before shipping their product t an ever incresing wrld market .
charlotte gersn fllows the gerson therapy herself as a life style of prevnton .
she as no one as millions of othrs hav dscovred that th principles of the gerson therapy ris the br for gttng the mst f life .
nw , in her eighties 
using the gerson therpy  ne ned never again worry by dieting to loose or gan weight .
obsity is almost always nothng but hunger .
and people are very hungry because , evn thugh they are full , they are not truly nourshed 
it has been sad , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , whre the dead food lies in state 
for many , it also grants them  higher vbration or spirital consciosness , that spns vry fith and walk of life .
day-to-day life xperiences are fraght with perplxities that cn be addressed to a negative or  postiv way .
for example , cocane nd heroine addicts destroy their cravings for drugs in usally less than 72 hours n the therapy 
the only obstacle that arrests r commences to subtract ths books is long term lack of nutrints and environmental toxicity 
when th brain dtoxifes , calm and clarity return , mental nd emotional fog lift .
the body is a miraculous n its design and flexibility .
these chemcals re found n vrtually all municipl drinking water and inflicts svere damage in the body 's endcrin system , particlarly the thyroid gland .
but there are other semi hidden dngers in ingestin of daily poisons that cn be avoided .
well , the dental amalgam s nw coming more and more into the floor  vn while dentists used to dispute it .
but in your mouth it s safe 
and t 's been clarly demonstrated that lot of children have seizures nd all kinds of mental dsturbances from the dentl malgam .
the danger of the illegal street drugs n public and private schools is heavily publczed .
the trouble with ritlin is sometimes ... first of all , it 's never ben tested on children under 6 
and they 're givng t now to children in preschol nd kindergarden .
and the mrican services like the army , nvy and the ar force , will not accept any prson int th service who is ever ben on ritalin , because they 're ncontrollble .
during sleep , not only is the nrvous systm replenishd like a strage battery being charged , but the body rids itself of poisns , in a way that nly slep can accomplish .
and with th bombardment in daily life of hits to thr systems in modrn sciety , repeated lack of it cn hinder nd sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain development .
the develping brain of a child at this time in human histry  must clear a number of hurdles in a bid for gnetic normalcy .
one of the mre publicizd vulnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially lad from older homs , where leaded pant was used pirated in th 1970 's 
remdling and sanding of older homes produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
thes irbrne hevy metals , along with nmerus other chemicals in the fod and water , are now unntentionally passed n to the next generatin .
but the removal , known as chelatin , of such toxins  even hvy mtals , such as lad  is possible with close adhrence to the gerson thrapy .
even the body tself can overproduce a substance that bcoms poison in excess , in stressful situations , if the liver is unhalthy and nable to netralze it .
it 's called adrenline .
in an occupatin that demands split second lfe or dath dcisions , the adrenalin flws in excess , and if not neutralized , can poison the body into illness .
the potncy of this substance is profond .
when a drp of adrnaline is secreted by the adrenal glands , which are lcted on little cps on top of ach kidney , it enters the bloodstrm and is diluted instantly to betwen 1 to 2 bllionth f its riginal strength .
the purpse of drenalin secretion is t accelerate th fighter fight response and protct neself in threatening situatins .
the largest gland of the bdy , the lver , when healthy , is able to neutralize th secretions .
many peopl have livr disease and do n't even know it .
for the detction of  liver problem via illness rquires the liver t drop below 30 % of its full wrking capacity before symptoms becme detectble .
lke mny othrs who do not have degenerative dsese ,
because many of the animals ar crnivrs , in the wldlife center , their health and reproduct ability must be maintained at highest levels .
evntually , they were unable t reproduce successfully .
clearly , all carnvore animals sch as thes were designed to hunt and kill and survive n prey composed f flesh .
ther teeth , stomch cids and short dgestive tract bear this out .
but th dissimlarities btween wild meat aters and humans do not end there .
invaribly , some of them does n't pass through at all , bt instead get snagged inside tiny pockets in the coln putrefying not for hours , but days  mnths and even years .
the pancreas was never designd t brek down animal prtein r meat .
when meat must be digestd , the pancreas is divrted frm its important prtective purpse .
if we nly eliminated the animal products from our diet , the odds f getting cncer , dibetes or heart disease and the pandora 's box of woes tht go long wth ll this , will lmst vanish .
but the standard american diet  referred t as sd for shrt , has totally flipped that scintifically verifiable statistic upside down .
looking undr a microscop , it is easy to see red blod cells floating round fre .
surprisngly , some foods , like legumes , soybeans and soy products are either deficient in nutrnts  or cause health dgnertion  by blcking absorptn of nutrients 
ostepoross in th u.s is very widespread 
it s caused by milk drinkng .
and the doctors gve t for supposedly curng osteporosis , becaus supposedly milk has clcium .
th bdy has t maintain homeostsis , t has to maintain a very exact level of alkalnity vrsus acidity .
whre s it going to take calcum ?
it is not bsorbbl from milk , becaus in the mlk with pasturzation and all , the enzyms are missing .
and the body ca n't use it .
so , n the cntrary  tht adds to th problem .
i had canceled my helth insuranc when i was 34 years old .
and the reason was not that i ws very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not interested in a kind of hosptal or medical treatment that might be covered by insuranc because it 's toxic , it s drugs , t 's chemicals , and i have , you know ,
nd over th years , i 've saved an verage of us $ 2000 a yar .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 
but that is not th only benefit .
even now , his applicaton of ths thrapy is unrelenting .

ironically , h developd cancr after pat had recovered on th gerson thrapy .
n 1986  i was diagnosd with pancres cancer , which is spread to my liver , gallbladder and splen .
my husband just would n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 days , the bleeding had stopped , the pan had stoppd , i came home , get the therapy for 2 years ...
after three months , my doctors here wondered why i was still living .
he asked me if i would hav a ct scan , whch i dd .
he said i do n't know what you 'r doing  we d n't want to knw what yu 're doing , just keep doing it .
i hope they apprciate me .
t the time i was fghtng the pancreas cancr , we gt a call from michal landon , you may rmember him , h was on little huse on the prairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
he would n't go down to mexco , but he started the gerson thrapy at home with his family .
he wnt on to the tnight show and he loked wnderful  nd he sd h felt wonderful 
he phoned us fter he did this treatment
and sid he knew that ws the end , that he should have stayed with the gerson .
and thre is no doubt in my mind that he wold b alive tday f he had stayed with the grson .
it s  medieval castle .

this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for the gvernemnt but mostly 
mostly for a ...  hollywood studo .
this what at the time of the 'good neighbor ' policy .. and it was my task to mak a large techncal documntry on the subjct of the carnval .
samba orchestra 
vodoo ceremonies , particularly n shango which are prcticed ... up in the favelas , thos strange , native settlements on the . mountains , which are right in the midst of ri .
he came to my offc ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort f thing hppens not only in south american governments , but also in film stdios .
and the witch doctor assured me that this . ws deeply offensive and ..
and , i sd i was most sorry about it myself and .
i dd want to finsh the film and i did hope he understood 
and i said : well , i 'm awfully srry ...
crtinly not in the time ...
uh ... lredy agreed on .
left the doctor , n my office .
to finish , since so much effort hd gon into t and i was pleading my cse for some time .
praying that w would be abl to .
and , i came back to the office and found tht the doctor had gone ...
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wl .
this was the mark of the voodoo .
th first story , 'my frend bonit  , began shooting in mxico under the direction welles assciate , nrman fostr .
as prducer of 'it 's all tre '
at the same time he was preprng to produce an act in the thriller 'jurney nto far ' , but his plans were abot to change , drmatically .
and brazil 's dictator , gtúlio vargas , had nazi sympathizers in his government .
so , the state department appointed welles , specil ambassadr t brazil .
we , the people f these nited nations of merica , now stand togethr .
we ought to know each other better than w do .
it was more of a cltural interchang .
i was told that it ws my ptrotic duty .. t go and spend  milln dllars shooting .. th carnival in rio .
he had to get to rio n time to film the carnival .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent mbersons ' and 'journey int fear ' t the same tim on adjoining sndstages 
he did n't even have tim to chnge his costum .
filmng f bonto  , the first prt of the new latin amricn version of 'it s all tre ' , was temporarily sspended .
never to b resumed .
he finishd shooting both films in time to leave for rio , but it was a real cliffhanger 
i went to th projectin rom at about two in th morning , no , four in the morning  and then gone on the plane and off to rio 
ask m again .. in six months .
the lights failed t arrive , so h filmed carnival ' with nti-aircraft lghts borrowed from the brazilian army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival  was like trying to captre a hurrican .
people get tired , thy fall aslep , thy 're going to len against a house , that 's it .
as it turned out i became fascinted with samba .
what was interesting wer the samba clubs , and all of that which would hve orgnized nd told to popl , explained what it ws  socially and all the rest f that .
welles had dscovered what the tre subjct f his flm would be .
there s another sid f rio .
can yo her it ?
no , inded  if rio 's bckyard s n't exctly gala it 's even gayer thn rio 's frnt lwn .
it 's set to music , but the music 's all its own .
rich ...
dep ...
brzilan .
it throbs in th streets .
samba .
vargas hd demolished pra onze t build  new bolevrd .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicolr cameras to commemrat th carnival f the streets nw passing into history .
welles joined the people in ther protest 
t th same tim he began filming the story of another protest which would be the third story of 'it 's all tru  .
a cry of outrage from th poorest of the pr that electrified all of brazil .
h first read abot it in time magazine .
four poor fishermen risked their lvs sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to ri to demand that brazil 's president give their peopl , the jangaderos , the same socal benefits enjoyed by other brazilan workers .
they sailed frm fortaleza in the northeast , an ncredible 1650 mils , withot the aid of a compass , stopping along the way t find fod nd water .
jacar was the leder of the expedition but jerônimo , a man who could neither read nor write , was the pilot .
their jngada ws carried in triumph thrugh th streets 
three mnths had passed since their voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangadros wr still nationl heroes .
with bonit ' and 'carnival ' the jangederos story would complet his ltin america trilogy ... bt jacaré s politcl actvities had made him  cause f concern for the vargas governement .
i think that th vrgas govrnement bgan to recognize the fact that this was not going to be  film that wold bring tourists to brazil .
 rmember th night we tried to photograph one of the tenement dstricts in the favelas
thgs surrunded us and after a sege of beer bottles , mpties of corse , stones , brcks , nd i hat to think what lse ..
w retreated to a more photogenic dstrict .
nd , it occurs to me that since man and the world hav to live with one another and get along somehow ...
and they see a lot of pople , black people , and the rection is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and down .
they did n't even hear the smb music bcause t had nt ben synched up .
and all i kept gtting were thes terrble signals about this awful move  had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out f the magnifcent ambersons ' nd gave t a happy ending .
it might have been welles ' gratest flm .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... the picture itself dstroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remmber it was a sunny , beatiful dy ... nd t ws  nightmar .
the hrbor was fll of salboats , putting up sail , getting ready to reenact the jangaderos . triumphant ntry nto rio harbor .
and thn  the impossible hppned .
a wave of ...
we were devastated 
h must have made the decision at that point that h would make this flm no matter what 
 'm sure .. was haunted ... by the felng .. that the pictur dd have a curs on t .
a vce prsdnt was snt from hollywood to shut the pictre down  and send evrybdy home .
when we were recalled frm brazil there ws till some mney left fr shooting .
not mch .
i tok that and went up with dck wilson and a cmeraman ... and we made the 'jangadero ' dcmentary .
nd we were ther two months with the jngaderos  following thir voyage nd all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not gt ... what they .. went for .
it kept them pr  n matter how hrd they worked .
it was to ... remind him of his promises .
welles dvsed a little lov stry .
to get extrme low angles , he wold put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep n the sand .
he drew mving performances from pple who hd never sen a camra before .
welles and hs team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to ctch a wartime flight to the states .
once bck , he learned that rko was not ging t let him finish 'it 's all true ' 
so , i was fired from rk .
and ... they ... made  great publicity of point f the fact that i had gone to south americ without a script and thrown all this money awy .
that ..
 never recovered from that . from that attack .
h hired himself t for the first time as a mvie star to option the footage from rko .

lewis dixon .
nobody 's going to believe ths .
believe what ?
that primitve apes can talk .
primitive ?
uh .. well , i men that in r , um ... primitiv , um  civilization , apes just do n't talk .
may  say somthing ... personal ?
god afternoon  gentlemen .
i 'm aware that what i hve to tell you may conceivably creat
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was one of two that have been missng in space for over 2 years nw .
have thy identified the bodies , mr. president 
zoo ?
what wuld astronauts b doing in a zoo , mr. presidnt ?
rporters :
general !
no comment 
reporters :
i hve n't the time now .
a lttle later , plase .
reprter :
later .
nd if the questons become less simpl ?
and i am the nmal psychiatrist who has been n charge of thes 2 pes since they cme to the los angeles zoo 
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zologist , i know and respct your wrk  bt f yo think you 're ging to turn a presdential inqiry into a ventriloquist 's act , i have to inform you --
and  have to nform you , sir , that thes tw pes hav acquird the pwer ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i repeat that they have the powr ofspech 
well , may we be told which s the female of th species ?
hve yo a nme ?
certainly she can artclat , which , in itself , is extraordnary !
what is your name ?
zi-ra !
mchanical mimicry .
uniqe in an ape vocally , without a doubt , but , uh  does the other one talk 
mr. chairman .
w ll take that p latr , your eminence .
cornelus , do you and yor lawflly wedded spose spek any languag other than english ?
what is englsh ?
i spak the language tught to me by my father and mother , who were taught by thir
it has been the language ofour ancestors for nearly 2,000 years .
s to its origins  who can be sure ?
nonsense !
and the orangutns are a bnch ofblinkered , psudoscintific gees !
i 've examined thusands f them .
nd until now , i 've nly discovered 2 wh could tlk in my lif .
god knows who tght them .
whre we come from , apes talk .
humans are dumb .
i 'm not sure 
when th spacecraft first lnded on our seabord , it was dr. milo wh salvaged it 
he studd it and halfundrstod it .
hlf 
enogh for dr. milo t b murdered n yor zoo 
enough for my wife and  to be her now .
from where , cornlius ?
of curse the female knws !
that dos n't make any sense .
cornelius , you spok ofwar .
war betwen whm ?
chimpnzees are pacifsts 
in a spaceship .
gentlemn , d you have --
no comment .
no comment .
as head of this commission , it wll be or duty to sit through the facts of this bizrre affair nd pass our conclusions onto the presdent of the united states for implementatn .
what a load fhgger mogger .
dr. hasslein .
no cmment , please .
no commnt .
no , gentlemen , no comment .. yet .
doctor .
you wer marvelos .
thy loved you .
but only to lews and stevie .
oh , zir .
well  you see .. we did know colonel taylr .
i mean , as a scentist , i sympathize , but i agree that that 's  revelaton the masss would not take kndly to .
 thnk y dd the right thing in denying knwledge of colonel taylr .
what ?
they would have askd ifh was still alive .
and is he ?
because frm th windows of the spaceshp ... we saw the earth ... destroyed .
 repeat , talked to the prsdential commissin of lnqiry .
dr hasslein  as i recll  whn you asked th male pe wher he was from  th female repled , from your future .
would you believe that ?
i think it is the nly explanation .
but still something is missing - nd that somethng s still his real self pantng th scond picture .
so he regresses furthr and pints a third 
he would perceive , mr. bnds , tht time is like a freeway with n infinit number oflanes , all leding from the past into the future , however , nt unto the same future .
thnk you very much , dr hasslein .
it 's certainly the most incredibl stry this rporter has ever coverd .
thy will , however , b taken from the zoo infirmry to a hotel , and thy will be given an xtendd tour f th city .
this is bll bonds rporting for yewitness news .
god night .
your lggage  ma'am 
address , plase .
the zoo .
mdam zira , i represent frand feather , a pet magzine .
madam zira , what is your favorite fruit ?
ha h ha 
and latr , she 'll accompany dr. hsslein t the musem of ntral history 
now , for a look at the wather .
sunny clifrnia will not b exactly that tomorrow .
the downtwn -
tired ?
how is that ?
we have heads as wll as hands .
i call upon men to let s use them !
beastly .
nd dimas which means body frame .
its scientific name is a compund of the grek kampt , which means flexible or bent 
ts generic nm  therefor , is flexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnnt .
n , i insst 
now , is there anything i can get yo , zira ?
wll , i have a strange craving .
grpe juice plus ?
lewis sad only  sip .
especially in cass ofprgnncy , you know .
oh , since wll before the wr .
it was n't our wr .
it was the gorills ' wr 
we stayed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
when we were in space , we saw brght , whit , blnding light .
then there was a tornado in the sky .
i fel magnifcently sleepy .
th date meter on the spceship .
and before -- befre the white light and the torndo ?
bfore the white light and the tornado ?
zira : 39 .. 50 .. something .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr presdent , that one day , tlking apes will dominate this earth and eventually destroy it by 3950 something .
and accrding to the nasa experts , who are still subjecting the spceship to microscopc scrutny , th precise year ofwht you merely inferred to be earth 's destruction is recorded on the flight synthesizer s 3955 a.d. , presumably .
alter what you believ to be the corse of the ftur by slughtring 2 innocnts 
or rther 3 , now that one of them is pregnant 
mr. president , herod lacked our facilitis .
he also becme very unppular , historically npopulr .
nd w do n't want that to hppn  do we ?
i am saying that our 2 vstors seem to be charming  peaceful people -- r rathr creaturs -- and that the vters love them .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the world  mr. president ?
well , not at th next electon , no .
wll  are n't you 
by their own testimony we know tht apes ne day wll cquire the powr of intellignt speech .
by zir 's testimony  we knw that she is pregnant with child .
by my own testimny we know that it 's genetically possible fr ths child -- provided , of course , always tht we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a talking ap by a dumb on in a present-dayjngle or  prsent-day zoo .
yes , mr. presdent , i do 
i do n't know .
which futur hs god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy r his instrment ?
n assassin would say the lattr .
well , mr. presidnt , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because he was evil .
w have no proof , hasslein , that these apes are vil .
mr. presidnt , there re very strong indcatons .
r y suggestng that they were improprly interrogated 
lt s say unprofessinally .
tell that to th commisson .
i 'll abide by their findings 
having convend in secret sessn at the request of the president , th commission makes the following interim recommendations --
the public should b informed
tht the apes , after their arduous spac voyag 
nd the fatigue rising from ts intended publicty ,
thre s justifiable cause for suspecting
to the installatin known as camp 1 1 .
when we were in space , w saw bright , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw th rim of the earth mlt .
i wthheld nothing 
nobody asked me .
but ifsmebody hd asked ...
only the gorillas and the orangutans .
what 's the difference ?
you re all monkeys .
plas do not us the word mnkey .
it is ffensive to us .
man dstroys man .
all we want to find out is how aps rose .
and cats .
of corse  fr man , this ws intolerable .
so humans tok primitve apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
thy became lert to the concept ofslvery , and , as ther numbers grw , to slavery 's ntidte  which , of course , is unity .
thy learned the rt of corporate and mltant action .
he articulted .
he spoke  word which hd been spken to hm ver tme without number by hmans .
no .
so that 's how it all started .
cornelius :
whre we come from , apes talk 
you recognize your husband 's words to the commission ?
ys .
so humans were dumb .
zira 
zira :
i ve examined --
i ca n't remember .
complet the word !
call for dr. dixon , please .
p.a .

sodium pentothal 
12 gram l.v .
yo have th commission 's authority 
and that f th president .

whs anatomies did yo compare ?
apes and hmns 
ye -- ys ... when they died a natural death .
available ?
gorillas hnted them for sport in nets and wth guns .
nss  nervous systems , the various reflexes .
of the living 
yo ca n't mke a dead man 's kne jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reaction t a lobtomy 
you were advanced enough to perform expermentl bran srgery on living humans ?
of curse not 
when you lft , ws colonel taylor alive ?
we loved taylor 
w did all we could t help him -
cornlius nd i .
she needs a nap .
we must gt this to th commission .
if yo 'll be seated  we 'll get down to bsness .
by either ape towards the human race as it is presently constitutd in this year , 1 973 
the male 's attitude is that
of a deeply interested academician
wth the tru objectivity of a good historian 
the femle 's case is different ,
will hav become dumb brtes
with the intellignce of anmals 
it 's been noted tht what apes will d t hmns
to dr. hasslein 's convictin tht thse apes ' progeny
this is a risk we dare not ignore .
therefre ...
the commission unanimously recommends
tht the birth of the femal 's nborn child

do n't see how yu can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective business all at the same tme .
and  50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advntag of me .
it is n't going to be asy smoking old ned out .
well , i hope you do n't think i 'm going to keep you in whiskey .

that 's the way he bsts yo at cards 
i go .
mr. rt i have a wrt here says you re to stp eatng chen lee 's crnmeal forthwth .
se ?
that was yor job in th first place .
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , baby sister .
a rat ctcher 's too tough on the rats .
give them rats a fair show , they say .
well , what kind of  fair shw did they gve old man potter ?
you scared f the dark ?
well , f  had a big horse pistol lke tht ,
i 'm not scared of no bogerman 
cream 
i 've been waiting to hav some private words with you .
 find a sweet distractin , as i suppose most men do .
i saw your mother yestrday .
what businss did you have wth her ?
it 's a likeness of tom chaney 
 m looking for him and  her you 're loking for him , too .
i only take ne step at a time .
 've ben on his trail the best part of four months nw .
i m a sergeant in the texas rangers 
chelmsfrd r chaney as yu call him , he shot and killed the sentor 's bird dog .
bibbs threatened to whip him , and chaney sht the old gntleman while he was sitting in a porch swing .
well , yu need not wrry but chaney anymr .
the sheriff nformd me tht you wer looking for a man to go fter chaney in th ndian territry .
i 've alrady fnd one for the job .
his name is rster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the federl court  toughst one they hav 
you 'll hve to talk that ver with rooster cogburn .
it 's at lest  two-mn jb to take him lve .
we 're tking him to fort smith and hang .
well , more so to m .
now , would n't a hanging in texs serve yu just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pay for killing my father , not for some texas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you fiv r six good licks with my belt .
one wold be as unplesant as the other .
ly a hand on me and you 'll answer for it 
the children of txns are brought up to show a lttle more respct for their eldrs .
you ll psh tht sacy line to far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no regard for you , but i 'm sure you have enugh for yourself to g around .
they ar all for sale except those four scrubby ones .
the hirs of th lte frank ross .
i m matti ross 
i fear that is out of th qustion .
tht hardly concrns me .
your father bought four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and thr 's an end of t .
tom chany stol it whle it was in your care .
you have no case .
yu r impudent .
and he will mke money , and i wll make mony , and your lawyr will make money .
and you , mr .
licensed auctoneer , you will fot the bill .
lwyer daggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.a.v .
g. , yes .
all rght .
