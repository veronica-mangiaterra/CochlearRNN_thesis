it 's the best way to express te eergy of a movin obect .
if you drive a ca at 20 miles an ou , it takes a ertain distance to stop if you slam on the braes .
you 'e oi 60 ile a hour ...
oh .
realy ?
do be careful , madame .
do you thik he academy i ready for such an opinion ?
quie , quite .
olaire wrote hat she as a great ma wose only faut wa eing a woma .
i ' afraid that ...
nor is it your husband  .
oh , émiie 
émilie 
émilie u chteet knew that i the 18th century fo a woman o beome pegant at he age o 43 was real very dangeous , and al he while se was pregant she ad terrible peoniions aout wha was goin to hapen .
in the end , it a a affair wih a youg oldier tat led to er demise .
six das aer giving bit to he ourth child , e uffered an embolim and died .
einstein pusued ligh righ hroug unierit and beyond 
unortunately , he 'd upet so many pofessors that no oe would ite him a reerence .
he acepted a low-paying job in the wiss atent ofice .
the youn family suggled 
but , listen ...
aou your promotion .
i 'm sorry .
a will e fine , ou 'll see .
come on .
all will be ine .
there real i a vey caming , but kind of a se-entered strea to einsein .
if the ret of the world fits in aoun him , tha ' fine , if they ca ' , it oe n't boter him .
i 'l tel you ha is truly mysteious :
he athemaics are fine , if a itte unconventional , but is only wors for ig syes .
i diagee .
here we go .
what would happen i one aplied tose formulae to eleromaetic adiation ?
albert , ou ca 't just take one bit of physis ad aply it withou proe rear to a opeely differet area .
why not ?
i know you like he grad linkages  te big theories , but would n' things be ette all round if ou just go goig in soe smal area ?
spoke like a true bourgeoi .
hey had cornered the question of lig from every posibe anle .
as einstein and esso were uminatin on ow uch ime it woud take light to eac the om clocks at ifferent itances 
thak you .
what einstei did was completely tu the oblem on its hea .
hat light wou aways moe aay fro you at 670 million mile an hou , even if you  too , wee traveling really at 
hi extaodinary inight is that time .. a you approac the speed of light , time itself will slow down .
it ' a oumental shif in how e ee the ord .
you see , before ten eople ad asumed that time was like a wriwatch on go 's hand , that i eat at a teady rate hougout te universe  no matter were you wee .
hat he ick , ti , tic of this wistwach was actuall the clic , clik , cic
of electici uring io magnetism turning ino electriciy 
it starts with his publication of a paper on how to work out the true sie of atoms .
two monhs later is the puliation of his aer o e nature of light ...
tha 's what will ear him te nobel prize 
in i einsein sets out hi theor of ligh , time a spae .
it a the theor o seial relatiity .
in einstei 's ne orld , the one true constat was not time or eve space , but ligh 
i one last reat 1905 paper , he woul proose a even deeper uniy .
it has to go somewhere 
from our point o vie , the train atua gets heavie ;
it ' a icreible iea .
even einstei is amazed by i .
i hink i ave found a connecion beween enegy and mass .
i i am right  then ener and mass are o abolute 
hey can be converted ino oe another .
einstein ent his fifh grea 1905 paper o pulicatio 
in ree pages he imply state that eergy and mass wee conneced b he square of he speed of light .
e = m.c2 .
the culination of his ten-ear journey into light .
here i a dee unity between enegy , mater and ligh .
ou multipl that by itself and you et 90 uadrilion .
probably he ost miraculous yea in sciene ens in silece .
he aticles are published to reouing .
i hink the gos ae laughing a me .
for four eas einstein wered eac inquiry duiuly  trying to explain his diffiult , comlex ideas to a cofuse phyics comunity .
here are these universe-angig aers circlig aroud  ad he ol is . suglin to come to terms with them 
luckily it happened to be the o important living phsicit .
he has sen his assistan .
after our years of waiing , he is appoited rofesor of hysics at zuric university .
from there his career is meteoric .
i 1919 he divorced mileva ad married his cousin .
hi fame led o numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 became the oly ail of science .
it held out the promise of vast reserves o enegy locke deep inside te atom .
ut e had n't banked on the secod wor war a the geius of a jewish oman in hiler ' ermany .
28-year-od austrian lise meitner was aifull shy 
despite he aniety , the young docto of psics arrive in erlin determied o pusue a career i the eciing new fied o radioactivity .
eman uiversities did no employ emale gaduates .
oto ahn .
ye  he uggee that i speak ith you .
i hink i coud ealy he wit he phsica analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematis 
tudying radioacive atoms has become so uh a collaboation betwee emistry ad pysics these days .
yes , ye .
i 'll ask fische for a laboratory , hen .
at this time , ot a ot was known about te atom 
ut en ... in wat are alle radioactie metals  thing lie radium and uranium ...
the nuceus itself seemed to be unstable , leaking out eery an paricles .
the mass of a nuleu urnig into energy .
he was given a laboraoy .
she was foced to work in a woo shop 
i see you hae n' set you hair on ire .
ood day , herr hahn .
good da .
e , where wou we chemists be wihout te steadying hand of the hicis ?
oh ?
es , eith .
es , wel , i have , um .. asked her to marry me  and se as accepte 
oh ..
o , dr. hahn  orauations .
i 'm ery pleaed fo ou .
very pleased 
lise meier was warmhearte b nature .
se had a fiends an e may have wanted to have a close elationship ih otto .
the 1920s ad '30s were the olde ae o uclear researh .
eitner and han were leading the ae to see if een bigger nuclei could e created by addi moe neuton .
so .. the aom , petty amiliar :
the nucleus , mae up of roo ... and neutrons .
now , he larges nucleus that we know is tha of e uranium atom 
the jewess edangers our intitute .
he was hounded out of germany in 1933 
she wa able to stay because se a austrian .
ha is it ?
hat s hapeed 
i , um .
we re speaking omorrow .
it ' ae 
we 'll finish up .
hahn , wo wa nown or hi ai-nazi ie , did his best to proec her , a lea initial .
ot ow , i 'm too busy .
we have to proect er 
what an we do ?
and she ma soon be forbidden o leave germany .
lise ...
hoei demands hat you leave .
you ca n' hro he out .
olein sas you shoul not come into te institue anymore .
wel , i ave to write up the thorium irraiation toorow , so i have to ome i .
you ve give up .
we it beame clear that meitner oul be disisse and obably arrested , hysicists all aound europe wrote eters inviting her to conferences , giing her an excuse to leave germany .
in juy of 1938 , a ut colleague traveled to erin and illegall took lise ack ith him on a train to hollad .
she ha lost everytin .
he home , her osition  he boos , er saary , her ension  even her natie language .
e ad bee cut off from er wok ut a the ime wen she was eadi e fied and was on te rink of a ajo cientific iscovery .
no ater wa piations she suere ,
aunt 
ise , how are you  my dear ?
m , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getin sange result .
e found no evience to suest that bombardin the uranium nucleus with neuton had caused it to increase in size .
om afar , she as staring to supect tat someting very ifere wa appeing i their expeien .
hahn ad stasman are getting soe tange result ith te uranium work .
really ?
a couple of months ago  hahn old me tat he ere findin radiu amongt he uanium poducts .
and now e writes to me and tels e ha it 's not radium  it 's bariu .
but that ' eve smaller .
it is a leas possible that arium is being produce .
so a still needs you to iepre the ata .
ell , i ca n't e there , can i 
he as n't done wa ou old him o .
it turns ou that a big ucleus like uraium is us like that 
ow for fou years , meitner and ha and al other phiist had thouht ha if ou pup ore eutro into this nucleus , it 'll just ge bigge an heaie .
realize this nucleu miht just get so ig hat i would split in two .
if he ucleus is so big that it has toule taying together  then ou 't ut a litle , tiy jog from a neuton ..
how uch energy ?
but soething ha to supply hat eergy .
einsei 's e = m.c2 .
200 million eeton vos .
no , o , o ... ou 'e spi he atom 
of couse , in te laboratory we 're taking abou tiy amounts o uraium and corepondingy tiny amoun of energy .
but e poin is that he amout o energy released a reatiel arge and that ame fom the mas of he uanium iself .
einer an fisch ulished the discovey of ha tey called ulear fissio
to great aclaim 
ut betayal awaied the .
hahn mainaied it was he a no meitner who had disovered nulear fissio .
shall m cientific past also be taken rom me 
and why is it happenin ?
he d onl broen aart a handul of atos  bu ta was enough .
in 1942 , an intense effor to build an atom bomb was beun .
all over america , secret instalations sprang up une the code ame the manhattan project 
se refused o have anyhing o do ith the atomic bomb .
but robert rish was difeent .
vast aounts of energy , in he orm of electromageti raiatio , were eeased fro a few pouds of uraium and plutoniu .
today , young physiist carry o eintein ' quest .
ever since its birth 
e = m.c2 has bee use to dele ino the epth of time , to anwe the bigest question of all ..
in te firt moments of creatio , the uierse was this immensely dese  immensely conentrated eruption o energy .
as it rushed apart and expanded  hue aouns o eerg , o e ,
it became the paticles and atoms and it eventual forme he irst sars 
it comes out as eergy .
te oe proces actually ceates ife itelf .
eventually , a maive sta dies , te deis floas aroun , lusers togeter , ges ulled into the orbis of aothe star and becomes a plaet .
uilding on the work o scientist through the ages , ew generatios ae seaching fo asws 
as einstein hisel knew  the jourey of discovey is sometimes painful , soeies joyul .
