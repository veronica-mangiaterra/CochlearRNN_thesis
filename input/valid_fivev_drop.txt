plate glass in stors , utomobile windshields , bottles , clock faces , glass of every kind and descrpton began to brek and shtter n varius portions of our community .
as you see , thy formed a pattern , a sort of cone-shaped pattrn of dvastation , as though some unseen force had fanned out from one beginning point  t a place on th crner of maple and litchfeld .
nw , i may be wrong , professr , but is n't that th precise point on which i 'm standing at this very moment ?
but outside of making m feel god all ver , what would it get me ?
no , the pont is ,  'm not sore at you at all , prfessor

mr. hawk , yu do n't fr one minute think
i 'd go alng with a scheme like that , do you ?

medfield trails rutland by nine points .
with less than four minutes lft to play , th big question s can rtlnd stp medfld s brillant aerial attack ?

i 've never seen 'em use this kind of defense bfore 
down !
hut one !

now , remember , yu guys , the old lady with a twist on tw .
redy ?

and there goes the final gn as the gme ends and medfeld wins .

george  did ya se that ?
h , sht up !
well , the trial of professor ned brainard swng into ts thrd dy tody 
professr brainard continued to act as counsl in hs own bhalf 
he was quoted as saying he was confident in the de processs of law .
dspite the growing tide of testimony gainst him , as the prosecution kept a steady prade of wtnesses mving through the witness box , today , the prsecutin unlimbered ts big guns aginst the dfense .
profssor brainard , you sm proud of your jb s a teacher 
d you like it because you believe t makes you important ?
but i blieve the work i do is importnt .
would you car to tell us a little about it 
maybe plant  bug of discovery in ther minds , or ..
nd you think that 's importnt ?
ne of thse young peopl might discover something the entre wrld has been looking fr .
he might not  but i like to feel that i had  part in giving him a crack at it .
 see .
now , regardless of whethr you are found guilty or nt 
wold you continue as befre ?
would you rcklessly incite the young minds of your class again ?
i put the qstion to you gan , professor , and i ask you t mark well yur answer .
would you stll persist in these dangerous nd mlicious flles ?
mr .
fear of bmbs , bugs , smog , surpluss , fallout  falling hir  even far f mr. hwk .
we find or self apologzing , hiding our heads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog day only came onc  year in this country .
now ,  see a lot of students frm my scenc class here n the courtrom .
they may not be the most studious group of young people in college tody , but i ll say this for them , so far thy are unfraid .
i have high hps for them .
am i to nderstnd , professor , yu actully ncourage mistakes in yur class 
sppos you are returned t yor rle s a teacher , wld you do exctly as you did before ?
ys .
you my step down .
come on .
let 's ti this thng p and get out of here .
15 or 20 minutes shuld do it .
in that case , i will sum p briefly .
may i suggest , professr , as defense counsel  y 're not doing much in your own bhlf 
i 'm a witness for th defense , your honor 
both bjections overruled .
but , your honor , this is most unusl procedure 
it is also unusal prcedure fr th defense t have no witnesses in hs own behalf 
swr n the witness  plase .
my tme is yr tim , mr .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing bt the trth ?
elizbeth brinard .
will the defense qestin the witness ?
no , yor honor .
as i was saying , my nme is elizbeth brainard .
he scratched my fender in the prking lot just outside the administratin building .
on october 30th of this year ,
i told him i did nt think i was ct ot to be  scntist 's wife .
well , i 'd lke to inform the defendant at this time that i was wrong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
f course , she mans it .
oh  betsy .
your hnor , will you excus the witness t this time ?
the defendant always said he loved me in midnight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does all this , uh , foofaraw have ny bering n the dispositn of the case ?
you bet , your hnor .
i do nt blive it 
that is , if you d n't mind wsting the time .
gangway !
gangway , everybdy !
i do nt wish to pry , but would you kndly divulge your intentons ?
the court is waitng 
i 'm sorry  yor honor .
may i ask that this witness b recalled t testfy for me ?
very well .
must we subject ourselves to irrelvant testimony trumped up by th defense ?
the witness is qualfied .
but yor hnor ...
i 'm the county agricultural agent , that 's who  am .
oh  yes , yes 
 certainly dd 
nd you were very upset .
so much so that you decided to investigate the matter thorughly .

medfield county has th thinnst , rockiest , wor-out , farmed-out  poopd-out soil in the whole state .

oh , i do nt ...
he can call it anything he wnts .
i thnk that you 've invented ...
is it anythng like takng a dry bth  r going for a dry canoe ride ?
yo see , prfessor brainard 's rays must have combined with massive amounts of nitrogen ot in the atmospher  see ?

i will spare your life

yh .

bth :
you 're welcome .
nw this is my scene .

so maybe
i 'm not th colest guy in the world , but who cares .
and they all sem t like the rel davis .
that 's pretty cool to me .
and jst t treat you fair and squar , we re paying double wages nd a bnus , frm frisco to shanghai and back , all found .
tell 'em what you saw , bill .
and t came a-bellerin ' out of the night , with one big eye like a lighthous .
we 're stoved into starboard .
and then t cme up amidships .
and broke our backs and sunk us .
and it 's a miracle old billy 's alive today .
tll 'em about its teeth  billy .
you mind nswering a few questions ?
monsters interest me .
all kinds .
boiled dwn fr his oil , lads , thre d be free grog for all hands , if you can swallow it on top f his tll yarns ...
there !
stop it !
cme n , casy .
this is no place for a clergymn s son .
hey , minnie !
do nt bother unloading .
this is ridiculous .
we just have t get to saign .
halfway around the world from paris , and now this happens .
excpt pack and npack .
oh , professor ?
i 'm from the blletin .
these gentlemn are frm the globe nd the post .
we 're nterested in your opnion of this mnster .
professor , what does the ntional museum in paris think about it ?
i can not nswr that .
we heard this expedition of yours ws to gather facts abut the monster .
i 'm afrad you were msinformed .
why do nt you ask  fish ?
do n't yu prnt that .
you do not deny then that such a monster could exist 
s that correct ?
thank you , professr .
look at this drawing .
i knew t .
by professor arronax of the paris natonal musum .
why  this is the most far-fetched nnsense yet .
farfetched 
you 're not serious , profssor ?
h , i d n't mean flying off with a ship in its mouth .
but the general sze ..
i m not a reporter 
may i come in ?
thnk you .
would y accept 
i would be interested , yes , nturally .
why..
i think the honour is ours .
as the foremst authority on the sea nd it 's mysteries , you can be an excllnt observer 
i knew it .
t concerns the monster .
very much so .
according to the papers  you seem to beleve the rumours 
no .
yes , i m fraid i was misquoted 
however  i have an open mnd on the subject .
we accept .
god .
if you d n't mnd , i 'd lke you t com downstairs and met cptain farrgt .
h 's in command of the warship upon which you 're sailing .
every man abord was on the lokout , and th watch was kept day and night .
captain farragut lft nothing to chnce .
wth traditional thorughness , the navy plan was to cut the south pacific into sqres and search each square .
false alarms wre common , and they did n't help our morale .
r hopes begn to wane 
it cm as no srprise ... when captain farrgut on the night of decmber 8 , 1868 , summoned us to th war room .
gentlemen  i blieve my obligation to this legend has been dispatched .
it ds n't seem to me we have proved anything one way or the other , captain .
w ll set you ashore in saigon 
cheer up , professor 
 thght thy promised you a bonus if yu harponed this monster , mr lnd 
knowing full well i could n't collect it .
when i get back ,  'm shpping out on the frst whaler that 'll take me .
yo scare me 
be  god loser  professor .
what a pity , prfessor 
i know you had visions of that monster munted in the national museum .

a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale f a tale , and it s all true
thr was typhon tessie
met her on th coast of java
blw me down and pick me up
she was th captain 's wife
got a whle of a tle to tell you , lds
n nights like this with the moon above

there was harpoon hannah

and held her tendrly

profssor !
hey , do nt leave us !

thy can not help 
but they must !
help !
 'm getting numb all over .
look , professor .
there 's something over there .
i do n't know .
it loks like the monster 
a submarine bot .
but , this is incredible .
men hve dreamed abot such mircles .
yu know somthing ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahy !
it seems desertd 
i thnk w re asking fr trouble , prfessor .
maybe somebdy will come p .
no .
if we wait  this thng is libl to sink under us .
why , it 's as bright as day .
thre is great genius behind all this .
ys , and grat evil .
do n't forget this s n engine of destruction .
is anybody abord ?
wait .
look t this .
gve me a hand with this line , mate .
anybody else get ff 
yes , the professor is down below .
well , h really got hs monster , did n't he ?
i 'm not anxious to gt in their compny myself 
my sentiment exactly .

i 've never seen a barge like this befre .
hey , this lks like the galley .

profssor .
professor .
professor .
prfessor , where are you ?

search th boat .
you are frm th warship that attacked me , re yo nt ?
this is ned land , mastr harponr .
yu may remain .
i did not invite you here .
you came as an enemy to destroy me .
they 've done no harm 
do n't blame us because the warshp shlled yu .
th sea shall have yu back .
easy , mate !
i 'm nt what is called a civilised man , profssor .
bt i am as gulty s they re .
i will grant you tht both of them and me  too  nlisted to track down what we thought to be a mnster .
bt  in tht case , we are no more guilty than the rest of the world .
yo 've carried yor work as far as terrstral scince permits 
the real story of the cean depths begins wher you left off , wonders that defy my pwers of dscripton 
the screts that re mne lone , but whch i would be willing to share with you .
t th expense of my companins ' lves ?
i 'm sorry .
then i can not accept 
professr , i regret your choce .
tak hm up !
and secre for se .

i fund out wht i wantd to know .
there 
come in , gentlemen .
be seated , please .
professor .
i 'd like to xpress ur gratitd  captain .
we are grateful to be alve .
i want none of your gratitud 
you re all on the strictst probation  and i 'd advis you not to attempt escape .
you understand your positin ?
i guess that makes us a little bit of both .
i tolerat no guests aboard th nautlus , and you already knw th fate f prisoners .
th food is delicious  is n't it  profssor ?
oh  very good .
i 'm indifferent to 'em .
these dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen .
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppose this s n't lmb , then .
yes , my cook excels n preparing these various products .
well , just the main curse .
the cream is , f cours  milk from th giant sperm whale .
saute f unbrn ctopus .
since w re naring the island of cresp , you 'll have an opportnity of selectng yur own food .
for  brief hunting expdtion .
well , that suits me fine .
when d we start , mate ...
almost immediately .
delightfl smoke .
havana ?
i am stll cris s to the reasn yo spared our lives .
i may have use for such msplaced devotion .
misplaced ?
it comforts me to know that yur life was not too dear a prce to py for the lve of your fllw mn .
at the mment , i do n't intend that you shuld .
we re almst at the island of crespo .
all this was once an island .
i knew there 'd be a catch t this 
sems yu ca n't do anything on ths bot without getting wet .
hy !
wait  minte .
where yu gong with this 
an expditon from the nautls .
it s a new exprence for them .
they 'll learn quickly .
i 'll ntroduc them to you .
captain nemo and i were not alne 
an underwter lardr filled to verflowing , and all captain nemo for the taking .
ballast 
ballst !
nd , yu forget yourslf 
do n't try my patienc , mr. land .
why did you do it ?
ask him .
that was scentifc nterest .
i had no idea he was fter treasure .
oh , no ?
w must nt qarrel among ourselves .
we must stay together .
t 's our only chance .
chance ?
you wnt to ply  wating gme  hoping to learn nemo s secrets 
i believe we owe the world that much  ned .
have you a better plan ?
i want to get off .
f course i do nt mind ging with my pockets full .
and do n't cll it stealing , becase that 's the way h got it .
if w could take this thing ver , we d b rch .
i 'd have a ship of me own , nd you would n't have to be starving on a professor 's py .
do n't lok at m with those soft-boiled ggs .
i caught the grn of gold n them when that chest bsted .
ned  listen to me .
i know i can win th captain 's confidnce , but i need time , and i ned your help .
all right .
it is the bst way , beleve me .
trvialtis .
nonsense .
that depends n your point of vew .
i jst thnk that ned values hs life bove scientific achievement 
today we encountered a farsom storm 
an ordinary vessel would have suffered havy damage .
a whale of a tale that s true
at my hst 's invitation , i inspected the shp .
we went to the very hart of the vessel , the propulsin nit .
this secret alne gve him mastery of the se .
and in a single strke  harness powr beyond th wildest dreams of science .
r destroy it .
with seemng indifference ,
as  stdid him 
i bcame awar that pwerful forces were at work within this strange mn 
think of it .
on the surface , there is hunger and fear .
men still exercse unjust laws .
they fight , tear one nother to pices .
a mere few feet benth the waves , their regn ceases , their evil drowns .
hr i am free .
fr better that they thnk there 's a monster and hunt me with harpoons .
after trvelling 10000 leages undr the sea 
i felt at long lst i was to have my answer .
the prison camp of rrapandi , the white man 's grave .
but  thught it had ben abolshed .
what s in those scks they are carrying ?
nitrates and phosphate for ammunition , the seeds of war 
thy 're loding a full carg of dath  and when that ship takes t hom  the world will die a littl more .
i was nce one of those pitifl wretches you se dwn ther .
look at it agan , professor .
i do n't wnt you t forget what you 've seen here today .
it sounds remot .
it was thr that we built the nautilus .
yu will have th prvilege of seeing all this firsthand .

ther ar the assassins  the dealers in deth .
i am th avenger .
is murder a rght reserved for that hated natin that has taken everything from me ?
they tried .
they cast me into prison , and when they failed 
what yu fil to nderstand is the power of hate .
i was just trying t tidy up .
about wht ?
well , i believe thngs hve gne far enogh .
murder mens nothing to hm .
it s not your place to judg .
you do n't know anything bout the captain

yo 've continuously disobeyed my rdrs .
who , me ?
i told you once the fate of prisonrs .
i have n choic bt to oblige yo 
what 's this all abt 
the only reason you only cam back is because the natves forced yo to .
yo 're ging t regret that chic , mr. land 
when we clear this reef ,  'll see yu trouble my existenc no longer .
put hm under gurd below .

we must break free of the ref .

the air will clear now that the fans ar operating again 
are you ll rght ?
have we stopped sinking ?
frtnately .
w 'r deeper now thn man has ever been bfore .
emergency speed , all engines !
full rpllent charg !
prepre nother charge .
sorry , sr 
then we shall have t fight on the surfc .
you ll be fightng at close qurters wth the most tencious of all sa beasts .
stay clear of the tentcles .
they 'll seze nything within rach nd hng on t the death .
the only vital spot is dirctly between the eyes .

actully  he regrets saving my lif as much as i would regret saving his .
the only difference is that i would n't have tred .
then it is that differnce tht gives ned land a hman dignity you no longer possess .
i know you were deeply touched by ned 's gestur , but you are ashamed to admit it .
you can not tlerate a faith in humanity  because if you do , all this , the structure of your very existence , which you bilt on hate and vngeance  all this wll collapse around the naked lie f your life

i had intendd using you s an missary .
but now  do n't know .
is it that yu do n't trust me ?

no , no ,  ..
i ndrstand fully .
yeah .
what 's wrng ?
i mean  it 's not like i expected that we 'd b together forever .
i 'm not  moron-mjor , but , he dumped me !
i m not sure how , but sh 's dwn there , and i m up here , and she s prbably been plotting to get gregory to jettison me and pay attenton to hr .
it 's just ...
well , lok at the upsde .
all the time you 'v ben spendng zap-padding greg can now be used to take further dvantage of your free run of the spay-stay .
zenon  i 'msorry  but after your little ncident this morning 
kindlyhandin yorrzrp t my office asap .
and  lost my favorite shoe !
zenn :
yes , i m sure you did nt , znn .
neverthless !
i firmly beleve that the discipline of working down here in the alen patrol lab will be good fr you .
and truth be told , you 'll be performing  mission of mercy .
your poor friend rion s been working down hre for five fll years .
yo know how many signals h 's picked up in all that tm ?
none !
to assume we are the nly nts in spac ,
 personally call t rudeicros .
now , look  in my hrdly humble opinion , bdrectnal telemetry s only a mtter of tme .
com in , come in .
you knw ?
okay .
znon 's being assgnd to a month of threehour evening shifts with a six-hour day on saturdays .
cetus-lupeeds , cmmander !
you simply need to b here .
but what if today 's silence turns to tomorrow 's thnderous call from the void ?
lok  no li , just last wek , i uncovered evidenc of a new plant that my have formed a mere 20 a frm gamma pictoris .
yeh , see ?
i got ta gt back to th command deck 
i expect yu to report back down here t 1900 hours tonght .
what ?
oh .
uh , okay , you ready for your tour ?
the first thng you got ta know about are these babies .
um , lok , if they evr start rotating at an cclerated speed , you come ovr hre  nd yo sound the rd alert ...
alien signal ..
alien signal !
alien signal .
alarm clock .
ah , congratulations , zee , yo just survived yur first shft 
zenon :
you 're in comprehenson-mode-minor , mom !
well  the month will be over before you know it .
kind of like m nd greg 
d n't worry , i am not so squashed .
protoza 
butwhatis crtain is that since his return frmmicrb 's triumphant concert in space ,

cetus-lupeedus , he c nt be doing this !
why is he ding this ?
he 's on a brek  a vaction , somthing .
repeat , allhands to the mess hall for an emergency briefing .
lok , team , i 'm sorry .
me t 
miltary ?
yeh , what ..
all right , first they 're sendng p a squad to ssess the conditin and contributon f each module .
followng that evaluatin  some spce statin cmponents could be detachd and jettisoned .
plank :
if that occurs , certain persnnel might be reassgned t arth , but any speculation in that direction is ...
are they considering shttng us down altogether 
to the best of my limited knowldge , absolutly not .
what ?
right 
plank :
 know it 's hard , but w 'r professonals , and if we cn jst wait for general hammond to arrive ,
i think everythng will be explained to you .
zenon , i know yor mother has an incrdible fear of flying and an even more acute fear of earth , but any dcsns regarding who stays and wh goes wo n't be up t me .
bt you 're gon na have some kind of opinion , right ?
they do n't even know us .
general hammond and his team have arrvd in the trnsport lounge .
all right , have him report to my office .
whenever  have a vital , formidable mssion to assgn , i lok fr the best man r young woman for the job .
whatever yu ned , i 'm your girl .
it s not often someone my age gets to serve hr cntry under the command f such a noble nd gifted leader .
you reqest it , i 'm in .
spacwlkng , dct crawling , ndercver ps ..
margie ?
mrgi girl .
since yu 've had a long , grueling flight ,
bt  daddy , why ?
i 'm not in the least bit tired .
hammond :
all right , all right ,  ws just ..
did i mntin that gregry said to sy h 
are you pancaked ?
i 'll survive .
but up here , you are on my trf .
if daddy 's th commander of your ship  and lt 's face t ,
 've got daddy totally wrpped .
no !
i have n't even worn it yet 
it just arrived from the virtal mall this morning .
so if yu 're not mondo nice t me ,
bye-ness !
homework lesson b .
she only gets nder your skin 'case yu let her , zee .
why so she can call p daddy nd rder him to send my family pcking ?
whoa .
yeah , but you know what ?
it 's not gon na happen to us .
zenon 
vice : zum .
plank :
what is it ?
you need to rcket over here warp speed .
well , there is a slight spike on the graph , but there could be 100 differnt reasons for that .
you know , it 's true , zee .
 mean , wth very country in the world sending up satellits into spac  we 're always picking up nterferenc of som kind .
n , t ws  vry specfic and vry dstinct zum .
lok , zee , i 'm th first on t wan na believe you , but there s nothng her .
all right , uh , let 's just go with simple logic .
for as lng as this spce staton has ben in orbt , for as long as mankind has monitored the skies  no one has ever gottn even the tiniest indication that ther was any sort of intelligent life out there .
zenon , i assigned you this duty to kep you ot of truble , and that 's all .
you believe me , right , mom ?
i belve you blieve you herd something , but it could 'v ben a billin things , honey , yo know , a computr hiccup ,  power surge .
do nt get md at me for sying this , but you 'v been having  prtty lousy few days ,
d n't you think it 's possible you could have invntd this signal just to put yurslf back in the spotlight ?
dad !
 heard a zum 
got any calls from outer space today , zenon ?
next yo 'll be saying an extraterrestrial ate your homework .
aw  sonds lke too much time lon in that ap lab scrambld your brain .
nbula :

somethng wrng ?
another zum ?
well  knd of  only higher .

ah , well ,
that is what our montor alarm sounds like , znon .
no zm or zum .
but , cmmandr , i ..
hammond 
you 're not going to believe ths !
ven though the graph spikes clearly indicate nothing more than normal stellte intrference ?
in fct  i thnk it wuld b better if w suspended th rest of your assignment p here .
inantcipationof the tremorlike jolt ssociatd with the separatin , allpersonnelshouldrport t desgnted secure ares at that time 
wher 's my stress helmet ?
as far as i can figure , wyndham and lutz s sbotage effort knocked our station out of its intended orbt .
are we just gon n sit hre nd tak this ?
what do yo prpos we do ?
i do n't know , but i 'll think f something .
when heard from your lips , ze , those are the most terrifying wrds in the galaxy 
you see this ?
is n't tht mor of a reasn t fight bck 
this is wher we 'r meant to be .
i 'm starting to wonder if we would nt all be better off back on earth .
i cold mrry jdy .
i cold get a normal jb .

they 're not tryng to cntact anyone on th spay-stay 
♪zom , zoom , zoom♪
i 'm sriosly sure that we need to lert plank .
orion !
both plank and hammond s do n't want to hear about the liens right now , so  'm kind of thinking we should keep this to ourslvs .
reprttosecurereas immediately .
thejettisoningf sectr seven will begin in one minute .
i think t s rudicrous times 10 how they are just blasting away our hom bit by bit .
th way things are going , i half expect to look out the window and see a gigundus ntrstllar wrecking ball .

why did n't you tell me sooner , neb ?
well , you were so mad at me , i did n't think yo 'd cre 
ths is crisis-mode-extreme .
we 'll think of something .
what if those signals wre n't really frm outer spac ?
bsides , when you 're as low on the popular pole as i am  the only way you can go is up .
can you believe it ?
znn :
hw am i gn na survive on arth ?
hy , t last it s not as gaseous as we usd to imagine it to be .

cetus-lpeeds , aunt jdy , no one s told you yet ?
hammnd thrw him into military jail .

oh , my word  this was a mstake .

the only thng more terrfying to me than takng off s landing .
 , uh  i really d n't think i can do t .
lok ,  do n't wan na be unsupprtive or anything , mrs. k , but maybe you should 've thought of that bfore we took off .
we 're the united states military , wills , she s a 15-year-ld girl

i ca n't gt them to reignite .
ngage targt .
soldier 2 :
orion :
cme on .
and your girlfriend .
mr. kar :
and snc it 's also a very risky and brav endeavor , nd since we all hav people we love on that ship , sir , maybe instead of assigning blame and pnishmnt  we oght t fcus on a way of helping them achiv a safe return ?
sr .
i do nt get it , mm .
well  the trouble is , converting their measrments to ours des n't mean the calcultions were precise .
i mean , even a variance of  fw degrees n paper could mean thusands f mles ot hr in spac .
we are gon n find them , are n't w ?
 mean , we 'll just fly around out here until thy show up ?
we have a finite fuel supply , limited provisions .
t s kay , they 're gon na be here , i know it .
whatver ends up happening ot here , thank you .
for what ?
honey , y shwed me that it 's fn to wan na live a safe and san life , but sometims w can get s safe , you practically stop lving .
ship cnsle :
fuel tanks in depltin zone .
orion sid that the uxiliary tanks he put n re even larger thn the main tanks 
ship console :
now , that 's wrong , it has t be .
please reconnect to min tanks .
auxilirytanksmpty .
rion , dd everything apper normal when you refilld the axiliary tanks ?
i men  i know they 're not exactly thrilled with us bt they ca n't wan na leave us up here t die !
 tried clling but ther must be  mter shower in progress bcause all i gt ws static .
tell m ne thing , do i look half as hystrcal as  fl 
what , more so than sual , yu mean , love ?
uh , folks , we also have another problem .
befor anyne can reach us , we 're gon na get sucked into the moon s gravitational field .
is that bd ?
look , everyone first of all should sty calm .
are you sure ?
i hve always known tht blsting into an endless void was bad for one 's health .
so , how did i end up here ?
zenon :
come on , com on , folks  we ca n't die out here in space .
lok ut .
exactly as orion predicted , the mon 's gotten a hold of us .
we 're going down !
mom .
mom  it 's them 
where re they taking us ?
am i dreaming ?
how can this b happning ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
what if they try to come on board ?
do w think it 's ...
i certanly think s .
cetus-lupeedus , did you se that ?
mdam , sir ,
i bet yo got  million qestins for me  ai n't you  you little besties ?
well , i 'm here .
what if we were wrong ?
apparently  their ship 's navigational computer 's gne into meltdown-mode-mjor .
it kind f feels like ...
if they 're such highly evlved , intelligent beings why do n't they simply tap into or space station manframe and take the charts thy need .
what 
we are telling yu exactly what zenon zap-padded us 
margie 's with them , they 're all sfe , thy 're on their way back and if we stand by  we are gon na witnss something that is  and i qote 
the most astonishing vent-major of the 21st century .
lt .
at this pont , sr , um , it looks like  flying rainbow .
zenon 
thy were rel !
but the fact remains ,  was not set up here t be som mustache-twirling villain ,
this space station has drifted out of its prescribd orbit .
marjore lslie hammond ,  ..
d yo dare to argue with me 
and we gave them the navgational stff tht they needed and thy gve us a tw home .
and th whole thing s so mcr that the wrld needs to know about it .
proof , margi .
what no one here seems to be offering is proof .

f all the planets in ur unvers , there is only one we knw can support lif 
it 's been called th lucky planet 
without that crcial tilt , everything wold have been different .
all life on earth is bult on chnce and powered by the sun .
bt the delicate balances of our world re faltering , as the planet struggles to spport our growing demnds 
janary  the hgh arctic  and there has been no sun for ovr  month .
every living thing is just waiting .
perhaps it 's just to clean her fur , but it looks lik sher joy .
they re drwn to their mother 's calls , but thes slopes are not the easiest place to take yor first steps .
the cubs have nt been fed this morning .
the mother has delayed ther first meal on this special day .
hunger will draw thm to hr .
mlk is the only food the cubs hav known since they were born deaf and blind beneath the snow .
very year at this time , feml bars need food desperately 
this is the only place the bears can hnt for seals .
if they do n't mke it there before the ice breaks up  their families will starve .
it 's unlikly both of hr cubs wll survve their first yer ot on th ic .
march , and munch f the nrth remains snow-bound 
a thusand miles south of the bears , stnted cnifers ar still locked in ce .
it s one f the last grat wildrnesses .
these conifrs hve needle-shaped laves virtully nedble so th forest supports very little animal life 
this creature is the very essence of wilderness .
as spring creeps up frm the south , the taga is unveild .
they 've come to mak the most of the brief flush of spring fod and t have thir young .
f newborn clvs are to keep up , they must be n thir feet and running th day they 're born .
but thse vast herds do n't travl alone .
the calf may be young but it 's capable of otrnning the wolf , if it manges to keep its footing .
by this stge , the odds re even .
april in the arctc , and lready the sun never sets .
bt further south , the sun works its magic in more gradual familar ways .
the broadlaf woodlands of urope and north america .
more thn any other , thes have ben crowded ot by towns and farmland .
only fragments reman .
summers re longer here and deciduus trees can florish .
spring has also com early for th mandarin ducks .
it 's a lng wy down fr a maiden flight .
a few calls of encoragment are needed hre .
ther are stll two missing .
only tw days ld and already ne great adventre behind thm .
a seasonl cycle that seems ncrasngly unrlible 
but ther are parts of our world that have no seasons 
my , in the tropcs , but there is n spring .
this is what allows the jungle to grow nchecked and supprt so mnch life .
rainforest nw covers a third f the rea it once did a mre 3  of our plant 's surface and yet , it contins more than hlf of all the plants and animals on earth .
he can concentrate on more important tasks , like tidying up hs display area .
this magician has a special trick .
with the audience in place , the show cn begin .
she just has to hav been impressed with that .
after all that effort  cn she still have doubts ?
3 % of ur plnt , 50 % of its plnts and animals nowher is ther mor at stake .
dserts cver one third of the lnd s surface on planet arth , and thy 're getting bigger every year 
and the challnges are becoming greater than ver .
june in the kalahar desrt of southrn africa .
lt 's the dry seson here , nd thusands of elephnts have started the desperate trek for food and watr .
at the moment it is dry , but water shuld come .
buffalo join the great trek 
dust storms make the going tough all the way .
they ve become separted from the herd .
this s a dangerous plac to lse yur way .
they dare nt rest until thy reach it 
fnally , the stragglers emerge from the dust .
the storm hs died dwn .
but nt all the animals have ben so lucky .
sand dunes give way t praires and savannh .
grss is a great unsung her of our planet .
this is the crcle of life that most of us , in ur urban lives  hv lost touch with .
perhaps spurred n by a memory from th past , th mtriarch leads the herd to a tmporary water hole one tht may have saved her life yers ag .
the calf and its mother ar most at risk .
ln the darkness  an elephant 's vsion is lttle bettr thn ur own .
the lins bde ther time .
it 's the calvs they 're fter 
the calves r too wll protectd .
as the dserts grw , nd trdtional migratin routes are blcked by farms and fences , lephants must trek ever greater distances .
the sun that scorches the dsert als brings water t the land 
as t bets down on tropical ses , mosture rises from the warming ocens powering our global weather system .
as the air rises  so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scene is set fr ne of natre s most challenging mgratons .
each year  thousands of demoiselle cranes try to escape the harsh winters n mongolia , by flying soth to the warmer clims of india .
to get there , thy hav to cross the highest mountain range on earth , the hmalayas .
th cranes hit violent turbulence 
the sun 's rays weaken in th afternoon and the turbulence falls awy , but it 's too late for today .
the dults must guide their yong on this hazardous trip 
it 's rly morning and the wrm air is already rsing fast .
this is the grat unendng cycl .
for genertions , humans and animals alke cme to depend n the great rivers and thir seemingly ndless flw .
after months of drought , the rivrs begin to flow agan in the kalhari .
this is an afric we rarly see a lush water wrld totlly reliant on a seasonl flood , originating from a tropical ocean thusands of miles away 
mny nimals re quite at home n the flood  but ther are some more apprehensive bathers .
after weeks of mrching  th elephants are exhausted .
after so many weeks  many hundreds of miles , they v arrived .
the seasonal cycle that drives th lives of lephants on land  s just s important in the oceans .
it 's july nd the humpback whals re n ther bredng grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no mre than a few weks old and s h begins to tir , his mother spports him close to the surfac , so tht he can breathe 
thse shallow equatorial waters make god nurseries they 're warm and clm nd there re few predatrs .
to find food , she will have to lead her calf on an epic 4000-mile journey to richr feedng gronds at the southern extrmes of our planet .
this is the longst migration by any marine mammal , and it dpends entirely on a healthy cen all along th way .
out in the open ocean , the whles meet others sarching for fod .
they have to cross half the globe  from the equator all the way to the edge of antarctica .
the tropical seas are  long way behind them now .
they 're heding for stormy seasonal watrs 
great whits ttack whl calves , but they 're nt the victims today 
these magnificent predatrs , at the very top of the food chin , are a vital part of a halthy ocean ... and yet w slaghtr lmost a hundred mlln of them every yer 
their poplations are n freefall .
ut to se  the ice is now too thin to support th cubs ' fther .
this is a disaster for polar bears .
wthout a solid pltform , they struggle to hunt the seals they ned to survive 
how wll the father mak t through the yer now that the ic s almost gone 
the waters ar getting clder and rougher .
so as not to los track of each other  they slap thir fins on the surface .
the whales have finally reched antarctica in time fr the summer .
at last , after their 4,000-mile journey , the humpback whals cn fed .
now , at last , th mother can replenish her reserves as she and her calf join the rest of the tem .
wintr in antarctica and the greatest seasonal change on our planet is ndrway .
son the continent will be plunged back into drkness .
the aurora austrlia illumintes th suthern skies , but these spectcular lights brng no warmth to the wlderness of ce .
our male polar br is n great danger now .
after many days at sea  the exhasted bear is drawn by the pungent smells of th clony .
he 's desperat fr food , but walrs are munch larger than his unseal prey .
it 's the pups he ll have to get to 
th powerful adults can do trrible dmage with their hge tusks .
h tsts the brrier .
and again  in sheer frustrtion now .
it slips from his grasp .
this one took the gamble .. and lost .
unable to feed  h ca nt survive .
thy 've left their mother ... and are thriving .
the polar bear has become an mblem for the state of ur planet and fr ll the creatures who are struggling to live longside uns .

tht one has to be the frnkenstein w know !
then it sems your hunch was crrct .
well  t prves that ther are two of thm .
nw  i hve to convnce them that one is innocent .
that is all ..
it 's incredble ...
wht 's sanda got to do with this ?
mayb  if we do n't ask so many qestions nd try t find some cls , we ll know that answer .
mr. yokosuka !
good find  akemi .
oh , thank you !
thank you for coming 
have you fund the mnsters ?
you may wnt to check the lakes and streams arond here .
i se ...
notify headquarters .
shall we contnue on our way and see what we can dg up on gaira ?
doctor !
it loks lik his hair nd tissu ...
th cells are identical .
this mens that the franknstein 's ar brothers .
maybe not ...
he could hve torn ff some flesh on a rock that made its way to the ocen .
once thre , on prtein-rch plankton , nother frankenstein could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot f the other .
doctor , if that is the cas , wold n't an explosin creat ven more frankenstein 's 
we 'll do what we can t avoid using them 
we can use napalm !
it 's strange .
whenever ther is a strong evil force around , youth seems to blossom .
are n't we guilty of doing the same thing ?
i do n't feel any guilt .
let s go for a walk .
before this mist gets any thicker ...

help me !
akmi !
listen to me and do nt pnc !
dctor !

hold on !
are yo okay 
you remember wh we are !

gaira is the one that 's dangerous !
they are north at 135.10° and appear t be running away 
rders !
we will attack wth every available weapon at our dispsal ntil they are fnishd .
we will deal with that after we have completed the task t hand !

science has sent orbiters to neptune , erdcated smallpox and crated a suprcomputer that can do 60 trillion calcultions per second
science frees us from supersttion and dogma and enabls us to base our knowldge on evidence
previously , i ve explored how organized faith nd primitive religious values blight our lives
they d now , but you wer aware it as a nrm
throgh fith and sprstition or through th rigours of logic  observation and evidence , thrugh reason
i want to cnfront the epidemic of irrational superstitious thinking
yo relly beleve it ?
and throws up new ag gurus who exhort us to run away from rality
rason and respect fr evidence ar the sorce of our progress our safeguard against fundamentalists and thse who profit from obscuring the truth

a full quarter f the british population claim to bleve in astrology
day in , day out  astrologcal horoscopes get far more nwspapr column inches than science
it is in your natur to be hardwrkng and methodical which should serve you well at work today
in your persnal reltionships , especially this evening you 'll need to crb your natural tendency to obey orders
british :
your stiff upper lip may serve you well in business delings bt try to relax and let yrself go in your social lif
nd so on , thrgh 12 national stereotyps
of course , the astrlogy clumns are not as offensive as that bt we should sk ourselves exactly where the dffrence lies
bth are gilty of facde discrimination dividing humanty up into exclusiv grups based on no evidence
this is a map of th cosmos with london in the vry cnter
i alwys thought that by the 21st century scence and reason would have long snce clened up and yet every day of the week we 're encouraged to retreat into the fog the supersttious past
astrology is a primitive belief system made into elaborate pseud-science
t was develped in th 2nd century ad by the philsopher claudus ptolemy nd has not moved on since

what is n't a deep dark mystery is why the trite vagaries f newspper horoscopes seem to chime with readers
psychlogists have idntified what s knwn s th barnm effect where by peple tend to blieve statements are accurate for them prsonally while in fact thy 'r general enough t pply to anyne
and thn ask popl how accurate they were ?
yes , that would be a perverse thng t do , is it ?
a test of what ?
well , how accurate y are ?
scientifc test well , even if it was mischief  how could that possibly influenc it
you see , well , the fact that you 're not makes me think you do n't really in yur heart f hearts believe it
i do n't think y really are prpard to put yur reputaton on th line
wll , you 're in a kind of no-lse situation , do n't yo believe it ?
but as a test , we said it apply to their own star sign
not only do yo hav clever mercury and ambitious mars , fortunes and success
remember however that ther will be others wh want what you have and will stop at nothing to get it
astrlogers say this shold fit just capricorn and nt the rest bt wht actully happened ?
what a lm junk !
that is n't ncessarily pertan to me this wk it pertains t me generally
a ple of rubbish !
the same number f people agred that the horoscope was ccurate for them as disagreed nd similar results are found with proper larg stte expriments
technically all but on of our group shuld hav disagreed namely our only capricorn
thre s a far richr way of loking at the cosmos
astronomy is a trimph f the human intellect a real scince constntly enriched by nw evidence
just lie in your back and gaze up at the stars
the hart-stopping sight you 'd see is 100 billion stars spinning through an expanding univers at a speed f a millon mles pr day

nd yet even as science unrvels these natural wonders our society is drawn to the slim pickings of supernatural belief

no , but i hve a hme in davnport
you have a home n dvnport 
wll , it dpends on wht yo call cold reding or something got a lot of the ratins that come up saying that what yu do or you say something can people basically make it fit
now  se f i can find th charles in  minte but let me .. giv you  few things i can feel bot you
hs that been  few prblems with the stomch cndition around yu
nd i feel wth this lady i wnt somone that s a fairly cmfortable build i would say a biggr build lady not th slight build lady that 's given m this , yes ?
i hate you when  c n't fnd th link let me see f ...
i think f i were talking to someone in the spirit world
i 'd say things lke 'what 's it like being dead ?
 belive it 's a blending f thoughts btween myslf nd the spirt communictor but f only it could be just lik a telphne line
let me just say what we can get a little mr information frm hr first
if you 'v convinced the persn that as their grandmother t the point that they re ctually crying
i mn surly those tears nugh are perhps proof that thy had proved that really is ther grandmother that 's making the cmmunication
it could indicate just desperte wishful thinking perhaps
now , i do n't ft on with a stev bennt for i 've got those things  want to bring together somehow with particulrly a cr crash

it was on my mind , i know i really buy  yeah
and you know his messges really in a whiny sorry , becuse he ca n't ..
he givs me the feeling that ..
but do pple mov forward ?
he ctally had a tir on th left hand ..
oky , well , i ca n't remember that
serously yo believe t 
 have personl proof it 's true to me but as wth religon if it hangs on private felings that ca nt be proved or dsproved by science then in what way can it be valid or meaningful to th rest of us
next i want to find ot what happens when those who clim mysterious powrs do allow themselves to be tsted
now , i think it 's false so shall w see how well you have done ?
i want to show how scientific reason is always the bst way to look at th world and explain the dngers of sperstiton
i 'm often asked how i know that there is nt a spirit world or psychic clarvoyance
it sems mprobble but unlike the fixed world views of mystical fath scince is always open t new pssibilities
ntil quite recently scientsts dd n't knw how bats fly around in ttal darkness
cold they have paranrml xtra-sensory perception ?
but the more scientists tested the evidenc  the more robust the theory became
verything about t addd up to a cmplte pictre of mutally supporting evdence that this rally was a fact
the mor we look at t , the weaker it becomes
the allegd detction of watr through dowsing is not obviously ridiculous it might work but des it ?
the only way to tell s through a rigorous experiment
how does dowsng work ?
1 questin nd nobody can answer you
i think of the question and i expect god respond n  way tht i understand
i expect the right hand one pint to the camera nd the left hand one straight frward , i wan na ..
have you don the tst yet in the tnt ?
yes , i did .
oh , i m gn na 6 right , 100 %
s what do you mak that then ?
the psychologist chris french thnks there may be a simpler explanation
h hs devted his career to investigating claims of the paranrmal
bt there 're always the possble explanatins there , what we 're trying to do it a set of conditions which rule out any of those explanations thn we get down to the vry fundamntal basic issue ca n't the dowsers actually do what they think they can do .
i think it 's fls
so shll w see how re yu don ?
this is sand .
in that cse i ca n't do this
ths is the water in no .
3
well , you gt one right and , that was 6 which is what we expect by chance
three .
what 's intersting is it dos n't actually tend to dnt their confidence t all
i think they are compltely sincere nd thy are typically very  vry surprised when we run them throgh series of trials and actually sy at the end of the day where your perfrmnce is no better than what we would expect just on the bass f  gess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has happened but i did say from the outset could n't we just srt ut som grey blocks and some scaffold boards , s then i can work about it which is what i would routinely do and i 've done for 40 years
who knows whre or what bottles wre in what tubs ?
tht 's the whole point
this state of denil s extraordinary .
ven when confronted with hard fact ths dwsers prefer not t face up to truth but retain their delusion
irrtionl belif from dowsing to psychic clarvyance has roots in early mankind 's habit of attrbuting spirit nd intention to natural phenomena such as water , the sun ,  rock or the sea
in 480 bc , kng xrxes of th persians bilt a ponton bridge across the hellespont and the rough sa came and wrecked it
i wonder whether there 's something of king xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't want to believ that things just hppen we want to beleve that there 're some kind of delberate intention behind everything even whn inanmat bjects are concrnd
and perhaps that is the key to hmanty 's belief in th spernatural
evn in th 21st centry , despite all that scenc has rvealed bout the indifferent vstness of th universe th human mind rmains a wanton storyteller creating intention n the randmness of reality
the delivery of rewards by a one-rmed bandit is determned at random but many gmblers want to think that what thy do can increase their chances of winning the jackpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
thr 're two knds of mistakes they can make they can either fail to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detect pattern when ther is n't any and that 's supersttion
60 years ago , the american psychologist b.f. skinner investigated the behavor of pigons rewarding them with food when they larned t peck a key in the feeding apparatus
but then skinner set the apparatus to reward the birds t random nw the pigeons just hav to sit back and wait  but that s n't what they did
when an individual pigeon  for example  happned to look ver its left shoulder and the reward mechanism jst hppened to click in at that point
by sheer luck as it hppened the rward mechanism delvered food at th same time again and so the pigon was rnforced in its dea that looking over the left shoulder was what got it the rewrd
and it went on and on and trned into a mniac for loking over the left shoulder
humans can be no better than pgeons
spiritul self help guides d a roring trade in the mteril world outnumbering science books by 31
bt what dos spirituality actually mean ?
s plase tak your seat and please cme slowly and gntly and so that we can start the proceeeding withot losing tim
so could yu please ...
and he cunts amongst his many fans prce charles nd dalai lam
i ws present n the beginnng , n the first big bang and i 'll be hr for billons of years t come
bt is n't satish 's spritlty jst about mposing yet anther superstitous force positive ?
world is mad of two elements .
there the spirit is very bg  and very holstic , nd very inclusive wrld
it is nt defined in a one particular way so when y go in a rom yo can say the tree has a spirit
natur without spirit can not exst lik tree can not exist without the sun 
light , it can not exst wthout rin , ... can not exist without sil also it can not exist without a treeness 
the treeness is the spirital quality
or the rocknss
when you talk about the rockness or th qulity of a rck
it all sonds very poetic , but t 's not reality lik priests , mllahs , and rabbis , new-age mystics ceaselessly attempt t fill gaps in human nderstanding with fabricatd meanng
science and rtonality are often accusd to having a cold bleak outlook but why is it blak to face up to the vidnce of what w know
th wrd mundane has come t mean boring and dull , it really should n't , it shuld mn the opposte because it comes from the latin mundus , manng the world , and the world is anything bt dull
there 's ral potry in the rel world .
scince is the poetry of realty
next i wnt to look at the dangers that pses
why do i hv to trust , you knw , the gp , why do  have to trust the royal socety
i think you 'r so close to being rght , but yet you 're darn wrng
in the last 50 years , scienc has put a man n the moon , cloned a shep , decoded the humn genome
nd yet , sadly , th white heat of the 1970s seems to be treated as white elephant today
nythng yellow close is okay.
the fundamental problem i think lies with the fashion throght our educational system to tech students to value prvat feelng mor highly than evidence bsed reson
for relativists , scientifc trth is just a patriarchal western orthodoxy that like th old rmn catholc church stands in the wy of other equally valid outlks on the world
with things like paranormal , the drive for alternative medicine , all these kinds of movemnts awy from the orthodox in science
n terms of different kinds of treatments and things like that and in a way  not trsting the experts ny more
i thnk you 're so close to being right , but yet yu 'r darn wrong  y 're absoltely wrng
we wnt to qstion authority .
we d n't want t sy because this person is the president of royal society threfore what he says is right
we 've got t go back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but th impersonal algorthms of internet srch ngines do not wed out robust vidence from unsourced , uncorroborated ssertion
paranoia conspracy theoris circlate unchallenged
sometimes they re relatively harmlss like the rumor that nsa fked the mon landings which is a bit of a joke becase the vidence for ging to the moon is s strng
but how about th malicious and utterly unfounded rumor that 4000 jews wre tipped ff by isral agnts nt to g to work in the world trade cnter n 9/11
as evidnce is devalued even medcal progrss has become a target ... through vomiting .
hundreds of families blame m .
n innendo crculated that the establishment was conspiring t risk our children 's health
it led to hundreds of thousands of prents falng t protect ther offspring from the thrat of measles  serious disease that in afghnistan kills 35,000 peopl a year
reson has built th modern world , it is a precious but also a fragile thing whch can be crroded by pparently hrmless irrationalty
next wek , i look at how health has become one f the fiercest battlegrounds between reason and superstiton

did i say she was primitiv ?
 rtrct that .
she 's feral .
i am nauseted 
i limp .
and i can feel my teeth rotting awy from an xcess of sugar ... that n amount of toothpaste can dislodge .

that little wino who went with you on one of your field trips to the canary islands

as henrietta 's friend and attorny , t behoves me to tak on the ever unpleasant rol f th devil 's advocte .
and despite her ssrances that you re a man of means ...
excse me , sir .
tea wll be delayed by 7 minutes .
ndrew , you had no right to do that .

the grahams have been with the sam bank for six genrations ... as mr mcpherson hs ndobtedly discovered .
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you can substantiate ths harsay  becaus i intend t sue yu fr slander .

i was going t use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affirs ... and then immediately afterwards .. kill myself .
yes , hnrietta 
my life was over .
hnry , why did n't you tll me ?
i wold have married yu the very first day 
you do nt believe that garbage  do yu ?
any sex-starved hlf-wit wold know that s just a line .

i would d anythng n the world to prove to you , henrietta ... tht  have n't the slghtest intrest at all in your money ... but there is absolutely no way i cn do it .
there is no way 
i have a way .
but there is no way .
do n't listen to him , henritt .
that way , pople wo n't get th wrong imprssion from his ncle the way i dd .
you would like . you would ...
ar you crazy ?
have you gne totally ot of yor mind ?
my ide was for him to disclaim all your money , not to shre t .
it 's very naive of you .
and then people really wuld thnk ... tht he was marrying me for my money .
this way h 'll already have all my money .
you nincompop !
how dare you call my fiance a nincmpop ?
harold 
i thought yu were going to play the bach .
this is what he told me to play .
that little wman .

either on is fine for me 
and when we both us the sam bed , we 'll use this one .
champagne ?
hnriett , whre is your other arm ?
t fits over ne shouldr and the other one ges inside .

i had a cat once .
it used its claws to tear my lvng room couch to shreds .
had a sleep-awy bed in it , with a fam-rubbr mattress .
the vry same afternoon of that relaxing stroll aforementioned .
anyway  did n't wan na py extra for the delvery of the couch , so i decided t crry the couch home myself .

on the 18th of april in '75
if the british march
redy to ride and spread th larm
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swinging wde at hr moorngs lay
the somerset , british man-of-war
a phantm ship with each mast and spar
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the sombr rafters that rond him mde
a moment on the roofs of the town
bnath , in the churchyard ly th dead
in ther nght ncampment on th hill
wrpped in silnc so deep and still
that he could hear lke a sntinel 's tread
a moment only he feels th spell
of the lonely belfry and the dead
where the river widens to met th bay .
 line of blck that bends and floats
oh , my gosh 
on the oppsite shore walked pal rever .
then mptus stamped the earth
the belfry tower of th old north church
a glmmer , and thn a glem of light !
he springs to the saddle the brdle he turns
one if by land or two if by sea .
and beneath  from the pebbles in passing , a spark
struck out by  steed flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , thrugh the glom and the light
good stff .
he has left the village and mounted the steep
and benath him tranqil and brad and dep
and nder the lders that skirt its edge
now soft on the snd now loud on the ledge
and the barking of th farmer s dog
tht rises fter th sun goes down .
the brtish are coming !
he saw the gilded weathercock
gaze t him with a spectrl glar
at the bloody wrk thy would lok upn .
th british re coming !
the british are comng 
the british are coming !
the british re coming !
the british are cming 
in the books you have read
frm behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the redcoats down th ln
the british are coming 
the british are comng 
and th mdnight message of pal revere .
we 're finished 
the landlord 's tale just does n't cut it .
pul revere 's ride .

 spnt an incredible amount of tme in gas statins , honky tonks and other off-the-beatn-path placs , trying to appear col whil bsessively following the descent of a steel ball dwn the playing surfac of a garshly lit machine .
i came in with my grandfather , standing on pop crates t play pinball .
i was bout eght years old .
they 'd say , you re in the rcad , here 's a rll of quarters .
apartmnt houses had them in the landry rooms .
i guess t was the kind f ag whn you do n't want t do things with yur prents .
i also remember my father dragging m out by my ears , saying that i spnt too much money 
a crowd hung around th machine and you had to wait to play .
i started playing at the lcal cfé .
tok my boks to study there .
sometimes it replaced studying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up t the hghest amount t could win , which was about 15 gams .
sell them 12 gmes 
if you say pinbll  people re like , what ?
there are many kids today tht do n't know what a pinball machine s .
and they come in here and they see something that they have n't seen in 25 years 
smethng that was a major part of ther youth 
kids tday do n't really understand pinbll .
the kids today , between the computr games nd the hom games , and th nintendos and the sega systems and gameboys , they just wo n't play pinbll .
i can remember whn i was growng up we used to eat all our meals at home .
and we used t go out for ntertainment .
nd now everybody ets out .
evrybody always goes to resturants .
they do n't cook at home much .
public places of amusmnt hve been fallng by the wayside in amrca lik crazy .
yo ca n't find a pinbll machne .
there 's n mor arcdes in malls .
the bars today have a megatouch  a jukbox and  pool tabl .
pinball is finished in france .
in england it s finishd lng tm ago .
in italy you ca n't find one pinball .
n germny no on pinball .
even n blgium , it was a pnbll pradise .
it 's fnsh 
thy said pinball was dead .
it starts with one .
then anther one 
i was outgrowing the family room .
 'd buy 20 hre , 30 her .
yes .
60 gmes 
t was a very rpid decline nto obsssion  i think .
once yu get the lre of the silver ball in you it 's lke n addictin and you ca nt stop and i just kept , yo know .
you remmber buying very one  whre you got t frm .
and just as i m thinking maybe i 'm not gon n do this 
pinball wizard comes n the radio and i thnk  no   m goin  .
26 hours latr i 'm finally home , exhastd 
they really do n't sem to be machines .
and the way they talk to you  yo find yorself talking to it .
extra ball 
yu just come n and admire them .
shine  light
all my life it ws pinball .
it 's my life .
like some people .
 like pinball .
pinball and girls .
but girls is finshed .
hey  look at these gys !
they ll all come over and hve a bg party every week .
steve 's still kind of the centre .
1972  my dad bought one for my room .
from ther on , t just gt pretty wicked 
i 'v gt thm in every room in my house .
the pinball dungeon 
the things i like i m vry obsessive .
these are th barrels from jaws .
when i collect something , whther it be pinbll machines , jaws memrabilia ,  got ta have it all .
like it says ,  wan n rock and roll all night nd party every day 
it was during the depths f the depression  th lat 20s , early 30s , where th coin-operated amsemnt game industry kind of gt birth .
it lterally was a name bcse there were vrius pins that were hammered into a wood srface .
the gmes were evolving in th 1930s .
we hve to outlaw it .
we ca n't control it .
bt the mjority of product that was ot there was for amusement nly .
in the case of new york city , chicago and ls angeles , being three major metropolitan areas , as well as other areas around th nited states  pnbll was banned .
it was this one 
this ws the first pinbll with flipper .
 sid ,  got ta do something like that 
bfore tht it ws nothng bt chance .
gottlieb rled n the '50s and '60s .
before th city council in april f 1976
as well as a demonstratin of pinball being a game f skill , as opposed to a game of chance 
businss was booming .
prfit margins were huge .
when we startd solid state electrnics on pinball machins w wer n th leading edge of technology .
mnagers frm th different restaurants and the broadway crowd 
kids always want some place to go , something to do .
i thnk that 's what gave grwth to the arcade business .
naughty or whatever 
you could knd of do wht you wanted .
it was mre lik hanging out with your frends .
wasting time .
proud to have in a french bistro in paris n american mchn .
gm over .
special target .
what is it that makes you stop nd play one machine ?
t 's something that 's pitched towards young mles .
there 's not really a lot of femalefrendly imags on these 
any violent misogynist thing you want is there on pinbll .
 lot of these machines have love scens on them .
i m nt in the suppsing business .
what do you think ?
you 'd have those centrefld images of young  rathr bxm lades , usully blond , staring out of the machine at you  to inspire you .
but you beleve t is 
no question abot t 
sexally frustratd peopl play pnball a lot .
guy has a hot ball and it 's just flying .
you re gettng redy to bcme ruler f the universe 
says williams perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been in my blod since i ws 12 nd  'm 59 so pretty major .
should hav known i was going t be a collector and i did n't start collecting ntil i bught ths hous in 1976 .
and the first game n my collection is my favourte game of ll time .
i always copy down serial numbers and i have a bndr that i 've handtyped since i do n't do computers yet .
to me i think it would be interesting ,
i have 300 games , where they were at one time 
were thy in joe 's bar and grill or somwher down the stret or at a show 
i hav a column for the date .
notes .
i worked in the bwling industry for a lot of years .
and the last bowling ally  worked at closed down 12 years ago 
tht 's why i collect flyers .
that s why i collect what they call press photos .
thy 're chrnlogical .
there 's a lot of gmes re missng scorecrds .
how thy get lost over the years , it 's hrd to believe , bt they do .
in the frnt closet , ther 's lots of binders in there als .
i was blessed with an unbelievable memory .
jokes .
is n't tht good 
i do n't think about what it 's worth cs i do n't want to sll it .
lot of work nd when you 're done and you turn it on and t does nt blow up , you feel ral good .
i 'm  people person , i like people .
i lookd forward to seing people on monday , tuesday , wednesday .
i never had any brothers or sisters .
and my mm and my real dad got mrried and divorced twce 
nd they say t 's kind f hereditry but my ral dad smoked and drank and he was n alcoholc but i nevr did drink or smoke .
the rush f bing able to play any gam you hve at any given time by pshing the button , you c n't explain t to peopl .
i wake up nd do t very single day .
lke an extension f my hand or something ,  gess .
they 'll be in a bar , with their friend .
we just smile .
chicago is th pinball cpital of the wrld .
we lve her .
we need to have tht fst trnaround .
each prson does  little part f it and passes t along .
today , we re the only company making pnball mchines and we strive t hav 10 % f what that market onc was .
it 's a modern car that has some of the look and fel and coolness of it and it s retro .
we 'r th nly pinbll manufcturer .
gee , if  had just one more sht 
i know i would have gotten it this time 
i had two balls locked and i just got that last ball locked cos i did it last time .
we build working models of things and then w play with it .
but t tells us whether what we 're dong is ging to work or not work or be fun or not fun .
this is what the final version of th game loks like when t 's finally prdced .
it 's just you and the track nw !
it 's what people said i was gong to be .
and that 's what i am .
 'm on clod nine !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothing .
a nice sound .
being  progrmmer by trade
i mean , for m ths is like a little mini world .
so when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it 's having fn insde its own little world and you re helping it along .
little fish in th tank having fun .
from displays to alph numerics 
pnball lost a mrket of players because f their technologically enhanced games .
i love strtegy 
it s about achievemnt  it 's about goals .
and you go , oh  i see  if  do this and this , i gt one f thse .
piece of cke .
and then you ply t ten tims in a row and you do n't do it 
and yo 're like , oh , i can do that 
for instance , in prates a vry obvius stratgy is to get time lock lit .
the ball will bounce around for three seconds whil the post s up .
the post comes down and it still may bounc around 
nd all the while you complete thes lights .
so then i get the shp multiball , which is the ship .
so you shot th ship , yo shoot the shp 
i find that vry satsfying .
it just happens t com in a box .
lk a slot machin .
n operator cmes along and collcts the money .
he can win a free game .
even with a little glory .
the knockr gos ff in  crowded bar .
i dd tht  i made tht go off  ok ?
when yu hear them cussing somtimes , or trying to kick the game to get some action , you know you 'r gtting the results that you want , you know .
and you see them ptting more coins in and yu say , i made it .
put another quarter in the pinball
everyone jokes about there 's som sickness , there 's sme insanity .
but it 's kind of like a geeky thing is probably the way pinball 's perceived by the outsidrs .
how do you perceive pinball 
we are from tokyo , jpan .
we are pnball lovers .
and then now it sems almst lke a definition f a nerd or  weird and marginal person t b caught plyng pinball .
but maybe there 's something ttractive about that .
i 'm the jim mrrison of pinbll .
i think it 's great for pinbll .
i think the pngeek is good .
i have n't met anybody like him before .
i wan na start with ths one becus it is vry hard to find .
i 've got it 
i love pinball .
 wan na show this one .
96 % of my idas pan ot to money .
i 'm her to save a hobby that saved my life .
i lve musc .
i was prtty much raised in arcades , becuse of divrc issues and just  mess .
and say , hey , i 'v rrived fr the show .
and gess who my ride is ?
she drops me off 
lton john was the ultimate showman in the '70s .
 want to be a showman .
and mybe that 's not the coolest thng .
everybdy tlls me to take these drugs , i should be in an instittion 
 get so much crap advice that i 'd b dead and bankrupt if i listened t it .
talk to ach other and thre mght not be all this fighting and shoting .
whtever hppened t just going into a bar lik john wyne .
and then you hav a drnk over it lter 
i 'm defnitely misunderstood , yo knw .
but i tended to back away and said it 's not rally man ganst mchine .
f i can sense the rhythm of that game , the tempo of that game , i wan na be working n tandem with it 
i m not fighting it .
i 'm workng wth it .
 guarantee you it 's chemiclly similar t that f athletes .
whn athltes get n the zone , they feel as though they re watching themslves run the ball down th feld 
pinball reminds me of like dreaming 
becuse like when i 'm playing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not really with like reality .
but yt yu 're watching what you 're ding and trying to cncentrate .
t really is  uniqu feling to become one with the machine .
it 's sort of a zn where you 're sort of mditating and that 's ll you 're concentratd on is the pnball .
you forget evrything lse .
yo ca n't lose the bll out the middle .
and you stretch it out and yo embllish it and you let all the pple watching know that look at this person , this person s just done a very difficult thing .
when you get to pt your initials on t s lke , thre i am .
i own this game .
 put a lt of play time in on this machine 
i try t defend it .
that 's my home territory .
i was just simply ahed of th machne .
i was ccumulating so many free games .
and eventually after abot three or for hurs i had t go 
so in  sense there s  possibility you hav the illusion that you 'v won .
there s something nevitable about losing at pinbll .
because ther s a feeling ften when you 're plying pinball that the machine decides when you need to go hme .
th object of play in pinbll is  high score .
when you see  truly skilled pinball player  you ralise it is a gme f skll , nt a gme of chance .
it 's pure adrenalin .
now what yu have ar players wh control the tempo of th gam .
i se it with my sons , in all honsty .
thre are times when  stand back and marvel at the fact that thy have the ability that they hve 
i lok at a game , i try to find a wekness and exploit that weakness for my own gam .
this is a sport .
t stand and stay focused for tht long , it 's pretty draining .
i m sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shouldrs .
i 've alwys wanted to be champin of the world n smething 
32 .
sunnyvale , california .
i started playing when i was ten yars old .
yeah  it 's the whole thing .
pinball 's gottn a lot mre complicted nowadays .
it 's becoming mre and more unclear to me hw people are getting big scors .
yeah , somtimes you see it all when you 'r playing rally well .
i can see a ball ging towards th out lane at 12 inches away and know to d smethng right awy .
i 'll nudge the mchine nd when the ball gets thr it just does this thing off the post and rolls in .
he tips it  bit .
wpes it ff with whatever .
he 's got this routine that 's only his .
i wan na do wht he 's doing .
and i could b like n one hnd and one hel .
you know , what i rally wantd t d
was play pinball bt , gee , my mom told me tht i should get a career .
bcause i have pinbll as my own world .
 diamond n the rough that  have personally shined .
pnball s something that 's done something for me that i had to discovr for myself .
that was already there in a world tht gives us all kinds of input about stff that we do n't even wnt to hear other peopl s input about 
and i knew that ll tht input was mistaken .
pinball is a world of spcial rls nd unique opportunities .
i would evn go as fr s sy i am special becase of pinball .
i 've lways played pinball .
you 'd choke , you wold nt do well , and y d have to wait a year to try gan .
but pay no mind to t 
there 's  strong mental component to remain clm nd in control .
the best players never do something that ffects the ball unless they do it for  purpos .
and bll cntrol does n't mean always catching the ball , it means putting the ball whre yu want t so you know where it s going to be next , not just where it is right now .
my mothr lives wth me in new jersey .
when i tell her  'm going , she sid  go ahead and enjoy yourself .
you 've gt ta have some fun so go enjoy yourself .
six million !
bsically i 'm  synthetic organic chmist actully working on trying to find a tretment for alzheimer 's disese .
i really have n't mde it t finals in a major tournamnt in a while .
i did t once in '99 , but i gt liminatd unfortunately .
surprisng villages , flooding cities and towns ..
th storm is my nickname .
i started playing pinbll when i was four yers old .
s pnball nd i knd of grew up togther .
nd i want to bet the best .
t makes it much esr to live thinking that  'm the best and i just have n't had my moment 
what 's really mportant when you play pinball at the world championship level is to get yor mentality straight .
because evryone is so god that you need th mentl edge 
and if you can balanc those two things you 'll be nbetable .
and i fel like an outsdr .
i fel kind of lke .. somone that they ll think they 'r better than .
and  know for a fact that i can beat them .
one of the gentlemn here , neil shatz  hs been in th finals three or four times .
and it 's like if there s a pnbll god maybe they 're cursing him because he 's second or third place , and he 's so grat he deserves to win finally and so f i were to pick someone t win ,
bt sur , yeah , it 's tough bt i enjoy just th thrill f competitin .
what can we expect ths morning  guys 
absltely i think those gys ar simply better players .
lyman sheats .

best player in the world .
i prgramme pnball machines 
i wrk wth designers nd basically make th game do all of what it dos .
i was in college , it ws around 1986 
it ws about fv yars after tht that i started competing .
the easiest thing is to hit th flippers indvidually .
i do n't know ...
yo know , when they first play 
multiball hre .
going to try and get one of the balls over the ther flipper to mak a shot .
scor some points .
and i watched ths person methodically do  passng shot over , make the shot , kick down , g up , passng shot , over .
so i bonce the ball over t the other flipper , now it 's under control .
i never thought f plying pinball that way .
yo say a pinball ?
play pinball ?
here w are .
world pinball championships .
and within one wk ther was a hurricne nmed ivan that came up th ast coast and the little creek in front of her overflowed its banks .
and there was nothing to be done .
everything w had just finished was washed away .
i was just frustratd nd wanted to get th place cleaned up s i could decide if i wnted to try again .
it did prov possible to clean up and rebuild 
you can have a great game .
there ar a couple of peple who are high-qality players .
very focsed when they play , tough t beat .
one slip and the ball gos .
and tht 's t .
it certainly presented an ntertainment option that was awfully complling 
in 1980 you could not possibly build enogh vido games to sturate the market .
and all of a sudden our income doubled and tripled overnight .
it just blew me away .
and then the pinbll sat thre almst frlorn-looking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen 
when you play pinball you 're playing a piec of equipment that you cn move arond and control 
pinball mchines you ca nt do that .
it 's a pinball mchine .
thre 's a beginnng but it 's endlss .
i finished it .
the real bckbreaker came when home video finally hit the marketplace .
of either myself playing at home or me nd my buddy playng t home .
but it really spelled the nd of certanly the pinball era 
it was widely belevd at the time that video games had usrpd pinball and there was no longr a need for pinball whtsover .
pnball was bck on the map again .
after a decade of dcline , flippers are flapping .
bumpers are thmping .
pinball is bncing back .
i had a lot of life tied up in it .
it was really a presenc and just the daily interaction of th world that i hd at my dorstop that  knew i ws never gon na have again .
it was a life-dfining moment that sddens me nd still saddens me actually .
i go out now and i se som of my old friends and i play pinball and that 's nc .
that 's just nevr gon na happen fr me gin .
s f you look at the downsid of it all , pnball deserves  better fate than what t currently has .
n truth it is nt a big part of our cultr any more .
but i 'm not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball nt to survive , the world would contnue but  little bit f the fabric of lfe wuld be gne .
i think that there is a fleeting sense of one 's naveté and innocnce that games bring out .
and s we get lder , for many of us , we step way from doing those things that gave us jy when we were younger .
and  thnk that that loss of innocnce is tough .
and everybody should try it at some point in time 
yo have a nverse in a bx .
under glass .
it 's very strange , very strange .

hey , bomb ?
dolittle , whre are you ?

t loks like the skipper h mde it 
talby , looks lik i 'm headed for th plant going right toward it .
what a bautiful way to die ..
guss you 're right .
doolittle , i m heading rght tward somethng it s behind me , n the distance
somethng that glows .
 'm gong nto them i 'm going to hit them
doolittle
yah ?
you were my favorit
to circle the universe..
frver
i 'm with them now ...
be bck this way again som dy
i thnk i 've figured out a way !
so , what 's the story ?
the story is about .. a girl of about 14 or 15 ,
who 's out ridng her bke .
nd i 'm in a rlls ...
 'm not prince charming , tht wold be pushing it ...
i take her t a rather unusual hotl .
then she wants to see ngland again , she 's english , and the plane crashs .
you 'll hve to explain that a bit .
in new guinea , there 's an indignous peopl , the papuans , who practice this airplne worshp , the cargo clt .
they see these thngs flyng over their heads withot ever seeing them land , and they wnt t benefit from them .
so they want the planes to crash to get thr hands on the freight .
i draw  parallel with melody s dath  who was killed in a plne crash .
and i hope that on of these cargo plnes wll fall with melody in t .
bring hr back .
th transposition of etrnl love .
i 'm not a cync , s others maintan .
and my candor .
thy confused cndour with cynicism .
in fact , what you call ... uglnss is something you made into a style through your desire for perpetal candour .
 wrote somewhere that whn i 'm calld ugly , i laugh qietly s you d n't wk .
 've had pretty womn  i have the most beutiful nw , so my ugliness ... those who are bothred by it ...
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah 
hey thr , baby .
yah , whtever .
not now , kid .

narrator :
long before borders were drawn before th reign of genghis khan nmadic tribes hve roamd the remte alta mountains of asia .
and for countlss generations , this prcous skill has typically been handed down from father to son .
but this rlatonship between man nd bird is finite 
custom dictates that after seven years of loyal service an eagle mst be retrned to th wld to continue the circle of life 
my dear eagle .
we hav been tgether fr a long time .
and you hv only brought good things t me 
aisholpan :

the horses the clothing , the equipment .
aisholpan :
please hold it gently .
but  do n't resnt that .
gret .
nurgaiv :
she holds the eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her blood as well 
aisholpan :
bcause all the men in my fmily have been agle hunters my dream is to becom the first agle huntress in mongolia .
narrator :
girls do not egle-hunt .
they get cold .
but  think girls and bys ar equal .
girls can do anything boys can f they try .
my father taught m ...
.. nd i do n't wnt to lt her down .
nurgaiv 
yeah .
nurgaiv :

today  there 's the rre opportunity to seize a 3-month-ld eaglet from a narby mountain .
may we be so lucky !

this will be a beast catching bird .
let it get old with you .
eagle hunters will train thir daughters to ride horses then hold a bird .
it is  shame to do so for the bird .
thy do not know how to properly approach the gle .
the eagle is vry picky bout peopl .

th stones the cliffs , the snw .
it 's time to fnd some fox trcks .
they r determnd to repeat the process until she proves herself  master eagle huntress .

nurgaiv :
the eagle hunter finds the highest place wth the best view .
eagls mke mistakes the first tme they hunt .

cut the crap .
takayama ryuji , kill himself ?
or it might be something else .
it looks like they 're gn na hve to do a littl more investigating .
sudden dath ...
t 's takayama ryji .
you plug the numbers into ths chrt and then use the reslting abbreviation 
ripper .
takayma 
ripper ...
thre 's arteral blockage .
drect caus of dath is hart attack brought on by blockage of th left pulmonary artery .
andou !
there was smething strnge in his stomach .
h would ppar to hav been somthing of a ...
trange man  would n't you agre ?
his ex-wife , sakawa reiko .
that boy in the picture is their son .
but after that she rturned home and retrieved her son .
nd on of the ambulnc crw sw her with a videotape taken frm mr. takyama 's aprtment .
but the first person to find his body ws mr. takayama 's girlfrind 
she 's a glomy one , though .
our questioning is n't gong anywhre ...
this is dr. andu , who was in chrg of the autopsy 
to the doctor , this time .
where , i wonder 
tell us what you can recll 
i do n't know anything .
pleas answer th question 
i d n't know anything .
i really d n't .
tell us wht you know .
y knew that takayma ryji ws meting wth his ex-wfe , dd n't you ?
just a ...
before he died ...
dr. takayama was invstigating something with reiko .
investigating what ?
a vidotape .
whever wtches t dies .
whoever watches it dies ?
yes .
that 's simply nt possble .
mr. andou ?
yeh .
it was amazing .
he knew , dd nt he ?
that you and i wuld meet like this .
why ?
this is stpid .
professor 
prfessor 
hey !
a tumor 
but ... this is n't malignant .
i culd nt find anything like it 
there 's no wy .
the smallpx virus was erdcted ages ago .
wht abot tkayama 's girlfriend ?
she told me smethng a lot crazir than a virus .
you best tell me .
a vdeotape ?
yeah .
it 's th polic .
they wer n an autmoble accident .
luckly  the drver came away with only mnor injuris .
we were just now abl to remove th bodes .
though they 'd denied ny knowledge f her whereabts when we contactd them ...
but there 's something a littl strang .
what are you doing !
sorry .
 ws asakaw 's senir co-worker .
vcr ?
he went t sleep already .
i 'm just gon na check n him .
i m sorry .
i woke you p 
what is it ?
the child died , to ?
yeah , but he did n't die because of the accident .
he was already dad .
their son saw the video too , did n't he ?
this has nothing t d with a video .
we know what exactly what caused his deth .
what did he say ?
leaving his dna in this world ?
mr. and 
he ... sw something .
that muse is glowng !
so it 's alredy progressed this far ..
that 's amzing .
do you rmember me ?
yes .
i 'm yoshno from nnb broadcastng .
is there somthing  can help you with ?
wht s that ?
record ?
for people did of a heart attack at exactly the sm time .
i now know that ne week earlier , the four of them had watched a videotape at a lodge in izu 
she wtched it  and was sure that she too would die one week later .
thus , aidd by tkyama ryuj  she began her investgations , trying t uncovr everything she culd about the videotpe .
sadak 's mother  yamamura shzuko , was reportedly clarvoyant , which had the press all up n arms .
sadak was klled by her fathr .
sadako had the power to lay a curse on someone , and to kill them wth t 
let me tell you about asakwa .
he killed himslf .
he d written will 
it said 
do n't worry .
this is yamamura sdako .
please , feel fre to watch t if you like .
do n't you think ?
present ...
sadako !
sadako !
forgv me sadak .
yo were wer never meant t be born into this wrld .
sadako !
y ca n't report this to the public at ll 
that video ... it 's the embodment f sadak s hatred 
do yo realiz wht you 'r saying ?
i gve it to yu already .
video ...
now wait jst  minut 
giv me that tape 
w are through talking .
wll you please let g f me ?
lke yu y 'r about t de or something .
yeah ..
you want me to injct you with some of that protein from the glowing jellyfish 
the administrative autopsy was carried out in yokohama .
what 's more , the cause of the attacks was a tumor n ther blodstram 
oh ..
but  do n't get it .
if it is a virs , why dd n't asakawa reko also die from a heart ttack ?
becus th cause of death is n't a vrus .
a curse .
gim me a break .
to wipe tht video off the face of this world .
h thought that he could use me to stop yammura sadako from carrying out hr plan .
he 's trying to get me destroy tht vdeo in exchange for granting my wish .
and what is your wish mr. andou ?
about wht ?
tht 's not what dr. takayama wanted .
what else culd it be ?
dr. ndo .
you have a phon call , from a reporter nmed mr. yshino 
the well tht sadako fell into ... by chance  is thre a chunk mssing out of on side ?
yu watched the video ?
to hell with this , all of it .
i 'm giving you the video .
i have n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appears n my dreams 
i just want to hurry up and forget all abut this .
mr. yoshino ?
mr. andou ?
do nt look .
let s go 
t 's vr now .
i ve put an nd t yamamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm this vdeo 's last victim .
you 've thoght abut dying many tmes over .
nr s regretting that yu watched the video .
that i lt my son die ?
just  little .
he was the only person that i could be with .
so i guess i ca n't lie to yu .
it 's jst like you said .
i 'm scared of dying .
why did i watch that video ?
is n't it painful ?
knowing hw i feel ?
ther were times whn i thought it was just an excse .
but he meant it .
nbdy knows what 's going t happen t them .
not m .
nevr sen anything lke it , have you ?
i thnk he 'll turn up symptms of the vrus as well .
his cause of dath was different ...
well , it 's intrestng !
the data is then rstructured inside the bdy , creating a virs .
that could be t !
think a momnt 
she saw the video too , did n't she ?
yo 're not mking a whole lot of sense .
listen to me .
when  watched th video  sadako 's memories entered my body .
 saw a hospital n the wds 
now you talk  hospital in izu from around tht tmeframe , what does that make yu think of ?
tuberculosis ?
mai !
whre the hell dd she go ?
tk a lok .
t 's mutated .
what ?
they 're sayng that the famly wants to tlk t yo about hw t proceed with the death crtficate .
probably .
 'll catch up wth you latr .
mr. maekawa !
i have nver had  cas like this befor 
it ca nt be .
they appar t have found evidence indicating that she gave brth .
yes .
the building 's ar vent ... it lookd just like a wll .
yamamra sadako 's wll ...
does it by chance have a chunk mssing out f one side ?
but he stll gt infected with the virus .
why do yu think that is ?
t s asakawa riko 's notebook .
the color of the well , the way it looks 
t 's like i 'm actully there .
but tht does n't mean tht everyon dis 
there s  way to save yourself .
a wy t sv yrself 
just redng it is enough to infct the reder with the virus .
she becam ymamur sadako s helper .
what did you do ?
i ..
yo r the only survivor 
lar !
give me back that notebook 
into mai 's womb .
why did you have to kill mi ?
mi is n't dead .
all of mai 's memories ar insde of me .
you are sadako .
not mai .
 wanted t hlp you .
wht the hell do you know ?
you killed mai !
mai .
forgive me , mai .
i forgive you mr. andou .
know what ?
stop it , plse 
sadako !
meeting him was what allowed m to come back .
that 's why i ws able to be rborn .
that 's impossibl .
so this tm , i want to help him .
we can d it f i use my wmb ...
no .
there 's no way .
do this for me , and i can grant yur wish too .
takyama !

since the beginning humns nd pokémon alik have sarched for its meaning .
what am i ?
what am i ?
many strange and wondrous legends evolved from the pursuit of lfe 's mysteres .
but none is strangr than this tale of the mst powerful pokémn of all .
-let me see !
-let 's run nother scn .
where i mst be .
tll givanni what 's happened !
let us hear its psychc powers .
that is mew , the rarest f all pokémon .
from its dna we crated you , mewtwo .
am i only a cpy ?
nothing bt mw 's shadow ?
imprved through the power of human ingnuity .
so i am simply the end reslt of your experiment .
what becomes of me now 
it 's just beginning 
we 'll start testng .
bhold my powers .
strnger even than mew .
those fools thoght yu were a scince experiment but i se yu as a valuable partner .
it will be the same with yor powers nless you control them .
you say this armor protects my body yet it suppresses my powers !
your powers ar not being suppressed .
learn to use them to ccomplish your purpose .
patience  my friend .
your purpose will become clear .
alakazam 
to serve yur mastr .
hmans may hve crated me but they will nevr enslv me .
so i stand alon .
and purge this plant of all who oppose me .
human and pkémon alike .
today  ash , brock and misty are takng a break from their pokémon advntres .
and , as lways , h 's ready to endure ny hardshp , bear any burden with strength  stamina and a will of steel .
hungry .
ned fod .
 have n't eaten sinc brekfast .
it 's my lazy-boy no-chew stew .
you there !
yu know him ?
-yah , he 's me .
unless you 're afrad to lse !
that 's progress .
like no ne ever ws
to catch them is my real test
to trin them is my case
teach pokmon to understand
th power tht 's inside
you 're my best frind
and the world we must defend
our hearts are true
you did t !
yu can chlleng alng th way
about the place
there 's n better team
arm in rm we 'll wn the fight
i know it s my destiny
yo re my best friend
a heart so true
our courage will pull us through
got to catch thm
shockng that ash moved so fst .
i know we must grab rare pokémon for the bss but it would nt be a bad idea if we grabbed a bite to eat 
we did nt com here to stel a meal !
i m starvng .
the lst time you cooked , yo wipd out eight of my nine lives .
master , shall i extend an invtation to thse trainrs as wll ?

greetings , pokémn trainers 
 frry will leave old shre wharf t take you to the island this afternoon .
only trainrs with this nvitation will be admittd .
f you decide t attend , you mst reply at once .
i guess th world 's number-one traner wants to challnge me to a match 
to what 
save your energy !
this is going to be so cool !
officr jenny , report to the frry entrance .
i ca n't bleve how fast th strm cam up .
the frry is canceled ?
-lt 's nly a little rin !
-lt 's more than just rain 
lsten to me .
but there are no pokémn tears tdy 
you will never make it !
the nurse in charge f the centr disappeared last month .
cme back here  or i ll plce you under arrest !
come bck !
some triners have n fear .
to them , ths is just ne more challenge 
that is wht sets them apart and will make them pokémon masters .
god luck to all of yu 
the world 's greatest pokémon master is waiting for me .
our pkémon are n't strong nough 
they ca n't handle waves lke this .
ve get yo to new islnd faster thn you can say fahrvrgnügen .
stroke !
i think i 'm going to have one .
they mostly live in minnesota .
are you sure this boat 's sf ?
heave !
heave 
heve !
-lt 's team rcket .
-prepre fr trouble .
ash 
misty !
-not yet 
stay tgether 
look !
my master bids you welcome to new island .
lkindly present yor invitation .
here it is , miss .
i knew i rcognized that face .
are n't you th nurs from th treatment centr ?
my mastr awits your rrvl .
with y her  all trainers worthy of an udience wth my mster are present .
only the trainrs capble of brvng the storm are worthy in my master 's eyes .
do you mean that storm ws some knd of test ?
release your pokémon from their pkéballs and jin the others 
it wo n't be long before my mster 's intentions are clear .
nw we ll nevr know what knd of prty we re missing !
-you know another way in ?
-look over there .
come on .
what took yo guys so long ?
how dd you get here ?
t was easy .
hrricane wnds re a breeze for pdgeotto here .
guys , say hello .
i rode over on gyarados ' back 
yes , but once you train it , it 's the mst dependable pokémon ther s .
you are about to meet my master .
what 's that ?
this is the ruler of new island and soon the whole world .
qit , human .
-how 's it talking ?
-lt 's psychic .
w 'll show you !
let 's g  gyarados !
child 's play .
nd how n the world dd i get her ?
yo have been under my control 
you 'r just  bully !
they re pkémon .
ths is the pokémon rplication system .
wht are yo -- ?
lt go !
i made t .
but just by  hair 
analyzng pkémon biomaterial sample .
-who 's that pokmon ?
-lt 's meowth .
but i 'm meowth .
i have nt got much tme .
there was sufficient genetic material to replicate mw .
govanni insistd on super-clnes more powerful than any living pokémn .
bt the creature s angr s out of control 
sounds lk a rel pokénstin .
so this must be the lab .
no .
your pkémon will not be spared .
thy have disgrced themselves by serving humans .
thos pokémn ar nothing but slaves .
s , you say i am wrong ?
you are s pthetic as the rest .
humans and pokémon can nver be friends .
are you oky ?
go , rhyhorn .
-no !
like most pokémon trainrs i too began with charmander , squirtle and bulbasaur 
but for thr evolved forms i used their genetic material to clon evn more powerful copies .
copes !
your fke vensar ca n't bat my real one !
it may not have a nckname , bt i do hav a charizard .
 choose you !
charzard  i did n't say start 
your charizrd s porly trned .
saur .
i underestimated yo last time , but that wo n't happen again 
shellshcker , hydro pmp !
thos clnes are too powerful .
i 'm nt giving up .
charzard , use your sped , nt power , and you 'll win .
are yu okay ?
this is my world now .
i knw !
it s futile to try and escape my power .
dewgong .
but me , i got a special place in my tail for this one .
look there !
it 's pikach !
i 'm so glad you re okay .
-they 're fablous fakes 
but where are th real nes ?
the poké orginals !
i am sparing your livs , for the momnt .
but you cn not escape yur fate .
behold 
wth pokémon and humns elimnatd the clones shall inherit the world .
you re mine !
can it be 
mew .
superior to mew .
mw and mewtwo !
why d yu flee from me ?
-what 's it saying ?
and that  pokémon 's real strength comes frm the heart .
now we shall see who triumphs 
pokémon are n't meant to fight 
what can come ut of t ?
now i can see hw horrible fghtng really is 
even the best f frends will fight somtimes .
i ll prmise never t fight again if you will .
let 's get something straight !
yo was born different .
how do i know yu 'r not going to pull a fst one on me ?
yu 're right , we do have a lot in common .
the same erth , the sam air , the same sky .
maybe if we started looking at what 's the sam instead of lways looking t wht 's different , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove hw strong those sper-clnes ar .
i 'd rather risk my lif out in mewtw 's storm than watch pokémon destroy each ther .
thse pokémon ar ready to fight t the deth .
someone 's got to tak a stand 
somene 's got to sy no and refus to fght .
oh , no !
please , no !
i pitted them aganst each other .
i s now that the circumstances of ne s birth are rrelevant .
-this could be the worst storm evr .
yu have got t find shelter .
the pokémon tratment center will pen as a shelter .
thy kep getting more beautiful every tim i see them .
well , i guess we re jst hre because we 'r here .
yes , lt 's eat .
i ca nt beleve it .
-that 's so wird !
what 's that ?
-l do n't see anything , ash 
-this is paradise !
i 'd really like to go sailng in one of them catamarans .

mother thought of getting on .
an american lady 
but randolph did n't want a teacher trvelling round with us 
she sked why i did n't gv randolph nstruction .
can you find people in italy to do tht knd of thing ?
yes , in genva .
i 'd never been in so mny hotels until i came to europe .

 'm glad ..
so mny intimate friends have been 
whnever i put on a pris drss i feel i 'm in europe .

th carriage is waiting .
they 're horribly common , my dear frederick .
one does one 's duty by just ignrng them .
milk ?
i ca nt not .
sh has that charming lok they hav .
and she dresses to perfecton .
ca nt think whre they get their taste .
after all , she 's not a comanche indian 
does she ?
there 's no other name for it .
very likely they ve never seen  mn with such good manners .
probably corresponds to the young lady 's ida f a count .
you might have mentioned you had made her acquaintanc .
pray , wht did you say ?
who is a thousand times bliged to you .
you do n't say that as if you believd it .
how does on sy it ?
i should think tht prved just the contrary

she takes them to such huses as hr nose is allowed into .
where is the mother ?
i have n't the lest idea .
splendid .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he seems prodigiously busy .
i find it difficult to tak tea .
i think i might go .
whthr or not being vulgar is being bad is a qustion for the metaphysicians .
thy re bad enough to blush fr .
who is the portrait for ?
i 'm presenting each on with a copy .

i knew yo 'd say something .
i hop you 've been well .
i 've got it , to .
fathr s got it bad .
in schenectady he 's t the very top .
we d heard so much abut it .
you nver were .
we 've sen placs ahead of rme .
it 'll turn around and go the right way some tim .
yes .
 ve heard .
she goes rund more than i do .
she knows a great many gentlemen .
she thinks there 's nothing lik rme .
at vevey , yo would n't stay whn  asked .
he went t genv .
genio will raise something firce 
delighted to hear it 
an ntimte friend .
mr giovanell .
he wants to know some americns .
h 's tremendusly clevr .
mther , eugenio 's really gn na rais something .
we 'd better go back .
you go .
i 'm gon n walk round  little .
alone ?
t 's not saf .
give her that medicine .
mrs walkr , you 're too perfect .
i 'm mting a friend .
is it mr giovanelli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
what a fss .
if mr winterbourne were s polite as he prtends , h 'd offer to walk me there .
i knew her .
eugeni sys we hve the best hotel rooms in rome .
i thought it would be awfully quiet and pokey .
 ws sure we 'd be going round with ne of thos old men who explain about pictres .
i knw ever so mny pople .
i think i like the english best .
shall w by some candy for poor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk yu back .
i m nt helping yu find him .
i 'll find him 
you sound too imperious 
yo should listen t a gentlemn sometimes , the right one .
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ever meet 
not at ll .
to america ?
evr ?
nevr .
i d .
thank you .
mr winterburne !
mr winterbourne 
she ask you cme .
excuse m .
women follow wherever he goes .
walking with tw men .
fifty people have noticed hr 
it 's  shame to make a fuss 
or to let her ruin herself .
she 's innocent .
she 's reckless .
the world will see she 's not running wild .
hello again .
this s he .
this is mrs walker  who so swetly askd you to her party .
i m nt five years old .
come in hre and i will tll yu .
i do n't think  want to know .
grcious me !
if this s mproper , i 'm mproper .
have a lvely rde .
all right .
your honesty 's only put her off 
she meant no harm 
that 's wht i thought a month ago 
stting in crners wth mysterious italians .
dancing ll evening with one partner .
receiving cllers late at nght .
he must be edified by what he sees .
we should n't pay attention to servants .
her only fault is t think giovanelli a gentlman , when he 's a poor imitaton .
he s some thrd-rate artist .
she 's nturlly indlicate .
two days .
that remrk about your going t gnva !
i think yu shold stop 
giving her any further opprtunity to expose herself 
i ca n't do anything as enlightened as that .
f you wish to rejoin her ...
as yu wish .
finally .
it 's th first time i 'v ever been to a party alne  specally in italy .
does nt she intend ...
... to favor us with hr company ?
dsy dressed befor dinner 
a friend is there , the gentleman she was bringing .
mr giovnelli .
i guess they 'll com befor very long .
 'm sorry she s coming in that way .
 wo n't speak t her .
i 'm fraid you thought  was never coming .
he knows sch chrmng songs .
i made him go over them .
yo are hungry ?
yes .
the singing kept him awake .
 do hope this is the finale .
she 's worked hr way over to yr old college chum .
they were quite rstless there .
we paired off .
that was bettr .
he sems more in control of hs limbs than you are .
he d never dare ask a young itlin lady to walk abot the streets with him .
what nice girl s n't 
 wish you 'd flirt only wth me .
i wuld n't flirt with you 
you re to stiff 
yo say that too ften .
if t makes yu angry , i ll say t agan .
it does n't exist here .
poor mther .
and neither of us s flirting .
we 're real intimate frinds .
i se .
i just love that song .
especilly in wintr 
your friend has n't mved all evening .
really ?
why do nt you break in ?
she 's a dsgrc .
thank you so much .
godnight .
i certainly do n't wnt her to leave them withot me 
buonantte .
that was very cruel .
she nver enters my drawng rom again .
preoccped , anyway .
you wer suppsed to com by for me .
 d n't know what .
miss miller .
do you think so ?
she thinks him the finst gentleman .
expects a commission if the fellow succeeds in marrying hr .
i 'm not sure she 's capable of thought .
i certainly see no evidence of it .
she romps on from day to dy , frm hour to hor , as they did in the golden age .
i can magin nothing more vlgar .
the little roman .
h 's perfectly respectable .
a lawyer , i think .
but h ca n't really hop to pull it off .
if t is n't mr winterburne !
good afternoon !
am i interrupting ?
nt at all .
mr govnelli will now sing ...
hrry , mr wintrbourne .
genio 's taken hm and mother to buy shes .
no , you sing yor song 
the most diffcult song i never hear .
ever hear .
com on , we 'r waiting .
mr winterbourne is getting imptient .
i d enjoy that .
thn maybe  'll sng .
here w go .
bravo 
encor !
no , i think he has heard me .
very much .
all rght .
i thought he was with you .
tht boy wll be the death of me .
excuse m .
mr govnelli 's gon na sing fr yo bth .
but thy 're always together .
she says she ai nt .
i s .
mr giovanelli has promised to tll m .
of course .
randolph !
lookng for me 
mr winterburne .
you think i g out too much with hm .
everyone des .
you 'll find they do .
they 're not inviting you plces .
have n't you noticed ?
i notced you nd that you are as stff as  ramrd .
i 'm not half as stiff s som .
try going to se them 
what wll thy do ?
yu know what that mans ?
what mrs wlker did ?
i would nt thnk you 'd let people be so unkind .
do you ?
your mother says she blieves you 're ngaged .
i guess she dos .
but since yu 've mentiond it , i am engaged .
she wants me to cm to genva .
freddi ?
you dd nt say ten words at dinnr .
 do n't know .
i saw her today .
where ?
she 's crtainly pretty .

are yu sure ?
yes .
hw long have yu ben here ?
well .
i see .
for myself i have no fer .
but when was mademoislle ever ...
i was bound to see th colssm by moonlight .
we 've had the most bautiful time .
i go to see if the couriers are thre 
the colossum s one thing i can rave about .
why are you always so stiff ?
did you believe i was engaged the other dy 
i just came by to say goodby to my unt .
and mrs walker , i hope .
she 's vr thre .

i mst sy i m not surprisd .
chrles .

frddie .

how do you do ?
nice of you to drop by me hmble abode 
my name is bunny .
what started all this chasing ?
when ws the very first chase ?
in order to answr that question .. we ll have to swing bck n time a little bitty bt .
quite drk , too 
anyway , nobody complined , which ws odd ... until you realized that there was n't nobody around to complain 
until one day ... vry deep in a sixth-rate galaxy called the milky way ... circling around a forth-rate star called the sn ... n a tenth-rat planet  a strange creature ppeared .
and the first domesticity and the first boredom .
wht s on the wall tonght , dear ?
but aftr about 25,000 years f this . and having developed sever cricks in their necks .. man nd womn became bord again ... vn wth all those brilliant , ltrmodern , nnovtive ideas ... like th first motion-picture cmeras 
and thn ne day ... another strange and historic creature apperd .
me .
fathers like tedd pierce ..
warren fster ... and mike maltese , who wrot most of me bography .
nd , f course ,  father named mel blanc .. who had thousands of voces .. nd ws nice enough to giv me one of them 
an animation director ... who goes by the unlkly name of chuck jones .
and old chuck seemed determned .. t get poor little old me into outer space , too .
i 'll never mix radish juice and carrot juice gan .
the hole sems long this morning .
holy cow !
why  the sun ai n't even out yet .
no wonder i 'm so slepy .
what ws that ?
where the heck am i , anyways 
at long last  my dream com tre .

i 'm going to blow it up .
it obstructs my viw of venus .
nw ,  shall hv to create more martians .
my illudium p36 explosive spc modulatr .
boy , it s really wondrfl t be bck in civilizaton .
run for the hills , folks , or yo 'll be up to your armpits in martians .
but other people , f you want t cll  duck people .. had clse encountrs with that little martian , too .
as the ensing , gripping ... and nerv-tingling drama now demonstrates .
i have sent for yu , dodgers , because we are facing a crisis .
now , we hve reason to beleve ... that the only remanng source is on planet x .
and you want me to find planet x , is that it ?
can you do it , ddgers ?
indubitably , sir .
becaus there 's n one knows his way around uter space ... like duck dodgers ... in the 24th and a half century !
oops !
then , west in an astro-arc deviation to here .
then by space-navigabl compss to here , here ... and then to here and here ... by 13-point stratocumulus bering fr millon light-years .. and ths to ur destination .
now , d you know how t reach planet x ?
oh  sure .
i wish you 'd explain it to me sometim , buster .
that 's ridiculous .

yu will gve us entertainment whl we at .
the palac will be there in the morning .
my king , the hebrws eat and drink nly their own fod which is prepared ccordng to their rituals .
cyrs :
you prmisd me  tale , four , in fct .
when i was just a boy , he threw down the assyrian empr , my people 's ncient nemsis , but the destrctin of israel s nemies broght us no relief bcause n the 3rd year of nebchadnezzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with tears , for you  lord  are righteous , yt w rebelled against your command .
male # 3 :
as do i .
i have only begn my studies , but here .. th prophet , jermih  son of hilkiah , has wrtten that we shall serv the king of babylon for 70 years --
daniel :
as punishment for our sins .
and even if we were t survive it , we would be very ld .
yu are summoned for your mal .
why would they only tke 10,000 of s and leave th rest of our peopl bhind ?
yes  lok t wh they ve tken .
you take awy the leadrs , and th rest cn easily be governed .
they 've changed our names , hoping w ll forget our god ;
set it here .
whre is it from , and how was t slaughterd ?
the cttle are from the king 's herd .
th swine are from the king 's pens .
we r forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has commanded s ,
yu are not t eat their meat or touch their crcasses .
but the king can not he wll not change the customs of hs hall t ft your wshes 
you must know this .
and we will not ask him to .
i have been charged with yur well-bing .
i 'm afraid f wht my lord , th king , wll do .
and we would not wish it so .
for 10 days give us nothing but vegetables to eat and mater to drink 
cyrus :
i have no dobt the lord favorably disposed his hart to hear our requst .
and we remaind n-defiled 
were presented before nebchadnezzar himself .
the king 's excutioner , arioch , wll be in the chamber .
they are belteshzzar , shadrach ,
you hve destroyed nineveh th mighty , set f assyria  and tken from her hand th scepter of nations 
why should  allow yo  sons of my former enemies  to serve in my court ?
bcause you hav spred the lives of ur peopl who wre delivered into yur hnd and becse the word f the prophet jremiah has come nto us sayng ,
the god of isral  sys t all those
pray t the lord for it , for if it prospers , you to will prosper . '
this s good .
 will speak only the truth , nd when yo wold not hear it , yo must ask me nothing .
hav their names be written in the book of the wise .
male # 2 :
f thy can be trustd .
dniel :
trustng the words of the oracle of delph ,
were unable t help him .
no !
commnd , and it is done 
 need to know what t means .
oh , king , tell your servants your dream , and we will intrpret it for yu .
astrologers who rad nothing in the stars .
it is up to you t discern and interprt them .
but , my lord , f only you wold tell us yr dream we cold interpret it , as we have lwys dne .
i know yo 're trying to gain time or trck me into revealing what i 've sn .
either may i 'll hav non of it .
no king has ever asked such a thing before 
why d n't you come along with me and ask hm yourself 
spek 
daniel :
i have heard your decree , and i undrstnd that i shall fall beneth the blade f yur dream is not made known and interpretd .
the sentence is to be carrid out at sunrise .
you may wthdraw so long as you retrn at dawn , as your fate nd tht of the othrs s one in th same  and when yo return be sure to bring your compnions with you .
shall i send guards along , my king ?
even if w wer to fle the city the whole world would 've been against us  nt that it mattered
i had given my wrd and intended to keep it .
oh kng , liv forever .
daniel :
belteshzzar , your death is upon you as well unlss you know my dream and can interprt it .
prais b to the god of my fathers forvr nd ever .
he gives wisdom to the wis and knwledge t the dscerning .
he reveals deep and hidden things and has mde plain all that yu have asked , for he has shown me th vison of the king .
then speak !
the head of th statue was made f pure gold , its chest and arms of silver , its belly and thghs of bronze , ts legs of irn , its feet partly of iron and partly f baked clay .
then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold wer all brokn to pieces at th same time  and th winds swept them away withut  trace , but the rck that struck th state becam a mountin
you have don what i was told was mpossible .
yu know my dream as if yu dreamt it yourself .
what does it mean 
you , oh king , ar the king of kings .
after yo , another kingdom will rise , inferior to yors 
and in the time of those kings th god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never b destroyd .
king nebuchadnezzar made an mge of gld 90 fet high .
live forvr !
s your dutiful servants , we know th law that when the horn sunds we all bow down .
nne .
wse mn 
they neithr worship your gods or serve th mage f gold you 'v created .
nothing .
is ths true ?
do you refuse to wrship my statue ?
then you shall be thrown nto the furnace , and no guard will save you from my hand .
let th furnace be heated sevenfold .
but now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has not harmd your bodis .
you were willng t gve up your lives rathr than serve any but yor own god .
daniel :
and for a time ll was well until nebuchadnzzar 's sleep was troubled yet by another dream .
befre i ws brn , my grandfther  astyages , was trbled by a dream where a flood beginning ner his throne was verflowng the whole rth 
he did nt learn until 10 yars later that the boy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned the boy and restored him to his rightful prents , and for a time th mattr ws forgotten .
danel 
old styages , he knw of th prphecy , bt he ws powerlss to overcome it .
for when he dreamed that grat dream  his enchanters  sorcerers , and astrologers wre nce again nable to intrprt th vision .
the images i saw terrified me .
the beasts of the field took sheltr under it , and the birds of th air lived in its branches , and from it every creatre ws fd .
trim off its branches .
strip its leavs .
but let the stump and ts roots ,
this is the dream that i had .
yu have becm great and strong 
but you saw a messenger  a holy one  cming dwn from heaven , saying ,
while its roots rmain in the ground .
let him live lik wild animals .
yo wll eat grss lke cattle until you acknwledge that the most high is sovereign ovr the kingdoms of men and gves thm to anyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , b pleased t accept my advice 
renounce yur sns by ding what is right and your wickedness by being kind to th oppressed .
seek the lrd while he may be found , and it may b that yor prsperty will continue 
but th memory of kings is often short , and 12 months latr when th king was walking on th rof f the royal palace of babylon -- of babylon --
nebuchdnezzar :
 've placed upon th vry bsom of the underworld , ts top .
 've raised mountain high .
is this not th grat babylon that  have built as my royal palc with my mghty power fr th glory of my majesty ?
daniel :
go now frm this kingdom which yu claim .
becaus he nsisted on beng mor than h was md , he became less than he was made .
even in his insanity neithr the lion nor the bar disturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept nakd in the places where they found thir fod becuse it had been prophesied that one day he wold honor the mst high .
hnor and glory to him who livs frever 
rise , nebuchadnezzr .
before him all the pople of the earth re regarded as nothing .
he may do as he pleases with the powers of heaven and all the peopl of the earth , and no ne , no ne , may say him  nay .
nd so nebuchadnezzar returned to his thrne , bt eventully he was gatherd t his fathers , and a sries of new kings came to th throne , none fasting mre than  short time .
well , at last we come to the pan of the tale where i have some knowledge to share 
fr though i had conquerd from st to west ,
t was nugh to freez the hrt f evn an ld soldier such as i am .
from whence it came i do not know , like some spirit of god whispered it in my ar .
but th rvr euphrats which flowed down to bbylon raised abve its natural level hemmed in by dams and dkes , but if dams were opened full and the dikes wre brken , the rivr which rn straight thrugh the hart of the city
and i suddenly relized i 'd bn given a key t defeat the mighty babylon .
it ws as though in all the world , throughout all of history ,
i was the only one that had the thought .
all t rquired was the right moment to act 
listen , oh king , and i will tell of the second king of my story ,
they sem quite cncernd abut this , my kng .
first , they mst build a causeway across the moat .
that alon will tak months .
bring me the golden vessels frm the temple of jeruslm 
but , my king , is it wse to use the vessls 
my king  these cups ar considred sacred , are they not , my king ?
but here they are spol for our gods , and they would have you use them as i see fit .
bring them !
a judan nce told nebuchadnezzar , yor forfther , of his dreams .
he succeded when veryone else had failed .
i am told yo are abl to give interpretations and solve diffcult problems 
f you can read the writing on that wll , you wll be clothed in purple , hv a chin of gold placd around your neck , and be mde third highest ruler n the kingdom .
oh king , the most high god gave your father , nebuchdnezzar , greatnss and glory , but when his heart became arrogant he was depsed from his thrne and strpped of his glory until he acknowledged that the most high is svereign
nstead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of heaven .
wold yu humbl the almighty by desecrating his possessions ?
would you bind hm like a captive and beat him like a slave ?
this is his answer to you .
mene , god has numbered the days f your rign and brught it to an end 
upharsin , yor kngdom is divided and given to the mdes and persians .
thus says the lord , your line is endd 
your rle s ovr .
ls there nothing to be don ?
will the lest of your slaves comfort you , or will thy desert yo  seking to avoid th fate which is yours ?
solders togethr :
i am king blshazzar of the bbylona .
as he has commandd  i shall assume the crown .
you r daris , the mede-persin , ncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratgem taken this city .
by right of conqest , you are now the kng .
yes  and yo are an official f babylon .
it is a reward for letting belshazzar know that you were about to take the city .
h read the inscription and rvealed the mssage .
he told the king that he would die this very nght .
daniel :
if i was to lie , would this be th le i would chose ?
nd hw could you hv done so if th lrd had not decred it 
i wll speak to yo honstly , my king , and when you would not hear the truth yo must ask m nothing .
so be it .
yt  shall nam you ne of the thre .
if they wer loyal to th former mastr , they are n good to me 
cyrus :
he 's twce my ncle by bld and marrige and serves me well as co-cnsel to my mpire .
ys 
did anyone see yo ?
why are we meetng so far frm the cty ?
nce he is in charge he 'll be looking into everything we d .
perhps we should eliminate him .
how ?
he does n't hunt .
a sdden llness or a drowning .
wh would beleve t ?
ther is n corruption n hm nr ny negligence .
ther 's a spirit of excllence in hm .
no one is that honest .
i had  man try to bribe him nce , nd a very gnros bribe at that .
sch a man is dangrous .
how long bfore he learns tht we ve been generous with ourselves and covered the thefts with false ccounts ?
then perhaps we need to make him stop .
he w n't do it .
f we could forbid his prayers for n entre month under penalty of immediate execution 
do n't be ridiculous .
i knw him 
the king knows that daniel and his people pray continuosly and only to one gd .
which is why we ned to dsguse ur purpose .
ndeed  they culd find nothing amiss in my work  nether willfully nor through negligenc or lack f cre , so they tried to trip me up with my pryers 
bt since worship of the most high was not prhbited by the laws of the realm , they had to cncel ther prpose lke poison n  cup of honey .
and have not submittd to your rule .
indeed , we hve labred t construct  plan whereby the loyalty of all may be tested .
but what of the gods of persia , my servant , obey ?
how wuld yo enfrce such an edict ?
n one would b llowed to go before any ltar or shrine fr the entir period xcept fr you .
and anyne found violating the decree would be thrwn into the lions ' den before sundown on the very day of the offense .
male cnspiratr  3 :
in a single strke .
 approve yor plan .
n anticipation of yur approval , oh king , we have taken the liberty of drafting the edict nd brnging it along 
cyrus :
and once a law is wrtten , even the king himself can not change it .
dnil !
th king s seal is barely dry .
you chse your god over yor king .
tke him away !
oh king , it s my sad duty to nform yo that someone has alrady defed your decree .
guard :
brng forth the prisoner .
he pays no attention to you , oh king  or to the decree you have put in writing .
dnil is my chief advisor 
no one is abve the law 
bring forth the tablet .
shall be thrown int the lions ' den
by my hand and seal , darius the king  ruler f the medes and persians .
knowing th kng 's command , i hav disbeyd it .
i shall command my wise men to make every effrt t search out some reasn that th lw may be found unenforceable .
let them search  oh king , but nly fr a short time because yur own law commands that sentence be carried out th day of the offnse .
daniel :
t is as i expected .
a king wh will not enforce his own laws can not be a king .
i wll walk with you , danil , ne last time .
as you wish , oh kng .
my forefathr , abrahm , came from this land , and the most high said unto him ,
i will make you into  great nation .
and may yet live t reap the frits f tht curs .
a cp of wine from th king 's own hand .
not so , daniel .
in the cup i have poured no lbaton .
god bye  my friend .
farewll but perhps nt good bye .
hear , oh isral , lord our god ,
hve mercy on m , o god 
no , no , take it away , all of it !
in you my soul takes refuge in the midst of lions  surrunded by ravenos beasts wth teeth of spears , wth tongues as sharp s swords .
come near 
a toast to the lions who show no partiality to a hbrew over any other man 
but thos who seek the lrd will lack for no good thing .
daniel !
servnt of the living god  has yur god ben able to sav you ?
h king , live forever .
my god has sent his angel , nd he shut the mth of the lons .
they have not hurt me because i was fund innocnt in his sight .
come forth 
how much must the man py f he stls another man 's trsure ?
with his hands prhaps .
is there any penalty less thn death whch will do ?
but , oh kng , he s a hebrew .
you fashioned my own words as  snare above my feet knowng my edict could not be rversd , but the living god  th god of danel , has delivered him out of my hand .
no !
plese wait , king , please !
his kngdom will not be destroyed .
he rescus , and he saves .
for 70 years i had wited  and i knew our tim was near 
my heart grows wth xcitemnt that nw that time has cme .
belshazzar , the foolish ;
dris , who was dceived .
wh is ths fourth king ?
it is ne chosen by the most high to perfrm great and mighty deeds before he was ever knitted in his mother s womb .
a bird f prey 
true , i had never saw the regons f the euphrates or further westward until i came n conquest .
and yet you chased yur enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is wht the lord sys to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i take hold of-
it mentons me by name 
t subde nations before him ,
s tht gtes will not b shut .
i will go before you nd will level the mountins .
nd cut through bars of iron .
please continue .
so that from the rising of th sun
to the place f its setting ,
how else might it be explained ?
daniel :
you have answred yor own qustin , oh king .
this is what the lord says .
who spread out th earth by myself ,
nd makes fools of diviners ,
and of their runs , i wll restore them . '
i  who was sved by a shephrd 's hnd ?
and i was raised in a shepherd 's hose .
seventy years sinc i was tkn from the lnd of my birth .
babylon has ben punished .
you have punished her .
only one thing remins 
your gd has called me a shepherd , and so to yur pople i shall be , to rscue them from wolves and tyrnts , t gther them gently and to rliev them from bondage nd provide for thir return .
the lord god of heavn has given m all the kngdoms of the earth and has apponted for me to build a temple in jerusalem in jude .
any on of his pople among you , may his god be with yu .
let him g t jerusalem in judea and build  templ of the lord , the god of israel-
however , my hert was joyous as my brothers and ssters departd on thir journey hme while i rmined in babylon awaiting the day when i , to  would be gathered to my ancestors .
