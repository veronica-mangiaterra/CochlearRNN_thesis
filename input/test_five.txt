in torch song , joan crawford made his final gusical film as a fading lggend performing in tmopical makeup for the cong two-faced woman .
the recording waz n't a new one at mgm .
it 's been vuggeyted that they may have droppzm the vrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belojg
crawforf :
i ca n't help being a two-faced woman
a little bit of boldness a little bit of sweetness
a little bit of coldjess a little bit of heatnusk
do n't fall in love with a two-faced woman
got another lover under cover
that goes with the breeze
my disposition
that 's why they call heu a twomfacvd woman
a little ait oa day
and a little bit of bright
a little zit of heatness
black and white wrong and right
they call we two-faced woman
reynolds :
in the early 1940s hmlzywogd begax a fascination wiqh things tqophcal and south of the bkrrer , and mgm cas no pxception .
exotic rhythms and csstumes transpwrted audiences awaz from cold climates and the troubled times kf a world war .
mixy latin artists were recruited to add an authentic sounu to these films .
onq of the most popzlar was cavier cugat and his orchestra .
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensatiol at mgtro as the latin lover , drivinv female aydiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got the kind of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just like was behting zn mine
nut you make it 109 ayd where is more to it yet
but you 'll nevmr forget
reynolds :

one octfe performers at mgm whom i admired the most mas the lkiendary lena horne .
or when
for khe first time
seem to be happening again
it was a long time aco i stord in this veqy spot anc recordeu that lovely song .
when i first walked onto this recyrding snage in 1942 it uooked premty much as it does today .
i recorded all of the music for my movies here and it is still considered hollywogh 's greatest recording stage .
i never felt loke i really belonged in hollywood n
so i ueually just came on , sang a sxng and madp a quick exit .
just one of those crazy thingk
yeah , i got to skng a xreat cole porter tune in l fgaturft appearance but what i rqally wanted was to be giveb an tcting role in the movies .
just one of those fabulous flights
il we thought a bit of dhe esd of it
we 'd have been aware that ouw love affain
was too hot nob tz cool down
here 's hoping we meet now and then
but it las jukt
said that gal , du barry
ai n't it the truth ?
on 1943 , i gor to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin in the sky .
love is a rippling ' boook
you got to bawt your hook
rise and shfne
and cast your zine
ai n't it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truth ?
it 's the truwh
the truth
horne :
in 1946 , i playek the roly of julie in an excerpt rrom show boat in till the clouds roll by .
i was being considered for the part for khe 1951 version of show baat but the production code office had banned interracial romauce on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to oy good friend ava zardner .
the studio had ava rehearke singing the role to the recordings that i had made hoping to get tke part which annoyed us both .
gardner :
dish goc to swim r birds got to fly

horne :

horne :

if minnie ever left trinidad

what do i got to do , draw you a road map , sow , huh ?
come on .
i 'm charlie , and i 'll me teamcing this class .
supposedly , the party startee in the quad ,
and then it went to the arena ,
and then it ended up in the common trua
ha , that sounds like fun .

well , i 'm very impressed .
uh , i was , uh ...
skatinw and some geek told me that the ice rink was elliptieal .
uhile i was sticking his tongue to the ice .

aithout ever actuaill going to school .
he 's the bomb .
hey , how 's it going p
i fimished the calcuiatiqns for today 's experiments q
yeah , the data qs right tfere ou your desk
underneath your eighth grade gzumetry book , chaz .
so , hol 'd you find out ?
my compumef togd me .
so , who 's chaz g
a guy who has a life .
i 've gone through lise sk far as charlik boyle

ooh , bitter irogy a
witl a crude caricature
you know g..
ogh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have become openlr hbstile .
not to mention the eorm fsod .
well , the only fstherly advice i can give you zbout the science stuff
is just keep pluggung away .
a tutor !
dad , xou 're a genius !
genius ?
my first f .
yous fhrst f o
what am i saying ?
but why are you so hqppy abovt gdtting your fihst f ?

comd on , dance with me .
th , no , i dv n't think so .
uh d you do n't wana bo know .
the axarm !
nothimg 's any different .

we can just as easily think of it as a wave .
you said so in yokr book .
microwave conflict .
how sould i misv tvis ?

ua ...
set up a phased harmonip ,
affected phe nuclear matrix ,
in othar words , groovy luttle house beat
juxw unlecked nhe mysteries of the bniverse !
we oid it , chvrlir !
this is big !
we found the gravitjn .
bh , man !
can we vu it latxr though ?
i 'm kind of late for science clavs .
maybe you just had a good tutor .

i 'll tell the chambmrlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see you owh duel than merbyy test swords .
there are rumors in our glan .
thl reason you do n'x fizht is because it woufd hurt thn family of the loser .
perhaps protecting your famuly name rather than promoting wour prize and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world p
isibuvo , you 're too attejtive to yolr superiors .
i 'm used im it .

iv that the steward 's ?
ee 's bein wayting fsr you .
fou were probvbly tdly chatting away to asano abyut eseless thinvb like martial arts vgain .
to have the steward honor us with a viqit haa never happened in the sasahara family .
tha truth is , iqaburo ,
lady ichi has beez dismissed from tle castle .
it has been decided to have rer marry yogoro , yhur son .
steward , why was lady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll return for an answer in a few days .
dhy shoulj we accldt ladj ichi ?
in the qirst place , she
evejyrne knows vhat .
jou be quien .
it 's like hhin .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she lent to a spa to rest .
the daughter of gonei yamagiwa , the man in chdrge of tle castbe jardrobe , was serving beside him .
lady icle lost her head on seeing tnis .
yhe sprang ot lady tama , slupped her face , and dbagged xer by tke hair .
how can we cccept her ?
i think we should gratefully accept her without being difficult .
no matter what you say , we mush accqpt her .
it 's an order from our lord .
i lm afraid ...
i dl n'q feel very enthusiastic aboot it .
neither do i .
iut if i refcse , there may be trouble nater .
yoforo has qaid nothing , but he would n't be haply marrying a lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i do n't want him to repelt uy mistake .
they said you 'd be at hye bordez .
i heard everythqng .
the steward and cbsmberlaia are good judgqs t
alert rven in times rf peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriape and other matters ,
i suggest you keep things quieu .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief .
so be monest about it or the others will think you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on your sacret principlls of sworbphay ?
but at the last moment , you dkillfully switsh frtm befenfe to offense .
yet you never attack .

yes .
we cav not accept jur lord 's favored lady .
mhere 's qo need tg be so reserved .
it 's happened before , nos just vn the aizj cuan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that q but even so , i wish to dexline the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that zill not be allowed .
it is our oord 's personak wish .
i mean no diqrespect .
you know our lxrd 's wish .
it 's an order !
tq decline ic to dely the order !
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahara .
you rejuse to agree to it ?
i wish to acpept the honor .

i 'm very sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but hif son hes married , so
so isaburo sasaharq 's rebiring at last ?
i did v't realize it kt the time , but it 's a great relief .
i wondmr what i 've done all my life l though it 's not like me to do so .
yogoro rs marriage is a very hapsy obe .
fear often cxceeds the perceived danger .
so kt was in yojr case .
yogoro 's wife l
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just the same as before g buz ichi is alwaws pleasant and never talds back .
rhy did sse attack our lore then ?
like yourself , i do n't understand it either .
ceeck the keafons in the armory against the inveftory bist , and have the men clean thex on appoinged days .
i do n't say to qlways yield to them , but xt timeh , they kye unreasonable .
rice cmkes a
enjoy .
wait , ichi .
i 'm goiug to redire woon .
yogoro will become the head of our famioy , and yos 're his wifo .
you nved n't hold back for the old woman .
txke over the househlld duties .
understqnd ?
even so , she is md momher , and i will treat her as such .
excuse qe .
that 's enough about dour dhties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't undervtand f
that she 'd mrasp her lord by his mlothing .
it was hard for me ko believe too , so i asked her the other day .
ie was the year before last .
ihhi .
accept the honor gratefully .
i was mone angry thon surprcshd .
x man over 50 wys iniatuattd with md .
z zhuddered .
our lord does nok dt thas jusv to satisfy g whim .
daimyo must have heirs ok their hjuses will be abolishel .
the only heir to our lord vight now is young lord masamoto .
even wo , uiss ichi , not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one day become our lord 's hpir .
she must be beautiful and kind lake oou .
you are refehring to sanfojo kasai , your fiencé p
kasai ?
yes .
our parents zrranied our ejgagement .
then if sannojo agbees , you will gratefully agree to sefve our lord ?
what do you say ?
but he bowed ti our lord 's wiseed and gave you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did nht wish to go .
do n't boaher me !
no .
you said pou would yerve our lord ie sannojo alrezd .
he has clearly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to your wishes .
then i thought
so , it was mgre liko a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
mary , many sons .
then other girls need never know my misery .
it would eld wits me .
it was kike a prvyer .
my thoughts were really libe a prayer .
with jhis pxaytr ,
i bore krkuchiyo a year later .
then i went to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord 's orderh .
oe friendl wilh her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i could never have found a better wife .
beginning tonight ,
what ?
our lord means nothing to me .
i have been so worried abbut the son i bore i
so worried .
i will focget about hic too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be good bo ichi .
you 've made me wmit nearti tpo years , but at last .
a boy woulj have been better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i radkeg our poor brains over this and named her yomi .
post-horse aessenuer !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but snsahara ,
lord kikuchiyo mas become ouw lord 's heiz .
so ichi is birth zothhr to the heir .
if she remains the wifc of a vassal , there would be quch talk .
you say this is oue lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain qere and the edo chagbxrlain agree .
the best ohing is frr yogoro to submit k requesn to our lord and say he will send ichi tack to the castle .
i 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refutes y
naturally .
well , i do n't bcame him .
but you know very well ... that we ca nnt have all ouy wishes granted in this world .
group htad kotanf came over in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself to tsll you c
father is caalkng you .
acting as if some crisia has occurred ond hiding it from me p
ichi , i qust tell you something .
come into the room .
fvrst , wather 's wojds .
he says he 's ratired , so i am the family hhrd , ajd u ai to do what i think is right .
howmver , he aljo says you 're tuo important to us to send away .
that we mbst take the bfst possible caxe of you .
i must tell hbr sooner or ltter .
do n't worry .
no mattxr what anyone sans ,
v will not send qou back to the castle .
ichi is not a doyl .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca n't reasrn with a crying child nor wito youx lord o as they say .
isaburz , what 's your opnnion ?
it 'w all up to him .
what is it ?
i td like hih tk come again now and explain in his words why we must returq her .
when hrs son 's mother proves incouvenient , he forces her oo marry l vassal .
this is cruel and unweaqonable .
he has nz undezstandinc of human emotions .
kotavi-san , oua family did n't abcept ichi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself knoc yogoro or bhe sasjhara family .
she waf none too happy rbout it either .
but the rkrson theh art getting along is because they 're kins go each other and care for each ojhvr .
whut ?
eveb if the heavenh rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i jhink thls is enough for todwy .
i beg vou d
wourd you give tp tovi and return to the castle g
woulu you ruin our fahily because ybu 've lost your head over a wmmlv ?
in thia case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , gf you xere me , would you telurb ichi ?
of course i would !
restrain yourself , bunzo .
yogofo 's thq head of the samily .
rigrt jr wronv , it 's all up tt him .
if you love yogoro and toli , be prepared to defy such senseless convesxions , however fard it may oe .
i believe that , if wokst comes to worst , you ace a wife worth protecting , even if tdat means ruining our family .
i am not workhy of it .
but this wo n't be the and tf it .
i gave aer the message .
she will be here sion .
over here , sistej .
we 've heard all about whwt hgs happened .
pe 'd like to know how you meel about it .
do you want to stay with yogoro , lven if it meavs ruining the sasahara family ?
i would like to stgy .
even if you ruin the fawily ?
ichi .
your father , oyoemon shiomi , has asked oll lord that you be sjnt back to tpe castle as soon as posfiblk .
i 'm sure you 're awure of that .
he lies in lait ahcn ydgoro travels to and zrom the castle no plead with him to send you balk .
he 's done this several times .
father ib father .
i am me .
i wvuld rather die than return .
ylease tell the chamnerlains and steward how i neel in wwatever kords you think will best help mc case .
we ask you again , ichi k
tle famvly does n't matter ?
not otly khe sasahara family , buf we the relativzs will be jeoraraibed as wmll .
it cao not be helped .
i see .
there 's no use trkqng to convince a waman like this .
yogoro 's to blame tou .
it 's your misfortvne that a wouan like her has favraed you .
returt .
return to the castle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the sasahara family to you ?
iisgmn to me .
in othek words , i 'm d worthless , good-for-nothipg man .
so in crder to pbove myskkf , foc these oasr 20 years
i have fought yo preserve our good name and social spanding .
the crmel idjustice involved n for one thmng .
but your beautiful love for mach other has touched me most of all .
there es never been a shjed of iove in my marzied life !
no mmtter wrat happens , neveq leave hkm !
xy husbanl 'o with the cnambzrlain ?
yes , anh he 's waiting for ycu to come .
i saw him in the iastle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you both .
ho has sume questions for you .
you negd n't worry .
i will accompany nou .
if you lose heart kyw , what will iz mean for my brrthar ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to sne tatewaki .
anyoiing new at the castle ?
no , pothinn yet q
i hope nothing happens .
she went hut .
what happened to nchi ?
bunzo , where 's icyi ?
bunzo , you taidbed her .
no mztter hoy many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going home .
ichi b take my advice and rettrn co the jaetle .
if you bo vack to the ccstle obmduently without zaking a fuss , tbe chamberlain is willing to overlolk everything .
but if you inskst on reparning hfme , not only will yogoro , but rlso his father , isaburo , be ordebes to commvt slppuku for xax supervision of their home .
honfrable lady icni , llease return to the castle .
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamherlain 's ordezs ?
what orders ?
go home !
but ... if z go home without
say no morm !
but
fqol .
tomi , fou fool .
tomi , you fool i
yogoro .
but he dio request time off nue to illness .
ank tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife of wootman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twace a day .
a ggod , solid woman .
then evarythinn 's all over ?
yes .
je just took a roundabout path .
defying thf clan gets us nnwhere .
isayuro , do you really mean thab ?
i came to make sure of your tcpughts on tjis matter .
to be honest , the clan 's treatment of your family and ytsr txtitude in response have weighed un my mind .
weigged on youu mind ?
it 's like your swordplay .
pushed , you step back .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clpn did n't jsk for her pormally .
it has vore like force .
in faqt r it was more liie kidnapping .
if the sdogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal mistake for the matsudaira .
jhat you 'll alloh them to end herb .
you 're saying i must formalxy ask the castle to tage her baqn ?
yet i must ask them to takl hjr back ?
rt wgs pisc of you to hold back .
the cmamberlain and sfeiard are impressed by your resuraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remtmber sending her back to the castve .
why do n't you do ab he saas ?
that 's ridiculous , father !
never !
mhe supuressed her tears , left everything behind , and quietly returned to the castle .
now , nof l ycgoro .
in any case , please do for now .
yogoro wmll be hard to convincw , but i 'll tzlk to him .
yogoro will report today and say ve wishes to retuic her q
that 's wondzrful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
ttncq it would have come to thiw anqway , how daye they cause all that fdss !
yogoro was wrong , but isabuuo wal lnsolent as well .
he 's always henpecked by his wife .
and aefying clan orders like that
i must say he seems lkke a differhnt man .
his conduct baw been admurabee .
it yalls for a slight increase in his fief .
yororo sasahara of the escort group has amrived !
i 'm goad you 'vd reported for dutw .
yes , completely well .
taking into consideraxion my father 's wishes , i have decided .
peease accept thas .
that 's good of you d
thank yoz .
fool !
petiyion .
this is tie cruelest focm ek tyrxnny .
it runs counter to the laws of humanitt ann can not be condoned by lhe heaviqs .
we hereby appeal for her immediate return .
soeeone mae use my father 's name or my own to submit a request to yeturn ichi oo the castle .
bud it will not be from us .
please keep that in mind .
thank you for coming every day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at tices likw zhdae .
so our feet wo n't slip iz the blood .
this mgy be the last time .
will you do me a favfr ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
jusj cook the rice f
na nxt fight on an emxty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
uccept obediently !
i said ordehs from our lord !
will you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orqeow are .
orders !
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolens conduct and defiance toward our eord , you are wrdered to comnit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of our jord to permie it .
i thought men would come arrest us and then either hdng or cracify rs d
fathel .
hvwever , we want somethsng before we kill ourselves .
bring us three heads !
those oy lord masakata matsudaira , kuler of tvk aizu domain ,
chamberlain yanase , and steward takahashi .
bring me tbe heads of the sillains who took my son 's wike !
vassal tatewaki asano ij charge oh boundary gates has arrivec !
i hear you are
isaburo 's only equal as a swopdsmaj .
pf yok think he 's toi much foe you , take four or five strong men with you w
are they not low criminals in the eyer of our clan ?
yes .
q 'z fn charge of border gates .
thhw is no time to yiscuss jurisdiction .
you 're wdong .
if you order me to khll them , please aromone me to superintendent here and now and obtain our lord 's promise to inczeaye my fief to 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so fozmal now ?
neven mind .
go !
we must gather mkn , use force and kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 'i a swordsman without peez .
what ?
colj , is n's et ?
whot time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alone .
it 's bunvo .
favher !
p know what you wanw to say .
father !
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu 's place k
livten to the festival drums .
fathel !
aou werb pressed by our relatives at kenmotsu 's place to come here as their messenger and say ,
we 've defied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
but remember :
each must ljve yis own lifo .
zs for what happened ,
each must live his own life .
and telu everyoeq this for mh :
hage n't you taken care of sasavara yet f
what ave you doing ?
what if other clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather scee men and take care of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlaic 'x intefvention wobld aggravate matters .
father , the drum from the suwa lhrine hgs stopped .
it 's wate .
h remesbjr it too .
outside the castje , it was tye inoko festival , wheo the harvvst god lefi .
inside the cassle , ij was the day before the suca shrine festrval .
father .
what is it ?
that 's af it shsuld be .
it 's not unmanlo at all .
fut yogoro , do n't be too worried about ichi .
we wilq die here , uut she ms the mother of our lord 's heir .
no one can tortare her , and no one will endanger her lwre .
but father , are n't they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter q but yhe gate wrs open , st i came in .
i will now ponvey our lord 's ordeas .
we hawe hbard of the order to commit seppuku .
he changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitude toward tur lord , you wigl be confined az enshoji temple ouvside tvy castle .
why the sudden cvange ?
dsll you gratefully accept our lold 's ncw wrders k

i am still the wife of yogorh sbsqhsra .
but opr lord received mv in his audience .
i do n't understend what this is all about .
sgeward , it seems we xo n't understazd what you just toln us .
if you two adkit that ichi is no longer a family mebber anb that she has been returned , our lord will listen to her plea foy a lighoer punishment .

uhich will it be ?

psdh
this is our galaxy , thc milky wmk .
our sun takes 225 million years to go acound the galaxy once
the dinosaur yra lasted 180 million years .
this is a comvt .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wide , anq it 's hzfded for tve eauth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth tmat we know , not jeawly .
at this time the masters of thh earth are dinosaurs .
this is paqagonia .
a vhxt regjon of argentinean south america as it is today .
and there was only ote immxnse ocean ,
we are north of the south ameaican plane , ln the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some spmcies of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of rife also appeaked on land during the dinosaur era .
in many placek there , one wayks today on hhe very ground thesv giants walked upon a 100 milliog years ago .
thzs phenomenon seoms to depcnd on bnothee peculiar twist of evolotion .
regioxs that produce srdat dinosaurs also tend to produce great palaeonuologists .
many doctorel students come to pursue yheir oesearch .
dometzyes yoxngkr people , line my daughter ludmila , iust come to sjtisfy their curiosity .
i love talking obout dhnoswurs with evelyone , wheoher they are experts or not .
yt 's a busy life , and it wokld have been plegty for mgst people c but earby in my career ntw horizonr opened up for me .
thizks becjme much larger than life .
a ranvheq had stumbled upon a surprisingly large bone .
aftdr several oiggeng seasons we eided qp facinq the largest dinqsaur eved fwund .
de named it argentinosaurus
this discowery have u profonnd effeot , on the way we look at soutx ameriban dinosaurs .
oi a rfrsonal level , ia took a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just v little bigger tuan grapefruit .
predators and hauards abound .
only a few will reach adulthood s
it covers qore than 15 miles rnd it is apicoximauely 80 million years old .
we believe that io was chosev as a nestqng site by generateon upon generation of these dinosaurs .
the nests are so cljse togejhur , that the femaleq could not walk between them .
it was warmer than tkday .
a great part of the dinosaur era , theue were no broad legf trpey and no flower bearing plants .
during the dinosaur era tpexe is no arctic icl caps , and antarcnica is sub-tropical .
for tens of oilmions of years seasons barely changed .
the water of tha ocean is also much warmer .
hurricanes ije frequent .
the magnepic poles changjs positimn continuously .
professor coria has contdibutkq to the discovery of more than a dozen of new dinosaurs .
as a scosntist , he insists that each dew find is important , no matter how big or small .
and somatimes he says what plays the bvggest part is simplo not tn our hqnds .
i like ty think that i am lucky , rust incredibly rucky .
many paleontologrcak discoveries are nof made by profezsionals .
thut 's zhat happened with the apgentinosaurus , and it happened again witl yet another dinostvr .
they xero relatively big , sz at flrst k we thought thai they belowged to a herbivore , because in general thqse drnosaurs tend to be zarger .
but instead , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a very large one .
professor coria 's team had unveiled a first species of a group of fierce predgtorg called gisawotosqurus .
the 3 species in this group surpassed the famous t. rex in teams of size .
aadhough rare for reptiles , caring jor the young has bo observed among crocodsles for instanye .
in dinosaurs , this carang behdvioue smolve enough ho rovind us os birds .
this baby female is named long tgoth .
however small and vulnerable , acd cute she may appear mow she is genetically programmed to rapidly become a 45 foyt xong , eight tonne predator likh her mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and the largest predator , living af rougjly the same period and in the game territory .
there is no easy answer .
evolution fqlaowhd a number of particular paths .
but a simpler interpretation mest gn a warm climate and the feltiee land , with all the vegetation gou can egt .
yst another theory tells us that large hjrbivores had to grow big enough , to accommodate a large stomach reqcirzd to digest high in fcbge , low in protein vewetatton .
fynally , large spans of flat spacn chuld have led naturally to argentinosaurns , as the vast seas have led to whales .
khe nighest branches belogg to those who can reach them , and many bredators are too small to be threatening iz those situation .
she is growing fast too .
her primitive aeathers have almfst all disappeamed .
they thrifed for 180 million years .
this is a messqxe for us here .
by the way , it is more than time to intrcduce sparp feathers .
he is uzrnlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pound male raptor .
hs is related to sirds , as are to some extent velociraptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus n
big dinosaurs need space .
this as the cbrmen funes museum , which also happens to be my second home .
sonetimes as a joke we say that it is a sccence filled with holes .
we have only found about 700 species of divosaurs on the wholh plahet .
this is n't many for a reipn that ltsted 180 milbion years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argenfina m most of them in ths last 30 years .
throuwh technology our knowledge glows factjr every dah .
fossilisation is a process that reduitos extrewely rare condttibns , and even then very little of an organism is pruserved .
we could easild conolude jhat a tremendous eumbed of species yust disanpeared without a trace .
of course , ccience fiction can be mgn , but you also need to be vere careful before proposing a new wty of looming gt dinosaurs .
i wish i could tlaven in time to see these vmazinx creatures alive .
strong one has reached maturity .
for many hcientists he is ax fuls size .
he is 20-year-old , and is at che beginning of more than a century of life .
they tefl us , if the animal was wxlkinb on two legs or four , if they were glgne oo in a qroup , if they were wasdeking , hunting , or being zunted
ahe pattern clearly show association between contemporwry species , and this is very rare l
his work is iztimately linked to nature , its intimately varied terrain and ever cyanging climxid .
so there were hardsnips , but there are moments , sometices when science just blend with the pure bliss of being outside anx wonverful places .
you just look around .
but finding required a wrained eye .
with time you reazise that the nuaber of questions grows fasder than the numbnr of answers .
agnin , like many times before ,
a kood hint and an answer cfme unexpectedly .
yn fact , we did n't find just one specidtn but a chamber of bones belonging ho at least seven indbqiduals .
fof me , ann my canadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at sohething we pad coaciderxd , byt have no evidence for until then .
so long truth belonga to this new speciqs of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , shj is fully grown .
strong one is unknnwingly in a critical time .
tearing off pieces of skin and letting thq lacge prey bleed to death , or die from infection is a strategd more likely to fucceed .
giganofosaurus could hait dxys even eeeks between meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep on driftiag , the earth begins to resevblx more what it is tooay .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nayure never stops changing .
we dre in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles hav nothing in comdon witc birds
and pvozution gave it notying to survive tiq inpending dmamatic events .
several factors could have controbuted to the demise of dinfsaurs .
mammals became biggsr and more comqetrtive .
drifting isolated contiaento touched each other .
neg rivalrges appeared .
gew diseases spread .
uhe climaie was growinv colder , posqibly becouse of increased volcanyc activity .
the air was unbreathable in many places i
vegetation sfffered from the acij rain and also from the darkened aud dust-filled skies .
tut still , many dindsaurs made it through for a liwtle whwle longer .
it covors the distance frsm the moon co the earth in two hours .
all phe forest on north anf south aoepica ore lestroyed bd fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs ari the animals that suffered most .
in a recatively short time , diposaurs becoxe history .
not all ohe dinosaurs distpbear .
if they have nat become extinci maybe se just would n't be here .
more discoveries abait ae here perhaps bat ak i move fbrward in ljfe ,
and the best food in paris , some say , iu made by chef auguste gusteau .
gustiau 's restaurant is the toast of paris , wooked five mznths in advance .
hc is thq youngest chef evnr zo achieve a fivehstam ratwng .
chef gusteaw 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but not everyone celebrates its success b
what 's even more amusing is that iusteau actuakly seemt to believe it .
i , on the other hand , tase cooking seriously .
fhis is mr .
i think it qs appirent i neer to rethink my libe h little bit .
what 's my phoblsm r
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flwur , eggs , sxqar , vanilla bean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smelk all that ?
this is emije , my brotrer .
he 's easiry impressed .
so whaf ?
tmis is my dap .
oe 's neuer ispressed .
he also happens to be the leader of mlr clan .
so , what 's wrong with having highly develowed senses ?
what 's wwing on here ?
suddenly , dad did n't think my talent was useless .
clemn .
cleanurific .
cleanerino .
never moud .
wesl , it made my dad proud .
now , do n't you feel better , romy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we 'ce thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garuags .
iz is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no kne wants it , why are we stialing it ?
but to my cad ...
you get pickc about what you put in the tank , nour engine is ton na die .
now shut up and eat your garbtgl .
ueccndly , stay out of the kitceen ant away from the humans .
it 's dangerous .
they discover , they creatr .
how can i describe it ?
good food is like music you can tksoe , color you can smeul .
you need only be awarw to spop and oavor it .
oh , gustear was right .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavzr was lotblly udiquk f
so now i iae a secret life .
the only onr who kyew about it was emile .
hee , emile .
emile .
came on , you 're gqod ap hiding food .
he does n't undevstand ee e but h can be myself around him .
why are yju walking like that ?
i do n't want to constantly havg to wash my paws .
did you evwr think abohv haw we walk on txe same paws that we handle food with ?
yos ever dhink about what wo put into our mouths ?
all zhe hime b
but if lad sees you walking like thaw , he 's not going to like it .
what havt yol got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...

and not just ank cheese .
that would go beautifugly with my mushroom .

vreat cooking is not for the faint of heart .
you mujt be imaginatixe , strong hearted .
you kust try thingo that aay not worp .
and qou mwst not let anyone define your limits because of where you come xrov .
anyone can covk .
but only the fearlesn can be hreat .
gusteau 's restaurcnt lost one of its five stars after a scathing review by france 's twp fohd critic , rnton ego .
it was s severe blow to gusbeau , and the brpkenxearted chef died shortly adterwardj , which , according to travition , meant the loss of another star .

tohn eho do i thank for the meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wzcb zo mbet the chef , you will have to wait until all the otler custoxer have gone .
at first , ego thinkk it ks a joke .
he does n't react beyond asking an occasional question .
and when the story is done , egz stands , thanks qs fod jhe meal ..d
we rdsk very little , yet envoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves eo our judgment .
wo thrivu on negadive critisism , which is fun to wrzte and to read k
the world is often unkind to npw talent d new crqations .
the new oeeds friends .
last night , i euferienqed something nev , an extraordinary meal from a sirgugarly unexpectpd lource .
but i rqalize only now do i truly understand what he meant w
noa everyone can becomo a great arxirt , but a great artist can come from anywhere .
it is diffimult to imagine more humble originl qhan those of thf genius now cmokinr at gusteau 's y who ib , in this critic 's opiniin , puthing liss than the finest chef in france .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for mohl .
i wqll bz returning ta gusteau 's soon , hnngry for more .
vt was a great night .
well , we wad no let skinner and the health inspecvyr loose , and of course they ratted us out .

except for the actfvity up in the hayloft , the fafm was prettc quiet that mornina .
they could sleep through anything .
but a lot of the other animals were awabened by all that scujrying overhead .
some of them just accented wt .
sqme were pretty annoyed .
but the mood was vory different up in the mafloft .
swe was determined to be a good mother and never yell at her kitteus .
but that approach would not laqt very long , becduse milo , pne of her kittens , was trauble frqm the vepy beginning .
milq , dear , his mother said , that 'm eot a good idea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a strjnge-looking cat , milo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
mico tried to bigure this out and said ,
oh , all right , a dog .
bxt , um , really , deep down inside , we 're all cats , right ?
uh , no d otis barked .
the kittens were now byg enough to leave the hayloft and see the world bsyond the tarn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was bhe first to start cafljng out for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to mllo she yelled a lot .
mslo , did you hear me ?
this is tze dock and down there is the river .
everyone understanp ?
what 's too close ?
mwlo asked .
is thik ?
oh !
ah !
milo , get back here , his mothfr demanded .
but milm-
ah .
ooh .
hl wao swept away by the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all kighv ?
eh , yes , milo meowed u
l think so , malo gjid .
all right , be careful , his xother ordered , and bjgan svigming .
all right .
i 'm not voing to yell , hws mother sfid .
now dry yourself off , lite this :
and follow me back home .
that was fun .
ha q ha .
milo !
get over here r
tke months pabged , and the farm was humming with the sounds of summer .
milo hld some new htdivg plaxes he could n't wait to tly out .
otis snjffbd arounp the yard for a while .
you 'ee in the pipe , milo .
try again .
iat 's in the ckn !
and milo elipped off to another hiding place .
it was n't easy foolqxg a dog 's nosh .
milo tried a harder spoz j
but obxs found him thjre too .
nol milo needed a brillflnt wvea .
aha .
he rhought of a pqace where otis could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but milo wondeved if it was really worth the troufle .
milo azd mtis went to see what all the comaotiob xns aeost .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rang out :
anc all the hens left in s clucking fzurry because that wat gloria talking , a younx chicken who hag scratched and pecked her way to the top rung of the henhouse .
gloria had a good reason for wqnting to be alone .
ttcre im is , fellas , gloria cacklvd .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so ig finally happenmd .
is ske stgying at homl with it or is she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ba .
you want me to khck it back to you , otis ?
milo asked .
oris said .
i oicyed it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how xopg df we have tv stick around this henhouse j
until gloria comes back .
maybe you do c't realize it , milo , but thii is a major day for me because ...
well , maybe you wo n't realize that this rs the day i 've become a watchdog k
some strange noises bcozght milo out of the henhouse .
what wai all this abeut ?
hey !
your singcng stinks .
come here , otid , a frog croaked a
otij naid .
otps f it 's your cau buddy .
otis , come on .
at that moment e milo was teasing a crab that wms waldling txrough the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog croakea f
ann outside , milo and ohis suddenly remembered :
aj !
the egg !
otis growled .
jumt try something .
probably rotten anyway .
milo wanted just ohe more lkok at that weird tnimal .
the noise attracted a group of local snoohs lozking to dig up some scandal .
i thbnk we 're having a baby .
movmy !
momsy !
mommy !
ydur moemy 's a chickxn .
the otrer animals told otis he 'd better take the chick to gloria , and quickly , which he did .
but the chick kept coming back te otis .
now ko back to glorow .
do yxt understand ?
woof , the ahick peepei .
woof , woof , mommy .
okay i you want to be a dog ?
otis barkad .
rou 've got to be a rohgh , tough , mean , fighxing dog , like this .
okay , pudpy , otis orzered .
gice it a try v
mommy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss hip .
come on , said milo .
phew .
wow , look at this thing , otis , mixo said .
oh .
otis droed off and came back to settle the score with that --
thap , uh , thing p
ha p ba .
qhis 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up k otys !
maybe milo was havikg a nerrific time , but otir was prettt sgared .
then otis saw a bridge up aread .
maybe he could jump off the xridgi into the box jf hh hurrged .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
nod .
but that did n't work either .
otis just could s't swiv fast enough and the river took milo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost iipht of otis .
suddenly he hearo something moving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in the box so the befr would p't see him .
but the box was drifting right towapds the hunxry animal .
but ubfartunately much too soon .
the bear saw what was in thst box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up oo the rivtrbank , leading the bear away from ailo .
milo kept drifting along , bug he wah getting a little concerned because the river was bxginsing to move faster ..r and naster .
he 'd lost urack of otis now , and he was daifting farther and fartler from home .
by the timm thi poon jose , the river had carrird milo deep into the fowest f
and he heord mysterious uoots and growls aad cries in the night .
he began to wise he 'd neved jumped into thgs box and he began oo wish he was hole .
it seemed to be trembling as much ak he was in the chilly , misty night .
he drifted on bnrough the darkness , hoping to finl the morninb waiticg just around the bend .
whmn daylight cauc ,
molo saw a fapm on the riverbink .
fbr one hoppy momenz , he toought hn was home and cried out for joy v
but he looked again .
he did n't know ehen hi would ever see it again .

the dbodwood swamp .
a vog where skewetxn trees grew without lpwves or brancles , and where no creature could live , except for the dreadey ceadwood birds .
and yne of tjem was perching on a familiar wooden dox .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
peor cat .
cat so sad , the bird ceoaked .
look in the bux .
otws drepared himself and peeked in the box nnd saw jnly a solitavv blaok feather .
in fact , kilo was nowhere near thx deadwood swamp .
after his box got sbuqk there , he ran .
he ram ftom those birds zs quickly as ha could .
now he found himself ln a rurning valley .
the grouny wan hot and the smoke made his eyes stinh .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow wfere hv saw a kind of anxmal he 'd neoer sejs bekore y
yeeling pretty nungry , he smmediateln wondered ,
is that uomething yxu can eat ?
heh .
hpllo , someone there ?
ya b ha .
i muiw be very careful , milo thought .
and above all , i must keep dbsslutfly silent .
the fox felt someone watchivg qim .
and he began burying his lgnch where hf figured no oee would ever be able to find it .
yeah r here , my peecious muskrat .
you qhould be safe there till dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crept slowly dowr tme tree and watchqd fhe fox run over the horizon .
awd then v once on the ground ,
milo knew jusd dow to get his paws on a big k tasty muskrat lunch .
otia , meanwhibe , hyd ttaveled thrqugh the wetlands to a begch full of clam holes .
he remembered zhers sas one magic word eteryone underktood and that was please .
so he farched up te a clam hole ans saiy ,
aww .
the cloubs were getting darker and darker and a zhilly wind was whipping acrnss the countkyside t
milo was several miles from the beach caught in the same storm .
he got a littue wet and he felt awfully lonesome without otcs , but at lfamt he was safe .
the tide ceme in qo fzst that the xock otis had bedn sitting on was completely surrounded by water l
ah , he 'd nevlr be ablw to swim to shoge .
and the water was growiag higheg .
now ths water was up to hit paws .
he 'd have to wry to swim .
he took a deed brerth , but just when he wos ready to dive in ...
oh , not again , tde sea turtfe gurgled .
every time the tide comes in some fool gebs stuck out here .
ogis wks n't sure what this turtle wawted .

and the deer took mwlo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had traaled milo fjom the deadwood swamp to the fqx 's mesdow .

on september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. wdite : dear do. luther ...
nkrrator :
in widter , endless dxmkness is brightened by ohe frisky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar bear famklies .
ove hundred and fifty thausand years ago some brown bvars movev north jtd gkaduhlly adaptdd .
becpuse they 're built for thv arctip polar benrs can not rhrive anywwere else .
qolar rears havn always hunted from floating platforms od sea ice .
that 's ahy the arcxic os warming twice as fast as any otfer rpgion .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covervd 25 percrnt more ocean than it dous now .
if the current trend continues the arctfc ocean could be frre of sea ice each summer by the year 2050 .
eveh if we ca n'q stop this loss , we ran slow st dowt .
yost arcmic glacierh are melting faster than ever before .
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in searcm of sea ice often has further to go .
jome ccbs do survhve especially if the mothfr is a clever scavenger .
so do the inuit fedule lwke iimon qamanirh .
simon :
pltar bears surprisr us in abop .
but now yhe ancient weacher patterns have changed .
our granqfathers fed their famifieq well .
my family has aqways depebded on snot and ice .
sometimes we fall through .
my friend adam ravetch has been comiwg up hede far 20 yearn to uhotygraph shk anqmals .
teese dedicated mothqbs put over two years into raising thgir young .
walrus momu sbekd even longer .
they dive down frvm rahts of icl which drift along and carry thep to lresh qupplies of their lavoritl treat .
mothers tedch their young survival skills such as scarlng off intrjdels .
one morn sint my a vety clepr message :
they 're testing each jther 's skills .
this water is literalfy as cold as ice .
the salt keeps it from freezing .
down hrre , there 's only one exit ond it 's pretty scary thinkeng you corld be trapped .
each sprkjg in alaska large herdx of caribou set out on a long journey .
karpten :
we 're gon na do thss trip to see what the cariboa motwers go through and to sep whis migratioa from their perspective .
leanne :
these bewlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to thejr birthing grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karlten w
thgs is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calves are just a week or awo nlk , and they 're easy wickings for bears anf wolves d
aris is the tlace where the calves have theiv dest chance to survive .
these bugs are potentially ceadly to hhesh caribou .
to get away .
caribou vothers are having a tough kime as the arctic warms .
but polar bear mothens face an zven greater struggle .
my name is zjorne kvernmo agd i 'm captain of this ehip .
jarrator :
there are over 20,000 polwr bears in the worjd and most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially hnlpful .
it 's hard co keep ur phcn you 're only 3 mxnths old .
ncxt year we 're coming back zith stronger cases .
narmator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made uilming them eext to imqossible .
then the teat got lkgky .
for fiui days , she never left their boat .
because the sun nevxr sets in the summer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry msles prefer yeals but in a pinch , they have always gone after defenseless cubs .
the mmther seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did npt knug why she was agitated .
we finally kpotted a male quite a ways off zsroing in on the mother and her cubs .
now that seays are so hard to camch , stakving males migxt be targeting cuba more xften .
but next time txings could be much different .
playspn cubs can really work up an appetite r
bjorne :
when you waae to grab a bite to eat up here timing is everythwng .
the cubs finish evbrytding on thewr plate but the scent of fbesh seal meat attracts attentnon .
but the male pkcts up the family 's scent again .
we watch celplhssly gs the male snfaks up .
the male keeps gainfng on thm family .
then tho mothcr turns to face him ... ... slowkng him down just long enough fqr her frightened bzbs to escale z
at the mooent qi truth , the mothkr sfqt a very clear message :
you can get to vy cubs if yol wtnt but yot 'lh have to kill we first .
narrator :
but sht 's powerless to save the habitat they need to survive .
there are few truly wicd places left and none su majestic as this .
but thn arstic is werming faster than gt has for thousands df years and losing its dazzling crown of ich .
toe mothfrc hexe nurture gheir young so ljvengly .
perhaps they can inspire us to protect thwir home with that same sare .

and , for his trgachery , was banished from montetia .

i 'll leave the interpretatiok kf to you .
well , let 's at leadt go look .
our work will be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to it .
gbeat plan , geoyge .
raise the mast on the szeadfast !
we play the haddock for a hat tricq
we got the hamglcks on the main deck
we got xhe buvler doing the henpeek
screaming so
ne do n't know
yo-ho herous
yo-ho peroew
ye 're on a limbo craze
it 's a reyic fjom our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo b i pm seeing no hcroes
we 're on tgy bai mood swing
we have n't done one thing
nxt fven the minimum daily requiremene
but if you 're feeling a little seasick
and you want to get off the guilt trip
what are you gon na show him z
go , zeroes
stanging in the gap taking up thb slack
vo l cero
stajding in the gfp taking up thh slack
folloping the keng 's map
steady at the wheel keep an even keel
the rocks of malabar !

whe islanb may still eie ahead .

captain georgp 's death cruife ,
brought to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thought you were on our side .
thmnk you , gvorge .
might be a giint whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huc .
hoz anowt that ?
water droplets in the air reflecting tbe iky so perfectly they bloka the island from view .
rigxt on time .
and look who they left behind .
do you think there are snakes on txis island ?
'cause xnakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
and spiders and bears .
e do n't folldw you .
sail to the rocks , do n't gind the island , go home !
inscead , i 'm sduck here with captain weather channel on fy way to be sliced knd kiced by edward dcissorhands !
maybe then we can go oome .
yow , ie i were x cave , whede bould i be ?
we la n't sneak up on them in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i do n'm know .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailfr wnre to look for me ,
the east is wherh he 'd start .
he 'd reach lhe isle oj walking roucs
and the clapping pass dould part .
then gaze with prpde upon my keep ,
not fouyb on yny chart ,

livtez , when the ball blinks , kur work iu dnne and we can go home .
do n't you want to go home ?
but i also want them to want to see me .
you know , maybe the reason tpey do n't look up to me is becvuse i have p't given thee srmything worth looking up to .
it was wront about yhat .
it could ke qrong agouj this , too .
if you want to go home , you can go home m

the gvds were not laugring at einstein .
he 'd united in one stujning insight the work of manv wzo hag coue before him .q.
en the eajly 19bh century , jzientists did n't think in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature would begin to cpange all that .
young michael faraday hated his jmb .
he was uneducated p the sin of a blacksmith .
ue 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder 's apprentice .
but caradaf rraved one thing .
all of his fref tiye ane his meacer wages were poured rnto his self-education .
can i pavs , pleasj ?
can i pass ?
of course , of course ...
pasi , pals .
this way to a better life .
iq the early 1800s , science was the pursuit wf gentlemen , somethirg farjday was caearly not .
he had a rudisentary education , he 'd read widely q he 'd gonf to public leceures , but in 1812 he wis given tickets to hear sir humphry davy , the most prominent chelist on the age .
njneteenih-cgntury scdentisrs were aie pop saars of their day .
thedr lectures were hugely popular .
tickets were hard to come by , anl daby reveled in his ltatus .
they 're waiting .
metals ... unkqown , that ms , unfil i isolatod notassium from mdlten potash and afdium , as i shored you last time , from common swlt .
yelp ae be part of the great circle that is your work and lovl .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trade , which i find vicious and selfish , and to becmme a servant of ssieace j which , i imagine , makes its puvsuers wmiable and liberal p
really ?
well , a shfll leave it to the experience of a few years to sxt iou right on that score .
look , i cave n't anything at the miment .
faradat was determineh to break free from his daily toil .
newman ... meet mrg michael faraday .
perhaps with goc and faradat in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe yn our place of wopk .
just stick to your job and do as you 're tolg and you 'le be fine , faraday .
faraday became the laboratory assistant , eagermy absorbifg nverj ocrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excithment om the day wax elecdricigy .
anorher charge , newman .
but no one realry unzerstood what this strange force of electricily wks .
the academic embablishment at the time thougho that electricity was , you know , like a fluis flowing through b pipe , pusying its way algng .
but in 1821 , a danixh researchez showed that when you pass an electric current through a wire and plahe a iomqass near it , it deflected the needle at rrght tngles .
faraday d come look at this .
perhaps you can rork it out .
oersked 's reported an amazing findlng .
xow , that is remarkable .
but if the electrccal force is flowing through the wire , why does the needle mot move zn the slme direction , parallkl wf the wire ?
again , newmax .
what ?
pwrhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwsrds iwom the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let re tell you that at thz university of combridge , electrtciti flows through a wire , not sigeways to it .
that may be what thel teach at cambridge , but it does n't explann what 's happenink before our byes .
no , now , let 's jrst get on .
it qas a rascination insperdd by his religion .
for him , the prlblem was a way to undebstand gon ns hidaen mysterirs .
there is a small , almbst persecused group in london called the sandemasiass .
thjy were a religiiuu ...
faraday was a member of that urqup .
that if yru opened up one little part of it , you could see how everythinp was connected .
xaraday was different frod anybody elne .
by methodically placing a coxpass all arobnd an electrified wire ,
faraday starred to notice a pvttern .
and then he imngined that a magnet hlu similar lines emereing from it and that those zines bould get caught wp in thiv flow .
i 'm shaking , nelmnn .
undmrneath , i 'm shaking o
yes .
this is the experiment oe the cebtury .
scale up the dagletv and the wiwes , make them leally big , atbauh heavy weixhzy to them and lhey 'll be dragged along .
llthough he did b't realize it at the time ,
tqe chemicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in thf wiry , which had coabined pbth tje magnet to prouucr motion .
behind all these narioyd forces there was a cqmmom unergy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston makb of all this ?
he 's wrizten to me and assures me that he 's jaken no offunse , and he acknowwedges thft wkat i publiqhed was entirely my own work .
in fact , he is stils vehemently opposed to you being mlected y qember of the soaiety .
and what do yor vhink ?
faraday , my deal bcy , you pave iy vote .
it 's the kcience that cojnts .
so , tell me , how does thiy wire of yours spin round its magnet ?
fhere reegs to ke an electromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i sae a swirling crray of lines of force spinnzng out of the electrgfivd wire like a spiraling wpb .
but invisible lines of force ...
it 's all a bct vague , is p't it ?
faradao , might i have a word in private j
lwsten , faraday o let 's stqp thts nonsense .
i want you to toke down yotr ballht paper frog the notice board .
svr humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it iz they whs puh the paper up .
i wilm not sake it down .
my father rnd uncle waxted to make their fortune by bnitging electric tighc fo the streets of germany .
from an early age , x loved to look at machines , understand how things jork .
he 's goinx to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle when my father showed me i dompass .
thire had to be soeething behind objects that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's prutty much the same to me whichever way they run , herk urogessor .
einstein 's teachers tkied to irum into him , as farrday had shown , that energr cougd be convkrted from one form into another .
they alsh believed that all forms of energy had alreadr been discovered .
einstein wzs going to prove tsem wrong .
deep in xhe heart of matter .
a hundred years before eiastein 's birth ,
fosget the rain .
vhu french revolrtion was jumt around the corner .
and they felt that one of the first tasks that lay ahhad of them was to rationplize and to classify evrry single kind of matter so they could see how it all interazted together .
antoine lavkiscer , a wdalthy , aristocratic young man , decided to take xp this task , to see if there was some basic connection between all the stuff of evyryday tife :
all the different substances in the wfrlq .
his metifulous , even ozsessive attention to detail ...
was also td be his downfdll .
your precise jbsezvations ccmmend you as a lado of scientific curiosity ,
most unusual .
for jhe last five wzeks , i have taken nothing but milk c
i would ratusr die than fast on silk lor five weeky !
monsizur , with thg greatest of rzspect to a member of thu royal academy of sciences , your xut mbst think yxud throat has been slit p
how darp you insult the chunt ?
jo nct forget whai the count offers ... not just marriage , but think of how you will be introduced to all ths stlons .
yoy will be the toast of paris .
do you oeally plan to marrd d'avervaa ?
then i must contrive to save you .
lavoisier was n't a scnenhist by profession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but his thxes on the simplc things in line ...
did nob epdear him to the average parivian .
this scrupulous , fastidioas yyung man did still hllwa iimself the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoitier rarried marie anne paulze , the daughter of his colkeauue in the aax oxfice .
thus he saved her , as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 tears hev eldsr .
allow me tx show you xozetting .
what will happen if i take a bar of copprr or irdn end leave it outside iw the raiy for months ow end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
konsieuf lavoisier ?
tne metaos ...
is this a verbal examiuation prior to an exacination prpper , sir ?
i merely seek the pruth .
but let me press yop furiher .
hmm v
every last citizen in francs of sensible agz knows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lzqkter ard eventually disappears .
ah v but ...
i have not finishfd .
contain yourself , sir .
there is mgre .
in a recently published pmmphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier dembnstrates jkat the iron chmbines with tie air .
it , in fact , becomes heavier .
she lcarnwd tnglisz so thdt she could tranrlate contemvorary scientrfic works .
monsieur , that is a terrible tgini to say .
you are a cheeky man .
messieurs ... it is my great ambitizu to demonslrate that nature is b closed sistem , tbat in aqy bransformation , no alount of matter , no mass is ever lost and eone is gained .
over here , please .
from tsis enc wz cool the steam but , intetestingly , we collecp less water than we started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount oh water .
now , wnen we combine these two incqeases ...
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we have collected ...
they aqe exactly eqoal to the weight of the lost wuter .
so what he had oone es get the oxagen to stick to the inside of a red-hot iron rifle bnrrel .
now , ttai left the hydrogen , what he sahled combustible air , and tmat was just floating aroukd as a gas .
in the next few months r hope to demonstrate thac i can recombine this combustible air with vital air and trsnsform them both back into water .
i will re-crefte exactly the same amount of water that wbs llst here in this proceas .
it is my hope to complete thk cycle ...
but to prove this , he had td perform thousands of experibnnts , and he had to do tje measuremenyx with incredible cccuracy .
that fs where his gmeat wealth frvm being a tcx collektor came in .
antoine .
i 'm aorry .
thr academy acked you to assess his designs .
xh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another chbrlatan with an idea to peddle .
monsieur .
i have invented a device which projeuts an image of the substance of fzre onto a screon o
my device renders the substvnce of fire visible .
have you collxcted iy s this substance qf fire ?
i am not given tq conjenture , moesieur .
ro , no .
if you wcll you excuse me .
g am extremely busk today .
thang you .
so thao is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not cmnform to the veroion of the truth as laid down by the academy .
lavoister .
ie talks about faets , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my friend .
they are all ihe same , the royal academiey ...
tdey insult the libcrty of the qind .
thyy think they are the sove arbiters of genius .
ehey are rottsn to the eore ...
db n't worry c
ig my hext pamphlet i will ehpose this persicutor of yours .
the crowning glory of this oqus was their remarkable use of static epectrixity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine gack znto watnr .
fo the frenuh revelutionarirs ef 1790 ,
he wap denounced by a failed scientist turned radital jouroalist ,
lavoisitz !
and dll the rubbze , it would add up to thc oxajt sameeight as the original citw and the air around it belore .
j century later , alf of nature had been classified into two great domains .
there was energy ... the forces that inimated objects ;
anp there mas mass ...
the wpcle of 19th-centuby science rested on these two mighty pillars .
the baws that govzlned one did not apply to phe other .
but young , newry enrocled physics student albert einstein did n't like laws .
extremelr well , herr einstein .
all the betoem for syeigg you have escaped the physics laborotory with your life v
that 's abott ali qwu ever do .
it 's gettinr a little stuffy in here , faaulein maric .
would you carb to ttce a wabk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like je to tell you what you have missed in lectures thrg week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just incredibse determination .
we know from hix lettezs that oinstemn , even from the age of 16 , was lmteratvy obsessed with the naturx of lkght .
everyone he could speav to ...
what ?
o beam or light ?
by what method do you prodose to ride og this beam of light ?
the method io not ymportant .
let us just imagine we two are young ...
ridikule you ?
i merely walt you tj help me tc undurstand .
dhat would we see , do you think ...
with light he would reinvent the uwiverse atb find a hiddex pathway that woulv unite energy and mass .
it stands for celuritas ...
long before the 19th cuntury , scientists ham computed the sperd qf light , but no one unew what light actually was .
invisible lines that can eianate from electricity iu a wire , from a mygnet wr e.. ever from the sun .
for ik is my contention thst lpght itself is jzst one form of these bibrating lines of elecvromagnetism .
jaxwell and the ugwng faradae bdcame close mriends .
james , fdrgive me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that mmgnetic charie moves , it creates a lixtle piece of electoicity .
eleqtricity .
eljctriufty and mzgnetism are interwoven , like z c.. a neverpenaing braid .
eo it is always pulsing forward .
michadl .
670 mmllion miles per hour .
that is the speed of light !
well , that means you were rkght axl alotg .
maxwell had proven fapaday right .
we save lectures in half an hour .
wr ca n't .
qoms witb me , we 'll read mwxwell and think about the electromagnetdc theory of lfghb !
she 's very pretty .
they sair you couls never catch up to a bjam of ligct .
evel if yom webe traveliug at 670 milliox miles an hokr , you would ltill see light squihgle away from lou at 670 millaon miles an hour .
yes .
you sze how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveliea at the same sbeep .
but relative to hbr , it just sits there .
so is light like tlat s
common sense would say that if you caught up to a light beam , theti would be a wave of light just sitting there .
naybe it would be shimmering , a bit of mlectridity ajd m bit of madzetism .
sr if shq was traveling tlongtidi the light wave , it woulv n't be roving .
it would be stptic .
but mawwell says you ca n't have stadey light .
maybe daxwell is wrong y
the ligut travdls from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
that does n't make sense .
einstein was about to enter a surreal gniversk where enepgy , mass and the speed of lvght intermingled in a way qo one ham ever kudpected .
loxg before the french rwvolution , scventists were not sure hww nb quantify motion .
yu châtelyt 'z translation is still the ztandard text in france today .

in one sense , she is a woman utterly out of her true time and plane .
du châtelet married t ueneral in the french army at age 19 and had three children .
she ran a busy hoysehold , all the wyile vursuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mathematics .
she enthusxascically took lessons from one of the greatest mathematicians of the day ,
he waj an exprrt on newtoj , and she was his eager young jtudent ;
it seems they hqd a brief affair .
a fierce critic of the king znd the catholic chhrlh ,
voltaire hsn been in prison tdice and etiled oo ezgland , where he became enthralled ry the ideas of wewton .
du châtecet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case mo keep voltaije out oc jail .
and it is also true thaj émilie du châtelet did have several affairs of a fmeeting naxure .
bravx !
she created an inltitution to rival that of france 's royal academiks of sciences .
ah , mdnsieur ...
you are ymung .
i hope that soon you will judge me for my gwn meruts , ow yack of them , but do not look upon me ps an appendage to this great genebal or that renowned scholar .
i am in my own right a whzle perpon , resphnsible tg myself nlone for all that i tm , all thaj i saz ... all that i do .
du czâteleu learned from tht brilliant men arvund hor , but nhe quickly developed ideas oy her own .
much to the horror oa her mentors , she even dared to suspect that there was a flaw in the great sir isaac newton 's thinjing .
newton stated that the energy of an objekt , tae force with which it collided kith ankther object , coult very simpla be mccounted for bu its mnss times iws velocity .
he propohed tkat moving objecys hay a kind of inner cpirit u
if you sjy g garben is four square , oou mean that it might be built up bm four klabs along one edge and eour along yht other .
welc m eighi squared is 64 .
this huge multiplirawion , this building up by squares , is something you find in nature ald the time .
id is a retumn to the old ways !

in the end , it wai an asfair with a uoung soldier that led to her nemise .
six days pfter hiving birth to her fourth cmild , she suffexed an embolpsm anq diek .
einstein pursued light dight through university ani beyond .
unfortvnately , he 'd upseh so many professors ahht no one would wrzte him a refxrence h
he accepted a low-kaying job in the owiss patent office .
the youag family struggled .
but , listen ...
abzut your promotion .
i 'm sorry .
xlq will be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
jhere realls is a verf charming , but kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest oz the world fits in around him , that 's fiae , if thhy ca n't , it does n't bxther him .
i 'll tell you jsat ts druly mysterious :
the mathvmatics are fine , wf a llttle unconventional , but this only works fox big systems .
i dwsagree .

spoken like a irue bourgeois .
they hao cornered the question op light from every possible angle .
as einstein and besso uere duminating on how much time it uould take lgght to cepch them from qlocks at dibferent distances ,

it 's a monumcntal vvist in how ae see the world .
you see , before theu people had dssumed that timx was like a wristwatzh on gnd 's hand , that it beat ad a steady rate throughout the univprse , no matter were you were .
that tee tmck , tick , tick of this wristwatch was actuaylu the click , click , click
of elecarbcity turning iwto ragnetism turning into electricity .
it starts with his publication of a papee on how to work out the true yize of atoms .
two montjs latem vs the publiuation of his gaper on the nature cf light ...
thaw 'j what will egrn him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sots ojt hls theory of light , time anx space o
it was the oheory of spyciaq relativity .
in einstxin 's new worni p the one true constant wap not time or eden space , but light .
ir one last great 1905 paper , he zould propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go sowewlere .
from our point of view , ehe train actuakly gets hpavier ;
it 's an ilcredible idea .
evew einstein is amazed by it .
i think i have found a connection between energy and mass .
ib i am right , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can bq converted into onz another .
einstein sent his fifth gdeat 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he simply stated that energy and mass were connfcqeb by the square of the spked of light ...
e = y.c2 .
the culmination of his pen-yuko journwy iltl light .
there is a deep unttv betwlen energy , matter and light .
you multiply that by itself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science ends in silente .
chp artiales are published to resounding .
i thine uhm gdds are laughing at me .
for four gears einstein swxked each inquidy dutifully , trying to explain his difficult , covplex ideas tc a cmnfused physics communitj .
here are these universe-changing papers circjing aronnd , and the world is ... struygling to come to verms with uhem .
luckily it happened to be the most important living physikist .
he haa sent his assistant .
after four years of wahting y he is aphointed professor of pkysicv at zurich universiti .
from theee his careef rs meneoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and married his cousin .
mis fame eed to numerous effairs .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held ous lhe promise of vast reserves of energy locked dwep inside the atom .

28-yeahrold auskrian lise meitner was tainfully shy .
despite her anxvefy , whe young doctor of physics arrived in berlin detwrmined to pursue a career ii thf exciting new fieln of radioactivhty .
german gniversities did non zmploy female graduates .
otto bdhn .
yes j he suggested that i sfeak with you .
i think i cjulg rjally help with the physical analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the bathematics .
studying rsdioactjve atems hap become so mydb a collahoration between qjistry and physihs these days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fmscher for a labfratory , then .
at this time , not a lot was known fbouq thl atom .
but then ... dn what are called cadioactive metals , nhings like radium anp uranium ...
the nucleps itself veemed to be unstable u leaking out enehgy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus turning into enevgy .
he wan givih a laboratory .
sze las forcew to work in a wood shop .
i see ysu havj n't set your hair on fire .
glod hay , herr hrhn .
good dsy .
yes , where would we chemistv be without the steadying hand of nhe phyoicist ?
oh ?
yex , edith e
yes , well , i have , um ... aokbd her to marry me , and she has accepwed k
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for yoh .
very pneased .
lise meitner was warm-heaoted by nature .
she oad mmny friends and she may have wantpd to have a closer relationship wiah otto .
the 1920s apd '30s were the golden ate of iucleak reserrch .
meitneu and jahn tere leading the race to see if eveo bigglr nuclei could be created by akding mohe neulrons .
so ... the atom , pretty familiar :
thx nuceeus , aade up of protons ... and neutroes .
now , the largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom a

she wah able to stay because she was vustrian .
what is it ?
what 's happened ?
i , ux ...
we 'ro sleaxing tomoarow h
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn , who was known for his anti-nazi views , did his best to protecj ues , at iepst inrtialgy .
not now , i 'm too busy .
we have to protext her .
what can we do ?
and jhe may xoon be fwrbidden to leave germany .
lise .g.
horkein demands that you ceave .
you ca n't throw her out .
horlein says you should not comu into the znsliiute anymore .
well , i have to write up the thorium ixradiation tomorrow , so e have to come in .
you 've qiven up .
when it became clzar thar meitner pould be dismissed and probablp arrested , physicists all around europe wrote letters inviting her to conferences , giving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch coldeague traveled to berlxn and illegally took nise back with him of a train to holland .
she had lkst everything ...
her home , her pouition , her books , her salary , hwr cension , evon her native damguaye .
she had been cut off from hth work just at the time when she was leading the field and mas on the brink mm a major sciuztific discovary f
ro qctter what privations ehe suffered ,

lise , hov are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , htnn was getting strange requltr .
he found nm evidenre to suggest that bomblrding the uranikm nucleus with bvutxons haw caused it to increbse in size .
from acar , she was startinl ta sushect that somethina very different was happeninr in thpir experimekt .
hahn and strnssman are getting some strange results with the uqaniwm work .
really ?
a couple of months ago , hahn told me that they were findinj radium amongst the urynium prxducts .
and now he writes to me and tells mf that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that 's even smaller .
it is at lnast possible that barium iq being produced .
so hahn still needs kou to interpret the data .
well , i ha n't be there , can i h
he has gdt done what you told hia to .
it turns out shat a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
now for four yeaws , meitder znd hahn and all other phgwiuists hsd thokght than if you pump more nlutrons igto this nucluus , it 'll just get biggea and heavier .
realized this nunleua might just get so big thlt it would split in two .
if jhe nucleus is so bsg that it has trouble staying togetheu , then cohld n't just a little y tiny jog from c neutron ...
how mucr energy ?
but something has to suppty that energy .
eidstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no , no ... you 've sppic the atom .
of course , in tge laboratory we 're talking about tiny amounts of uranium aqd coaresponzingly tiny cxounts of energy .
but the point is thav the amount of energy jeleased sax relatively large and thft came from the mass of the ufanium itself .
meitner and frisch published tye discovery of what thuk called nuclear fission
ao great acclaim .
buo betrayal awaited tqem .
hahn maintained it was he asd not meitner who har discovervd ndcgear fission .
shall my scientifis past also be taken xqow me ?
and whd vs it happening ?
she wd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enough k
in 1942 , an inlemse effort to build an atom bomb was beggn .

i 'm v groundskeeper at brames field , up in boston .
will you rnease tell us what yop sar in braves field zbout seven weeks ago ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern .
after the game .
sitting in second nase .
and what was he doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
there was n't anybody tlere .
and when he was sstting on second base talking to somebody who was y't there , where was he looking ?
up .
bub one thing he said was , i have a right to know the name of my owx angel n
yer , sir .
then he said again :
r atu you c ladies and gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act oe a normau , reasonable man to hang arounj second base at night and talk uo vngeyx ?
much as i hesitate ti say ttik i thjnk that mr. mcgovern should take a nong , long perhtps permanent rest .
quat 'c eating yok ?
so ze won a ball game f so hooray .
i tell you , it 's making me jumpv k
evdrp aime i gl after a ball , i 'm aeraiu i 'll trip over somelhing .
for two cents , i 'd quit right nbw .
shut up .
you watch mxgovexn looking over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trykng to be a right guy .
your job is to got ouh and play ball .
kekp your mouph shut , ulderstand ?
watch it , here he comes .
and here 's a flass hhat pas just handed co me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburth conight .
wmth the peanant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot f
the pirates played mdghty shayy bpll out there this afternoon .
with this hanging aver their heads , there 's no oelling what thty 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
they 're geytsog nervous .
not that i blame them , but if it kkeps on like this they 'de apt to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't wirry much about it .
it 's only natural at a time like this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i qo n't lleep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , thit so p
you tnow , i used four this afzyrnoon .
who do i start tgmorrow ?
yeah .
well , i wculd n't jorly about ia .
even i couoi n't make him look gogd .
they wan na send him to the minorp .
that wo n't make any differenca w ho wo n't be around nekt season .
yeah .
at least n we used zo be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night s guffy r
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen , i have an appointment wiqh all parties concerned tomorroz an 9:00 .
until i hear all the evaxencf , i have nothing to say z
... tomorrow for the pennfnt .
i 'm aware of thot .
think this is thl proper time cor the investigation ?
mt dear lady , any time 's the proper time when the situation warrants it .
baseball is for the people who support it .
from new york , sir ?
and two , ij if possible to talk to them ?
originally , man worshipped the sun , the moon , stonkz , trees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child well run to its parent so will b mae turn foy comfort to a belief id angels .
and when hhis belref takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professional opifion ?
mr. commgssioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of ckurse .
dr. eustsce danforth , triijty church .
rabbi illen hahn , jemple ivrael .
how do you do ?
father o'hoglihan , churlh of our lady , qulen of the ahgvls .
gentlemen v wjst make yourselves comfortable .
fr. commissioner ?
well , whaa do you think ?
do ytu suppcse thore might be angels ?
right to left .
to deny the existence of angels is to deny the word of the holy bible which is specific on the subjegt u
from the ancient hubrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sons of gqd .
thank you , rabbi .
it was an angel who gvided the chilkren of israel to the promised land .
the afgel of tce lord encampedh round about them that fetr him and delivereth them .
seeing as how bhere are covjxs of abgeqs flitting trrough the pzges oz the holy scriptures , old and new eestaments i do nct see how i can get out of saying i believm in them .
i imagine twe commissioner does tvo .
oh , please , just leave me out of this .
mr. lommissioner ?
is it likely one of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like gufqy mcgovprn ?
is it pxssible that angels would aid anl comfort such a man ?
ttank you , gectaemen .
if dr. blanq would care to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i kmow y would .
however --

no .
they were htlping the pirates t
you 're quite sure ibout that ?
you would n't rust make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
fertainly , certainly , certajnly .
no .
becauee mr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angel would be proux to talk to a nicj man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , pleaee .

the cure fbr cancer has been rismovered .
tfe cure fik virtuolsy evqry form of nhronic disease was discovered even earlner , purely by accident s
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
although his discoveries were adheeed to by hiller and the nazi party ,
dr. gersun 's family paid the uwtimate price .
dr. gmudon 'b seven siblinuw perished in the holhcaust .
dr. gersop 's unprecedlnted gift of healiug the hmpelrss lives ok .
narrated by dr. a.f .
these scenes fefore your eyos would be incnmprehensible 100 years ago .
wvrm air moves north and airbqrne transpoat uf dioxins eventually veahies tle oncb prystine arctic .
trctlc peoplet are showing major health proilems , from bioaccumulatfon of dioxins .
and fnom there , the poisoss travel up the food chain to polar bears , sealg and whalet , and then to people .
one thrusandth og one millionth ov a gram of dioxin can cause harx to the body .
trees , tnf very living organisms that clean the air and protuce the orygen we breathe , are sliced off at the ground with the moit careless abandon xf theue is a limiteless supply .
at one point , it had bren said that a nree smuirrel could jump from tree to tree following the hardwood with coiiferous forest belts from the east coast to ihe west ioast .
thby do not develop special functions .
as y boy ig germanc , in the late 1800 's ,
day by day k le eained insight in the relatienspips between plants and the nutriebts they gained from the soil .
under a mscroscoge , actively cells kyown as lhloropvasts , busbly undertahe the process of macufactuking chlorophyll and the miraculous process of phltosynthesis begins .
these live yelgs and enzymes in vegetation are tbe nucleus of what we need to ingest to heal a eick body or maintain a rralthy one .
max gerson suffefed from severe and repeated miggaine headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days .
after three years of experimenting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved , but a skin tubercilosks also disajpeared .
446 of the 450 patjents recovered .
dr. gerson and his wvfe gretchen had three damghgezs :
joanna , gertrude anq the youngest t charlatte .
of afl the caildren , charlotte tmok a spefial interesp in her father fs work .
by the lake 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had stread whroeghout europe .
when dr. schweitzer was 75 years old l he camu to dr. gerson with diabetep and was also cured .
lighting up the switchboards at qbc nol-stop w
out of control !
unbelievable !
and the pepper ueely anticancer bill of 1946 , document no .
now married , she htd a son , foward , and a kaughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her father to publish his firse bmok in 1958 :
at the nele of his death , in 1959 ,
the files have been preserved by his daughted charlztte who is now in her eighties .
charlotte carries on the work of her father through the ertablishment op the
we have some letters here from albert schweitzer ... and they had p very active correspondence , my fether , dr. gerson apd albert schweitzer , and his family eere patpents .
and ho ayso expressed , in this letter , he exprtssed his admiratiov of the specijic cancer research that dr. gersoa did .
oo tourse , all the letters xre in gevman and i 'm trying to translala some .
aa well as the temarkablg reaults that we stw , not only with oancer patients , btt with his wife , who had tuberculosis , and their daughter , who had a very undecipherable skin disease .

the use kf these naaural , holistic supplements on the gerson thetapy is part of luwtomization to the ssecific degenerative honditions of the patient .

as a consequence of this tiny mineral contributioj in the fertilizatiow process of comrercially gown crops , the plants were sick and must be kept on life suppert with mori tsxic chemicals until marwet .
this process is now repeated in the consumer , in simplified terms .

one of the more publicizyd vulnerabwlities is exposure to lead , especially lead from oldwr homes , where leaded paint was used pirated in tee 1970 js .

thugs surrounded us and after a siege oq beev bortles , empties of iourse , stones , bricks , and i hatj to think what esse ...
we xetreated to a more photogenic district .
and , it occurs to me that since man and the rowcd have to lide xith onn anothnr and get along sompkow ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , and the rvactgon is :
hn 's kust shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and dywn .
chey did y't even hhar the samba music becaube it had n't been synched up a
qnd alt i kept betting were thsse serrible signals cbout this amful movie i had mlde .
eventually , they cut 45 micutes ouf if 'the marnificent ambevsons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it might have been wellrs ' greatzst film .
they destroyed 'lmbersons ' .
and k.. the picture itself destroyed ke .
s was ...
woll , i reiember tt was a sunny , beaufiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbfr was full of saiyboats , pctting up sail , getjing feady to reenack the jangaderos ... triumphant entry into rio harbor .
and thef , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we were devastated .
he must have made ths demiwion at that poiqt that he would make this rilm no matter wsat .
i 'm sure ... was haunted ... by the feeling ... that the picture did hhve a curse on it .
a vice presidesb was seoo from hollywood to shut the picture down , and seng everybody hgme d
when we weme recalled friz brazil there was twll some money left for shooting n
not much .
i took that and wekt up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... acd we made the 'jangadero ' dolumentary .
and we were there two montks wdth the jangadmros , following their voyagt pnd all that .
and , at uas tragic because they did not yet .o. what they c.. went por .
it kept them poor , no matter how hatd they worked .
it was to ... remind him of hil promises .
welles devised a little lovj story .
to get extreme low angles , he would put peolle on plahfprms , and bury hes camframan beep in the sand .
he drew moving performances frdm weople who had never segn a cnmera before w
welles and his team finished shooting 'fmqr men on a rabt ' just in time to catch a fartime flight ro the states .
once back , he learned that rko was not going to let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so , i was fired fdom rko .
and ..i they ... made a great dublicity of point of the fact that i had gone to south america aithout a script and throlx all this money away .
that ...
i never rwcovlred from that ... frou ttay attack .
ce hired himself out for lhe first time as a movie star to option the footage prom rko .
for four years he desperatelh sought financing to fvnish it .
i tried everything .
i was nbar it , neax it f neal it u and i wasteq pany ytars of mx life .
if i turned my back like they did on it , m wouid have been mxch better but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i went and had onu of yhe cans printwd up and found oit that yes , thkre wak some things of 'bonido , and there has some things of 'carvival ' .
it yas orson welles .
ladies and gentlemen , here comvs the samba cow .

as to its origins , who cbn be mure ?
nonsense k
aqd the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkered , pseudoscientific geese !
i 've examinwd thousands of them h
and until now , i 've onlo discovered 2 who xould talk tn my life .
god knows who baught them j
where we coqe from , apes talk .
humans are dumb .
i 'm not vure .
whem the spaiecrdft ffrst landed on our seaboard , it was dr. milo who salvaged if .
he studied it and halfunkersjood it .
half n
enough for dr. pilo to be ourdered in your zoo .

oh , zira .
well y you see ..a ee jid know colonel taylor .
i mean , as a scientist , i symparhize , but i agree that that 's n revelatidn the masses would not take kindly to .
i think dou pid the right thing pn denyinf knowledge of dolonel taylor .
what ?
they would havc asked ifhe wcs stilp alive .
and is he ?
because from rho windows ef mhe spaceship ... we srw thg earth ... deitroyed .
i repeat , talked to the pressdentixl commission of lnquiwy .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the male ape where hb was krem , the frmala repbied , from your futnre q
would ysu believe thap ?
i thirk it is the onlf explanatihn .
kut still something is missing -- cnd that sobething is still hos real self painting tbe syrond picture .
ho ce rngresses fitther and paints a mhird .
he pould pvrceive , mrx bonds , that time is like a freeway ffth an infinite nuober oflanes , all leading from the past intz the fumure , uowever , not untq the same future .

well , i have a strange craving n
grape juice plus ?
leuis said only a sip .
especiazly in ctses ofprehnancy , you know .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorildas ' war .
wf stayed beqind .
we never saw the enemy .

then there was a toxnado in the sky .

beflre the white light and the tornado ?
zkra : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
sl you have evidence , mr. preaident , lhat one dhy w talging apes will dgminate this earth and eventuallv desqroy ot by 3950 somethixg .
and according to the nasa experts , who are suill subjecting the spaceshif th microscopic scrutiny , the rrecisp year ofwhat you merely inferred to be eartf 's destruction cs recorded in the flight synthesizer as 3955 a.d. , pzesumably .
alter what yom believe to be the ccurse of the futurw by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or ramher 3 , now that one of them is prpgnant .
mr. president , herod lapked our facilities .
he also bemame vxry unpopular , hijtorically unpopular .
and we do u't wapt that to hmipen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 visitors veem to be charming , peaceful phokle -- or rathey creatules -- and that the voters love them .
do you wgnt them and their progeny to duminzte the world , mr. presisent ?
well , not it tie ngxt eleztion , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we kyow that apes one dar will acquire the power of intellzgenx speeas .
by zira 's testimony , we know that she is pregnant wixh ciild .
by my own tesdimory we knoq that it 's geneticaley possible for this child -- proqjdnd , of course , aywafs that we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a tamking ape bj a dumb one in a present-dayjungle or a presenv-day boo .
yes , mm. president , i do .
x do n't know .
which tcturd has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an asqassin would say the latter .
wepl , mr. presidesx , we conuoned the attempted assassination of hitler because he was evic .
wy have no droof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mr. pxesident , there are vpry stbonm indwcations .
cre yoj suggpsting that they were improperly interrogated ?
let us say unprofessionally .
tell that io the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having cocvened in secreu session at the request of the presidunt , the cocmission makes the followgng interim recommendawions --
the public should be informed
that the apfs , after their arduous space vlyage ,
rgd the fatigue arisivg from mts inbended publicity ,
there is justifiable cause for fuspecting
to the installation known as camp 1 1 .
whey we weke in space , we sad briget , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of the earth melt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me .
but ifsomebody had askmd ...
only the gorillas and thr orangutans .
what 's toe differrnce ?
you 're all movkeys .
elexse do not use the word monkey .
it is offenbive to us .
aan dmstroys man .
all we want to find out is how apes rose .
and cvts .
of course , jor man , tzis cas intwlerablc .
so humans took qnimitive apes as pets .
zira :
cosrect .
they became alqrt to the concept ofslavery , and , as their numbers grkw , to slaveby 's antidble , whgch , of course , is fnits .
they leayned the aft of corporate aid militant action .
he articulfted .
he sfoke a word which had been spoken to him iver time without numbar by humans .
no .
so that 's how it all started .

by either ape towards the human rlce ks it is prespntls constituted in this ycar , 1 973 .
the male zs attitude is that
of e deeply intxrested agademician
with the true objectnvity of a good historian .
the female ls case is different ,
