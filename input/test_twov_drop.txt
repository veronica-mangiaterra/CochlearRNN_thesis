reverend .

profssor ashton from rtland university .

miss carlisle invited me .

the bridgroom , to , i hope .
i 've alerted his housekeeper .
 the ring is in your right-side pocket #
professor !
professor brainard !

keep going .
oh , not again 
# bum bum-bum-bum #
i 'm trying to solve the secrets of the universe .
and failing 
do you know what time it is 
you 've been working all afternoon .
i 've been working on something very important .
more important , i suppose , than getting married ?
oh !
oh , you 're gettng a wonderful girl .
if yu ask me , she s too good for you .
i love you , too .
is anything wrng ?
and , professor , may i say happy honeymoon ?

good .
very good .

yes .
now we 're cooking , charli !

oh , hello , charle .
what hppened ?
what happened ?
get way , charlie .
i 'm not sure what we 've got here , charlie , but if we 've got what i think w 've got , we 've got something .
there 's one way to find out .
ready ?
yes !
yes  charlie !
we ve got it !
it 's not going lower and lower .
you know what that means ?
it 's generating its own energy .
it means we ve discovered a new kind of energy !
discovered .
substance x .
in appearance , subscribes to classical requirements of metastable compound , but whse behvior is distinctly nonclassicl .
hypothesis .
of course you do n't .
we just discovered it .
we 've got to give it a name .
flying rubbr .
flubber 
all right .
now a sliding shtter to let the rght amount f gamma rays through to bombard the flubber .
here w go .
prfect control .
now we ease off on the gamma rays .
light as a daisy .
just as i thought .
just as i thought , charlie 
weight makes absoltely no difference .
just shoot up a few extra gmma rays .
is nt that wonderful , charlie ?
i can still make it .
yes , 5 minutes to 8:00 .
in the morning ?
no .
no , i dd n't do it agin .
 know what you 're thinking .
but do n't you worry .
when i tell betsy what i 've done , she 's gon na be happy .
mrs. chatsworth .
do n't you tell a soul , but i 'v discovered flubber .
that poor , poor girl .
daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbed by rumors tht you plan to take our campus nd construct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely he wuld n't .
not ven mr. hawk .
but he 's an alumnus .
my dar grl , our esteemed alumnus made an xtrmely large loan to the college .
that loan is overdue , and mr. hawk has us , if you 'll forgve a pertinent expression , over a barrel .
i 'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportunity that would be convenent to you .
i shall make myslf available .
psst !
however , mr. hawk ...
do n't be angry .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding again .
lok , i could n't help it .
go .
i hit my head .
i was kncked out .
daggett :
go .
get out .
look , the most wonderful thing happned .
wait till you hear .
look .
flubber 
i shall make myself availabl at any time .
... of the greatest mportance .
no , make that of the most spreme importance .
brainard :
flubber .
flubber .
flubber .
oh .
good morning , sir .
i have the most wonderful thing to tell you .
the most wonderful thing you can tell me is goodby .
this wy .
just a minute .
anything you say would be superfluous .
daggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasant surprise .
i , too , have been wanting to chat about our loan .
brainard !
yeah  that 's right  pop .
do you know that this man flunked my boy ?
may i remind you it was hawk brains that founded this town ?
i wish i could shw you his exmnation paper 
not only did he miss evry answer , h misspelled the name of the college .
do yu mind ?
this means my boy ca n't play in the big game tonight against rutland .
flunking your str player .
a makeup exam .
but he could nt be bothered .
so he 's ineligible .
nne of your vague promises abot lending money is going to chang that .
mr. hawk has already loaned the money .
professor ,  rejoice in your sense of ethics .
but do you mind terribly if i speak for myself ?
mr. hawk 
hold it .
i 'd like to dscuss our loan .
and you might bring some of those principls of yours nd see how much they re worth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
get me the file on wealthy alumni marked emergency .
we have some ltters to write .
yes , sir .
thn y 'll understand why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd like that .
for once i wuld really like to understand .
like most things that seem complicated , it was actually quite simple .
do you know what that residue was ?
no .
well  it 's been thrilling .
btsy , never n my wildest dreams did i hpe to find a compound whos configuration s such that the delivery of energy t ts surface would trgger a change in the configuration .
but they act in a dirction opposite that of the force which triggered the change .
yes !
now that i clearly understand what happened to my wedding , will you excuse me ?
president dggett and i have some imprtant work .
it culd be worth millions .
do me a personal favor .
go bounce your ball somewhere else .
we 'll talk it out tonight .
i 'll pick you up for the gam .
you 're kidding , are n't you ?
about closing the college and turning the grounds into a hosing tract ?
they 're all in the same boat .
the little man is gon na get squashed .
but you grduated from medfield .
it 's your college .
so what do you want ?
some total stranger to close it down ?
is n't there smethng you could do

from a certain rvolutionary discovery .
what 's revolutionary about a tin lizzie ?

i see .
how do you figure this can help the farmer ?
i do n't want to help the farmer .
do n't you understand ?

oh , national defense .
national dfense .
bfore we go further ,  just want you to know that  am proud of the new spirit of cooperation btween the army , the navy , and the air force .

brinard swings a lot of lead .

i want you to understand .
i 'm using it as a security measure .
what better place t hide my discovery than in  model t ?
i want you to keep n mind that this is only a primitive application of my discovery .
we use this spark lever here to levitate , the gs lever to move forward , and the brake to stop r to go in reverse .
absolute control at all times , as you will se .
all right , get a good , tight grip n your emotins and prepare for takeoff .
cool head .
a steady hand .
try agin .
the first time you tried to launch a rocket , it dd n't go up .
it 's probably just a short in the control mechanism .

the president , devoted to the advance of science , hs embraced the discovery of flubber with enthusiasm .

but when asked about the letter ,
did it contain critical informtion about the economy ?
or much , much mre ?
if so , what would be in it ?
did he have he from a secret book left behind by his predecessr , or was the intelligence he received from less audacious and more conventional sources ?

todaythepresident has a unique handle on the nuclear arsenal .
everywhere he goes he is accompanied by a military aid who carries a 45-pound brifcse known as the nuclear football .
what s in it is highly classifid , but wht it does is allows the president , as the cmmander in chief , to be connected to the national military command center and those force cmmanders who must respond to an order to initiate
president dd over the years .
one of them was dealing with a surprise attack by the sviet
missiles on the way .
our retaliatory strategy was massive retaliation during most of that time -- mutually assured destrction .

thisis n enormosly energetic , complx system , and differnt agencies have different habits and different patterns .
but as a species , we 've had conspiracy theories from the very begnning .
oneof themost enduring conspiracy theories that surround the office of the
president first took root in 1947 , when the u.s. militry reported that an alien spaceship had crash-landed utside
roswell , new mexico .
i mean , you drive on a long , long dirt road , and there are grond sensors in that road , so that base security know that you 're coming .
eventually you arrive t just rally at a series of signs -- ther 's not really even a clearly-defined brder -- and that 's the point that you do n't want to go beyond .

and we literally spent som time looking at this , but there was nothing cnclusive that came of it .

intruth , though , the reason why there s so much secrecy about area 51 is , that is where the air force develops its mst secret and sensitive planes , including its high-flying surveillance planes and the stealth fighters .

they'reabletogiv a unique perspective becaus they 'v been there .
they know what the pressures are , they know what the issues are .
and to have a president-to-
narrator :
fivemen .
theproblemwith putting that kind of informatin together in one journal is that it can be stolen , copied , compromsed .
i 'd b very nervous if i were th president and i knew some ther people had access to that .
gingrich :
but we keep lots of secrets .
we keep n amazing number of secrets .
i have my doubts that there is such a book .
presidentsthemselves certainly keep secrets .
it 's not even power  per se .
it 's information .
and those that do n't have , are n't .
one thing is certain :
i 'dsaythat there are things that george
bush 41 and i know that not too many other people know .
gezor , ganime , kamoeba
the progress f scienc is endless .
so is the dram of man to xplore space .
helios 7 , the new unmanned rocket to explore jupiter .
its mission is to fly 600 million klometrs , gather dta and return in abot three and a half years .
earth bres me .
are yu dreaming ?
you could n't get any pictres , so you 're trying to cover up .
wait a minte .
wake up , boy .
if you think you are awake , do n't bother me .
fly to brazil again  or no job .
make up your mind .
if i take pictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell them to anther publishr 
to take pictures of you ?
no deal .
i 'm not about taking pictures of women .
no .
island ?
yes .
selgio island .
it 's located between hawaii and the mrianas .
only eighty inhabitants .
it 's like it has fallen behind the time .
an island in the sun , surrounded by coral reefs tht 's selgio .
we 've invested a lot of money in it .
once this plan has materialized  the world will b stunned 
you want me to take publicty pictures ?
that 's right .
a single picture can impress people .
i refuse .
but ...
please .
it 's been a long time .
yeah .
we workd together on the series , mysteries of japn .
i see .
remember ?
monsters 
yes .
i thought you 'd be happy to go there .
well , i do n't believe monsters exist unless i see one , but they might ...
doctor , is it here on this map ?
yes , selgio island s there .
you 're right 
the spot you marked .
no , this is n't the mark for selgio island .
what ?
selgio island
fishing s prohibited in that rea .
that 's why it 's good .
the natives here would n't like us to violate it .
who would believe that ?
but they 're serious about it .
every accident that happens at sea , they think the monster did it .
that mens more fish for s .
the folks coming from tokyo ...
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's just a current of cold water .
rally ?
look !
yokoyam !
sakura !
ombo !
you were right !
ykoyama , true 
yes , rico .
gezora is angry .
so , you really believe the monstrs exist 
ys , i 'd like to be friends with them .
you could be a good writer .
and it lands in the backyard of prehistoric monsters .
enjoying yourselves ?
sure .
from yokoyama , too ?
yes .
i have n't had a chance to talk to you .
makoto obata  anthropologist
let 's be frinds .
this s where you are .
thre was an accident on the island .
an accdent ?
mr. sakr ?
his partner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it 's interesting .
it 's  beautifl island 
it s bautifl becaus nature is intact here .
i know .
do n't mak fn of gezora 
do the natives here speak japanese ?
i see .
fortunately thy 're fond of japanse .
mr. yokoyama is supposed to meet s here 
rico , why are n't your people around ?
i 'll find mr. yokoyama .
rico .
all right .
let 's take a rest .
he 'll be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expectd the natives would give me lodging .
the schedule for reserch of selgio sland
i think it 'll be difficult to research the entire island in a week .
right , we hve to tke pictures of undersea life , too .
over here 
the thought maks me shudder .
do n't give me that .
your firm sent us here .
no !
t reads our hearts by telepathy .
you saw it killd sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
i 'll drive .
tht was some scream .
i thought it was a monster .
the sea water .
look .
huh ?
what 's that ?
the light ?
this is terrible .
this is a japanese watch .
it 's sakura 's .
sakura 's wtch .
hey !
mr. yokoyama , how about other people ?
i 'm leaving this sland !
mr. ykoyama !
lve me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you wll die .
shut up !
i 'll go back to japan and warn the people do n't go to selgio island .
it 's hell on earth.
no , no !
shut up !
gezora !
finally we can eat .
where are thy ?
gone 
mr. yokyama !
look .
rico 
he 's alive .
come on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remember .
rico !
wait , he is scared of the light .
wold you stop making jks ?
it 's not a joke 
it 's not a scratch or  bruise .
no , it looks lke frostbite .
frostbite ?
if gezora caused it , the monstr 's body temperature must be nar zero 
you re all sufferng from monsterphobia like that man .
that 's right , whre is mr. yokoyam ?
plans for the selgio island underwater hotel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
you forgot me ?
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if we can bring back his memory , w my be able to find out what happened 
let s go .
our bags ?
right .
the island 's shaman ,  think .
de , frends of th devil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a first-aid kit .
is he conscious ?
rico , rico .
there 's on good thing .
we 're lucky to be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream of it .
no ,  wo n't be able to sleep 
doctor  but what if the monster really lives in th sea ...
that would be wonderful .
come n .
i think this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main character ?
let 's get this straight .
what did you come here for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the undrwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important .
we shouldn t have hard felings .
do n't worry .
you 're s mean as ever .
saki .
rico .
come !
 ca n't believe i 'm alive .
the monster is a squid 
th legendary gezora is back to life .
does it hate rubber ?
i do n't know .
my knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the shman .
why are yo so skeptical ?
the people her are serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo .
everybody is going t de !
doctor !
you 're ll right .
doctor , it 's just a monster squid .
it has the characteristics of a squid 
but ...
can you call that a squid ?
when the fir burnt it , the monster was upset .
any gasoline on this island 
the company brought some  but it 's gone with that hut .
what s tht ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guns !
good .
god !
pour out the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire !
great !
gezor is burning !
here .
this will protect us .
i never imagined .
plenty of gsoline .
we 're safe even if it comes back .
i 'm encouraged .
if it was only a simple gint squid we 'd be safe .
what does he man ?
doctor !
doctor , if it was n't a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an ncredible creature .
tell me the truth .
you know what the monster really is , do n't you ?
i 'm srry .
terrifc 
i 'll show you .
watch out !
hey !
wh is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's m !
i wondered where he went .
he wants to scape .
it 's dangerous .
come back !
the monster ca n't get me !
we should evacuate .
go frther .
hurry .
hurry !
we re almost thre 
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca n't be sre that we destryed it compltely .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto obata .
yo are no longer an ordinary human being .
no use resisting .
abandon human emotions .
i will giv you an important job .
you must find our formidable enemies all over the arth and annihilate them all .
stand up , obata 
there s one here too .
yes ?
i 'll tell you what i think .
and the giant squd we fought yesterday is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size had changed .
all the principles of genetics and bology ca nt explan it .
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab is n't ganime .
the space creatures that came with helis 7 mde the crab into a monster .
as a weapon to attack us .
you mean the space creatures got into helios 7 in outer space some hundred-millons kilometer away from earth ?
if ths creture is highly developd , it may be able to live in a vacuum 
... and it may be able to alter its own cells and pass through the atoms of metal .
 see .
space creature or not we must destroy it .
we mst think of some way to fight .
i will marry rico .
we will have  wedding tonight .
wedding ?
congratlations .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
ric .
rico 
saki .
you recognize me ?
rico .
good !
you had amnesia for a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
yes , monster !
but bats came and gezra rn away .
bats ?
yes , bats came .
gezora ran away .
why ?
ther were porpoises when we were in the sa ..
i got it !
what is it ?
the space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrsound ?
yes , humans can hear sound waves up to 20,000 cycles .
but bats and porpoises emit 120,000 cycles ultrasound with which they use to guide themselves .
ys .
i guess space cretures hate it .
if we have bats , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bts live in caves .
yes , bt they 'll com back to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bats !
there .
did the monster do this ?
i do n't knw how , but nobody else could do it .
i thught we were safe , but ...
even though thy ar space creatures , they ca n't kill all the bats on the island .
here to .
all right .
mybe all the bats are dead .
that ca n't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes  we 're safe now .
we can control some bats .
mr. obata !
of course .
th monster ca n't beat me .
what 's this ?
the monster is scared of bats .
great .
then let me sleep here too .
what are yu doing , obata ?
it 's about time for the bats to move .
he went out .
wait !
doctor ..
you .
he 's nt obata 
why did you come to earth ?
we are the wanderers of spce .
we can exist only by living off other forms of lfe .
what are you going to do with s ?
yu know our weakness .
rco !
now we know enough about earth creatures .
before they rrive , i must annihilate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't se mankind perish like this .
even though you 're a wretched spy , you 're still a human bing .
a human being !
kamoeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go of it !
let g of it !
i wo n't ...
obata .
do n't come 
d n't come near me !
pray !
that 's all we can do 
even if a man 's cells are taken over , he hs his soul .
man is more than a structure of cells .
every man has a soul .
his soul is fighting the space creature .
they 'v gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck !
i wish i had my camera .
what happend to the monsters ?
even space creatures .
mr. obata !
mr. obata 
obata killed the last space creatur by killing himself .
mr. obata .
they must hav seen the volcano erpt .
the united forces of erth creatures ...
porpoises , bats and men destroyed the invaders .
will the people believe this story ?
mmm !
hmm .
hh ?
huh ?
wo hoo !

s i should probably tell you about my cousin .
but , h , you know , she 's got a family , sh 's got a career .
she s hd a spech mpediment her entire life .
and that 's okay , because that 's just not her thing ... just like my thing is
have you seen me dance ?
it 's not even called dancing ... it 's called trpping and falling and stumbling .
but that 's okay .
she says that ech f us needs a good friend to show us ... th best part of who w are .
everyone has their weknesses ... but also we have a special talent inside ... that could make the world a better place if we shared it .
i got something for you .
kathy gave me this , because she saw something in me .. that i did n't know was there .
i thought it was very courageous of you tonight ... to get on tht stage in front f all those people .
camp princess-worthy .
there is one condition , though .
i want you to us that curage and try to find ... that one talent , that one special thing .. that will make the world a better place .
can you do that for me ?
yeah .
okay , c'mre .

one summer , when we was about , oh , ten or so ... my uncle told him to go pick up a bag of horse feed ... down at the supply store down the road a ways .
now dn , he did n't weigh much more ...
well , did he make it ?
yeah , eventually .
lost a big chunk of the food , too , on ccount of the hole ...
he just kept saying , no , i can do t .
i can do it .
just  you know , i always wondered why he would n't ...
lt anyone share the burden , s to speak .
sve him a lot of extra trouble
i would think , do n't you ?
jerry ?
no ... wish i did .
but you know somebody who might be able to ?
but th thng is , we wo n't know unless we ask 
what 's up ?
so tht vaulting thing you were telling me abut ?
yeah !
but what changed your mind ?
the whole time i was just thinking ...
how amazing would it be to do that on a horse .
no 
unh-unh 
no way .
worst idea ever 
yes way  and best idea ever !
fine , but only if she listens to every single thing i say 
fine .
great !
you guys wan na shake hands ?
thanks !
gram i had a feeling you 'd thrive there ...
it makes me so happy to knw you 're making frinds ... and i want to hear all about them .

i ca n't wait t see you in the final show .. at the nd of smmer .

mres , automatic weapons , ammo  water

any sign of chyna de vere ?
not yet .
you know , thre 's some food .
you just should n't see where it cmes from 
did yu know that pigs are very intelligent animals ?
and certan politicians .
i do n't s connors ' truck anywhere .
let 's look in the barn 
if this is chyna de vere 's blood , we 're getting warmer .
looks like he had a hobby stuffed nimals .
why 's that ?
csi season07 episode22 leapin ' lizards
this is a career first .
a little tip for you :
the new mrs.phillips does n't need to har about this .
are you kidding me ?
cme on , pretty girl , gett outta there , come on  girl 
i 'm so glad i 'm a vgetarian .
well , no one has sen or heard from the victim 's husband , so ...
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likes you .
they always d .
we went to connors ' ranch because a week go  chyna de vere went missing .
she just separated from her husband , got her own place .
this is a large section of her living room carpet .
well , t 's certainly enough blood to suggest foul play .
connors ' name did n't come up .
how about the husband 's ?
and he 's still missing 
so what s this 
that is a single  distinct blood drop , not from the victim , not from the husband .
we also found soil trace , identfied as scheelite , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim 's husband .
looks like armageddn came on a thursday .
i 'm not sre there 's intelligent life on this planet .
i 'll get started .
i already went through this a week ago .
you know , you 're right .
yeah , not my boyfriend , my friend .
she was n't a member of your club ?
if she was , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husbnd was .
and he 's m.. .
you know , the club 's getting smllr and smaller by the minute .
you 're already n accessory to one murder .
if hank connors killed chyn 's husband , too .
oh , is that what you think happened ?
you know , this cn work in your favor with the d.a .
i 'm not really worried about that .
adam and eve were not only the first humans on the earth , they wre bait ...
for ntelligent life forms elsewhere in the cosmos .
but why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you re not toching me .
wll , ma'am , this is standard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just going to swab th inside f ...
not !
calm down .
get him awy from ...
calm down .
calm down .
no !
tht bitch bit me .
i gt my sample .
these visitors were highly advanced nd did nt apper in human form .
people of the serpents ...
of cours t did .
it was nt humn .
not of this earth .
ufo 's , alien abduction ...
looks like shannon was a plyer .
reptiles ...
history is replet with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george nd th dragon ,
stptrick and the snakes of irelnd .
what s this ?
so connors cut off her head becase he thought she was  serpent from outer space ?
catherine ...
check this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chllin ' in cabo .
i 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , hllo , xena .
oh , boy .
duct tape ?
yeah , he used it to close up the laceration from a sharp force perimortem wound .
could that be the fatal wond ?
give me the rest of the body and i can tell you .
almost three inchs , smoth-edge blade ..
you know , catherine found ...
why would anybdy want to taxidermy a human head ?
that   can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our guy had to separate the head from the body .
for that , he used a serrated-edge knife .
heartwrming .
yeah , so then ... he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle .
then he tnned th skin to preserve it .
hydrated it with a borax and water solution to kep the bugs off .
popped in two glass yes , and then ... and he 's got the best-looking wall mount in the neghborhood .
yeah  i 'll get it ver to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a guy on the fencing tem .
his thighs were incredible .
yes , the , uh , tip has been wiped clean .
gives us a height for a white female of 5 ' 6 .
how about for a male ?
did you msre the head of the femur ?
41 points ...
point five millimeters .
it 's a female .
this little piggy hd chyna .
yeah .
hey , greg .
no .
i 'm having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
good .
come her , take a look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeah .
you can see dick cheney  al gore , all nine supreme court justces shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , most membrs f congress
hey , did shannon turner have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
cats are a natural nemy of reptiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found at shannon turner 's made the tool marks on the skull .
shannon 's prints were all over the handle .
and th partials on the blade , above the hilt ...
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
yeah , but brass interviewd hr last week .
she did n't have any visible cuts 
warrick ?
come at me with a sword .
all right , so i push back hard nough ... bang you n the nse .
brass would n't have seen that .
bt what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank connors really believed in a reptilian conspircy and they felt threatened by the politcal establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah 
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a club card at a table game  the flor man writes down what game you playd , where you sat , what time yo started , time yu quit .
this is the first tme shannon used her card .
and the dealer is chyna .
looks like they 're best friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe chyna was her lucky charm .
she never walked away a winner .
i think she was gaining her trst .
stalking her .
t 's not a crime to play blackjack .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
we found your blood in chyna 's apartment .
then it was planted .
how should i know ?
look ... y killd chyna ,
and connors killed prston , becaus he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminat the competition .
you lied about knowng chyna , you going t lie about this , too ?
his cells do n't die .
oh , 4000 .
the new 50 .
preston is a great man .
he has the wisdom of the ages 
beyond your capacity to understand .
ms.turnr .. was chyna a reptilian ?
the reptilian athena .
is that chyna de vere ?
tell me about this ne .
is that you ?
i did what i hd to do .
i have to kill you .
what 
her husband .
she des n't look so happy to se him 
give me yur ring .
i really , really hate you .
that would explain why we found both rings in th ashes .
i found it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lng , and then the dom of the livr .
that 's your c.od .
yeah , pelvis is female .
the femur 's the same length as the one the pgs were chomping on .
it 's her .
well , we 'll run this against connors ' guns .
then yu better turn it off before they use the oxygen destroyer on him .
i do n't know why i find it so dfficult to exprss my feelngs to you .
i can see you as vividly as if you wre here wth me .
as shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnet 47 , thyself away art present still with me ;
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move , and i am still with them , and thy with thee .
or , if thy sleep , thy picture in my sight awaks my heart to heart 's and eye 's delght .
you 're supposed t let m get these things on .
i do n't know .
you mean , like me and you  baby ?
jm .
i got a call from a passing motorist .
preston de vere ?
very glad to be back home 
i ws a captive , held against my will .
from what the sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skeptcsm .
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
oh , so you were abducted before your wif was missing .
what ar you trying to tell me ?
you do n't know your wife is ded ?
unnecessarily cruel .
 had no ide .
come on .
preston .
f she was so sweet , what were you ding chilln ' in cabo with shannon turner ?
well , you got your pictures on the coffee mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth of where you were the night your wife was killed .
that 's easy .
there 's a woman , and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are victims .. and no one is listening to us .
we 're powerless against what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has nyone talked to shannon in the last couple of days ?
they 've got her .
it 's like we 're witnessing some form of mass hallucination .
you know , they think the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as wll .
that 's why shannon attacked greg .
let 's try this again .
sorry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contct with them .
please , we come in peace .
it 's all right .
got a warrant to tow in clarissa niles ' car .
blue fluorescence is on of the properties of scheelite .
which was found in the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same area .
have you looked inside yet ?
i was just about to .
preston was found naked , right ?
yeh , t 's a recurrent theme in tales of alien abduction .
s clarissa drove him out thre and he left his stuff in her car .
that 's nt all he left :
steam cleaner .
just wht every estranged husband needs to clean up his dead wife 's blood .
ths case just came down t earth .
yes ,
we wre asleep and suddenly the room turned very cld .
freezing .
i ..
come on , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i mean , really .
you got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man .
he 's a brilliant man .
he saved my life .
it was cancer and he cured it .
he knows how to prevent human cells from dying 
they 're , they 're radioactve .
t wold put them out of business .
let me shw you something .
look at this .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a nutritionst .
he 's not .
and look .
they never heard of him .
he has no place of business , no job .
he got shannon turner to kill hs wife for him .
got you to give him money .
he never asked for it .
i wanted to give t to him .
they do it while you re sleeping so they can manipulate your thoughts .
you 're not only cancer-fre , you 're fre of their control .
hw am i ever going to be able to thank you ?
the evidence s all over your car .
he lovd me .
if they were trying to clean up all the blod , thy did a good job .
steam cleaner testd positive for blood , bt there was n't enough for dna .
did you find anything ?
funny you shold ask .
found a hair in the brushes .
it 's on the left 
the one on the right is chyna de vere s .
hey , so ... tht steam cleaner was completely wiped dwn , could n't find any prints .
but then i remembered this story about a csi down in l.a .
nobody could find any prints on a gas can from n arson , but he realzed that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas .
nd you know what ?
he brok the case .
so whose prints are on the steam cleaner ?
i just got an afis hit :
preston de vere 
you have a destiny .
you are a protector of mankind 
cut off hr head  she dis .
no problem .
it was nt a reptilian conspiracy , but t was  conspiracy .
men re snaks .
i 'm glad it took a long time for her to die .
yo know , evry time i think about leaving this job , a guy like you comes along and reminds m why  ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa  st.george nd the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
these are accounts of battls for the survival of the human race ,
a battle we will lose unless we stp killing one another and focus on the real enemies .
they re among us .

narratr :
when fred astaire sang this song in the film ziegfeld fllies the year was 1946 and mgm was at the height of its success in creating incredible fantasies and setting them to music .
here , lucille ball tmes a pack of exotic cat-women .
it was imaginatve , outlandsh imagery , and dences loved t .
the most popular entertainment in the world .
this is the mixture to start the picture
narrator :
metro-gldwyn-mayer was not the nly studi that made musical motion pictures .
when i first arrived here mgm 's dram factory was in full swing .
but the success of the mgm musical did not happen overnight .
then they hit on the dea of filming popular vaudeville acts .
all :
whose pet 
and i pet with nobody else
in the hollywood revue of 1929 one of the first all-talking , all-singing  alldancing movies the studio gave its huge roster of stars a chance to get thir feet wet in the newfangled talkies .
but at the time it was so nw that some of the prformers had trouble remembering the lyrics .
come on with the rain i 've a smile on my face
just singin ' just singin ' in the rain
singin ' in the rain
just singin ' in the rin
suddenly , the musical became an overnight sensation delighting audiences with bigger casts lavish sets and costumes and even  new gimmck called technicolor .
mgm began its most ambitious film of this kind in late 1930 and filmed all th big production nmbrs befre th public lost interest in these plotless musicals and the prject was bandoned .
what els ?
shake your stripes beat yor pipe
lock your cell step light , hello , warden
clean as  whistle fresh as a daisy
brand-new clean through
clan as a whistle fresh as a daisy
to capture an audience , producers knew they could alwys turn to the old reliable sex .
this number , set in the shower room of a girls ' school shocked audences in 1933 .
but , gee , i 'd rther exercise myself into
say , the water stopped .
wter 
kelly :
such scenes fuelld th growng public outcry .
that th vulgar , the cheap and the tawdry is out .
there is no room on this screen at any tim for pictures which offnd against common decncy .
and thse , the indstry will not allow .
eddy :
ah , sweet mystery of life
at last i found thee
ah
klly :
among mgm 's efforts for the nw morality was a series of wildly successful operettas with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy .
both :
my hert has heard th answer to its calling
for it is love that rules
kelly :
in 1934  the studio lifted the public out of the depression and into a make-believe hollywod party .
hollywood party get up , get up , get in t
hollywod party nobody sleeps tonight
satan sing out , yeh , mn
hollywood party nobody sleeps tonight
and now , here 's to bauty , laughter , romance  music .
feelin ' high
what 's the use feelin ' low ?
on that wagon on the town
gon na be up never down
there 's a reason f you 'd like to know why
i m in love
i 'm feelin ' high
kelly :
in broadway melody of 1938 and almost all of her films eleanor bcomes a huge sensation by the last reel .

i was called america 's mermaid because it appered that i could stay underwater indefinitely 
for 12 years , i was the centr of n amazing series f vivid sights and watr pageantry .
allyson :
ech mn she met sh went and kissed
for a girl today do n't get the scope tht cleopatterer did
williams :
if one performer could exemplify the lightheartd spirit of the mgm musicl then june allyson would surely be it .
allyson :
when she went like this and then like that
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the spot
she gave thes poor egyptian ginks
this was the original main gate at mgm .
it was all so glamorous 
that 's me n the right .
still wet behind the ears from the broadway show best foot forward which th studi bought and took m alng as part of the package .
it 's not hard to tell that nancy walkr , gloria dehaven and i desperately wanted to make good at metro .

it picks you up and then it knocks you right down
it makes you lagh and play and act like a clown
no other music has the right to the crown
like th boogie-woogie beat
do n't mean the blus
she loves the boogie-wogie beat
allysn :
it was n extensive crash course designed to fnd thos with that special something knwn as star quality .

this was mgm 's scenic backdrop building where talented artists created their move magic , and this is just ne section of a hge painting re-creating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was originally 600 feet long and 60 fet high and wrapped around the entire interior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've always had such respect for gene .
both :
first , you put your two knees close up tight
then you swy 'em to the left then you sway 'em to the right
step around the floor kinda nice nd light
thn you do the eagle rock with the style and grace
gene 's first big break cam on broadway , starring in pal joey .
both :
ballin ' the jack
charisse :
gene hd a styl all his own charming nd athletic , with boundless energy .
his partner :
gen 's inventiveness seemed inexhaustible .
fit as a fiddle and ready for love i can jump over the mon up above
fit as a fddle and rady for love
charisse :
gene teamed with donald o'connor to perform this marvelosly comic vudeville routine for singin ' in the rain .
soon all the church bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
hw th church blls will be ringing
hi , diddle-diddle , my baby 's ok
charisse :
the heather on the hill from brigadoon .
you ar my lucky star
charisse :
gene inspired a whole new generation of stars .
one of the brightest was a young calforna girl named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary frances reynolds when i entered the miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gwns created by the world-famous designer adrian were part of the tretmnt .
s well as makeup and hair departments that could accomplish any style imaginable .
a star like joan crawford would somtimes hav her look redesigned numerous times until it matched the exact mod of the role she was to play .
yu stepped out of a dream
yu are too wonderful to be what you seem
could there be eyes like yours ?
honst and truly ?
yo stepped out of a clud
n 1941 , the glamor age had reached ts zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone and apart out of a dram
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream seqnce to the sng a lady loves in the flm i love melvin 
loves a penthouse where she 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her breakfast try
but now and then pack and sail away
for a simple riviera holiday
reynolds :
now , at last , you can see our differing points of view .
she loves her dreams tied up with apron strings
just little pots and pans
and he 'll be handsme wll , mor or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look nice oh  never mind the price
a lady loves beaucoup i'amour
but first of all she loves to be secure
yet there is one vital thought she will place above
all of the things i make mention of
and what is more a lady loves to live
and what s mre a lady lives to love
thanks fr the present of the silver-ble mink
thanks for the yacht and for the solidgold sink
thanks a lot , bt no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of th pwer of the dvastating fmale over the hapless male from it 's always fair weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and for the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am just a faithful lassie
and there 's no gift however classy
by which this lassie can be had
thanks for losn ' your mnd
thanks a lt , but n
no thanks
 do n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm trying not to do
rynolds :
in torch song , joan crawford made her final musical film as a fading legend performing in tropicl makep for the song two-faced woman .
the recording was n't a new one at mgm .
it 's ben suggested that they may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
 ca n't help being a two-faced woman
a little bit of boldness a little bit of sweetness
a little bit of coldness a little bit of heatness
do n't fall in love with a two-faced woman
got another lover under cover
that goes with the breeze
my disposition
that 's why they cll her a two-faced woman
a lttle bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a little bit of heatness
blck and white wrong and right
they call me two-faced womn
reynolds :
in the early 1940s hollywood began a fascination with things tropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported audiences away from cold climates and the troubled times of a world war .
many latin artists were recruited to add n authentic sound to these films .
one of the mst popular was xavier cugt and his orchestra .
rynolds :
rcardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the ltin lover , driving femle audiences wild .
reynolds :
he 's got the kind of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just like was beating in mine
but yo make it 109 and there is more to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reynlds :
like this before
reynolds :
one fthe performers at mgm whom i dmired the most was the legndary len horne .
or when
for th first time
seem to be happening again
it was a long time ago i stood in this very spot and recorded that lvely song 
when i first walked onto this recording stage in 1942 it looked pretty much as it does today .
i recorded ll of the music for my movies her and it is still considered hllywood s greatest recording stage .
i never felt like i rally belonged in hollywod .
so i usually just came on , sang a song nd made a quick exit .
just one of those crazy things
yeah , i got to sing a great cole porter tune in a featured appearance but what i rally wanted was to be given an acting role in the movies .
just ne of those fabulous flights
if we thought a bit of the end of it
we 'd have been aware that our love affair
was too hot not to cool down
here 's hoping we meet now and then
but it was just
said that gal , du barry
ai n't it the truth ?
in 1943 ,  got to play a part .
georgia brwn in cabin in the sky 
love is a rippling ' brok
you got to bait your hook
rise and shine
and cast your line
ai n't it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truth ?
it 's the trth
the truth
horne 
in 1946 , i playd the role of julie in an excerpt from show boat in till the clouds roll by .
i was bing considered for the part for the 1951 version of shw boat but the prodction code office had banned interracial romance n the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good frend ava grdner .
the studio had av rehearse singing the role to the rcrdings that i had made hoping to get the part which annyd us both .
gardner :
fish got t swm , birds got to fly
ca n't help lovin ' that man of mne
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
thogh ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that  did n't get the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but when he comes back
that day is fine
s late as can be
ca n't hlp
horne :
i was not the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get your gun , betty hutton was a big hit as annie oakley .
judy garland had begun filming the rol and cmpleted two numbrs when she suffered a breakdown and had to be replaced .
retrievd at last from the mgm film vaults s judy 's version of i 'm an indian too .
like those indians
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
 sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
 'm an hnest injun indian
i 'm an indian , to
folks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see , whatevr conflicts judy strggled with as a person she always came through as an entertainer .
garland :
when you 're ot with a feller in the pale moonlight
yu do n't have t lok in a bok t find
what h thinks of the moon nd wht is on his mind
bt they cash them just the same
grandpa dick was always sck
he just died at 93
don ' what comes naturally
the quick toboggan when you reach the heights
horne :
words nd music ws the last time tht judy and mickey roney worked together at mgm nding the most popular song and dance team the stdio would evr hv .
garland :
no more pain
the pulled-out fur f ct and cur
judy garlnd and i grew up together at mgm and completed high school between long days of shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 picturs tgether and even when we worked separately we turned to each other for friendship and encouragement .
we were the very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her very much .
teach m how to sing
music with a modern rhythm let me swing
mr. mendelssohn swing
music is a thing
that 's no good without that rhythm
sweet and hot fast and slow
hey , swing it lw
and swing it mr. mendelssohn swing
rooney :
in love finds andy hardy judy laments th fact that she 's not a little girl any longer and not quite a grownp either .
grownups ignore me
and in every sense
i 'm just on a fence
i 'm just an in-between
for a few years , judy was an inbetween .
thy found it in her first starring role 
dorthy gale in the wizard of oz .
toto , i hav a feeling we 're not in kansas anymore .
we must be over the rainbow .
follow the yellow brick road follow the yellow brick road
follow the yellow brick road
because of the wonderful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to become the most widely seen motion picture of all time and judy 's wonderful performance in the picture earned her a special academy award which i was lucky enough to present to her .
thank you .
will you do that ?
somewhere over the ranbow
birds fly over th rainbow
why , thn
i like new york in jun , how abot yu ?
i like a gershwin tune , how about yo ?
i love a fireside when a storm is due
how about you ?
rooney :
loks like we both agree
on what to do
down on an island , the southern seas
there lived a lassie named minnie breeze
garland :
and all th natives would be so sd
if minnie evr left trinidad
came back to trinidad
who , stole my heart away
who , maks me dream ll day
seems as though i 'll ever be blue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one of the studio 's most valuable assets and made a special gust appearance as marilyn millr in th jerome kern biography , till the clouds rll by .
march on , little doagies
here are judy , ry bolger , cyd charisse , and a cast of hndreds in a never-before-seen march of th doagies .
garland :
we do n't know where we 're gon '
till we 're past the last fence rail
out there breaks the day
oh , we do n't know where we 're goin '
but we 'r on our way
me for a campfre out on the trail
me for an old cayuse
nd i 'm all set to vamoose
and nobody askng me why give me a cowhand song
are marching ' on
out there lies the prairie
this is judy at the top of hr career .
playing on his slide trombone
in a certain monotone
he was known as mr. monotony
ny pleasant interlude
but th same dull melody
would mrge from mr. montony
folks for miles would run away
she would come around and say
ca n't play
today
it only happens when  dance with you
rooney :
another legend at metro was my good friend fred astaire who always romanced a glamorous prtner in his motion pctures .
in easter parade , it was the one and only ann miller .
astaire :
why does it happen , dear
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks
are yours and mine
i 'v danced with dozens of others
that only happns with you
but fred astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on nd he put me at ease right awy .
come on , annie , let 's do it one more time 
good evening .
miss marlowe .
astaire :
i 've seen it often enugh .
i 'll try .
that 's fine .
harry , give us the pickup on that gang number , will you , please ?
it was a little more than a guest appearanc for fred for he was son to be under contract to rko pictures where they wre about to team him wth ginger rogers causng  string of hit msicls to follow .
frd did nt return to mgm until seven years later at which time he starrd with elenor powell in broadway melody f 1940 .
miller :
in 1945 , fred and a new partner , lucille bremer stepped out to cffee tim in yolanda and the thif .
its director , vncente minnelli .
that 's for me
i 'm drum crazy , yes i 'm drum crazy , yes
i 'm plumb crazy for drums
miller :
fred could make music out of almost nything .
and he often fund new challenges that stretched his talents .
astaire :
first , sft vlins
when the drum takes the melody
when the drum carries the tune
miller :
hard-boiled private eyes wre all the rage in the '50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse 
she came at me in sections .
more curves than a scenic railway .
she ws dangerous .
i would n't trust her any farther than i could throw her .
she was selling hard , but i was n't buying .
miller :
in the brkleys of broadway , they dance the swing trt under the min titles of the picture , but with the titles remved nother muscal gem is revaled from the most beloved dance tam of ll time .
it 's bill and coo-y , tea for two-y
just watch your prtner 's eyes grow dewy
entrenous-y you 're slightly screwy
oh , what a natural they 'v hit upon it gets you going till you 're really gone
and you will never rue the day
the day you relize the swing trot is here to stay
gon na leav my footsteps on the sands of time
if i never leave a dime

oh , no .
i thought ...
aw , shucks .
i absolutely agree .
s ?
it 's silly , running arund like this .
we 'r gettin ' nowhere .
he 's right .
so why do n't we just discuss this thing and reason something out calmly ...
i 'm with you .
fine .
yeah .
we bettr get the cars off that curve .
ok .
fine .
see you over there .
over ther .
ver there .
i 'm connecting you now .
santa rosit police station .
matthews .

so i 'll stay late after school .
sheriff , crckett county .
that s where the smiler is .
i wonder f anything happened .
grtie , will you put that call through hre ?
how about a little coffee , schwartz ?
culpeper .

what happened ?
afraid we got some bad news for you .
grogan 's cashed in his chips .
he wht ?
he was makín  a break , all ríght .
where did it happen ?
were there any witnesses ?
was he killed outright ?
see what they sad .
you wait for 15 years to solve a really importnt case , and just whn you get ...
it 's all right , chief .
i 'll get t for you .
he did it again .
get that fella 's number !
get that fella 's number !
item :
item :
it 's them .
say , we just made all four of em parkd along the side of the road .
thy 're just standing there talking .
over .
and stay by the radío .
the mn said there was a certain amont of money bured in this park .
that 's right .
it was under a big w .
i suggest that we quietly get into our cars and drive down there at  safe , sound speed keeping each other in sight of each othr .
he 's got a point .
t 's ok .
now what 's with this fair shares for everybody 
lok , ma'am .
quarters ?
you three each get a quarter , and benjy and i have t split a quarter ?
what are you tryin ' to pull ?
it seems fair to me .
it just chets us , that 's all !
$ 350,000 divided by four is ...
so you thre would get 87,500 bucks and benjy and i have to split it .
yeah .
yeah .
what ?
ca n't you count ?
there wer eight of us there !
my wife and i would be happy with ...
hold it .
let 's just put it back the way it was before .
either one qrter for each car , includin ' the van , or one fifth for ech guy .
one qarter or one fifth .
how dare you ?
chief , we got a stuaton here that is absolutely incredbl .
see ?
 think they 're arguing abut something .
and a crckett county unit has got 'em under bservation .
that 's eight shares for tht .
four shares for that .
that 's 12 shares alredy 
then fiv of us went down to the wreck .
we give five shares for that .
now we add the same number of shares as thre were people in each vehicle .
that s three for your group , two for yours , tw for us and one for you .
$ 14,000 per share .
and that covers everything including the emancipation of women !
wait  minute .
but no matter how you figure it out , i still do n't get s much as anybody else .
right ?
we , us , we gt 84,000 .
what do you mean , tax-fre ?
i mean , if we go down to this park and we uncover the money and we ...
i 'm sure he 's not gon na declare anything .
i know he s not gon na dclre anything .
lok , can you explain it to him , please ?
but what he was trying t say is ...
even businessmen that rb and steal and cheat from pople very dy .
i give up .
anybody got a fairer plan , go ahead .
there were eight of us there , so that simply means ight shares .
we re gon n get noplace listening t this old bg 
lady , are you tryin ' to split us up so it becomes every man for himself ?
and every woman for himself ?
please do n't argue .
look !
we figured it 17 different ways 
so good luck , and may the best man win !
all right .
there 's money in this for all of us .
thre 's enough for you , there 's enugh for you and for me , and for you , and there 's enough for ...

i ws gon na offer you a share , just for takin ' us to a phone .
do n't you see ?
he ll get there first .
the rest of s wo n't get a dime 
you can believe that .
but look here .
even if she does get all the mney surely it wo n't affect our agreement .
she would n't brek her word .
i 'd still be enttled to ten per cent as agreed , surely .
surely ( !
and then that dirty , rotten , slimy bum double-crossed me .
well , did yo get him ?
maybe he went out for the papers .
we can kep on tryin ' .

we just might be the last ones there .

somebody must 've taken them the ther way .
besides , we ca n't be sure they 'll be there .
i do n't know what t do .
look , surely the most sensible thing is for the two of us to press on !
and even if he were the first there , he still has to find the money , has n't he ?
now , i earnestly recommend that we press on with all possible disptch .
we 'll press on with all possible dispatch .
and i do n't really think that personal rancour is going to help the situation if i may say so .
come on , hurry up

two yers more i have to study for my master 's degree .
then four years more as a laboratory assistant .

good lad .
if yo do n't come now , the goose will be ...
aye , and withut  pause for lunch or tea .
now then , from whch volcano could this piece of lava have emerged ?
mount etna ?
very clse .
the lipari island group off the coast of italy .
tht 's exactly what stmped me .
but that would be celandc peridotite .
precisely .
there s a piece chipped off 
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
when i saw this , i stopped chipping .
looks like a letter r som ntches .
three notches made by the hand of man .
what s your concluson ?
science does not jump to conclsions .
w 're going to melt off the crust of lava .
mr paisley .
not too fast , you know .
i shll write to professor goetabrg f stockholm about this .
he 's the leading athority on volcanoes .
four hours ?
jenny !
are you all right ?
that was entirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't knw how it could have hppened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendered an inestimable service to scince .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
nt only looks like it is a plumb bob .
can you make out what it says , professor ?
it 's in some nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possbly .
look at this side , sir .
a sgnature .
arne saknus ...
arne saknussem .
or do i have to go alne ?
it 's unthinkable , but it must be true .
a man took some tools nd went where no human bing has ever set foot .
nto the interor of th earth , alone .
the laughter stopped when he disappeard , never to be heard from .
until tonight .
get ut of here , woman 
i did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shouting at me , sir oliver .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you hve n't slept !
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncle oliver .
no answer !
where is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to get here from stockholm ?
answer the bell .
did it ring ?
callers  callers .
i 'm involved in smething important .
more important than our university ?
what does the name arne saknussem mean to you , gentlemen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study of volcanoes .
out of a volcan came this message from him .
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , ws probably picked up by some pesant , gathered dust n a curiosty shop till it came to me .
whoever descnds into the crater of sneffls yocul can reach the center of the earth .
arne saknussem .
the center of the earth ?
an extinct volcano in iceland .
but  oliver , this is sher fantasy .
you hve n't heard all of it .
at sunrse on the last day of may the mountain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm mre mystfied than ever .
scartars ?
t s a mountain peak near the volcano .
but this is a student 's hoax .
let 's not take that tone .
more than anything , you must consult ther experts .
and i 've written to the foremost authorty in europe .
more eminent still 
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunately i 'v not yet receivd his reply .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent sees fit t answer you .
and in the meantime we could do with a cup of tea .
think whatver you want !
jenny , te !
just this moment , sir liver .
look .
well , he 's got his letter from stockholm .
did you se the shine in his eyes 
there 'll never be a better moment to tell him about our felings for each other .
he 'll say yes almost inadvertntly .
what if he says no dvertently ?
you wait and see how firm my voice can be when i spak of you .
blast and damn !
bad news  sir ?
his disappearance follows closely the date my commnicatin must have reached him .
or too important .
mcewen , go directly to th harbor .
oliver , calm down 
you heard saknussem 's message .
oliver , you 're seriously ill .
i am sriously well .
what are you waiting for ?
 told yo t hurry .
if you 'll excuse me , i must start packing .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've n time .
you must take time for this , sir .
what re you so urgent about 
this is the most urgent moment of my life .
i have to be in iceland .
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturally .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i g
i wish i could sing loud enough for jenny to hear me .
t is a bit painful to leve her on the first day of our engagement .
to come back to her as a world-famous scentist is not to be snzed at .
come here .
i neglected to tell you , sir .
well , yo 'll get over that after the first million fathms or so .
he 's been surveying here .
your revered colleague from stockholm .
he is n't wasting any time .
do you think he 's already gone down ?
no .
buy all the rope avalable .
you think we can prepare it all so quickly ?
what 's that you 're taking ?
jenny 's farewell gift .

but every pice f rope , very lmp , everything we 'd need was sold .
to professr goetaborg .

a fellow prisoner , d you suppose ?

perhaps t 's in icelandic .
my esteemed friend , whoever you are , let me introduce myself .
professor oliver lndnbrook , university of edinburgh .
may i ask you to interrupt your tapping for a moment and listen ?
in what language would you lke me to speak ?
he does n't understand english .

we 'll observe one minute of silnce in memory of a great scientist , even if he was a blasted thief .
alec , you mntioned fate .
slight correction .
fate plus a few grains of potassim cyanide .
he was against someon who was even more aginst him .
who ?
 'm the wife of professr goetaborg .
oh , my dear .
wo n't you sit down fr a mnute before you go up ?
please , my dear 
early in the mornng he went to the mountin .
when he cam back for lunch he received his guest right in the lobby .
they went up t his room and ate .
what are you trying to tll me ?
in the evening when the maid wnt to make the bed ...
oh , dear god !
as long as i can remember , no one ever died in my inn !
he was joking on the pier in stockholm .
madam , my deep sympathy .
my nme
oliver lindnbrook of edinburgh niversity 
professor lindenbrook .
i see you are 
this will be difficult for you , mdam , but it must be faced .
who was the last person to see him alive ?
i did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each other very day .
i suggest that yu have an autopsy performed immediately .
neither he nor i could suspect thre was a third party who would stop at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deeply distressed by your husband 's death , and i fully understand your felings .
however , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan to dspose of the equpment your hsband assembled up ther ?
what dos it matter nw ?
i ll take it off your hands .
your expediton ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from me .
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encontr .
a saknussm descendant turns up acts as if he were king of volcanos .
tries to force me to surrender his ancestr 's secret .
saknussem called agin .
new complication .
must fight him somehow .
young man , wuld you come here a moment , ples ?
who are thos for 
that 's a beginning .
what about lamps ?
lamps .
put me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in icelnd ?
but i wsh to pologize to you in plain englsh .
i went through my hsband 's diary  and some of his remarks led me to believe i did you an njstice .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't know .
do n't give it another thought .
i sha n't .
began and that 's all it has done .
sir liver , this mrning you asked me for thse .
if you still want them , they 're yours .
will you say that agin ?
madam .
my husband had these boots made specially .
i hope they fit you .
i told your man to order some for me immediately .
good , good .
why would yu need bots like this ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm coming along .
that 's why i 'm giving you all of this .
it 's a condition .
i thought you nderstood .
you did n't mention any condition .
then i d now .
whom did yo intend to take along , besides ths young man ?
then i 'll be very useful .
he des n't understand a word of english .
we 're not contemplatng a stroll down pccadlly or the champs élysées .
professr lindenbrook , i have just lost my husband .
the police require your presence for th investigatin nto the death .
but , madam , quit apart from the appalling danger , think of the inconvenienc .
the lack of privacy .
n short , yu do n't want ll f this .
i may be md on the subject of this jurney , but  am not stupid !
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbance to men , nevr a burden .
you 'll sleep wher w sleep , eat what we eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept my proposition .
professor , look !
now we descend into oblivin or ... we enter the great book of history .
carla goetaborg .
alexander mcewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans and wh ?
professor !
professor !
hns is tying the rope on her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you have told hm that ?
and then there 's always th blssed chance the rop may break .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solcitous 
if only you culd see your face .
yu do .
perhaps this is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no other way to contine .
eureka !
thank you .
now then , a general summary .
a :
b :
as my husband 's charts indicated .
onward .
and let 's have some music .
the last news was that they went up mount sneffels wth some heavily laden dnkeys .
yes ?
nd then the animals came down without their packs .
oliver s lindenbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what 's it ?
a woman !
a slght tremor , coming from undefined regions .
let us proceed .
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us 
the three notches of rne saknussem .
what does that mean ?
look .
we might have taken any one of these channls .
but our great collague maketh  path for our feet .
let us have tea .
with a double ration of risins .
may i cmb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen n the right .
what is it , madam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmares , we 'd have made different sleeping arrangements .
someone is walking up there .
human footsteps .
the hearing of all women is extremely acte .
my wife used to hear rats in the attic , usally the nights before i had an important lecture 
lec , go p and find out .
they need rest .
mreover , it was stipulated that i give the orders .
ther 's no need t use that patient voic with me .
would yo rther i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i am a member of this expediton , and as such  intend to report any observation i make .
alec .
put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right hre 
conceal these marks completely .
i 'll give them som new ones .
starting from an estimtd depth of 129km , lmestone formation continues 
here are the thre notches again .
god .
let 's see .
one heads 220º south-southwest , the other 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quite .
what 's he saying ?
hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expedition .
alec , suppse you tell him .
well , why does man freeze to death trying to reach the north pole ?
once a qeston has arisen in the human brain , the answer must be found if it taks 100 years .
1,000 years .
let 's hear you render that into a few well-chosen icelandic words .
why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries ?
are you all right 
can you unhook yourself 
grab his hand .
nver mind abot that .
how is it possible ?
this way was clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissur .
this has been here since the beginning of tim .
i ws not in a positin to observe it scientifically .
bt where ?
we 're supposed to stay together .
tricked into the wrong tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam ... heard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she 's saying t .
we must return .
why ?
you knw that .
but if there is a madman loose ...
he 's against all f us 
against the very concept of this journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to where alec fell .
but t 's not on our rout .
if we 're to go ahead , we have no time for detours .
then you wait here .
madam , now that the boy has gone and hans does n't understand english ,
i 'm blushing alredy .
professor !
yes , i thought so .
lec !
i 've got to take a specimen of ths back to edinburgh , if it 's the last thing  do .
unique .
where the devil is he ?
it s a blind ally !
keep back !
hans !
good god !
that 's it .
praise the lord !
alec .
professor !
hello !
professor !
professor !
hre i am 
salt .
professor .
professor , you ca n't go on this way .
i 've kpt track of the passage of days .
you have n't .
we 'll try the cross-channel over there .
you wo n't find him there .
i 've got to find him .
i 'm responsible .
i can see that this is a recent break .
if you 're down there , give us a sign !
lec , listn carefully .
when the echoes stop , yu must try to answer .
pick up a pebble and scratch the rock .
just give us a sign .
how can i live with myself ?
yo must continue with what you started .
it was his project as much as it was yours .
we will proceed .
down there , food and water .
s you 've lost your friends ?
just as well .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out f place here .
i 'm in  hurry .
to steal the prfessor 's project ?
you need me as much as i need you .
you found me .
my friends culd find me too .
very well .
you 'll carry it wth ne arm , not two !
it 's a multiple echo , reverberating through the rock chambers .
the last echo will give us the direction .
alec .
alec .
alec !
professor .
wher was he ?
 did n't think he 'd shoot , but he did 
of course  did .
you are trespassers here .
you are als the murderer of my husband .
he would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of your gret ancestor , put dwn that preposterous gun .
you 're not going to listen to a murderer ?
never interrupt a murderer  mdam .
i resent that bourgeois classification .
you hav my word of honor .
give me your hand on that .
a burgeois trick .
so sorry .
we have to hold court .
guilty .
guilty .
then th mndatory sentence is deth .
we will follow the route marked by th notches .
no  no , no , no , no .
i can carry something with my left hand .
you can carry yourself for a couple of days .
that 's all we cn expect .
it s a court order .
it seems his family have ben loyal to the saknussems for generations and , wll  he can not touch the gun .
this is cntempt of court 
no , no , professor ..
i mean , sir oliver .
you must n't look at me .
oh , no 
you ... you could n't consider for a moment that i could do t .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weeks you 've ben denying your sex , and nw you fall back on it .
i would say the natural exectioner would be the leader f the expedition .
we 're much to civilized to ...
what do yo propose ?
drag him with us ?
stop fiddling with those lamps .
the lamps are giving out .
to save what we can , i insist that w leave these regions at once .
you insist ?
what 's the harm ?
the harm is , madam , that he 's wsting a lamp .
madam , make a final note , whil you 've still light enough to write by .
let me , madam .
this may be our last entry .
hans and i can cut some rope into some torches .
what puzzles me s that the three notches of old arne saknussem still keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on neither do yu , sir oliver .
ys , just switch it off .
why , it 's miraculous !
look at this .
what is it  sir ?
light without heat .
a cool , chemical light .
the same principle is involved here .
256th day .
the phenomenal winds vanished as abrptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbrook expedition , yu 've written mcewen expedition ?
may i remind you that months ago you gave me explicit orders t that effect ?
yu my not remind me 
i do not wish to be corrected by you incssantly .
you 're doing it with your looks , the inflection of your voice , the very posture of yor body .
your entire presence is a constnt criticism f m .
i 've had enough .
well , let me tell yu , you dried-up walnut of a man , f anyone 's had enough , it 's me 
it 's i .
t 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla goetaborg !
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ...
well , at least you know i have a temper .
and from now on alec will keep the charts .
alec !
why ca n't h stay around ?
a forest of mushrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grw without sun this far under the earth !
it 's tougher than leather .
it s like an oak tree .
mushroom steak , mushroom soup , mshroom hash .
after some months of this , you 'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef .
if we only knew how many more .
there 's n term to the work of a scentist .
but that 's not professor lindenbrook 's feeling .
and what is the name of the girl yo love ?
the girl y love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
but why would yu want to know that just now ?
dear alec !
professor ?
here 's som hot mushroom porridge for you , sir oliver 
i slept as i never slept in edinburgh .
i may mov her permanently .
i do n't know .
is tht madman still givng orders ?
the minte you fell asleep he went off n that direction , through the tunnl .
what in the world can he want with all those ?
you 've come to ask me why i did n't take my rst period .
i d nt sleep .
i hte those little slices of death .
it 's a sea .
it 's an ocean with waves and currents .
the fissures closed again .
it 's the prerogative of the discoverer .
i congratulate you .
a dimetrodon !
if i had my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swim ?
no , thank god .
here .
i wnder if it 's cld where they ar .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hand !
my watch !
save the instruments .
my ring !
my wedding ring .
a field of force that snatches gold way .
this is it !
ths is it !
the junction of magnetic frces from the north pole and south pol !
gertrude .
nd his highness over there .
after all , we did hit the center of the earth .
he wants to know where we go from here .
tred minds do n't pln well 
sleep first , plan later .
oliver , the dy may come when you 'd very much like to have that porridge .
is it ncredible t yu that i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , duck .
gertrde ?
gertrude ?
gertrude !
gertrude !
hans !
why do you look at me like that ?
hans 
i needed food , so i took it 
stop this fol !
hans !
you ingrates !
what can you d without me ?
this is the sunken city .
after 5,000 years , behold a fragment of the lost atlantis .
all we know about it comes from the greek 
the floor of the sea opened up and swallwed the whole island f atlantis .
this must hve been the market square .
eating .
well , we 've learned one thing abut the inhabtants of atlantis .
stal bread .
we must speak to the baker .
madam !
madam !
já ?
exactly .
to think that at a moment like this i ve no pad and pencil to record it all .
turn around , madam .
what is it ?
look at that tibia 
you wo n't find nything edible in ther .
the chinese eat eggs over 400 years old .
gunpowder .
it 's pointing somewhere .
of course !
this is the way up .
a dirct hatchway to the surface .
and we can climb p .
let him venture 100 meters or so on reconnoiter .
the updraft ca n't crry hm away .
now i 'd say let 's roll up our sleeves if we had any .
we must n't hope for mch .
this light wo n't stay with us .
i 'll comb every inch f atlantis .
kai-ai !
kai-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be walking in darkness .
i wish i had better news .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward , straighter thn the one we descended .
there 's an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway .
hns sad only  landslide could ever move it .
if his hopes hd n't been so high ...
alec 
yes , sir ?
the haversack arne saknssem 's haversack .
get it .
i guarantee that this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrunding rocks will take the disturbance lightly , i can not guarantee .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear god , ruler of heaven and erth ...
do n't set ny limit to his realm , laddie .
god of the universe , we are in thy merciful hands .
look out !
 mnster !
let me go !
it 's an earthquake of unusual magnitude !
more likely it 's a vlcanic eruption .
stromboli , italy .
the capsule of the dead volcan broke under  tremendous explosion .
rocks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sea .
dammi una mano .
piano .
piano .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrown from the altar stone ... long befor we hit the water .
non si preoccupi .
 'm most grateful , ladies , but my immedit need is not a ladder .
pantalons .
pntaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
fellow scots , if these shouts of yors express some pleasure that we 've returned alive , i thank yo deeply .
however , if they 're meant as praise for a successful scientist ,
i must disclaim that hnor .
a scientist who can not prove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
i have no records , no shred of vidence .
i will never embarrass this distinguished university by asking that it take my word .
this , i know :
the spirit of man can not be stopped .
splendid , oliver .
professor , here 's someone who wants to say goodbye .
hans  old friend .
did you get your injries when the volcano blew up , in the hot lava ?
he was n such a hurry leaving the church , he fll all the way down th steps .
after all that waiting .
it 's been no marriage for yu at all .
you underestimate alec .
i 'm taking the night train to london and then back to stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you have a job to do here in edinburgh .
i intend to write my memoirs .
what you need is a widow who can jog your memory and take dictation .
no , nne of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend one 's days and nghts with  man under the earth , another under one rof in scotland .
what did i say 
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
frau goetaborg !
yes ...
carla ..
i warn you ...

jasmin refuses to choose a husband .

and i 'm ging bck .
ok .
charlie , i 'm not your dad .
good .
right .
science .
one kid even gave me his lunch money
always have .
oh , look , i got this one from a street fight .
look at that 
i got an appendix scar .
bar , bear ...
listen , it 's not the scar , all right ?
ok , girls , if you think that was something .
personal record .
well , the skeleton lectre sounded awfl interesting ,
so i thought i 'd vary my routine a little .
clss :
park it , mr. anthony ,
and lose the bldes .
catch you later , claire 
teacher :
all right , everyone , settl down .
and chaz anthony 's not .
honor society girls never like honor society guys .
trust me on this on .
sounds like a risky game plan to me .
and now i 'm nacting a stratgy
just like any good psy --
of course , alone , it 's not much good .
to actually move .
thank you .
now , how many bones do you thnk are in your feet ?
big finish .
i just wish you 'd use your powers for good , not evil .
what are you tlking about ?
thre are geniuses your age , you know .
i was tlking to a colleague over at northern .
he was telling me about a young man --
who was it that helpd you ?
lik i said , some lser in science clb .
now , who wants to come up here
and finish chartng these points on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricature
you know ...
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have become openly hostile .
not t mention the dorm food .
well , the only fathrly advice i can give you bout th science stuff
is just kep pluggng way .
a tutor !
dd , you 're a genius !
genius ?
my first f .
your first f .
what am i saying ?
bt why are you so happy about getting yor first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i guess they 're gon na kick me ot of school
f i do n't get better grades .
and i would care because ...
you 're pretty ok .
c n't you find anyon else ?
i mean , well , you wer the first one on my list .
maybe we could work something out .
then i guess i should start practicing .
oh , grt .
just what i want to do after school ,
mor school 
take it .
fine .
hw nothing lsts forever
well , they 're wrong
yeah
you stood strong
you 've got the key to my heart
'cause i
it seems so long ago
when my world was upside-down
hey , nice ...
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you know , just to say thnks nd all .
that 's good , is n't that ?
i men , that 's what we 're supposed to b listening to , right ?
thank you .
hey , so , wht 's with the museum ?
he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey , daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ...
i 'm just going to get my things here 
chaz ?
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i would have loved to have seen coach addison 's face .
i 'm glad he did n't see mine .
 had to smooth things over with claire , too .
that was 20 miles of rough road on the apology turnpike .
hey , doc ?
you ver have a girlfriend ?
yeah , sure .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it , charlie .
and still  there 's no sign of a graviton .
well , maybe if we take our minds off it ,
you know , if we sit back , relax 
and , uh  have a little fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
whenever he had a problem that he could n't slve ,
eurka !
come n , danc with me .
oh , no  i do n't think so .
uh , you do n't want to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any different .
only as a particle up until now .
we can just as easily think of it as a wave .
you said so in your book .
microwave conflict .
how cold i mss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
st p a phased harmonic ,
ffected the nuclear matrix ,
n other words , groovy little house beat
just unlocked the mysteries of the universe 
we did it , charlie !
this is big !
we fnd the graviton .
oh , man !
can w do it later though ?
i 'm knd of late for science class .
maybe you just had a good tutor .
but you are going t met one .
i got to thinking it might be good for you to meet a kid your age
who 's not ashamd of being smart .
he can probably use some one-on-one
with a kid who 's not ashamed to kick his butt .
clss :
yes , well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arranged a field trip today to northern .
doc !
doc !
i got to show you something really cool .
oh .
oh  what ?
what am i going to do ?
wait .
wait  wait , wait , wit .
6 shades f purple ?
thank you very much .
thank you and welcome .
the youngst particle physicist
a terrible lab accident has left young mr. boyle
temporrily disfigured .
but lucky scientist that he s ,
h has agreed to come out and talk to you anyway ,
mr. chrli boyle .
charlie ?
charli , in gravely voice :
thank you , fellow teens .
will eventually subside .
snce i am in obvious discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let professor krickstein
well , uh ...
psst !
just talk amongst yourselvs .
what ?
how do i get the purple stuff ff my fce ?
t 's starting to burn .
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is -- is pretty much like the universe --
i got ta g pay the water bill .
xcuse me .
krickstein :
chaz ?
this is a very valuble clue as thymin is changed to uracil .
uh , here at the university , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
yo 're the main one i wanted to meet charlie boyl .
from the head of the anthrpology --
nd schedul another field trip .
i 'm sure i can convince charlie to come back .
what are you ding to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
what re yu doing ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
ok .
i can do it myself .
he 's fine  he 's fine .
relly .
you kids do your homework .
bye .
i decided to move my stuff back n .
i need som help .
you ..
with what 
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
yu have everythng .
i culd say the sme about you .
women , poise ...
women .
losing my scholarship ,
in a chese factory .
not a bad trade-ff .
yeah , right .
look , i want more than that out of life , charlie .
what 's her name ?
s-shut up .
listen to me .
everything you 've learned --

right in the middle of her routine ,
the heavens opened up
and her whole attitude changed .
in a snow globe .
hmph !
you 're the most beautiful thing i 've ver sen .
couple of days .
hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the people up there think i m a genius ,
and then the other half think i 'm a pnk .
hey , i m gng to se the partcle accelerator while you 're gone .
might as well get some work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck dwn here .
mi particle accelerator es su partcle accelerator .
it 's the only on we got .
welcome to northern lights hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle ccelerator .
and i wanted to say thanks for passing me .
hey , yu hav nobody to thank but yourself .
so , uh ..
here 
it 's from me and the guys .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goin ' down .

i d n't know of any way to defnd against it .
i might .
go home !
to the conference champonshp game ,
boy :
come on , dude .
all right , now the 3 to worry about are stoker ,
nw cross will usually distract the referee here ,
whil stoker and rydr rack our bst player ,
which is me .
we send somebody else out there with my number ,
that 's your plan ?
but -- but --
and yo 'd come out wth a phony number .
i like it 
hy , i 'm a genius .
hugo , suit up !
ladies nd gentlemen ,

he wore yur golden goalie ma --
clire , lt me explain .
explain ?
just what was all of this ?
was t one of your xperiments ?
were you making a study of the local culture ?
then i guess you were just having a laugh at my expens .
imagine , me thnking i cold teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fat liar 
i also left the particle accelerator on !
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
announcer :
do not venture ont the ic !
gt off the ice !
this game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , nd we were this close .
this close !
this is bad , coch .
thnks , kid .
you probably just cost me my job .
i never want to see you again .

mostly i want to apologiz to my friends .
you re the best ones i ever had .
please forgive me .
well , if it is n't the con artist
formerly knwn as chaz .
claire :
come on , guys .
wht are you reading ?
breakaway .
i love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron finds , uh , subatomic particles
and how they 're connected to a mysterios quantum force .
oh  yeah .
but you know something ?
it was , uh , genev , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able t split a photon ,
and even though the particles are 6 miles apart ,
whatever one does , the other one does
cool !
and maybe unlock the secret as to how it works .
and then .
defy gravty .
let 's get to work .
and the output level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the rubbr coating ?
they all act like superballs .
and when i press this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i can make amends
well  with what we just discvered ,
i fgured out a way to help northern beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can kep his job ,
and my frends 'll be hppy with me agin ,
and maybe ..
clire might like me again , too .
a little .
you have n't let me down .
you saved me !
charlie , i could never have done this without yu !
you 're my friend .
thanks , doc .
but i got t g .
why are you here ?
i need help .
i figured out a way to help the team tonight ,
kep rumsen from cheting ,
no .
why d n't you just leave us alone ..
i ca n't do it alone .
yeah !
welcome to northern arena !
this is base ops .
vido ?
roger that .
blades ?
that i am here under extreme protest ,
and i 'm only doing this so my fathr does n't wnd up
stag managng the ice capades .
skates , rumsen bus should be in target range ...
now .
roger tht , ops .
video 's in place , ops .
roger , video 
hey , deion .
how 's it going ?
where 's blades ?
right here .
let 's just hope this works .
mike , yu know they 're comin ' after yo .
first sign of trble , i 'm pullin ' you ot !
yo just try and do that !
fr the re-scheduled centrl confernce championship
how 's this supposed to work gain ?
how is that possible ?
like the super balls i showed you .
correspondng microchips with other gravton halves
whatever our skates do , ther skates will be forced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c in science .
you sre did a number on this lab .
nah .
besides  i 've arranged hs schedule so that he 'll be gone all day .
and he 's never here during hockey games .
almost never .
this hs gone way too far !
i told yo i had to do what i had to d .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop right now .
you know i 'm on your side .
ahead of what ?
you can solve all the mysteries in the world ,
but what would it mean without friends ?
the chanc to make up for all the selfish things i did ...
so please ...
chaz 
od , tight up .
omar , you 're in !
mike , get off !
we got ta stop the rumsen rack .
deion , flip the switch .
take ...
that !
yeah !
power play !
number 2 
i 'm stoker .
you 'r ryder .
let s g !
whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leaving the box .
he 's out of control !
do something !
he 's heading straight for mike !
i ca n't find it !
i have the other chip !
aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !
hey .
wha , we 're too light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reversed the charge f the gravitons !
they re rpelling against the positive charge of the earth !
game announcer :
the fnal scor -- northern 1 , rumsen nothing !
a long , long time .
yeah .
that 's what i cll publicity .
ha ha ha !
i 'm proud of you .
i 'll take smithsn .
then i 'll take van bonn .
man , you 're sticking m with him ?
look , i 'm gettin ' good 
look .
t 's good , huh ?
and today he 's learning on your team .
hey , listen , if you want us to get off the ice ...
ok .
we 'll just clear out .
come on , guys .
if you 're nterested .
us ?
we heard bout what you did .
how 'd you find out ?
ok .
what ?
hey ...
i can float .
uh .
come on , guys , let 's go !
ca n't we mark it rest in peace ?
not as long as scientists try to prove porpoises have brains rivaling man 's .
even sprhuman .
and they thnk that he might be teaching them ?
tht 's right , lieutenant 
but admirl ...
is that a god likenss ?
perfect .
yes .
at least that 's the way he looked before ..
well , you know ..
how he was when ...
and this taken by one of our divers .
s there any doubt in your mind ?
no , that 's him .
skipper !
we hve no choice , liutenant .
orders from th very top .
thy 're recalling him to active duty .
henry always livd in a world f his own .
thank you , miss barnes .
well , did you have your physical this morning ?
i 'm fraid not .
really ?
n , my yesight .
they do n't want my blod .
well , i hope so 
and very healthy .
they may take her .
henry ?
yes , he is .
that 's nice .
they rejected me .
rejectd 
do n't hang around that pet shop .
d n't b upset  miss barnes .
there 's a fish in the water cooler .
hi , hen old boy !
george , good to see you .
do n't you look important 
that niform and all those doodads on your sleve .
just a cople of hash marks .
do n't apologie .
you look first-class to me , grge .
what kind of a machine are you mated to ?
hey , bess !
tim to take over 
lover-boy 's here .
hello , dar .
hell , henry .
i forgive you , csanova .
george hs liberty the whole weeknd , and he wants to spend it with us .
the whole weekend ?
no , i missed the subway train , bt i ...
washed out completely , i her .
yu ca n't win them all , gerge .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we cler the decks for action , go dancing 
feel like shaking a lg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
hw many times must i tell you , you do not rumba with your eyes !
now , do n't worry .
why do nt we go to the university for professor hoffmeyer 's lecture ?
you knw , he 's gon n talk bout the mating habits of the shellfish .
it 's a littl risqué .
sort of for adults only , you know .
 'v got it !
why do n't we run out t coney island tomorrow morning ?
well , i do n't know ...
i hate to miss that lecture , but i do like the water .
water and fish .
look at him .
always drawng into his shell , going off int his fish world !
george , come here .
the wht ?
devonian priod of the paleooic era .
you know , it followed the silurian and preceded the carboniferous eras .
i 've given it a lot of thought .
a lot of thought .
maybe go in for parakets .
he 's read many books on the sbject .
he clims years ago there was nothing but fish in the world .
then some of those creatures became amphibians they crawld t n land 
hope for wht , henry ?
with the war in europe nd new weapons being invented what if men were foolish enugh t dstroy themselves ?
then the fish would develop int a new rac of men and this time they might turn out better .
fish have a better life than people .
the water !
what a mess !
you ar floating yourself ut of your home with this hobby !
 'm gon na run down to the store and get a regulatr for the intake hose .
you mn get rid of them ?
but bessie !
either ths fish go or i do !
which s it to be ?
who looked hurt ?
my fish .
for once .
i left out the mst exciting details .
see , i do n't like to brag bt , i tell you , that one morning ...
it was at night  was n't it ?
right .
good memory .
we went out with me in the engine room ...
i thought yo wer on the bridge with the admiral ?
the uss elias j. starbright , is n't it ?
i can tell you this , though .
there are so many nazi subs below the surface you could walk to europe .
the cean 's jumping with u-boats ready to go if uncle sam gts in the fight .
i do n't want to strt a panic , so you keep all this under your hat , right ?
right , bessie ?
old boy , did i ever tll you about the caribbean ?
what a liberty we had in a port near trinidad !
and miami .
did you ever do the rmba , henry ?
no , i have faulty equilibrim .
yes  sir .
join the navy nd have a whirl !
barbados , kingston , th virgin islands !
lunch is almst ready .
come along , henry !
more than anything , i wish i could be one of you right nw .
i wish i were a fish 
henry !
save him !
wht will we do 
get some help !

fish ?
h , no .
there bessie , we 'd better get going home now .
all right , folks , back up , please 
let us through .
and i thought it all would be so beautiful .
wish i were home with bessie .

now shall we go 
i 'd sure lik ...

i 'm not going on record as the dmiral who was sent way because he believed in voices from the ocean .

oh , not me , admiral , i ...
stickle .

the voice asked us to bring stickle out to meet wth him .
i think we can arrange a leave for you immediately .
think what this means .
it could spt submarines all over .
within a year we could break the nazi -boat threat 
all right , harlock .

except btween stickle and yourself .
commander , you 've got to believe me !

we 'll assign this secret weapon to yor ship .
thank you .
but plese stop bringing these fantastic reports to me 
i 'm gon na hve a hard enough time explaining this to the pentagon .
and this is still top-secret .
i was at the pint of calling you about that secret weapon .

i was n't expecting anythng for myself .
of corse , if you insist .
vice admiral .
hello , george .

what ?
are you out of yur mind , harlock ?
how can we pay a fish ?
she 's  rel woman .
i should 've thrown you out when you came t me with this story .
all right , i suppose we can find some way to push this through the paymaster s ffice .
british screening units will deploy to thir assigned ports ...
there 's mor ?
he also wants a lieutenant 's commission .
absolutely , no !
it 's impossible to hold two meetings here at once .
i 'm sorry .
the news harlock brought is quite dsturbing 
if it cncerns the secret wepon , i 'd like to hear t .
our secret weapon wants to be paid 
then admiral spewter ,  suggest you pay him , and commission him .
commisson ?

i think you can see him out there .
limpet , raise your right hand .
sir  sir ..

it 's made out to you , but it 's for henry s servics .

henry 's alive ?
yes , but you see that ...
i 'm going to him .
i 'm gong this minute .

he did n't drown ?
he 's changed 
i do want to 
his work for the navy is top-secret .
just be happy with his paycheck .
do n't even mention his name to anyone .
george , there 's something vry fishy about this .
a mrs .
fish ?
not  mrs .
the wife of the fish .
spewter ...
i beg your pardon , sir .
you claim he turned nto a fish .
we 'll try , sir .
you 'll do nothing of the srt .
we have a wepon f effectiveness .
guard it wth your life .
now , never come to me again with a request like that .
at a time like this .
when we have a convoy on our hands ready for the biggest push of the war .
if bessie could see me now .
nt bad for a 4-f fish .
imagine !
my glasss .
i 'm losing the convoy .
sunk ?
it 's that female flatbush .
ladyfish , got a message for you from limpt .
he said h loves you and other such mush like that .
he loves me ?
oh , crusty , do you think he 'll ever come back ?
do n't get yourself into a tiy now , ladyfish .
if i know flatbush , he 'll be back .
listen !
it 's him .
ladyfish , i 'm in terrible trouble .
i ca n't see .
any sign of him yet ?
not yet , sir .
i 'm in an awful predicamnt .
i need some glasses , and ...
i noticed you were missing some eyes .
i 've got to get back to my convoy !
but how will i find it 
i 'll climb topsde and serve as your navigator .
the sound of the convoy will guid me , and with you navigating , why ...
i ca n't ask you to risk yor life .
risk my life ?
hold verything .
does that mean you 'll be leving me ?
do n't you car for me at all , limpet ?
but i hve n important job to do befre we can talk about that anymore 
let 's shove off .
yu ca n't .
it 's a very dangerous mission .
i 'll always wait for you  limpet .
slow down , gosh darn it .
darned near shivered your timbers that time .
dagnab t .
hey , flatbsh , wait !

wait !
he makes a ..
a thrm .
any contact with that piscatorial lieutennt pal 
we 're nearing enemy water , stickle .
sir , it 's not my fault .
we 've come quite a way .
i still ca n't pick up any sound of the convoy .
say , why do nt yu make that whale-busting noise of yours again 
just hold up a minute till i get nside .
dead ahead .
whole school of big ones , coming dead at us .
hard rght .
they 're coming at us !
follow me , you beeping devil .
we 'll take it right back whre it came from .
i do n't know , sir .
might be henry .
something big is going on down there .
them torpedoes pack a walloping thrum too .
great 
they hit their own boats .
we 'll just let them knock themselves out .
no , we do n't dare .
it 's about time you shwed up .
i got ta talk to george stickle .
wher have you been 
you put me in  terrible spot when we lost contact .
i 'm sorry , george .
i lost my glasses .

aye , aye , george .

had to los my best buddy to a frilly female .
i 'll help you forget .
i 've forgtten an awful lot already .
so long , flatbush .
i 'll never leave you , and i hope you ll never leave me .
t 's always the males who leave in our species .
that 's why there 's so few of us .
in that case , there might be more before long .
there , that 's my wife 
not much to look at , is she ?
let 's get ths over with , lmpet .
hello  bssie .
henry , is that you ?
d n't you recogni me , bessie ?
henry , you really are ...
a fish ?
yes , bessie , you can say it .
to think you 're actually still alive , and i 'm married to a ..
a fsh .
is that so terrible ?
it does nt happen every day .
well , what 's new ?
i mean  how have yu been , bessie ?
 'm bewildered , henry .
henry , am i th widow of a man or the wife f  fish ?
let 's be logical .
you could n't keep me in a tub  could you ?
i mean  what would th neighbors say ?
i shudder to think .
why ...
oh , good heavens .
if yu only knew , bessie .
i guess this s goodbye , henry .
if you 'll come up to the steps , i have something for you .
remember how you catch cold when you get your feet wet .
do n't brak up , bessie 
maybe i was mant to be a fish 
maybe nature just correctd her error .
goodbye , bessie .
goodbye , henry .
goodbye  henry , i said .
i thught that ws it .
bessie and i have been happy .
the chief f naval operations ordered it .
do they really think that henry is teaching porpoises ?
that 's what we 've been assigned to find out .
stickle .
it 's worth a try .
get the old man .
the secretary f defense ordered him to take cmmand of this mission 
and now , commodore regarding porpoise activities ..

isaburo sasahara f the escort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chamberlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see you two duel than merely test swords .
there are rumrs in our clan .
the reason you do n't fight is because it would hurt the family of the loser .
perhps protecting your family nam rather than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
saburo , you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
i married into my wife 's family and have been henpecked for 20 years .
would you like to look t the november border record ?
no , not if nothing unusual happened .
making rice cakes in november
but thre are no customrs
the god who came down in february and broght the rice harvest departs tomorrow until his return next yer .
do you really believe that ?
no , i was just
perhaps you want a grndchild ?
t s n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga s the problem .
it must be someone she approves of .
someone strong , loving and faithful .
is tht the steward 's ?
h 's been waiting for yu .
yu were probably idly chatting away to asan about useless things like martial arts again 
to hav the steward honor us with a visit has never happened n the sasahara family .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been dismissed from the castle .
it has been decided t have hr marry yogoro , your son .
steward , why was lady ichi dismissed 
i 'll return for an answer in a fw dys .
why shuld we accept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this 
after lady ichi bore her sn kikuchiyo , she went to a spa t rest .
the daughter of gohei ymagiwa , the man in charge of the castle wardrobe , was serving besid him .
lady ichi lost her head on seeing this 
she sprang at lady tama , slapped hr face , and dragged her by the hair .
how can we accept her ?
i think we should gratefully accept her withut being difficult 
no matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's n ordr from our lord .
i 'm afraid ...
i do n't feel very enthusiastic about it .
neither do  .
but if i refuse , ther may be trouble lter .
yogoro has said nothing , but he would n't be happy marrying a lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i do n't want him to repeat my mistake .
they said you 'd be at the border 
i herd everything .
the steward and chamberlain are good jdges .
alert even in times of peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage and other matters ,
i suggest you keep things quit .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief .
so be mdst about it or the others will think you 're showing ff .
a happy event .
he s not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordplay ?
but t the last moment , you skillfully switch from defense to offense .
yet you never attack .
yu wat until your opponent tires 
nworthy ?
yes 
w can nt accept our lord 's favored lady .
there 's no need to be so reserved .
it 's happened before , nt just in the aiz cln , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decline th honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will not be allowed .
it is our lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect 
you know our lord 's wish .
it 's an order !
to decline is to defy the order !
no , i 'd nevr do that .
sasahar .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn .
may yu enjoy long life together
we 'll all be at your side as long as you live
this is a dy of celebration
keep that in mind .
no .
a woman who was dismissed after bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n't notice yur return .
mother tok her along for prayer at shonenji temple .
she kindly teaches me domestic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father ?
but despit that , he has borne verything for 20 years .
yes , right away .
you must nt .
the world never seems to go right .
i wish to retire and have yogoro , my eldst son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara , how are yor son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
 'm very sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but his son has married , so
so isburo sasahara 's retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the time , but it 's a great relif .
 wonder wht i 've done all my life , though it 's not lke me to do so .
yogoro 's marrige is a very happy one .
fear often exceeds the perceived danger .
so it was in your cas .
yogoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just the same as before , but chi is always pleasant and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like yourself , i do n't undrstand it either .
check the weapons n the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean them on pponted days .
i do n't say to always yield to them , but at times , they 're unreasonable .
rice cakes ?
enjoy .
wait , ichi .
i 'm going to retire soon .
yogoro will become the head of our family , and you 're his wif .
you need n't hold back for the old woman 
take over the husehold duties .
understand ?
even so , she is my mother , and i will treat her as such .
excuse m .
tht 's enough about your duties , yogoro .
how about some ric cakes ?
but i do n't understand .
that she 'd grasp her lord by his clothing .
it was hard for me to believe too , so i asked her the other day .
it was the year befor last .
ichi .
accept the honor gratefully .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man ver 50 was inftuted with me .
i shuddered .
our lord does not do ths just to satisfy a whim .
daimyo must have heirs or their houses will be abolished 
the only heir to our lord right now is young lord masamoto .
ven so , miss ichi , not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , fr her son may one day become or lord 's heir .
she must be beautiful and kind like you .
you are rferring to sannojo kasai , your fancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
then if sannoj agrees , you will gratefully agree to serve our lord 
what do you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishs and gave you up ?
so you had no choice 
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
yu said you would srve our lrd if sannojo greed .
he hs clearly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyoemn shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to your wishes .
then i thought
no , it was more lik a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
many , mny sons .
then other girls need never know my misery .
it would end with me .
it was like a prayer .
my thoughts were really lke a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bre kikuchiyo a yar later .
then i went to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord 's orders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i culd never hve found a better wife .
beginning tonight ,
what ?
our lord means nothing to me .
i hav been so worried about the sn i bore .
so worried .
i will forget about him too .
i wll forget him .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wat nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would have been better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i racked or poor brains over this and namd her tomi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo hs become our lord 's heir .
so ichi s birth mother to the heir 
if she remains the wife of a vassal , there would be much talk .
you say this is our lrd 's wish ?
yes 
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for yogr to submit a reqest to our lord nd say he will send ichi back to the castle .
 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
nturally .
well , i do nt blame him .
bt you know very well ... that we ca n't hav all our wishes granted in this world 
group head kotani came over in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is calling you 
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it from me 
ichi , i must tell you something .
come into th room .
first , father 's words .
h says he s retired , so  am the family head , and i am to do what i think is right .
however , he also sys you 're too important to us to send away .
that we must take the best possibl care f you .
i must tell her sooner or later .
do n't worry .
no matter what anyone says ,
i will not send you back t the cstle .
chi is nt a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca nt reason with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo , what 's your pinion ?
t 's all up to him .
what is it ?
i 'd like him to come again now and explain in his words why we must return her .
when hs son 's mother prves inconvenint , he forces her to marry  vassal .
this is cruel and unreasnable .
he has no understanding of human emotions .
kotan-san  our family did n't accept ichi particularly gratefully .
nor dd ichi herself know yogoro or the sasahara family 
sh was none too happy about it either .
but the reason they are getting along is because they 're kind to each other and care for each other .
what ?
even f the heavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give up tomi and rturn to the cstle ?
wold you ruin our family because yo 've lost your head over a woman ?
in this case
brther !
i am .
bunzo , if you were me , would yu return ich ?
of course i would !
restrain yourself , bunz .
yogoro 's the head of the family .
right or wrong  it 's all up to him .
if you love yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy such senseless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are a wife wrth protecting , even if that means ruining our family 
i am not worthy of it .
bt this wo n't be the end of it .
i gave her the message .
she will be here soon .
over here , sister .
we 've heard all about what has happned .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you want to sty with yogoro , even if it means ruining the sasahara famly ?
i wold like to stay .
evn if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiomi , has askd our lord that you be snt back to the castle as son as possibl 
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he les in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to plad with him to send you back .
he 's done this several times .
father is father .
i am me .
i would rather die than return .
please tell the chamberlains and steward how i fel in whatever words you think will best help my case 
we ask you again , ichi !
th family does n't matter ?
not only the ssahara family , bt we the relatives will be jeopardized as well .
it can not be helped .
i see 
there 's no use trying to convince a woman like ths .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's yr misfortune that a woman like her hs favored you .
return .
return to the castle .
why d you sy that now ?
what 's the sashara family to yu ?
lsten to me .
in other words , i 'm a worthless , good-frnothing man .
so in order to prove myself , for these past 20 years
i have fought to preserve our good name and social standing .
the cruel injustic involved , for one thing 
but your beautiful love for each other has touched me most of all .
there 's never been a shred of love in my married life !
no matter what happens  never leave him !
my husband 's wth the chamberlain ?
yes , and he 's waiting for you to come .
i saw him in the castle .
th chamberlain wishes to see you both .
he has some questions for you .
you need n't wrry .
i will accompany you .
if you lose heart now , what wll it man for my brother 
hurry !
father  where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything new at the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happens .
she went out .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ichi ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter how many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going home .
ichi , take my advice and return to the castle .
if you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain is willing to verlook everything .
but if yo insist on returning home  not only will yogoro , but also his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervision of ther home .
honrable lady ichi , please return to the castl .
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamberlain s orders ?
what orders ?
go hom !
but ... if i go home without
say no more !
but
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool .
yogoro .
but he dd request time off du to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife f footman bansaku kariya t come and feed her twice a dy .
a good , solid woman .
then everything 's all over ?
yes .
we just took a rondabout path .
defying the clan gets us nowher .
isaburo , do you really mean that ?
i came to mak sr of your thoughts on this matter .
to be honest , th clan 's treatment f your family nd your ttitude in response have weighed on my mind 
weighed on your mind ?
it 's lke your swordplay .
pushed , you step back .
but it 's not like you to giv up .
the clan did n't ask for her formlly 
it was more like force .
in fact , it was more like kidnapping .
if the shogunate officals in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , t may prove a fatl mistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow them to end here .
you 're saying i must formally ask the castle to take her back ?
yet i must ask them to tke her back ?
it was wise f you to hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are imprssed by your restraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remmber sending her back to th castle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiclous , father !
never !
she suppressed her ters , left everything behind , and quietly returned to the castle .
now , now , yogoro 
in any case , please go for now 
yogoro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will report today nd say he wishes to return her ?
that 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
since t wold hav come to this anyway , how dare they cause all that fuss !
yogoro was wrng , but isaburo was insolent as well .
h 's always henpecked by his wife .
and defying clan orders like that
 must say he seems like a different man .
his conduct has been admirabl .
it calls for a slight increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the escort group has arrved !
i 'm glad you 've reported for duty .
yes , completely well .
taking into cnsideration my father s wishes , i have decided .
please accept this .
that 's good of you .
thank you 
fol !
petition .
this is the cruelest form of tyranny .
it runs counter to th laws of hmanty and can not be condoned by the heavens .
we herby ppeal fr her immediate return .
someone may use my father 's name or my own to submit a request t return ichi to the castle .
but it will not be from us .
please keep that in mind .
thank yu for coming every day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at times like these 
so our feet w n't slip in the blood .
this my be the last time .
will you do me a favor 
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca nt fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accept obediently !
 said orders from our lord 
will you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
orders !
isaburo and yogor sasahara , for your nsolent conduct and defiance toward our lord , you are ordered to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracous of our lord to permit t .
i thoght men would come arrest us and then either hang or crucify us .
father .
however , we want something befor we kill ourselves .
bring us thre heads !
thos of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler of the aizu domain ,
chamberlain yanase , nd steward takahashi .
bring me the heads of th villains who took my son 's wife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of bondary gates hs arrived !
i hear you are
isaburo 's only eqal as a swordsman .
if you think he s too much for yo , take four or fve strong men with yu 
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this is no time to discuss jurisdiction .
you 're wrong .
if you order me to kill them , please promote me to superintendent here and now and obtain our lord 's prmis to increase my fief to 500 koku , according to cln rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mind .
go !
we must gather men , use force and kill them .
a foolish dea .
isaburo 's a swordsman without per .
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alone .
it 's bunzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it nice and czy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to the festival drums .
father !
you were pressed by our relatives at kenmotsu 's place to cme here s their messenger and say ,
we 've dfied our lord long enough 
bunzo , do n't hate us 
but remember :
each must liv his wn lif .
as for what happnd ,
ech must live his own lif .
and tell everyon this fr me :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
wht if other clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather som mn and take care of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlan 's ntervention wuld aggravate matters .
father , the drum from the suwa shrine has stoppd .
it 's late .
i remembr it too .
outside the castle , it was the noko festival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the day bfore the suw shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that 's as it should be 
it 's not unmanly at all .
but yogoro , do n't be too wrrid about ichi .
we will die here , but she is the mother of ur lord 's heir .
no ne can torture her , and no one will endanger her lif .
but fathr , are n't they late in coming ?
i ment to ask for permission to enter , but the gate was open , so i came in .
i will now convey our lord 's orders .
w have heard of the order to commit seppku .
he chnged his orders .
saburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitude toward our lord , you will be confind at enshoji temple outside the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will you gratefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , h 's wrong !
it was not as the heir 's mother .
i am still the wfe of yogoro sasahara .
but our lord received me in his audience .
i do n't undrstand what this is ll abut .
steward  it seems w d n't understand wht you just told us .
if you two admit that ichi is no longer a family member and tht she has been returned , our lord will listen to hr plea for  lighter punishment .
will you acknowledge her return nd live , or refuse and fight t out 
which will it be ?
we are prpared for the worst .
then there s no altrnative ?
please return her t once !
i 'll ask lady ichi now .
or will you let thir pursuers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , the sasaharas are men .
you have alrady returned to serve our lord .
if you tell them that you sever yur ties with them once and fr all , then all will b well !
if you do , their lives will be saved .
w need not ask them to rturn you .
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save their lves ?
or will you let them die s traitors ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ich , does your silence mean you will do as i say ?
am i correct ?
n .
i
father ..
tomi  bd your fther and mother farewell .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are still aliv listen to them .
let 's listen to what they want us to do .
no , i knw without being told .
they want us to tell the world of our clan 's cruelty !
very well .
i undrstand 
we promise to do tht for you .
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestal !
first , tomi and i will go to edo together and see the shogunate elders .
we 'll leave immediatly for edo 
tomi and i are going to edo .
if this is for the clan , show me your pass .
if it 's private business , show me the clan ticket .
i have neither .
then i m afraid i can not let you pass .
you mean to pss from ths domain without having ether 
i must forbid it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quiet .
i 'd like to put her in the hous away from the wind .
but men we dislike ar n there .
venomous men .
i fed her befre dawn .
i do n't think she 's hngry .
we 'll make do with this .
you be qit now , tomi .
do n't cry even if i do n't return .
let me remain .
it 's bettr that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
no .
no matter how strong you ar , how perfect your dfense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ...
without fail .
i will win without fail .
tatewaki !
 had no chance of wnning .
take tomi with you t edo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
no one will ever know the story of your fther and mother now .
just one word .
when you grow up , become a womn jst like your mother .
be sure to do tht .

us
psdh
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 million years to g around the galaxy once
the dinosaur era lasted 180 million years .
this is a comt .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wde , and it 's headed for the earth ... fst .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not really 
at this time the msters of the earth re dinosaurs .
this is patagonia .
a vast region of argentinean south america as it is today 
and there was only one immense ocean ,
we are north of th south american plate , in the se that wll grow to be the atlantic ocen .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land during the dinosaur era .
in many plces there , one walks today on the very ground these giants walked upon a 100 million years ago .
this phenomenon seems to depend on anothr peculiar twist of evolutin 
rgions that produce great dinosurs also tend t prodce great plaeontolgists .
many doctral students come to pursu their resarch .
somtimes younger people , like my dughter ludmila , just come to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talking about dinosaurs with everyone , whether they are experts or not .
it 's a busy life , and it would have been plenty for most pople , but early in my career nw horizons pened up for me .
things became much larger than life .
a ranchr hd stumbled upon  surprisingly large bone .
after several digging sesons we ended up facing the largst dinosaur ever found .
we named it rgentinosaurus
this discovery have a profound effect , on the way we look at south american dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it tok a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit .
predators and hazards abound .
only a few will reach adulthood 
it covers more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 million yers old .
we believe that t was chosen as a nesting site by generation upn generatin of these dinosaurs .
the nests ar so close together , that the females could not walk between them .
it was warmer than tody .
a great part of the dinosaur era , there were no broad leaf trees and no flower bearing plants .
during the dinosaur era there is no arctic ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
for tens of millions of years seasons barely changed .
the water f the ocean is also much warmr 
hurricanes are frequent .
the magntic poles changes position contnuously .
professor coria has contributed to the discvery of more than a dozen of new dinosurs .
as a scientist , he insists that each new find is important , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes h says what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hands .
i like to think that i am lucky , just ncredibly lucky .
many palentological discoveries are not made by professionals .
that 's what happened with the argentinosaurus , and it happened gain with yet another dinosaur .
they were relatively big , so at first , we thought that they belonged to a herbivore , because in general these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
but instead  the bons proved to be those of a predator ;
a very lrge one 
professor cria 's team had unveiled a first species of a group of fierce predators called gignotosaurus .
the 3 species in this group srpassed the fmous t. rex in terms of sze .
although rare for reptiles  cring for the yong has be observed among crocodiles for nstanc .
in dinosaurs , this cring behaviour evolv enough to remind us of birds 
this baby femal is named long tooth .
however small and vlnerable  and cute she may appear now she is geneticlly progrmmed to rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator lik her mother .
in patagona , you have the largest herbivore and the largest predator , livng at roughly the same perid and in the same territory .
there is no easy answer .
evolution followed a nmber of particular paths .
but a simpler interpretatin rest on a warm climate and the fertile land , with all the vegetation you can eat .
yet another thory tells us that large herbivores had to grow big enugh , to accommodate a large stmch required to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spns of flat spce could have led ntrally to argentinosaurus , as the vast seas have led to whales .
the highest branches belong to those wh can reach them , and many predators are too small to be threatening in thse situation .
she is growing fast too .
her prmitive feathers have almost all disappeared .
they thrivd for 180 million years .
this is a message for us here .
by th way , it is more than time t introduce sharp fethrs .
he is unenlaga ,  6 foot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is relted to birds , as are to some extent velociraptors , gganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need space .
this is the carmen funes museum , which also happens to be my second home .
sometimes as a joke we say that it is a science filled with holes .
we have only found about 700 species of dinosaurs on the whole plant .
this is n't many for a reign tht lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , most of them n the last 30 years .
through technology our knowledge grws faster evry dy .
fossilisation is a process that requires extrmely rare conditions , and even then very little of an organism is preserved 
we could easily conclude that a trmendous number of spcies just disappeared wthout a trace .
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you also ned to be very careful before proposing a nw way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish i culd travel in time to see these amazing creatures alive .
strong one has reached maturity .
for many scientists he is at full size .
he is 20-year-old , and is at the beginning of mre than a centry of life .
thy tell us , if the animal was walkng on two legs or four , if they were alone or in a group , if they were wandering  hnting , or being hunted
the pttern clearly show association between contmporry species , and this is very rare .
his work is intimatly linked to nature , its intimately varied terrain and ver changing climate .
so there were hardships , but there are moments , sometimes when science jst blnd with the pure bliss of beng otside and wnderful places .
you just look around .
but finding reqired a trained eye .
with time you realse that th number of questions grows faster than the nmber of answers .
again , like many times bfore ,
a good hint nd an answr came unexpectedly .
in fact  we did n't find just one specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to t least seven individals .
for me  and my canadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at something w had considered , but hav no evidence for until then .
so long truth belongs to this new species f giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , she is flly grown .
strng one s unknowingly in a crtical time 
tearing off pieces of skin and ltting the large prey bleed to death , or die from infection is a strategy more likely to succeed .
giganotosaurs cold wait days even weeks between meals .
millins of years pass , and s the continents keep on drifting , the earth begins to resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature never stops changing .
we are in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evlution gave it nothing to survive the impending dramatic events .
sveral factors could hav contributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mammals became bigger and more competitive .
drifting solated continnts touchd each other .
new rivalries appeard 
new diseses spread .
the climate was growng colder , pssibly becuse of ncreasd volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable in many places .
vegetation suffered from the acd rain and also from the darkned and dust-filled skies .
but still , many dinosaurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the distance frm th moon to the earth in two hurs 
all the forest of north and south america are destroyed by fire .
already weakened , dinosurs are the animals that suffered most .
in a relatively short time , dinosaurs becme histry .
not all the dinosaurs disappear .
if they have n't become extinct maybe we just would n't be here .
more discoveries await me here perhaps bt as i move forward in life ,
and the best food in paris , some say  is made by chef auguste gstea .
gustu 's restaurant is the toast of paris , booked five months in advance .
he is the youngest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's cokbok  anyone can cook !
but not veryone celebrates its success .
what 's even more amusing is that gusteau actually seems to believe it .
i , on the other hand , take cokng seriusly .
ths is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of ll , i 'm  rat .
flor , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
this is emile , my brother .
he s easily impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impressed .
he also happens t be the leader of our clan .
so , what 's wrong with having highly developed senses ?
what 's going on here 
suddenly , dad did n't think my talent was useless .
clean .
cleanerific .
cleanrino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad proud .
now , do n't you feel better , remy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we 're thives , dad .
nd what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no one wants it  why are we stealing it ?
but to my dad ..
yo get picky about what you put in the tnk , your engine is gon n die 
now shut up and eat your grbage .
secondly , stay ut of the kitchen and away from the humans .
it 's dangerous .
they discover , they create .
how can i describe it 
good food is like music you can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it 
oh , gusteau was right .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally unque .
so now i had a secret life .
th only one wh knew about it was emle .
hey , emile .
emile .
come on , you 're good at hidng food .
he dos n't understand me , but i can be myself around him .
why are yu walkng lk that ?
i do n't want to cnstntly have to wash my paws .
did you ever think about how we wlk on th same paws that we handle fod with ?
you ever think about what we put into our mouths ?
all the time .
but if dad sees yu walking like that , he 's not going to like it .
what hve you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found cheese ?
and not just any cheese .
that would go beautifully with my mushroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we 're spposed t return to the colony bfore sundown r , you know , dad 's gon na ...
emile !
ther re possibilities unexplored here .
w got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep turning it .
that storm 's getting closer .
hy , remy , you think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to taste this !
t 's got , lik  this ba-bom , zap kind of taste 
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 's lightning-y !
we got t do that again .
okay , whn the next storm comes , we 'll go up on the roof ...
i know what this neds !
saffron .
saffron .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na wake up .
she turns on the cookng channel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been here a million times ?
gsteau swars by it .
kay .
who s gusteau ?
just the greatest chef in the world .
wrte this cookbook .
yu read ?
and they hve , which is why i read .
i do n't like secrets .
all this cooking nd readng and tvwatching while we read nd cook 
why do i let you ?
wht 's taking those kids so long ?
ah , l'aquila saffron .
italian .
gusteau says it 's excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love ...
forget mystique .
great cooking is not for the faint of hert .
yu must be imaginative , strong hearted .
yo must try things that may not work .
and you must not let anyone define your limits becase of wher you come from .
anyone can cook .
but only the fearless can be great .
gusteu 's restaurant lost one of its five strs after a scathing review by frnce s top food critic , anton ego .
it was a sever blw to gusteau , and the brokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards , which , according to tradition  meant the loss of another star .
oh !
oh !
oh !
run !
no , you 'll lead her to the colony !
emile 
help , remy  help !
start swinging the light !
try to grab you .
everyone , to the boats .

let me through !

i think she hoped it would help me  you know , get a job her .
but f curse .
gsteau would n't hesitate .
yes , well , we could file this and if something suitable opens up ...
how dare yu hire someone without my ...
oh , garbage .
well ...
uh ...
i ca n't believe it 
a real gourmt kitchen , and i get to watch .
let us see how much you know , huh ?
oh !
oh  that guy .

there .
very important .
chef de partie , demi-chef de partie , both important .
commis , cmmis , they 're cooks 
very important .
not nobody .
he is part of the kitchen .
he does n't cook .
uh , no .
hw do you know ?
anyone can cok .
that does n't men that anyone should .
see ?
do something .
what can  do ?
i am a figmnt of your imagination .
but he 's ruining th soup !
we got to tell someone that he 's ...
comng down the lin .

oh , god .
tonight , i 'd like to present the foie gras 
hmm .

you know how to fix it .
this is your chance .
where is the soup ?
how dare you cok in my kitchen ?
where do you get th gall to even attempt smthing so monumentlly idotc ?
i should have you drawn and quartered 
i 'll do it .
larousse , draw and quarter this man after you put him in the duck press to squeeze th fat out of his head .
what ar you blathring about ?
the sop !
soup ?
no !
waiter .
linguini !
f-i-r-e-d !
what dd the customer say ?

ego ?
solène leclaire .
she likes the soup .
wait .
someone s asking about your soup .
what are you playing at 
am i still fred ?
you ca n't fire him .
what ?
if she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook responsible ...
he 's a garbage boy .
how can we claim to represent the nam of gusteau if we do nt uphold his most cherished belief ?
he has taken a bold risk and we should reward that  as chef gusteau would have .
oh , yeah .
you will make the soup again  and this time , i 'll be paying ttention .
very close ttention .
they think you might be a cook .
but you know wht i thnk , linguni ?
get the rat .
what should i do now ?
kill t .
n , not n the ktchen .
they 'd close us down .
take it awy from her .
kill it .
go !
do n't lok at me like that !
they expect me to cook it again !
 mean , i 'm not ambitious .
i was jst trying t stay out of trouble .
you 're the one who was getting fancy with th spces !
what did you throw in there ?
oregano ?
i need this job .
i 've lost so many .
did you nod ?
have you ben nodding ?
so i m not crazy !
wait a second , wait a second .
you can , right ?
look , do n't be s modest .
you 're a rat , for pete 's ske .
whatever you did , they liked it .
do you think you could do it again ?
right ?
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not much , but it 's , you know ...
there 's het and light and a couch with a tv .
the best kind of drem .
ne we can share .
but why here ?
why now ?
morning , little chef .
idiot !
i let a rat into my plac and tell him what 's mine is his !
stupid !
h 's stolen fod and hit the rod !
that 's what i get for trusting a ...
hi .
is that for me ?
look , it 's delicis .
but do n't steal .
i 'll buy some spices , okay ?
and n the first day !
though i , like many other critic ,
had written off gusteau as irrelevant since the great chef 's death ,
the soup was a revelation .
solène leclaire ?
against all odds , gusteau 's has recaptured our attention .
nly time will tell if they deserve it .
well ...
you know .
welcome to hell .
now , recreate th soup .
take as much time as you need .
sup .
you little ...
you son of a ...
something that does n't involve any biting , or npping , or running up and down my body with your little rat feet .
the biting !
scampering !
no !
no scampering or scurrying .
lttle chef ?
oh , you 're hungry .
okay .
so let 's think ths out .
we need to work ot a system so that i do what you want in a way that does n't look like i 'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef .
would you listn to me ?
i 'm insane !
i m insane !
i will never pull this off !
linguini ?
we got ta communicate .
i saw it !
a rat ?
yes , a rat .
what ar you doing in here ?
get out .
that was close .
whoa !
hw did yu do that ?
that 's strangely involuntary !
one look and i knew we had the same crazy idea .
okay .
huh ?
where are you taking me 
i 'm sorry .
whoa !
mmm-hmm ...
okay .
whoa !
whoa !
à votre santé 
all right .
mmm .

no .
perhaps you lived in squalor at some point ?
you know something about rats !
you know you do !
yo know who know do whacka-doo .
hey !
what ?
ratatouille .
it 's like a stew , right ?
why do they call it that 
if you 're gong to nam a food , you should give it a name that sounds delicious .
ratatouill does n't sound delicious .
it sounds like rat and patootie .
rat patootie .
which does not sound delicious .
and finding someone to replace you for pison checker has been a disaster .
nothing 's been poisoned , thank god , but it hs n't been easy .
i am sorry , dad 
why is that ?
it 's tough ut there in the big world all alone , is n't it ?
sure , but it 's not like i 'm a kid anymore 
hey .
what 's up ?
visit ?
i will .
i promise 
often .
it 's not a big deal , dad .
i just ...
evntually , a bird s got to leave the nest .
we 're rats .
we make thm bigger .
 'm tired of taking .
i want to make things .
oh , yeah ?
what makes you so sure ?
i 've been able to observe them at a close-ish sort of range .
yeah ?
how close ?
close enough .
nd they 're , you know , not so bd as you say thy are .
come with me .
i got something i want yo to see .
you want me to stay and clean ?
is that a problem ?
no .
good boy .
we 're here 
the world we live in belongs to the enemy 
what ?
no .
can only be more of this ?
you ca n't change nature .
change is nture , dad 
the part tht we can influence .
and it strts when we decide .
where you going ?
with luck , forward .
hey !
yeah .
stop it .
god mrning .
that 's big .
that 's big .
what , you ca n't tell me ?
oh !
forgive me for intruding on your deep , personal relationship with the chef 
oh , i see how t is .
you get me to teach you a few kitchen tricks to dazzl the bss and then you blow past me ?
wake up .
i did n't have to help yo !
but ...
i wanted yo t scceed .
i liked you .
my mistake .
colett .
wait  wait .
i ca n't do it anymore .
wait , wait !
look , i 'm no good with words .
at least not without your help .
i hate false modesty .
it s just another wy to lie .
you have talent .
no , but i do n't !
it 's not me .
wht d you mean ?
i mean , i wold n't have done that .
i would 've followed the recipe .
i wuld 've followed your advice to the ends of the earth .
because i love your advice .
bt ..
but i ...
do n't do it .
i have a secret .
what ?
yu have a rash ?
i have this ..
little ..
a tiny chef ?
yes .
he 's ...
he 's up here .
here we go .
you inspire me .
i 'm going to risk lookng lke the biggest idiot psycho you 've ever seen .
you want t know why i 'm such a fast learner ?
d n't lagh !
no !
no !
what is it , ambrister ?
gusteu 's .
more financial trouble ?
no , it 's ...
nnounced a new line of microwave gg rolls ?
what ?
i sad , gusteau has fnally fond his rightful place in hstory
right alngside another equally famous chef ,
touché .
that was my last word .
the lst word .
then tell m , ambristr , how could it b popular ?
the dna matches , th timing works , everything checks out .
this ca n't just happen !
the whole thing is  setup !
the boy knows !
look at him out there , pretending t be an idiot .
string ?
playing dumb .
taunting me with that rat .
deliberately trying to make me think it 's important .
the rat .
xactly !
is the rat important ?
of course not !
he just wants me to think that it is .
and now he wants me to see it everywhere .
ooh !
no , it is n't  it 's here 
am i seeing things , am i crazy ?
s there a phantom rat or is there not ?
bt , oh  no !
 refse to be sucked into his little game of ...
about yo ?
i ca n't fire him .
he 's getting attenton .
if i fire him now , evryne will wonder why .
s n't it good to have the press ?
is n't it good to have gustau 's nam getting headlines ?
not if they 'r over his face !
gusteau 's already has a face , nd it 's fat and lovable and famliar .
and it sells burritos 
millions and millions of burritos !
no , no , no .
well , becase you ...
rat !
disgusting little creatures .
how the world really sw me .
and it just kept getting better .
remy !
remy !
hey , hey , hey , little brother 
you told them ?
emile , that s exactly what i said not to do !
but you know these guys .
they 're my friends .
i did n't think yo meant them .
look , i 'm sorry .
do n't tell m you 're sorry , tell them you 're srry .
it 's locked ?
hmm ...
okay .
emile shows up with ...
i told him ...
he goes and blabs to ...
yeh , it 's a disaster .
anyway , they 're hungry , the fod sfe is lcked and i need the key .
they want you t steal food ?
yes .
n !
no !
it s complicated .
they do n't have yor ideals .
ideals ?
or  tooth , i say , tooth pick ' n chicken 
about as french as  corn dog !
coming soon !
we 're inventing new ways to sell out over here .
can you guys shut up ?
word 's getting out .
hey .

linguini ?
why would linguini be filed with your will ?
this used to be my office .
he 's yor son ?
i have  son ?
i am a figment of your imagination .

bottoms up , linguini !
cheers , ja .
chef !
chef !
what is the secret to your genius ?
secret ?
i am gusteau 's son .
but you were n't aware f that fact until very recently .
and it rsulted in your tking ownership of this restaurant .
how did you find out ?
the gusteau part ?
inspirtion has many names .
mine is named colette .
something 's stuck in my teeth .
health inspector .
i wsh to report a rat infestation .
first opening is three months .
it 's a gourmet restaurnt !
monsieur , i have the information .
if someone cancels , i 'll slot you in .
but the rat !
you must ...
it 's past opening tim .
he should have finished an hour ago .
bonjour , ma chérie .
join s .
we were just talkng about my inspration .
yes , he calls it his tiny chef .
not that , dearest .
i meant you .
it 's him .
ego ?
anton ego !
is that ego 
y re monsieur linguini ?
hello .
pardon me for nterrupting your prmature celebration , but i thought it only fair to give you  sporting chance as you are new to this game .
gam ?
yes .
nd you 've ben playing without an opponent .
which is , as you may have guessed , against the rules 
you 're anton ego .
if  do n't love it , i do n't swallow .
listen , we hat to be rude , but we 're french , nd t 's dinnertime .
do n't give me that look .
you were distracting me in front of the press .
how am i supposd to concentrate with yo ynking on my hair all the time ?
your opinion is n't the only one that mtters here .
ll right , that 's it !
you tke a break , little chef .
 'm not your puppet , and you 're not my puppet-controlling guy !
yo cool off and get your mind right , little chf .
ego is cmng , and i need to focus !
you stupid ...
i have never seen that befre .
you know what ?
i 've been selfish .
re yu kidding ?
we 'll go after closing time .
in fact ...
yeah .
this is great , son .
an insde job .
oof !
hey , little chef .
thn when you were n't there , i do nt know ...
it did n't seem right to lave things the wy that we did , so ...
look , i do n't want to fght .
i 've been under a lot of , you know , pressure .
i 'm suddenly a gusteau .
and i got to be a gusteau or , yu know  people will be disappointed .
i have n't been fair to you .
you 've never failed me , and i should never forgt that .
you ve been a good friend .
the most honorable frind a guy could ever ask ..
what 's going on ?
hey ..
you 're ...
you 're stealing food ?
i thought you were my friend !
i trusted you !
get out !
you and all your rat buddies !
we are what we are , and we 're rats .
steal all you want .
 've lost my appetite .
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
come in !
you are the boss .
attention , evryone .
tonght is a big night .
i mean , ego .
the critic .
and he 's going to order something .
just ca n't leave it alone , can you ?
it 's not saf .
i 'm hngry !
observe .
no , wait !
h , no !
no , no !
yo might think yo are a chef but you are still only a rt 
sure he tok away a star last tme he reviewed this place .
sre it probably killed ..
dad .
this is very bad juj right her .
ego is here .
ego ?
he is here ?
anton ego is just another customer .
let 's cook !
yeah !
okay .
au revoir  rt !
do you know what you would like this evening , sir 
yes , i thnk i do .
after reading  lot of overheated puffery about yur new cook , you know what i 'm cravng 
a little perspective .
can you suggest a good wine to go with that ?
very well .
you provide the food , i 'll provide the perspectve .
which would go nicely with a bottle of chevl blanc 1947 .
i 'm afraid i ...
tell him to hit me with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i m the one in a cage .
i 've given up .
as you are .
oh , plese .
i pretend you exist so i have smeone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here 
what the ...
dad !
where re yu ging ?
they 'll fail without me .
why do you care ?
because i 'm a cook !
it 's yur recipe .
i did n't write it down .
t just came to me .
because we ca n't serve this !
where 's my order ?
ca n't we serve something else ?
something i did n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we just opened .
i have another idea .
what if we serve them what they order !
we will make it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the customers something .
then tell them ...
tll them ..
remy .
we r not talking about me .
we 're talking about what to do right ...
remy !
get my knife .
do nt touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ...
well , the truth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i have no talent at ll .
but this rat , he 's the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cok .
he 's been hiding under my toque .
h 's been controlling my actions .
he 's the reason i can cok the food that 's exciting everyon .
i know it 's a hard thing to believe .
we can be the greatest restarnt in paris , and this rat , this brlliant little chef , can lead us there .
what do you sy ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ca n't choose between two halves of myself .
i m not talking about cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
you tell us what to do , and we 'll get it done .
stop that health inspector !
delta team , go , go , go , go !
the rest of you stay and help remy .
team three will be hndling fish .
team four , roasted itms .
team six , sauces .
get to your stations .
those handling food will walk on two lgs .
i 'm sorry for any delay , but we 're a little short tonight .
plese , take all of th tim you need .
mak sure that steak is nice nd tendrized .
easy with that sole meunière .
nly use the mimolette cheese .
compose the salad like you were painting a picture .
do n't let that burre blnc separate 
gently poach the scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
god .
sorry .
just tell me what the rat wants to cok .
it 's a peasant dish .
i am making ratatouille .
they must be joking .
mmm .
no , it ca n't be .
i demand to know !
i asked a waiter to gve my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but  'm just your waitr tonight .
then who do i thank for the meal 
you must be the chef .
if you wsh t meet th chef , you will have to wait until all the other customer have gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react byond asking an occasional qustion .
and whn the story is done , ego stands , thanks us for the meal ...
we risk very little  yet enjoy a positon ver those who offer up their work nd their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticsm , which s fun to write and to read 
the world is often unkind to new tlent , new creatins .
the new needs frends .
last nght , i experinced something new , an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source .
but i realize only now do i truly understnd what he meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a gret artist can come from anywhere .
it is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those f the genis now coking at gusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the finest chef in france .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for mre .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a great night .
well , w had to let skinner and the health inspector loose , and of course they ratted us out .
the food dd nt matter .
but do n't feel too bad for hm .
he seems very happy .
how do yo know ?
got to go 
do n't you always ?
which one would you like ?

that 's better .
it 's good you little freaks know when yo 're baten .
i have to seize control of an area and force ts inhabitants to follow my way of thinking 
even if it means taking extreme measures !
-you would n't !
now i am more mojo than bfore !

yes , that was super , just super !
-amazing !
-stupendous !
you rock !
thank yo .
can we , professor ?
okay , but only if it 's before your bedtime .

sugar , spice and everything nice 
these wre the ingredients chosen to crate the perfect little girl .
but professor utonium accidentally added an extra ingredient to the mix :
chemcal x .
using their ultra super powers , they 've dedicated their lives to fighting crme and the forces of vil .
the powerpuff girls !
hey , that 's a good name for them .
powerpuff girls , yeah

it all began when the silence of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound .
it was  sound like one nevr heard before n this part of the jungl .
t was a man cub !
 would 've obyed my first impulse and walked away .
then it occurred to me 
oh , i knew there 'd be no problem with the mother thanks to th maternal instinct , but ...
ten times the rains had come and gone .
he was a favourte of all th young wolf cubs of the pack .
no man cb was ever happier .
and yet , i knew that someday ... he would have to go back to his own kind 
shere khan will surely kill the boy and ll who try to protect him .
now it is my unplesant duty t tell the boy 's father .
rama .
uh , come over here , please 
the man cub can no longer stay with the pack .
leave ?
there s no other way .
but-
but , rama , even the strength f the pack is no match for th tigr .
perhaps i can be of help .

mowgli and i have taken many walks into the jungle together , so i 'm sure he ll go with me .

mowgli , this time we 're not going back .
i 'm taking you to a man village .
bcause shere khan has returned to this part of the jungle .

every tme he bats those long eyelashes of his , it 's just a way to brng down the hammer on ur success .
he ven makes really embarrassing things look really , really cute .
ready  girls ?
let 's do this .
ok , here we go .
ok .
be quiet .
and she 'd read me  stry
it always was about a prncess n distress
and how a guy would save her
nd end up with th glory
i 'd lie in bed and think about
sittin ' in a drk .
cold .
dusty cellar
to come and st me free
oh .
i wll survive i know somebody 's on my side
do n't wan na be no .
i 'd rather rescue myself
i can sly my own dragons
my knight in shining armour
is me
so  'm gon na set me free
i do n't wan na be like cinderella
cold .
dusty cellar
for a handsome prince to come and save me
oh .
i will survive i knw somebody 's on my side
sittin ' in a dark .
cold .
dusty cellar
waitin ' for somebody
 do n't wan na be like someone waitng

oh .
do n't wan n be no .
no one else
drinka ?
drinka , you still there ?
drinka ?

it 's just that ... when i see you girls , i see myself .

you 're the only one  been dreamin ' of ..
you got ta slow down the disco fevr , drinka .
when i see you girls , i see , lke , little drink clones .
galleria , when i look t you ,

i see a hot , latin , spicy version of me .
and aqua , when i lok at you ,
i see myself as if i was from the sassy south .
if you were what ?
everyone else does .
dorinda 's like me if i was shrimpy and white .
oh , yes  honey .

i still keep my hand in the community .
the jackal keeps it real .
and i have n't seen this much talent on that stage since my graduation .

at this rate , you 're headed straight to your room .
you 'll be just as talentd after college .
50 times ovr .
then you wuld not have the time to study , you would n't have the grades to get in , and tht , my der , is what you call a paradox .
some colleges do n't even lok at grades .
some people do n't even go to college .
franco ?
papa , tell her  'm not a knucklehead .
tell her i 'm not a pazza .
but you know what ?
you have to listen to yor mother 's advice .
silly people do silly things , mom .

i have made so many mistakes in my life , and i 'm determined not to have our daughter mak th same mistakes i did .

but wht if her drems fall apart ?

k. i 'll cme for a spin
but i wo n't have anything to do with mr .
ski
why are you here ?
eetu asked me to come .
yup .
 can leave , if you insist
we 'll just have to take it easy
no need to hold back because f me
k !
let 's get charged .
a good idea
she 'll either come or she wo n't
did you notice  last fall  was in the same shape as you re in now
i knew i was in top form
yet i 'd build up the lactics way too easily
especially when climbing
strted working on my ability to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics were boiling
sonds extremely rough
it was , for months
then suddenly a week ago- a breakthrough !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i won the race
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance our team has
ok .
on three conditins :
neither of yu blows the other 's chances .
some program he 's been on all spring !
if i 'd used the sme mthod , i 'd already be on the natinal team
you do n't mind that your best frend kept such a big secret from you 
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat him once more- he would have killed himself .
it cn be a good thing .
taking things seriously
eetu !
coach agreed we could train together for the nationals
i 've qut .
maybe it would be a healthy chnge
no one sked you !
would we use your method ?
lf you want
in that case , count me in
off to bed early !
heavy session tomorrw
oona !
s he a total moron ?
this is similar to the 25 route the ntionals will b raced on this yer
 thought w were using your method
o.k .
each rond  'll join you on the climb
drve me as hard as yu can .
like it 's the nationals
ready for a road kill ?
you 're minute behind on this rund
how 's it going ?
not bd
i 'd prefer eetu alive tonght
so you came to play nurse .
have a problem with cycling women ?
my first childhood memory is watching my mm win the nationals
i 've seen cycling women befre
nice sannino .
hey , i do n't need a coach
bt your body is perfect for cycling
 men it .
is that just a professional remark ?
last year in vaasa , remember ?
i was a zombie aftrwards
i see
yeah , but oona and i had planned t go kayaking tnight
loks like i 'm too weak to hold a paddle
yup .
if he goes on with your method , he 'll soon be god for nthng
it 's only temporary .
h 'll soon be back on the ball
it 's just that i booked us  kayak .
i could fill in
i 'll be fine on my own .
no , n .
i can come
well .
why not .
where and what time ?
i 'll be there
got the entranc exam in july
it 's just hard to find time for rading
i am
at th bginning focus on pacing
the strength comes years later
yeah , yeah
same as in cycling , keep your body relaxed
now you 're telling me how to cycle , as well ?
arms stretched out
yu lost it again .
concentrate .
are all cyclists that stiff ?
for god 's sakes , shut p !
good .
i 've figured it ot
kind of far for a beginner
you think i 'm not fit enough ?
no , but ... shit , no !
where ?
directly behind us !
where to ?
shit !
my treat 
hi 
tw beers
beer .

ah well .
he 's a nice guy .
absolutely .
you have a girlfriend ?
such a beautiful nght .
sweet dreams .
yup .
how 's coaching coming along ?
very well .
eetu 's really getting there
oh , are they going steady ?
she 's ... a human being
what if i sewed all three of you som nice cycling shirts ?
silk and legance 
why not , if you feel like it .
and brasts ?
they 're there
but what size ?
it 's important with a cycling shirt
have n't measured them !
an averge girl with average breast sounds promising
hey , cut it ut !
man and ap descend from the sam ancestrs
man easily adjusts to hot climates
causes of death vary greatly cell which often stays nactive throughout its life cycl muscles start at the rdis ...
listen  here comes a sre bet
seemingly lacking a will , yet ble to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly  unexpectedly ...
k calling eetu !
eetu receiving
are you exhausted ?
on the contrry , i fel great !
so what 's next ?
if it 's up to me , we could even tighten up
remember when the team frm järvenpä wnt training in the mines ?
oona receiving .
what mines ?
look out for the boat !
should we check it out 
w ned headlamps or something .
everyone shut up , or yo 're dead !
k calling oona !
by th bay
can you stop by the tennis courts ?
sixty seconds .
over 
stop saying ver .
chck them out .
the biological background of man
they can both be classified as tropical diurnal animals
but in the cold he needs facilities such as clothes to survive
hey !
last warning .
the next to speak gets frd
k. there 's a job for you at the natinal theter ... through the bck , second window on the rght .
no buzzer , of course
i 'm in for the nationals nxt week .
it may be good that yu came
ther 's an odd murmur in your heart
the heart s a strange organ , though .
making excessive exertion on the heart impossible .
i just read it
and rushed over to tell m ?
and that 's what we 'll do
i 'll test you at the same tim
ca n't it wat until after the rce ?
until you 've been scanned , training is bnned
yes 
ne for oona , one for eetu , and one for k
perfect fit .
dense but not too tight
no space for air in between .
exactly
so when 's yor next race ?
thank you .
you 're wlcome
i thought i 'd wat until the nationals
but i 'm getting itchy fet .
no way .
no races until mr .
ski has tested you .
you need to be in top form then
if k has worked out a plan for you , why not follow it ?
we 'll dive 3 km down to 350 meters
they come frm cves far awy
i came to train here last spring .
ok .
a smll front gear and a 29 teethed in the rear
it 'll put all your muscle sets to use
i 'll shout when my hert rate goes over 200
we 'll chang into lght gear and keep pedalng through recovery
we 'll keep at it all wek long
switch to light !
switch to heavy !
recovery !
a helluva hill !
is n't it ?
do i ?
yes .
and no wndr .
you were up all night
i 'll take it easy n th next round .
no , you 'r not gong at all
you 'll rest through this session .
you have to get some sleep
 'll skip the next round
eetu , let 's roll on
he recorded my txtbook
how about doing something later ?
on saturday there 's the alleycat contest and a party afterwards
w could think of something then
after you v found 7 plant names in latin , head back downtown
the winner gets a paid day off and  kilo of rssian chocolate
did you oversleep 
yeah , my muscles are totally jammed
what the hll jewel ?
who cares .
lt 's find it and split the week between us
looks like a piece of cake .
ready ... go !
sometimes small change can make a big difference
a lousy deal !
two weeks int the job , and you already got fve days off
now i can study for the exam .
exactly
who won ?
you always have an excuse
what 's the big deal ?
it 's just a game
if you do the sme at th nationals , yo 'll be the laughing stock
what the hell 
i 'm fed up with his bitching
what do you mean ?
what s buggng him ?
ca n't deal with disappintments and takes it out on thers
feel like dancing ?
sure
t 's raining cats and dogs
nothing beats swimming in th rain .
oh yes , i love it
i know the best place in town for a night swim .
where is it ?
wan na go ?
yes !
i 'm leaving
yeah  right .
but i 'm leaving now
how about tomorrow ?
forget it .
forget th whole summer
nothing
listen .
sounds a bit like gears hmming
the tw of you will just have to talk things through
i ll call him in the morning .
i can call him as well
no , i 'll talk to him first
i m so happy .
so am i
etu called at 3 am .
great laps you 're doing !
i 've been wracking my brain over the tactcs for the race
i had planned that eetu would help k t win
you can bth race for first place
it would be gret if one of yu gets lucky
let 's go for a swim after work .
mr .
ski s ttally mind-boggled 
he thught yo wer history
yo calld on saturday .
for a while i suspected you were hitting on oona behnd my back
but i knw you would never do a thing like that to me
especially at a time like this
that 's what i thought
if yu see him ...
then what ?
you need eetu 's help
and he needs mine just the same 
he called m
apologizd for his bhavior .
and ?
bout s ?
abot us of course
why would i l to him .
i feel stupid enough s it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , if you did n't hav the guts to tell him
and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta
yur heart hs to be oprated on
is it a major opertin ?
yes , and difficult
if you were on the national team , maybe ..
i have the nationals on sunday .
and i forbid you to take part
consequently , the ventricles contract
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychlogical changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
am i bothring you ?
looks like my exam wnt really well .
thanks again for the tapes .
why not
should we go som plce ?
i have to finsh this
do n't worry
are you mad at me ?
i did n't mean it exactly that way .
i am what i am
here they are , 40 hungry racers , rady to give their best shot ...
a few names stand out as promising
how 's it going ?
and yo ?
busy as hell .
is the national team all settled ?
on man missing .
my gys will settle it on the road
keep n eye on this promising rider , only 19 years ld
oona !
come on chain mates !
we 're dong grat time
any drink left ?
lf i had , i would n't give you any
thanks
thy 'r cming !
k !
just go !
will you be all right ?
i 'm glad to see you eating agan .
why am i packaged up like this ?
tht 's why you 've got to keep still
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a good chance of recovery
you can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spinal shock , as the doctors believe- yo should be moving yur legs in a month 's tim
but you 'll never become a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a relief
i told them i 'd ask you first
we 're in a hurry
hi !
nver seen paralll bars ths long
i asked the staff t set them up
i left it t the very last mment , but i came anyway
with the under twenty-three national team
congratulations
 would n't have made it without you .
just thank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages
i 'm glad you made it
i think oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can manag on my own .
certanly not
hey , why do n't you leave
will you just get lost !
it 's coming along
but they wo n't let me cycle for a year
strnge how distancs take twice as long as they used t
i passed the exam .
by the skin of my teeth .
congratulations
it must have been the sure bet
do n't you remember ?
seemingly lacking a wll , yet ble to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly ...
unexxc ... unexpectedly .
unexpctedly
i want to apologiz
i really did n't treat you right
that was then
just about to do it
a socket shock
and suddenly socked hm into  real cerebral high
growing his mind into the kind
and a smil upon his face
a guy that crazed nd amazed and otherwise dazed
totally togther computer in tennis shoes
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
tht turned-on , uptight , flat out-of-sight
totally together computer in tennis shoes
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
ba , baa , baa , baa
doo-doo-doodoo-doo
den higgins , today , a computer can hardly be considered a lxury .
oh , very well .
now , unfortunately ,
medfield hs quite a long list of necessties , and a compter just does not have a very high priorty on that list .
now , it 's not that i 'm oldfashined 
you all know that i have an open ear for progress , and we do all that we cn .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we wnt to the expense of live frogs .
we re not dragging our feet , quigley .
why  i just put an order in today for two garbage disposals and an electric dishwasher
anything yt , bradley ?
how 's he doing 
yeah , that figures .
thanks .
you just d n't understand the problem .
d you know what the telphone bill alone is here every month ?
i do n't wnt to hear about state .
yeah , but do you realize that they give n entre course in computer technolgy ?
now , i do n't like to draw comparsons , gentlemen , but if we want to keep abreast of the times and raise our academic average 
we hve got to modernize 
modrnzation is n't everything .
yes , uh , regent deeds .
thank you very much .
gentlemn , i , uh , i would nt like this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are dwn to the nitty-gritty on our budget 
why , we raffled off everything on the camps but the women 's gym .
it 's tough , tugh , tough .
nrest .
oh , uh , that part about the unrest , that 's , uh , that 's off the record , mrs. winifred .
s , quigley , i 'm sorry , but i 'm certin that you understand our problem .
that 's it .
now , for the next item on the agenda ...
us .
well-put , dean .
leonard ...
the not-so-gifted stdents ' needs are just as great as those of th gfted ones .
now , um , quigly , we do have certain neer-do-wells that must be seen to .
probation is no substitute for catching th interest of the student , for firing his imagnation .
come on , quig .
thattaby 
john collgan , roger demney ,
henry fathinger ,
... myles harris ,
adam jervins ,
keith richards , dexter reilly ...
dexter , it 's not funny .
... robrt ross ,
sliver roth .
he went through all the s 's .
hey , that 's right .
oh , yes , of course .
richrd schuylr .
he 's sick .
you know , quig really cres , but the guy ca n't even reason with him .
well , swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive hggins right over th edge .
yo guys must be dreaming .
the guy who 's selling it wants 10 grand .
a.j .
rno .
i mean , i think if we went down there and talked to him , we could get him t dont it to the college .
well , i do nt know abt that .
dexter , you just cleaned up at night .
arno would n't even rmember you .
kind of .
you know , that 's not to bad an idea .
no truble at all , wexler .
i mean , i love that school .
well , believe me , if i did nt give them all that money ,
no .
maybe i can work something out .
look , just give me a little time , huh ?
you know , i like you kids .
i like the idea of a student delegation coming to se me .
makes me feel good ...
thanks .
godbye .
goodbye , boys .
thnks a lot for giving us your time , mr arno .
well , a.j 
arno never forgets an ld employee .
um , it 's ... it 's dexter .
ah , yes , dexter .
yeah , just abot  sir .
all right .
hey , they did pretty god with the horses .
750 is n't bad .
that crap table figure okay ?
looks like a real good day for applejack .
yeah , real good .
incidentally  do n't send that 20 grand to medfield .
do n't you thnk ...
do nt worry bout it .
146 , right .
asy through the door , you guys .
easy .
right in ther .
number 125 .
take it easy .
what a slave driver .
yeah , if he 'd been in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they 'd have made it .
you know  it 's a great idea doing something for the school , but next tme lt 's do somethng easy , like hijacking  cuban airliner .
yah .
professor , can we just take a few seconds off ?
oh , sure .
take s much time as you want .
uh , dexter , there 's a box of tools in the back of my car .
would you get that for me , please ?
sur .
right away , professor .
good mrning , dean .
good morning , dean .
h , deano .
oh , hello , there , dean higgins .
of course , we 're not really set up here yet , but very soon .
well , that 's wonderful .
i see .
and you will understand
we must withhld our yearly cash contribution .
yours in the interest of higher edcation , a.j .
arno.
you can say that agin .
nd  'm gon na tll you this much , quigley ... in the future , i 'm gon na be watching them .
but yu ca n't blame the boys , sir .
oh , gd faith , bad faith , who cares ?
they 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
w still have the computer .
you knw , i do n't like to brag , but if it had n't been for the fact that i used to work there ...
the elemnts of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmetic and logic , and output .
nd , uh , even though it 's an imitation , in many ways , the machine we 've developed cn operate mre efficintly than we can urselves .
nw , in th pst couple of weeks ,
i 've been , uh , working on a small experiment , uh , whch is intended to show how we can be replaced by a compter .
hey ... this may be  way of getting rid of dean higgins .
we live in hope , dexter .
now , let 's sppose that your parents are going way for the weekend , and they leav you the following instructins ...
all right 
and being th conscientious and reliable young people
i know yu to be  yo promptly forget to do it .
now , this is a rain gauge , and it 's , uh , sitting on a roof of a building .
the memory bank , in turn , activates the electronic circuits , the window closes , the door opens ... hopefully th cat cmes in ... and the autmatic telephone goes into ction , right ?
th rain ... falls .
computerized mle voice 
this is s recording .
hmm .
that 's enough of that .
thank yo .
now , another very important feature is its infallible memory .
and they were kind enough to send us this magnetic tape , whch will call forth from the computer solutions to a series of problems that would occur on a simulated flight to the planet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center panel , please .
hey , quig 
hey .
well , it seems like our flight to saturn will be a little delayed .
this is dean higgins 
now , as many of you know , we came in 36th last year .
i do n't know .
what happend , professor ?
it , uh  should be replaced , but i ca n't get over to capital elctronics today .
oh , that 's okay .
i 've got nothing to do .
oh  yeah , but i know all that stuff .
cars and buses going from place to place .
one guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes 
i got it ll , prof .
yes , i 'm sure you do hav it all , dexter , but if i wer you , i would look it over again this afternoon .
aw , honst , professor .
it would n't do any good .
i 'm up to here with it .
let me go to marshfield .
believe m , the drive and fresh air will do me good .
it culd n't be a .
the answer to the last two questions ws a .
would nver have three a 's in a row .
it 's got ta be b or c .
i have n't seen a c for a long tim .
got to be c .
that 's thre a 's in a row .
that 's impossible .
3 at 8-02-30 .
applejack pompey palac ,
dextr ?
dexter , are you okay ?
nah , you were beeping .
burping ?
no , beping .
w ... nothing .
well , there must be a short in it somewhere .
i had to call in these computr people .
well , move alng , boys .
now , ladies and gentlemen , this is a speed test .
and that mens if you have truble with any question , skip it and move on to the next one because you 'll be graded on the total number of qustions you answer correctly .
you may begin .
dexter , come on .
fnny guy .
i tell you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a doctor .
that 's ridiclous .
he did n't cheat  dean higgins .
now , we usually allow an hour and a half for that test 
dexter finished it in 41/2 minutes , and he did n't mak a mistake .
man :
yes .
listen , at this rate , you 'r gon na faint in front of all those peple .
dexter , it is n't that easy .
things are n't the same .
you have a responsibility now .
yeah .
yeah .
d n't worry about it , man 
there are ging to be 37 million viewers , qugley 
no question .
oh , mayor collins .
nice to see you , mayr .
ha !
it 's the mayor .
i tell you , quigley ,
ha !
mayor collins and there s councilman cooper over there and suprvisor straight and there 's  h , oh  he 's not anything .
hllo , dean !
what 's he doing here ?
well , i do n't like t .
every time  see him , i have to hear abut his building program .
it 's enogh to mke you sick .
hello .
i 've been hearing great things .
well , you know , at medfild , the scholastic ...
nice to see yu .
 would have gotten over here sooner , but i 've been tied up planning our new science building .
you know , quigley , sometimes i think i should have taken p contracting insted of education .
no .
i-i mean , he 's all booked up .
uh-huh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies nd gntlemen .
oh , i 'd better take my seat .
i 've been invited to sit in the control room .
in the control room .
i tell you , he 's trying to steal that boy way from us .
i 'm sure of it .
you do n't understand him , quigley .
the man is gredy .
he 's up to his throat in state money , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each of ur learned guests will be allowed 3 questions .
our frst questions will be from dr. rufus schmidt , head of the department of highr mathmatics at purdue university .
dr. schmidt .
well , i ...
i , uh , i guess i am .
i see .
mr. reilly , using the fundamental theorem of advanced calculus , and applying the formula that the square of a distance from the origin to p
is eqal to x squared plus y squard plus z squared 
you see ?
h 's getting his confidence .
your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 .
the square root of that product would be .. 102,978 .
i m fraid that 's quite correct .
hey .
man :
i must say , that was really something .
yes , i suppose it was , but would n't it speed things up a bit if we could save the applause till the end ?
yes , uh ,  'm sure the audience wuld be gld to comply 
good 
your third question , dr. schmidt 
gentlemen , please .
i hope you 're aware that i 'm perfectly equipped to go into other fields .
of course 
uh , prhaps now we could hear from , uh , dr. sigel , professor of foreign lnguages at lansing universty .
getting his confidence is one thing , but this is ridiculous .
 liked him better the way he was .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phnomenal dexter rilly .
we 'r awaiting the rrival of the phenomenal dexter relly .
it promises to be xciting , so stay with us as our cameras follow dxter reilly on his journey through gotham .
there 's ben s buzz of excitement around the big city this past wek , ladies and gentlemen .
everywhere you go , you hear the same question ... is dxter rilly for real ?
should be any second now .
and ther he is !
well ...
uh , mr. reilly 's bing greted by two young ladies who came all the way from yonkers just to greet him .
this is priscilla cummings ...
queen of th yonkers botanical society ,
i always knew if he had any brains , he 'd be dangerous .
look , i know dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind of understandable 
look at that crowd , quigley .
what a boon for the college .
why could n't the boy hve been carrying a medfield pennnt ?
do n't you think tht wuld have been pushing it a little , sir ?
yes 
from universal encyclopedias .
oh , tell him we already have a st .
he s no slesman , sir .
he 's the president of universal encyclopedia .
the president ?
sure .
the quiz program where they ask the questions from the encyclopedia , and they give away $ 100,000 ?
it 's a real pleasure .
thank you .
who are yu ?
who am ...
that 's good .
i like tht .
who am i ?
and  like that set of encyclopedias of yours .
displaying again his remarkable intellectual prowess ,
dextr reilly was able to converse with each delegate to the u.n in his own tongue .
they 're waiting for him in the security council .
earlier today , dr. suzuki of the nternatonal school of lnguages stated that wth s computer-type brain such as dexter reilly has , he 'll son be able to master every language the world has evr known .
 think he 's given s good indication of that today .
professor mertins , we ned tht boy .
he can wrap up that college knowledge program for us .
of course , bt we ca n't take any chances 
parsons ?
uhh , jst a minute , quigley .
trmendous .
well , t-this is rather important , sir .
it 's about the college knowledge program .
dexter will chew up those encyclopedias .
it seems that mr. van dyke is explaining the operation to the boy wonder .
only maybe we do n't have dexter .
what ?
find out when his plan arrives !
quigly , how could you let this happen ?
the first operation of cutting the diamnd in two exact halves s the most important .
i beg you .
wh-iii-pppp !
yeah , mr. arno , but i m kind of busy right now 
well  i hated t interrupt you , but i 've got some good news .
oh ?
to what i 'm gon na do .

hi , professor .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't mean to interrpt anything .
yes .
well , it 's just , uh ,  little thing , dexter .
it , uh , seems that we need , uh , three more members for the panel .
i see .
well , you know me , quigley , i 'm not a proud man .
if , uh , dexter does n't lke my suggestions , then he can have anybody he wants .
who does he want ?
hmm .
schuyler , henry , and myls .
schuyler , henry  and myles ?
and i 'm afraid that if we tried to force anyone else on him , he might ...
y
i mean , we want to keep that boy happy .
but schuyler , henry , and myles .
but the answer to part one is th battle of thrmopylae ,
well  lockhurst has answred two parts out of three correctly .
okay , schuyler , you answer this one .
what ?
it does nt look good f i answer all the questions .
phidias , who did  statue of athena , and praxiteles , who specialized in human figurs , then there was myron , who sculpted the figure of a discus-thrower , kind of like the best thing he ever done .
okay .

gentlemen , you have 20 secnds 
i think i misunderstood the question , sir .
w
who 's that guy , merlin ?
not merlin , myron .
gentlemen , your time is almost up .
i think i misunderstood the nswer , sir .
you did ?
that 's the last tim i 'll do that .

 nude descending a staircas.
boy , that 'd never make playboy .
oh , dean collingsgood , nice to see you .
you 'r scoting , i imagine .
and i would lke to say right at the beginning ,
if you had an ounce on integrity , you 'd withdraw him .
withdraw whom ?
it 's unfair .
he 's an intellectual freak !
unfortnately , this year , medfield has the horses .
are those the horses ?
fr 10 points each , could you give us the highst and lowest points in south america ?
the highest point is mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feet .
that is absolutely correct .
hey , i dd n't try to get him arrested , you know .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon na be a raid ?
i want to hear this .
som of that consumption was in the liquid form .
can you gve the phrase in slang fr the central unfrozen portion in a container f frozen cider ?
that 's absolutely right 
applejack .
hey , boss , i had nothin ' to do with this .
i swear .
what was i talking about ?
mr. arno , if you could please relx for just a little ...
out , out .
but ..
this is applejack .
i do n't want a trace of that operation left .
shut down ?
why ?
what 's the matter ?
whatever you say .
we got ta put that kid on ice .
look , we need time to figure this out .
hello ?
i wnt the pompey palace on franklin road in charlottesville 
yah .
you knw  if that kid had n't been stopped , he 'd have mentoned every joint i own in this state .
take him out to th hancock plac .
right .
no , i do n't know the area code .
hello , dxter .
go ahead .
start the car .
you know , fresh air nd stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happened  lieutenant .
he was supposed to be at my house abut 8:30 last night , nd he never showed up .
and nobody 's seen him since .
well , we 've checked all over .
he has n't been in an accdent nor has h been arrested .
lieutenant  i wonder if he could hav had an attack of amnesia .
could be miles away by now .
mm-hmm .
i 've alerted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his car .
and if they do n't pick him up pretty soon , then  'm afraid we 'll have to suspect foul play .
fol play , huh ?
well , that 's t !
collngsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean collngsgood over at state 
oh , do n't you se it , quigley ?
i mean , if dexter s n't back tomorrow for that college knowledge program , then springfield state will get the $ 100,000 grant .
uh , wait a minute .
wait a minte .
the dean of a college , a kidnapper ?
well , you do n't know him .
yu do n't know him t all .
the man is ruthless .

animals 740 , tables 600 , amusements 500 .
applejack  charlie ...
gee , ll those places and always appljack.
he did n't hve the foggiest idea wht they were .
maybe it does n't mean anything .
then all of a sdden , he mentions pplejack , and wham !
just like that , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses through a book on an oriental language , nd then speaks it fluently , remembering every accent .
how come he does n't remember this ?
pete , it does n't make sense .
unless ... unless he 'd never read it or seen it or heard it before .
it was in the computer .
and now he blurts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missing .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack 
... for something , something he des n't want anybody to know about .
hi .
i do n't care who believes it , just as long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell them if thy look up these places , they 're gon na find out what applejack is up to .
and the reason why we know applejack is arno is 'cause it came from the computer into dexter 's had .
and that 's why dexter does n't rmmber it .
come on 
that 's why pete remembered that applejack was arno .
arno ?
yeah , because it was the only thing he could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered .
because he could n't ?
exactly .
well , uh , thank you , mr. schuyler .

oh .

chad dylan cooper , dancing  nne-year-old girl .
so who wants to boogie ?
yes .
yes , we still do t .
we pint everything ... the jaguar , the fish .
only after five days ... .
first we put paint .. then charcoal .
about fr or five days ld .
yes , i dd .
 do nt remember , it was too long go .
kuberene was kind of a sad boy , but  good person .
one was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had famlies .
it leds to suffering , pin , danger and death !
we do n't have ... any written education ... we get our knwledge from our parents and families .
they teach us about our destiny , about being an indian ... being a human being , and about lfe .
if we do n't respect our elders ... we 'll be lost .
during the republic they tried .. to chnge us into whites overnight .
we were confused ... not knowing how to live in this new situation ... and after the years ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defend orselves .
but how ?
we 'll see if we will have to operat .
we teach our children to read .
we want to learn only the good things from the whits .
that s why we teach our children , so that wo n't happn .
yes .
i likd it very much , i was very happy .
i have missed him a lot since i lost him .
and now , when  saw him ...
i was very happy indeed .
i 've been feeling so sad ... nd this was great for me .
it ws great to see him live .
when i saw him moving ...
he was steering the canoe .
the water was very low .
when the canoe passed over a crocodile .. it went crazy and attcked my father ... right t his neck .
in this village ... a lot of things hav changed since your last visit .
but for me the saddest thing is that i 've lost my husband .
i mss the safety he gave me .
 remember long ago , one night he came into my hut ... and the next morning we were husband and wife .
he was a very good prsn , very kind and hard working .
how long have yo been running 
are you not tired ?
be reasonable 
give me the amulet and walk away 
i 'll ven pay you for your troubles .

excpt for the activity up in the hayloft  the frm was pretty quiet that morning .
they could slep through anything .
but a lot of the other animals were awakened by all that scurrying overhead .
some of thm just accepted it .
some wre pretty annoyed .
but the mood ws very different up in the hayloft .
she was determined to be  good mothr nd never yell t her kittns .
but that approach would not last very long , because milo , one of her kittens , was trouble from the very beginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that 's not a good idea !
come back here  mil !
you 're a strange-looking cat , milo sid .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , all right , a dg .
but , m , really , deep down insde , we re all cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barked 
the kittens wre now big enough to leave th hayloft and see the world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was th first to start calling out for fod .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to milo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me 
this is the dock and down there is the river .
everyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
mlo asked .
is ths ?
oh 
ah !
milo , get back here , his mther demanded .
but milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by the river 
right now 
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo meowd .
i think so , milo said .
all right , be careful , his mother orderd  and began swimmng .
all right .
i m not going to yell , his mother said .
now dry yrself off , lke this :
and follow me back home .
that ws fun .
ha , ha .
mil !
get over hre !
the months passed , nd the farm was humming with the sounds of summr 
milo had some new hiding places he cold n't wait to try out 
otis sniffed around the yard for a while .
you 're in th pipe , milo .
try again .
cat 's n the can !
and mil slipped off to another hiding place .
it was n't esy fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tried a hardr spot .
but otis found hm there too .
now mlo needed a brillint idea .
aha .
he thought of a place where otis could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but mlo wondered if it was really worth the trouble .
milo and otis went to see what all the commotion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rang out :
and all the hens left in a clucking flurry bcuse that was gloria talking , a young chicken who had scratched and pcked her way to the top rung of the henhuse .
gloria had a good reason for wanting to be alone .
there it is , fellas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it fnlly happened .
is she staying at home with t or is she going back t work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kick it back to you , otis ?
milo sked .
otis sad .
i kicked it by accident 
gloria gave us a job to do .
how long do we have to stick around this henhouse ?
until gloria comes back .
maybe you do n't realize it , milo , but this is a major day for me bcause ...
well , maybe you do n't ralize that this is the day i 've become a watchdog .
some strange nises brought milo out of the henhouse .
what was all this about ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
com here , otis ,  frog craked .
tis said .
tis , it 's your cat buddy .
otis , come n .
at that moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
h deserved it , the frog croaked .
and outside , milo and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis growled .
just try something .
probably rotten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird animal .
the noise attracted a group of local snoops looking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're hving a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
your mommy 's a chicken .
the other nimals told otis he 'd bettr take the chick to gloria , and quickly , which he did 
but the chick kept coming back to otis .
now go back to glra .
do you understand ?
woof , the chick peeped .
woof , wof , mommy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you 've got to be a rough , tough , mean , fighting dog , like this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it a try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll mss him .
com on , said milo .
phew .
wow , look t this thing , otis , mlo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle the score with that --
that , uh , thing .
ha , ha .
this ll be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up , ots !
maybe milo was having a terrifc time , but otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe he culd jump ff the bridge into the box if he hurried .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work eithr .
otis just could n't swim fst enogh and the river took milo farther downstrem .
mil was n't really worried until he lost sight of otis .
suddenly he heard something movng in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo trid to duck low in the box so the bear would n't see him 
but the bx was drifting right towards the hungry animal .
but unfortnately much too soon .
the bear saw what was n that box .
thn came otis .
that bear is 10 times my siz .
he ran up on the riverbnk , leading the bear away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he was getting a little concerned because the river was beginning to move faster ... and faster .
he 'd lost track of otis now , and he was drifting farther and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the river had carried milo deep into the frest .
and he heard mysterious hoots and growls and cries in the night .
h began to wsh he 'd never jumped into this box and he began t wish he was hme .
it seemed to be tremblng as much as he was in the chilly , misty night .
he drifted on through the darkness , hping to find the morning waiting just around the bend .
when daylight came ,
mlo saw a farm on the rivrbank .
for one happy moment , he thought he was home and cried ot for joy .
but he looked again .
he did nt know when he would ever see it again .
here comes the dog your life he -- ♪
the deadwod swamp .
a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves or branches , and where no creature could live , excpt fr the drded deadwood brds .
and one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box .
okay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
por cat .
ct so sad , the bird croaked .
look in the box .
ots prpared himself and peeked in the box and saw only a solitary black feather .
in fact , milo was nowhere near the deadwood swamp 
fter his box got stuck there , he rn .
he ran from those birds as quickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
the ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow where he saw a kind f nimal he 'd never seen before .
feeling pretty hungry , he immediately wondered ,
is that something you can eat ?
heh .
hello , somene there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful , milo thought .
and above all , i must keep absolutly silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch where he figured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah , here , my precious muskrat .
you should b safe there till dinnertime , the fox said 
mlo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fox run over the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on a big , tasty muskrat lunch .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled thrugh the wtlands to a beach fll of clam holes .
he remembered there was one magc word everyone understood and that was please .
so h marched up to a clam hole and said ,
ww .
the clouds were getting darker and darker and a chilly wind was whipping across the countryside .
milo was several miles from the beach caught in the sme storm .
h got a little wet and he felt awfully lonesome without ots , bt at least he ws safe .
the tide came in so fst that the rck tis had been sitting on was completely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd never be able to swim to shore .
and the water was growing higher .
nw the water ws p to his paws .
he 'd hav to try to swim .
he tok a dep breath , but just when he was ready to div in ...
oh , not agan , the sa turtle gurgled .
every time the tide comes n some fool gets stuck out here .
otis was n't sure what this turtle wanted .
well , now you know .
now , just stay on th shore , where you belong , the turtle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
next time the tide comes n , i 'll have to rscue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said otis , i did n't know that .
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otis called ot , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
i have n't got time , otis sid , sensing this fox was n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis was outraged .
ha !
he marveled at this road made of wod and iron and decided to follow the road and see wher it would tke him .
it could 've run right over me .
but milo was determind .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i 'm not sure cts know how to bound , milo said .
bound and leap , like a zephyr set free .
bound and , of course , leap .
t just does n't look right when  do it .
frolic with me , friend .
cme , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frlickng .
i 'm frolicking .
yo see 
ahem .
you can stop frolicking now , the deer coed .
i think i 'm a little tuckered out , mil said .
yes , it is possible to over-frolic , the deer murmured .
and the deer took milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest flor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trild milo from the deadwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the frend he missed so mch .
bt now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling .
as evening was falling ,
milo decided the safest place to spend the night wold be in a tree 
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest blong to you ?
yes , and t 's not just any nest ,  ll have you know .
i 'm the night bird , and that is a dreaming nest 
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone sleeping there will have his sleep flooded with dreams , the bird sid 
but it 's  safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... we 'd think of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so thy wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
whoo !
all right .
i wan na be your lifetime friend
i never think of money i think f milk and honey
grinnin ' like a cheshire cat
i focus on th plasure somethin ' i can treasure

really nothin ' to it , anyone can do it
it 's easy and we all know how
nothin 's really where it 's at
beat down th walls begin , believe , begat

that 's my littl girl .
how old is she ?
she 's four and a half .
your only child ?
i see .
ys ?
i guess not .. nothing you could say was really different .
narrator :
for several weks , mrs. white was greatly helped by the psychiatric treatment .
she had n more blackout splls ... at least none that she was aware of .. but not qite a year later , several thngs happened . that showed her to be in urgent need of help .

woman :

you ought to be mighty proud of her ... the way she looks in those dresses , especially that lilac on .

what does this voice say to you ?
a woman 's voice ?
can you recognize it in any way ?
it sounds familiar sometimes ... but i do n't really recognize t .
to do things like .. leave ralph ... take bonnie and run away .
that is what it means , is n't it ?
you 've been frightened by this voic ... because you rcognize t as a symptom of illness .
does n't make any difference .

mama and papa and bonnie and ..
i can remember .
i can remember 
that was in the fall of 1953 .
on september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. white : dear dr luther ...
narrtor :
in winter , endless darkness is brightened by the frsky dance of the northrn lights 
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely wether for polar ber families .
one hundred nd fifty thousand years ago some brown bears moved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bears can not thrve anywhere else .
polar bears have always hunted frm floating platforms of sea ice .
that 's why th arctic is warming twice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percent mor ocean than it does now .
if the current trend continues the arctc ocean could be free of sea ic each summer by the year 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slow it down .
most arctic glaciers are melting faster than ever before .
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in search of sea ice often has further to go .
some cubs do survive especially f the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do the inuit people like simon qamanirq .
simon :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
but now the ancient weather patterns have changed .
our grandfathers fed their families well .
my family has always depended on snow and ice 
sometimes we fall through .
my friend adam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years into rising their young .
walrus moms spend even longer .
they dive down from rafts of ice which drift along and carry thm to fresh supplies of thr favorite treat .
mothers tach their young survivl skills such as scaring off intruders .
one morn sent me a very clar message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
this water is literally as cold as ice .
th salt keeps it from freezing .
down here , there 's only one exit and it 's prtty scry thinkng you could be trapped .
each sprng in alaska large herds of caribou set out on a long journey .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what the caribou mothers g through and to see this migration from their perspective .
leanne :
these newlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to their birthing grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
this is climte change slowing down the herd .
some of these calvs are just a week or two old  and they 're easy pickings for bears and wolves .
this is the place where the calves have their best chance to survive .
these bugs are potentially dedly to these caribou .
to get away .
crbou mothers re having a tough time as the rctic warms .
but polar bear mothers face an evn greater struggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i m captain of this ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world and most of thm are camer-shy .
one bear was especially helpful .
it 's hard t keep up when you 're only 3 months old .
next year we re coming bck with stronger cases .
narrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to impossible .
then the team got lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
because the sun never sts in the smmer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males prefer sels but in a pinch , they have always gone after defenselss cubs .
the mother semed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finally spotted a mal quite a ways off zerong in on the mother and her cubs .
now that seals are so hard to catch , starving males might be targeting cubs more often .
but next time thngs could be much diffrent 
playful cubs can relly work up an appette .
bjorne :
when you want to grab a bite to eat up here timing is everything .
the cubs finish everything on their plate but the scent of fresh seal meat attracts attention .
but the male picks up the family 's scent again .
we watch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on the family .
then the mother turns to face him ... .. slowing him down just long enough for hr frightened cubs to scape .
at the moment of truth , the mother sent a very clar message :
yu can gt to my cubs if you want but you 'll have to kill m first .
nrrator :
but she 's powrless to save the habitat they need to survive .
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster than it has for thousands of years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
th mothers here nurture their young so lovingly .
perhaps they can inspire us to protect ther home with that same cre .

real pointy ones .
these treacherous waters shelter many a desperate pirate .
a skilled captain able to sail this maz will find , at ts center , the inn of jolly joe , a popular pirate hunt .
we can not turn back .
captain , are you up to the task ?
why , exactly , do we need to go there ?
to find out more about this .
you can cut a can with it and still slice a tomato .
if w find out who the owner is , we 'll b clser to finding alexander .
we must do whatever it takes t rescue my brother , willory .
does anyone know where the bthroom s ?
oh .
do n't worry about a thing , willory .
looking good , captain .

the cutlass belongs to robert .
rbert the terrible .
you have his cutlass , but yu 're not he .
the others were fooled , but i know better .
yo know where we cold find this fellow ?
but i ve heard tell of an island  past the rocks of malabar .
nt that i 'd go loking for it .
and why should n't they ?
thy do n't call him robert the terrible for nothing .
he 's the king 's own brother , but he 's as bad as the king is good .
and , for his treachry , was banshed from monteria .
s he 's a little nasty .
a little ?
story says he 's waiting for the king to step away , just long enough to grab his beloved children and take the throne for his wn .
for robrt to claim the throne , they must be gone !
on vacation ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enough adventure for this gourd .
clearing tables is really kind of fun when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
where are you going ?
somwhere else .
the helpseker brought yu her , and only the helpseeker can send you back 
just get me back to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're our heroes !
brav as lions and cunning as foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
wh are yo ?
i do n't know .
i 'm like  slepy little panda .
there 's no island anywhere .
i 'll leave the interpretatin up to yo .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work will be done .
well , wht if the map is wrong ?
that des have a nice ring t it .
great plan , george .
rase the mast n the steadfast !
w play the hddock for a hat trick
we got the hammocks on the main deck
we got the btler dong the henpeck
scraming so
we d n't know
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a relic from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're on the bad mood swing
w have n't done one thing
not even the minimum daily requrement
but if you r feeling a little seasick
and you want to get off th guilt trip
what are you gon na show him ?
go , heroes
standing in the gap taking up the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheel keep an ven kel
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's t .
the island may still li ahead .
what is that ?
el remolino , the great whirlpool !
i thought it was prate legend , but there it is .
captain george 's death cruise ,
brought to you by george , the crzy grape .
i thught yu were on our side .
thank you , george .
might be a giant whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but or own demise !
huh .
how about that ?
water droplets in the air reflecting the sky so perfectly they block the island from view .
right on time .
and look who they left behind .
do you think there are snakes on this sland ?
'caus snakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
and spiders and bears .
i do n't follow you .
sail to the rocks  d n't find the island  go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here with captan wther channel on my way to be slicd and diced by edward scissorhands !
maybe then we cn go home .
now , if i were a cave , where would i be ?
we ca n't sneak up on them in a pirte boat , yo ninny 
i do n't know .
or maybe a billboard .
to obvious .
if a sailor wre to look for me ,
the east is whre he 'd start .
he 'd rach the isle of walking rocks
and the clapping pass would part .
then gaze with pride upon my keep ,
not found on any chart ,
till he would spy my stely eye
ooh 
copyright robert the terrible .
oh , yeah .
so , what do we got 
we head east to ...
holy mackerel !
what ?
pieces of eight ?
spanish gold ?
even better .
cheese curls !
i 'm not going back to the boat .
what do you mean yu 're not going back to the boat ?
the way i see it , i have two choices .
but , the princess  she thinks we 're heroes .
we are n't any of those things .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
where do i start ?
how about you , my little friend ?
what ?
she 's sailing away .
maybe she did n't need them after all .
are you beeping ?
the ball .
what ?
it means our work is done .
where 's the rwboat ?
we can go home .
hold on a sec .
how long has that been here ?
it 's one of robert 's bats .
it 's blinking !
something ai nt right .
they 've got the princess !
we got to help her !
come on !
listen , when the ball blinks , our wrk is dne and we can go home .
do n't you want to go home ?
but i also want them to want to see me .
you knw , mybe the reason they do n't look up to me is becase i have n't given them something worth looking up to 
it was wrong about that 
it culd be wrong about this , to .
if you want to go home  you can go home .
but eloise needs me .
let s go save a princess 
help is on the way !
what kind f a crazy b movi am i in ?
let 's be rasonabl 
i was n't really going to eat you , but you were impersonating a snack food !
i think you 're right .
then we 'll just have to follow the clus .
head east to the island of walking rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like roaches !
i bet george knew bot those little things from the weathr channel , too .
t s n't worth it .
eaten by hs own favorite snack food .
at least that one day , from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'd want me to come back .
what ?
sorry , boys !
gord is off the menu !
what do you wnt , robert ?
indeed .
he tok monteria 's wealth , our wealth , my wealth , and squandered it on strangrs .
whn the crown is mine , i can once again enjoy the benefits of royalty .
yu 're not strong enough to take the crown from my father 's head .
of course , i ca n't just leave them in the harbor waiting , or i 'll blow up my own ships .
he did n't say .
alexander !
surly you must know when your father is returning !
if you can mange to remember ,
yu have two hours to think it over .
put them in their cell .

after the 32nd verse , it grates .

it was all a misunderstanding .
we 're no hroes .

he 's so lazy , he ca nt evn climb a ladder without giving up .
and george thre , he 's such a wimp , even hs own son thinks he 's a loser .
when all hope is gone , help will come from above in the shape of a donkey .

we 're not donkeys .
we 're cabin boys .

on the wings of a snow-white dove
he sends his pre sweet love
on the wings of a snow-white dove
he sends his pure sweet love
a sign from above
a sign from abov
a sign from abov
it 's a mracle .
a miracle .
a mircle .
a miracle .
i thought someone should tell yu .
father tardone .
father pat , bfore you start espousing yet anothr mircle , i advise you to take a breath .
he is with us here n aubrn .
the people from the revivl of angls meeting re all talking about it .
another miracle .
a revival tent ?
i warned you bout this joshua .
hey , i 'm not the only one .
everyne says it 's a mircl .
i have kept my eyes open and my vision clear , like you dvised me to ,
corrupted ?
as soon as ths joshua completes the statue , i want you to end yor association wth him .
he 's my frend .
good morning .
good morning , bishp .
thank you fr seeing me .
i 'll get rght to th point .
he seemed simple enough , but he 's shown a powerful influence ovr a great many people .
the protestant clergy nd i would like ...
and the purpose of this meeting would be to investigate these miracles ?
we all have btter things to do with our tim .
that i 'm glad to hear .
that i 'm glad t hear 
my own fther hayes follows him arund like a lost puppy .
this is a small fire  father tardone .
this is a small fre , fathr tardone .
father tardone , hello .
how are you ?
it 's the artist you have a problem with .
i 'm surprised you found time to fnish your work , considering all your other chores .
i suppose i do n't think of them as chores .
you know , father , we could use your help down at the baptist church .
join you ?
it 's the others whose eyes are nt pen .
to what ?
a miracle worker ?
i have nver made that claim .
a mracle worker ?
nd i think it 's time for everyone else to find out .
t loks very nic 
yes , they 've definitely made prgress .
i know most of you .
what joshua has persuaded you t do with this church is wonderful .
but i want yu all to look ...
does anyone do something fr nothing ?
does a complete stranger offer to help without wanting something n return ?
preaching ?
i do n't think you know what this is .
it 's  love letter .
a love letter ?
what about sin and god 's law ?
how dare you assume the role of the clergy ?
wait a minute .
what joshua has done is a mircle .
living next to each other did n't make us neighbors .
make us care about ne another , did it ?
but by working together hre with josha --
led by him .
cme on .
see the god in this man --
if you can lok at this church and how everybody here has changed for the bettr ...
and sy  this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no , no .
whatever it is yu stand for , father tardone , i do n't want to be a part of .
i ca n't .
 w n't wear this anymor .
i wo n't take it 
may god have mercy on you .
he 's just fraid .
no .
about this .
i am part of the clergy in this town , and  uh ,
i 'm too-
so i mght as well ...
it 's not true , pat .
what do you knw about being a priest , joshua ?
what do you know about th responsibility i feel ?
you 're just a guy .
you 're just a guy .
t just needs to be understood , and --
you 're wrng , pat .
hi , maggie .
made it just in time .
now , theo , since you 're the first one who came to help , you should be the one to put the bell on the steeple .
tke it easy , now .
that thing is big .
theo  cn you hear me ?
you 'r gon na wake up .
your work 's not done .
okay , now , come on .
come on , now .
come on , now .
wake up .
that 's it .
that 's it .
what happened ?
you fll off the roof 
come on 
you all right ?
thank you .
what just happened here ?
what just happend here ?
i mean , it's-it 's possible he survived the 40-foot fall ...
a certifiably dead person and you brought him back to life .
bless me , father , for i hve sinned .
i turned my back on my vocation .
but i have overcome my crisis of faith .
i am not resigning .
i promise you , father pat , the vatican shall know of this , and when they do , this miracle wrker will vanish .
he will simply run way .
you 're wrong about him , father tardone .
joshua ?
i 've never seen anything so beautful .
what ?
this is n't a letter .
from who ?
i do n't know if i 'll be visitng the pope , but thanks fr the etiquette tip .
hmm .

a spiritul leader ?
you do n't seem dangerous r evil .
do n't let hm fool you , cardinl .
i beg a formal condemnation of him by the vatican .
who 's come to auburn to mslead peopl , then i accept your condemnation .
then i accept your condmnation .
but is that truly what you see in me ?
that 's not what you 're afrid of , is it ?

and that if they open their hearts to it , i will fill that emptiness , and they will be able to lv one another .
that 's the message .

i 'm a lonesome polecat

to a herd of cows
i 'm a mean old hound dog
'cause i i n't got no
a man ca n't sleep
i 'm a little old hoot owl
hootin ' in the trees
'cause i ai n't got no
little gal owl fowl
ca n't shot no breeze
with a bunch f trees
it is beautifl , is n't it ?
i 've seen too much of it 
i 'm not spending another winter here , snowed in for months .
what would we do without you ?
benjamin says he 's leaving .
why should they grieve ?
once is all it takes if it 's the right one .
i had such dreams about ll of them living around .
dozns of children , visiting back and forth at christmas and birthdays .
if benjamin goes , then another will go .
if you could just get a look at yourselves ...
if you 're sweet on them  why do n't you do something about it ?
they were n the same fix you 're in .
they was opening up new territory , and wmn were scrce , like hre .
course , this being oregon and godfearing territory you 'd have to captre a parson .
they the ones i heard about settled north of here ?
no , this was in olden days .
i read about it in milly 's book .
a bok !
why , this is history .
this really happened .
tell you abot them sobbing ' women wh livd in the roman days
so they took them all back home to dry
seems they cried and kissed and kssed and cried
ll over that roman countrysid
so do n't forget that
when you 're taking a bride
sobbin ' , fit to be tied
gather round , i 'll tell you .
they never did return thir plunder
to rotundas small but cut
them women was sobbin ' , sobbing ' , sobbin '
passin ' them nghts
whle the romans was ut hobnobbin ' , starting up fights
is that so ?
they kept occupied by sewing lots f little old togas for them tots and saying ' , someday womenflks will have rights
-whil the romans had fights
listen to this .
when the menfolk went to fetch them
the women would not be fetched
now  let this be because t 's true
a lesson to the liks of you
or else they 'll think yo 're tetched
oh , they acted angry and annoyd
them poor little dears
why are you sitting there ?

we 're gon na make them sobbn ' women smile
ho there .
be quiet about t .
they re coming out .
good night , liza .
just one kiss .
well , maybe just a little one .
why , carl !

let 's go !
we 'll get thm .
make them stp yelling 
here w go .
ther she ges !
what have you done ?
help us , mlly .
we 've been kidnapped !
mke them take us back .
you tak these girls back at once !
we ca n't .
the avalanche !
they 'll just have to wait till spring , that 's all .
it cme out of that book about them sabine womn .
what kind of men are you ?
swooping down , carrying off poor innocents !
they 're just young boys in love .
go on in the kitchen .
you 'll eat nd slep in th barn with the other livestock .
i 'm ashamed of you .
you 're taking this to hard .
m and th boys will get a parsn hre some way .
do you think those girls would marry them now ?
i ca n't abide to look at you 
what are you doing ?
you ca n't stay up there alone .
t 's us she 's mad at .
there 's nthing like a hot cup f tea when you re all tuckered out .
can you hear me ?
i hear .
please , milly .
snowblls with rocks in them !
what do you want ?
i need an extra blanket .
who is it ?
benjamn .
my leg s feeling poorly .
w wantd ...
it began at first by wars and acts of hostility and then ...
does n't it do anything but snow up here ?
we 've had a blizzard every day fr two mnths .
alice , why do n't you read out loud to us ?
we 've heard that book three times .
go on , read about the sabine women 
get a dress from milly , and i 'll fit it .
no one ?
we 're no one .
i wish i could hunt eggs .
i love to hunt eggs .
dorcas galen !
what 's the mtter ?
i saw you !
do n't you dare say that about martha !
girls 
stop it this minute !
you see , i 'm counting on all of yu to help me becase i 'm going to have a baby .
h , milly , sit down !
that 'd be silly .
but when ?
in the spring .
dorcas !
i 've always wanted to be a june bride nd have a baby right off .
nd the bridegroom who marries in june
of a spring that lasts all summer long
home you ride
with the echo of mendlssohn 's tune
n your hearts
s you ride
the day a maiden marries
here comes the brid
they 're each promising to love and obey
when yo marry in june
in november , the snow starts to fly
ankle-high
come december , it 's up to your knee
still , the brid 's a bride-to-be
still the snow never melts
oh , the barnyard is busy in a regular tizzy
and the obvous reason is because of the season
each nest is twitterin ' they 're all babysitterin '
every field wears a bonnet with some spring dasies on it
sun 's getting shinery to spotlight the finery
and affixin ' his lady with a legal eye
screams  suppose w set the date this week ?
yes , sirree , spring discloses that it 's all one supposes
milly 's having her baby !
liza , martha , ruth , hurry !
i 'm an uncle .
i 've come to get you .
well , milly has a baby .
it come day before yesterday .
it 's as true as i 'm standing here .
tricks ?
she 'd never bring herself to ask you back .
she 'd be wasting her breath 
i do n't fgure to go .
not even to see the baby ?
your own kin ?
your own little girl ?
a girl 
i might have known she 'd have a girl .
i 'll be back when the pass is opn .
now get !
the pass is open !
bring yor rifles , your sides , your guns  axes , any kind of weapon !
the pass is open !
what ar you staring at ?
i said i 'd be back when th pass was open .
go upstairs , girls .
put plenty of blankets and straw in it .
what do yu call her ?
hannh .
i 'd string him up the nearest tree shoot him down like i wold a thieving fox .
i thought about you too whil i was up there .
it seemed like i could n't get you off my mind .
the wagon 's ready .
all right .
they ai n't going .
i 'm taking them back .
what do i have to do  beat some sense into your dumb heads ?
takng them back 's the only way .
the whole town 's comng here .
let them come .
we 'll fight them all .
somone 's bound to get hurt .
a fther , a brother .
i stand with adam .
th girls have gone .
they 've run away !
get them bck .
come back here !
they can hear s from here .
please , alice !
where are you ?
com back , martha .
i 'm not going back !
i want to stay here with you !
come on , ruth .
you 'll hit dorcas .
oh , no ...
not that !
why , p !
i heard a wee babe crying in th house .
whose is it ?
do n't be afraid to tell .

it 's actually about a young , nergtic , dynamic  even a sexy einstein 
what wold i see if i rode on a beam of light ?
perhps some sort of electrical force is emanatng outwards from the wire .
what ?
it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system ;
the people ...
lavoisier .
why ascribe to an object a vage and immeasurable force like vis viva ?
it is a return to th old ways !
are you capable of discovering something of your own ?
there is n right time for th truth .
frãlein meitner ?
yes ?
otto hahn .
the nucleus is our focus .
the jewess endangers our institute .
if she stys , the regime will shut us all down !
no , no , no .
energy equals mass times the square of the speed of light !
and the u.s. department of energy , fostering science and security .
and the univrsities research ssciation .
major funding for nova is also provided by the corporation for public broadcasting , and by pbs viewers like you ..
thank you .
its author was a youthful albert einstein .
it 's the most famous equation in the world :
ll aboard !
but whle we 've all heard of einstein 's big idea , very few of s know what it means 
we 've only got sausage and cheese tonight 
sorry , no .
but first ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughing at einstein .
he 'd united in one stunnng insight the work of many who had come before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't thnk in terms of energy ;
ne lwly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature would begin to change all that .
young michael faraday hated his job .
he was neducated , the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd ben lcky to become a bookbinder 's apprentice .
but faraday craved one thing 
all of his free time and his meager wages were poured into hs slf-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of curse  of curse ..
pass , pass .
ths way to a better life .
n the early 1800s , science was the pursuit of gentlemen  something faraday was clearly not .
he had a rudimentary education , he d read widely , he 'd gone to public lectures , but in 1812 h was given tickets to har sir humphry davy , the most prominent chemist f the ge .
ninetenth-centry scientists were th pop stars of their day 
their lectures were hugely popular 
tickets were hard to come by , and davy reveled in his status .
thy 're wating 
metals ... unknown , that is , until  isolated potassium from molten potash and sodium , as i showed you last time , from common salt .
help me be part of the great circl tht s your work and love .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trade , which i find vicious and selfish , and to become a servant of scince , which , i imagn , makes its prsuers miable and liberal .
really ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of  few years to set you right on that score .
look , i have n't anything at the moment .
faraday was determined to break free from his daily toil .
nwman ... meet mr michel faraday .
perhaps with god and faraday in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe in our place of work .
just stick to your job and do as yu 're told and you 'll be fine , faraday .
faraday bcame the laboratory ssistnt , eagerly absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big xcitement of the day was elctricity .
another charge , newman .
but no one really understood what this strange frce of electricity was .
th academic estblishment at the time thought that electricity was , you know , lik a fluid flowng through a pipe , pushng its way along .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showd that when you pss an electric current through a wire and place a compss near it , it deflected the needle at right angles .
faraday , come look at this .
perhaps you can work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing finding .
now , tht is remarkble .
but if the electrical force is flwing through the wire , why does th needle not move in the same direction  parallel to the wire ?
again  newman .
wht ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanatng otwards from the wire .
oh  my dear boy , let me tell you that at the university of cambrdge , electricity flows through a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridge , but it does n't explain wht 's happening before our eyes .
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fascinaton inspired by his religion .
for him , the problem was a way to understand god 's hidden mysteries .
there is a small , almost persecuted group in london called the sandemanians .
they were a religious ...
faraday was a member of that group .
tht if you opned up one littl part of it , you could see how everything was connected .
faraday was different from anybody else .
by methodically placing a compss all round an electrified wire ,
faraday started to notice a pattern 
and then he imagnd that a magnet had similar lines emerging from it and that those lines would get caught up in this flow .
i m shaking , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking 
yes .
this is the experiment of the century .
scale up th mgnts and the wires , make them really big , attach heavy weights to them and they 'll be dragged along .
although he did n't realize it at the tim ,
the chemicals in the battery had ben transformed nto lectricity in the wire , which had combined with the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these varios forces there was a common energy .
so , farady , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 's written to me and ssures me tht he 's taken no offense , and he acknowledges that what i published was entirely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected a member of the socity .
and what d you think ?
faraday , my dear boy , you have my vte .
it 's the science that counts .
so , tell me , how does this wir of yours spn round its magnet ?
ther seems to be an elctromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i se a swirling array of lines of frce spinning out of the electrifed wire like a spiraling web .
but invisible lines of force ...
it s all a bit vague , is n't t ?
faraday , might i hav a word in private ?
listen , faraday , let 's stop this nonsens .
i wnt you to take down your ballt paper from the notice board .
sir humphry , i see no reason to take t down .
it is they wh put the paper up .
i will not take it down 
my father and uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing elctric light to the streets of germany .
from an early age , i loved to look at machines , understand how things work .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle when my father shwed me a compass .
there had to be something behind objects that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
n your feet !
it 's pretty much the sme to me whichever way they run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachers trid to drum into him , as faraday had shown , that enrgy could be converted from one form into another .
they also believd that all forms of energy had already been discvered .
einstein was going to prove them wrong .
deep in th heart of matter .
 hundred years before einstein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the frnch revolution was just arond the corner .
and they felt that one of the first tasks that lay ahad of them was to rationalize and to clssify evry single kind f mtter so thy could see how it all interacted together .
ntoine lavoisier  a wealthy  aristocratic young man  decided to take up this task , t se if there was some basic connection between all th stuff of everyday lfe :
ll the different sbstances in the wrld .
his metculous , ven obsessve attention to detail ..
was also to be his downfall .
your precise observations commend you as a lady of scientific criosity ,
most unusual .
for the last five weeks , i have taken nothing but milk .
i would rather die than fast on mlk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the greatest of respect to a member of the royal academy of scences , your gut must think your throt has been slit !
how dare you insult the cont ?
do n't forget what the count offers ... not just marriage , but think of how you will be intrdced t all the salons .
you will be the toast of paris 
do you really plan to marry d'amerval ?
then i must contrive to save you .
lvoiser was n't a scintist by profession .
he was the had of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes n the simple thngs in life ...
did not endear hm to the average parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidios young man dd still allw himslf the occasinal act of passion .
in 1771 , lavisier married marie ann pulze  the daughter of his colleague n the tax office .
thus he saved her , as he hd promised , frm an arranged marriag to a count 40 years her elder .
allow me to show you something .
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or iron and leave it outside in the rain for months n end ,
madame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metals ..
is this a verbal xamination prior to an examination proper , sir 
i merely seek the truth .
but let m press you further .
hmm ?
every last citizen in frnce of sensible age knows that when a metal rusts , it wstes away , it gets lighter and eventually disappears .
ah , but ...
i hav not finished 
contain yourslf , sir .
there is mre .
in a recently published pamphlt by a brilliant young chemist ,
antine lavoisier demonstrates that the iron combins with the ir .
it , in fact  becmes heavier .
she learned english so that she culd translate contemporary scientific works .
monsieur , that s a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheeky man 
messieurs ... it is my great ambition to demonstrte that nature is  closed system , that in any transformaton , no amount f matter , no mass is ever lost and none is gained .
over here , please .
from this end we col the steam but , interestingly , we collect less water than w started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of water .
now , when we combine these two increases ...
the new weight f the iron barrel and the gas we have collected ..
they re exactly equal t the weight of the lst water .
so what he had done is get the oxygen to stick to the inside of a red-hot irn rifle barrel .
now , that left the hydrogen , what he clled combustible air , and that was just floatng around as a gas .
in the next few months i hope to demonstrate that i can recombine this combustible air with vital air nd transform them both back into water .
i will recreate exactly the sam amount of water that was lost here in this process .
it is my hope to complete the cycle ...
but to prove this , he had to perform thousnds of experiments , and he had to do the measurements with incredible accuracy .
that 's where hs great wealth from being a tax collector came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the academy asked you to assess his designs .
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to peddle .
monsieur .
i have invented a device which projects an image of th substance of fir onto a screen .
my devce renders the substance of fire visibl .
have you collected it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to cnjecture , monsieur .
no , no .
if you will you excuse me 
i am extremly busy today .
thank you .
so that is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not confrm to the version of the truth as laid down by the academy .
lavoiser .
he talks about facts , he worships the truth .
listn to me , my friend .
they are all the same , the royal cademies ...
they insult the liberty of the mind .
they think they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they re rotten to th core ...
do n't wrry 
n my next pamphlet i will expose this persecutor of yours .
the crowning glory of this opus ws their remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water .
to the french revolutionaries of 1790 ,
he was denounced by a failed scentist turned radicl journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubbl , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a century later , all of nature had been classified into two grat domains 
there was energy ... the forces that animated objects ;
and there was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these tw mighty pillars .
the laws that governed one dd not apply to the other .
but young , newly enrolled physics student albert einstein did n't lke laws .
extremely well , herr einstein 
all the better for seeing you have escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that 's about ll you ever do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein mric .
would you care to take a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd lke me to tell yu what you have missed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just incredible determination .
we know from his letters that einstein , even from the ge of 16 , was literally obsessed with the nature of light 
everyone he cold speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on this beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us jst magine w two are young ...
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to understand .
what would we see  do yu think ..
with light he would reinvent the nverse nd find a hidden pathway that would unite energy and mass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long before the 19th century , scientists had computed the speed of light , but no one knew what light actually was .
invisible lines that can emante frm electricity in a wir , from a magnet or .. even from the sun .
for it is my contention that light itself is just one form f these vibrating lines of electromagnetism .
maxwell and the aging faraday became close friends .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
h ,  'm fne .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that magnetic charge moves , it creates a little pice of electricity .
electricity .
electricity and magnetism are intrwoven , like a ... a never-ending brid .
so it is always pulsing forward .
michael .
670 million miles per hour .
that is the sped of light !
well , that means you wre right all along .
maxwell had provn faraday right .
we have lecturs in half an hour .
w ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwell and think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they said you could nver catch up to a beam of light .
even if yo were traveling at 670 mllion miles an hour , you would still see light squiggle awy from you at 670 millin miles an hour .
yes .
yo see how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wve are traveling at the same speed .
but relative to hr , it just sits there .
so is light like that ?
common sense would say that f you caught up to a light beam , there wold be a wav of light just sitting there .
maybe it would be shimmering , a bit of electricity and  bit of magnetism .
so if she was travelng alongside the light wave , it would n't be moving .
it would be static .
but mxwell says yo ca n't have sttic light .
maybe maxwell is wrong .
the light travels from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
that does n't make sense .
einstein was about to entr a surreal univrse where enrgy , mass and the speed of light intermingled in a way no one had ver suspected .
long before the french revolution , scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtelet 's transltion is still the standard text in france today .
muse , my memory causes ...
for what offenc the queen of heaven began
to persecute so brave , so just a man !
only the other night ,
 fear , however , that my wit is only a curiosity to others .
if only my mnd were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and the world will fall at yor feet .
no ...
in one sense , she s a woman utterly out of her true time and plce .
du châtelet married a general in the french army at age 19 and hd three children .
she rn a busy household , all the while prsuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advancd mthematics .
she enthusistically took lessons frm ne of the greatest mathematicans of the day ,
he was an expert on newton , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they had a brief affair .
a fierce critic of the king and th catholic church ,
voltare had been in prison twice and exiled to england , where he becme enthralled by the ides of newton .
du châtelet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher t plead voltaire 's case to keep voltire out of jail .
and it is also true that émilie du châtelet did have several affars of a fleetng nture .
bravo !
she created an institution to rival that f france 's ryal academies of sciences .
ah , monsieur ...
you are young .
i hope that soon you will judg m for my own merits , r lack of them , but do not look upon me as an ppendag to this great general or tht renowned scholar .
i am in my own right a whle person  responsible to myself alone for all tht i am , all that i say ... all that i do .
du châtelet learned from the brillint men around her , but she quickly devloped idas of hr own .
much to the horror of her mentors , she even dared to suspect that there was a flaw in the great sir isaac nwton 's thinking .
newton stated that the energy of an object , the force with which it collided with another object  could very simply be accounted for by its mass times its velocity .
he proposed that movng objects had a kind of inner sprit .
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four slabs along one edge and four along the other .
well , eight sqared is 64 .
this huge multipliction , this bulding up by squares , is something you find in nature all the time .
it is a return to the old ways !
it is the occult !
so ll leibniz is asking is , where does all ths force come from ?
you 're nfuriating !
criticize this , denonc that .
i discoverd you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been dropping lead balls into  pan of clay .
so , messieurs , car for a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will travel not two , but four times as fr .
messieurs ,
i feel mr. newton 's reputation dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , mupertuis !
wll ... the ball travls fo times furthr .
it 's the best way to express the energy of a moving bject .
if you drive a car at 20 mles an hour , t taks a certain distance to stop if you slam on th brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do be careful , madam .
do you think the cademy is ready for such an opinion ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a gret man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor s it your hsband 's .
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du châtelet knew that in the 18th century for a womn to become pregnant at the age of 43 was really very dangerous , and all the while she was pregnant she hd terrble premonitons about what was ging to happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a yong soldier that led to hr demise .
six days after giving birth to her fourth child , she suffered an embolism and died .
instein pursud light right thrugh univrsity and byond .
unfortuntely , he 'd upset so many professors tht no one would write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the young family struggled .
but  listen ..
about your promotion .
i 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
thre really is  very charming , but kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in around him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't bother him .
i 'll tell you what is truly mysterious :
the mathematics are fine , if a little unconventional , but this only works for big systems .
i disagree .
here we go ...
what wold happen if one applied those formulae to electromagnetic radiatin ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bit of physics and apply it without proper regard to a completely different area .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linkages , the big theories , but would n't things be better all round if you just got going in sme small rea ?
spoken like a true burgeois .
they had cornered th queston of light from every pssible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it would tke light to reach them from clocks at different distances ,
thank you .
what einstein did was completely turn the problem on its had .
that light wuld always mov away from you at 670 million miles an hour , even if you , too , were traveling really fast .
his extraordinary insight is that tim ... as you approach the speed of light , time tself will slow down .
it 's a monumental shift in how we see the world .
you see , before then people had assumed that time was like a wristwatch on god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throughout the nvrs , no matter were you were .
that the tick , tick , tick of this wristwatch was ctully the click , click , click
of electricity turning into magnetism turning into electricity .
it starts with his pblication of a paper on how to work out the true size of toms .
two months later is the publication of his paper on the natre of light ...
that 's what will earn him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sets out his theory of light , time and space .
it was the theory f special relativity .
in einstein s new world , the ne true constant was not time or even space , but light .
in one last great 1905 paper , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewher .
from our point of view , the train actually gts heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even instin is amazed by it .
i think i have fond a connection between energy and mass .
if i am right , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth grat 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he smply stated tht nergy and mass were connected by the square of the sped of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year jorny into light .
there is a deep unity between energy  matter nd light .
you multiply tht by tself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science ends in silence 
the articles are published to resounding .
i think the gods are laughing at me .
for four years einstin swerd each inquiry dutifully , trying to explain hs difficult , complex ideas to a confused physics communty 
here are these universe-chnging papers circling round , and the world is ... struggling to come to terms with them .
luckily it happened to be the most important living physicist .
he has sent his assistant .
after four years of waiting , he is appointed professor of physics at zrich university .
from there his creer is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and marred his cousin .
his fame led to numerous affairs .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vast reserves of energy locked deep inside the atom .
but he had nt banked on the second world war and the genius of a jwish woman in hitler 's grmany .
28-yar-old austran lise meitner was painfully shy .
despte her anxiety , the young doctor of physics arrived in berlin determined to purse a career in the xciting new field of radioactivity .
german universites did not employ female graduates .
otto hahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i thnk i could really help with the physical analysis .
yes , yes ..
and the mthematics .
studying radioactive atoms has become so mch a collboratin between emistry and physics these days .
yes , yes .
 ll ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
at this time , not a lot was known about the atm .
bt then ... in what are called radioactive metals , things like radium and uranium ...
the nucleus itslf seemed to be nstable , leakng out energy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus turnng nto energy .
he was given a lboratory .
she was forced to wrk in a wood shop .
i see you have n't set your hair on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
good day .
yes , where wold we chemists be without the steadying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
yes , well , i have , um ... asked her to marry me , and she has accpted .
h ...
oh , dr. hahn  congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for you .
very pleased .
lise meitner was warm-hearted by nature .
she had many friends and she my hav wanted to have a closer reltionship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear research .
meitner and hahn wre leading the race t see if ven bigger nuclei could be created by adding more nutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty familiar :
the nucleus , made up of protons .. and nutrons .
nw , the largst nucleus that w know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers our institut .
he was hounded out of germany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
what is it ?
what s happened ?
i , um ...
we 're speaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn , who was known for his anti-nazi views , did his best to protect her , at least initially 
not now , i m too busy .
we hav to protect her .
what can we d ?
and she may soon be forbidden to leave grmany .
lise ..
horlein demands that you leave .
you ca n't throw hr out .
horlein says you should not come into the institute anymore .
well , i have to write up the thorium irrdiation tomorrow , so i have t come in .
you 'v given up 
when it became clear that meitner would b dismissed and probably arrested , physicists all around europe wrote letters inviting her to conferences , giving her an excus to leave germany .
in july f 1938 , a dutch colleague trveld to berlin and illegally took lse back with him on a train to holland .
she had lost everything ...
her home , her positin , her books  her salary , her pensin , even her native language .
she had been cut off from her work just at the time when sh was leading the field and was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
no matter what privations she suffered ,
aunt ?
lis , how re you , my dar ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getting strange results .
he found no evidenc to suggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons hd causd it to increse in size .
from afar , she was starting t suspect that something very different was happening in their experiment .
hahn and strassman are getting some strnge results wth the uranum work .
really ?
a couple of months ago , hhn told me that they were finding radium amongst the uranium products .
and now he writes to me and tells me that t 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that 's vn smaller .
it is at least possble that barium is being produced .
so hahn still needs you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , can i ?
he has n't done what you told him to .
it turns out tht a big nucles like uranium is just like that .
now for four years , meitner and hahn and all other physicists had thought that if you pump more nutrons into this ncleus , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
realized this nucleus might just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so bg that t hs trouble staying together , then could n't just a little , tiny jog from a nutron ...
how much energy ?
but somethng has to supply that energy .
instein 's e  m.c2 .
200 million elctron volts 
no , no  no ... you 've split the atom .
of course , in the labortory we re talking about tiny amounts of uranium and correspondingly tiny amounts of energy .
but the pont is that the amount of energy released ws relatively large and that came from the mass of the uranium itself .
meitner and frisch published the discovery f what they calld nuclear fission
to great acclaim .
but betrayal awaited them .
hahn maintained it was he and not meitner who had discovered nuclear fission .
shall my scintific past als be takn from me ?
and why is it happning ?
she 'd only brken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enough .
n 1942 , an intense effort to build an atom bomb was begn .
all over amrica , secret installations sprang up under the code name the manhattan project .
she refused to have anything to d with the atomic bmb .
but robert frsch was different .
vast amounts of energy , in the form of electromagnetic radiation , were released from a few pounds of uranium nd plutonum .
today , yong physicsts carry on instein 's quest .
ever sinc its birth 
e = m.c2 has been used to delve into the depths f time , to answer the biggst question of all ...
in the first mments of creatin , the universe was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy  or e ,
it became th particles and atoms and it eventually formed the first stars 
it comes out as energy .
the whole process actually cretes life itself .
eventually , a massive star dies , the debris floats round , clusters tgethr , gets pulled into the orbits f anothr star nd becomes a planet .
building on the work of scientists through the ages , new generations are searching for answs .
as einstein himself knw , the journey of dscovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyful 
it is as old s human curiosity itself and never , ever ends .

i 'd have caght one and got 000 yen as my reward by now .
thank you vry much .
yes .
it s boiling .
tht felt good !
does it say that there are kappas here ?
nah .
that 's a god river .

i drank water bcause f that !
coo 's swimming is super awesome !
any kappa can swm like that .
kappas are amazing !
re they ?
it 's a river where you 'd expect kppas to be around ... so let 's visit them tomorrw .
okay ...
this is a magri-ya .
fund in heavy snow filled areas in northern japan .
it 's impressive ...
the kids from tokyo sure are different .
seriously !
it 's really a countryside .
they 'll bring fortune .
do you know what a zashiki-warashi is ?
i do n't want yu to be scared of it .
so wht 's bent about this magari-ya ?
on yur own ?
kids from tokyo are so independent !
and he eats well too .
he does .
a kappa ?
yu must be the zashikiwarashi-sama .
that 's right .
but i c n't find them .
i hav n't seen any kappas n the last hundred years .
r have they all died ?
the wind blew .
go to sleep .
~ and it alwys will ; tomorrw will always com .
yeah ?
but you do n't know if what the zashiki-warashi said is true or not .
i know .
let 's go home .
we 're getting the bullet-train that departs in the afternoon .
we ca n't go bck till then .
has coo ever left the place h was born in ?
this is the first time .
kamaishi staton
wait and see .
do n't throw me like that !
sea ?
water !
quick !
what salty water !
 doubt there are any fish in such salty water .
they must b really salty fish !
lt 's look for kappas elsewhere .
sure .
east kurume station
i 'd like to hear your story about your kappa 
jst for a bit !
take a photo !
 did n't do anything !
coo ?
those weekly pctorial magzine peopl came during lunch .
they were probably waiting .

wha—
i 'll teach you properly abut them next tim .
coo 's really amazing !
apparently coo can swim by farting .
coo 's abut to ppear in a magazine .
just think about what we 're going t do now !
that s right !
i have a souvenir for hitomi 
is n't it ?
it 's an apology for eatng your mai-mai the other day .
it 's beatifl ... what about a thnks ?
s n't it 
he 's beginning to take huh 
alright then !
that 's all .
humans do scary stuff sometmes ...
middle magazine : footage of an actual kappa !
plese !
ehara-san !
h looks old in that .
his hir 's strange too .
not agan .
yes ?
yes 
i 'm sorry but we do n't want intrviews .
thnk you for visiting .
 'm sorry but ...
about what ?
come on .
keep it strong !
that is ... and we 'd like to decline ll interviews 
is t true that kappa has a psychic power to break cameras ?
t 's probably false information .
but afterwards our cameraman had a fevr .
excuse me .
hld on a scond !
they 're scary ... this matter 's becme huge .
it 'd be really cool if you did have some supernatural power !
what ar you going to do about wrk today ?
the camera used to photograph the kappa was destroyed by some kind of power .
w are n't .
dmn it !
that 's the hose !
i really have to go ...
mom and dad got to g on tv .
it 's not as if i went on tv because i wanted to .
it 's my fault !
it 's my fault that yukari grew old !
i 'm still young 
so rude !
we do n't even know if it 's really right ?
how are we supposed to believe it ?
but can i make a short film of you using our own video camera ?
i ca n't troubl you all anymore .
thank you !
kappa
filmed by
direct investigatin !
can you lower your head ?
can yo show your back ?
is it ?
but also famous for his research in kappas
it 's real .
but they 're ignoring it ?
be careful .
there he is !
excuse me !
let me through !
this is the plan for a drama series !
coochan !
coo-chan !
plese do n't shout !

welcome 
we 'd like to take a closer look at the mysteries surrounding kappas .
shimizu-san is someone who has lng believed in the existence f kappas and researched ... what 's wrong ?
co-chan .
sure .
what could that b ?
i just could n't think of kappas as just being imaginary mnstrs .
would you be able to show it t us ?
i wnt t see it .
that arm ...
because i can !
but ...
what to do ?
your ancestor killed my daddy !
my dddy was n't a mischievous kappa !
he was an expert kind and ...
an admirable kappa !
yor ancestor suddenly drew out his sword and killed daddy !
the daddy who i really loved !
co ...
coo-chan has the ability to see the past ?
do n't cry .
what 's going on in the studio ?
what 's happning ?
the commercials started .
calm down ...
damn it !
d n't be scared ...
we wo n't do anything ...
get on !
wait !

a kappa and  dog ?
okay !
wht is this place 
an arm ?
wait up !

coo-chan !
that kappa !
is ossan ded ?
why ... over there !
where ?
coo !
there 're stairs inside .
let 's get closer .
yu cn use the gateways in between .
which way ?
they were all killed by humans ...
it 's completely dry ...
daddy !

he did what we could n't do .
the kappa 's a dangerous monster !

but the demands for a proper nvstigation into the powers that co-chan holds has become stronger .
like this ?
i see .

this is perfect .
it 's nothing .
hitomi !
yes .
wht 're you two doing ?
brothr s the only one who 's being left out !
kouichi ?

yay !
it 's not being decided yet .
we are 
right now everyone they 'll get used to him .
and then you 'll be able to live like you used to .
why do n't you ask coo-chan ?
i dd ask if he that his dad did .
coo-chan and his father ...

on the other hand , we have a hero here .
it 's a guy thing .
is n't it nice that stuart has  friend ?
i d n't think stuart thinks of her as  friend 
i mean he 's smitten .
he 's infatuated .
he 's bedazzled .
frederick , did you hav mny crushes ?
i 'm still having one .

and cold .
but it 's mum 's ring .
now , if it gets too cold , or to scary you just tell s .

i can handle it 
will do .
there 's a lot of slimy stuff all over the walls .
what does it look like ?
can you see the bottom yet ?
is that a new top ?
yo know , you have such tast .
simple elegance is what  call it .
well , now , do n't get excited , bt someone that you and i love has volunteered to go down the drain t get your ring .
start ?
good guess , mum .
you let our son go down the kitchen drain ?
now , elanor , do n't be upset .
t 's been well thought out .
now you can be upset .
are you okay ?
can y hear me ?
i 'm slipping .
there is no more .
what else can w use ?
spaghetti ?
that 's too short .
w can tie it together with ...
hurry !
margalo , what re you doing ?
stuart , i 'm coming !
grab on !
are you all right ?
margalo , you 're the best friend i ever had 
i wuld not have let that happen .
you let him go down the drain .
irrational ?
what were you going to say ?
i know i 'm overprotective , it 's jst i ca n't stnd the idea of stuart getting hurt .
i 'm sorry , sturt .
you fnd the ring ?
everything but .
i ca n't find her anywhere .
maybe she jst went for a walk or  little flight around the neighbourhood .
but why 'd she leave me her pin ?
without even saying goodbye ?
yeah 
i 'm going to fnd her .
and do n't try t talk me out f it .
i 've mad up my mind .

you do n't have any ida how big .
i 've only been out here for a short time .
but i 'm putting together an organization bigger than anything the west has seen :
land , minng , cattle , freighting , speculation .
that does sound big .
and it sounds like it ll take a lot of doing .
you 'll find i 'm pretty well-connected here .
i can show you a shortcut to the whole proposition .
he got here first .
the pecs river runs through the middle of his land .
so 
that 's a chessboard .
and if another man makes th right moves ... there might just be a nw king of the pecos .
sheriff brady , jess evans , this is alex mcsween .
howdy .

'blessed are the poor n spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .

'blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness ..
'blessed are the pure n heart  for they shll see god .
'blessed are th pacemkers , for they shall be calld the children f the lord .
'blessed are the persecuted for righteousness ' sake ..
'for yur reward in heaven is great  '

vlverde , i think .
i 'm issuing warrants for th arrests of both of those men .
john , i 'm empowering you and your men to bring back those two ...
what re thir names ?
deputies morton nd baker ... dead or alive .
i m afraid of what he might do .
whatever he does , it 'll be legal .
jess evans rode up right after the shoting .
it 's hrd to believe about henry tunstall .
yes  and it 's hrd to blieve he carred a gun .
resisted arrest .
tht 's to bad .
it 's just too bad .
would yo excuse us , jess ?
all right , lawrence .
howdy .
have n't seen two men that look like they 'd rode just as far ... a day or two ahead of us , have you ?
fed up their horses here yesterdy .
where d they go 
hold it up .
yu 're gon na shoot us , ai n't you ?
i thought about it .
saw him hang .

and that 's the word :
ghastly .
you two are gon na hang .
pat , take 'em on in to lincoln .
let 's go .
hello , pat , charlie , tom .
you should n't be up nd around , billy .

it 's all right , george .
now , what in heaven 's name happened ?
believe me , you 're in the firing line 
you btter do somethng ... befor president hayes decides you ca n't handle this territory .
what do you suggest that i do ?
first , justice wilson is chisum 's friend .
you 've got plenty of grounds .
what else ?
governr xtell has appointed a new sherff :
and i 'm adding a further reward ... of $ 1,000 , dead or alive .
have you got nything you want to add to that , sheriff ?
john , since governor axtell hung me out to dry .. there s nothing i can help you with .
i 'll head back to mesilla in the morning .
all right , j.b .
i 'm writing president hayes a letter asking for an impartial investigation ...
by that time , murphy 'll have his name on verything between arizona and texas .
mr. murphy ... just how much of lincoln county are you after 
you have anything to say to that , mr. chisum ?
you 're not just gettng started .
the line s ben drawn .
but if on of your men cross my land , or even touch one of my cows ... or do anything to that store ...
i 'm cming to see you .
mr chisum , that sounds like a threat .

and this is our national pastme , the game of baseball as played by the pittsbrgh pirates .
i did n't know a thing about basball 
the sports editor wanted the woman 's angl .
all i knew was that pittsburgh was losing .
he 's out !
maybe even angry .
wht 's the matter with you ?
he was safe by that much !
all right .
.. on ne base was too many .
you 're out !
great , that 's the first time you three guys hav been together all season .
the score at the end of the gam was cincinnati 21 pittsburgh 2 .
you through , jnny ?
you hit them on a bad dy 
yeah ?
yah , they had a good one back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should talk to mcgovern .
everybody should talk to mcgovern once .
how do i get down there ?
yo see that second tunnl there ?
yeah .
the door on the right is the pirate clubhouse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates ' exhbition this afternon reducing their standing to seventh place in the ntional leagu .
by the way , i 'll nt be with you for the balance of the seasn .
steps have been taken and briefly , your announcer has been canned .
i 'll still have my reglar tusday-night broadcast and wednesday television and i shall cntinue to call the plays as i see them .
this is fred bayles saying , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
no , no , lady .
press .
gangwy .
he 's unhappy .
i think it was a waste of time to send me .
i do n't know the game and  have n't ny story .
but  can tell you what 's wrng with the pirates that mcgovern person .
and all those nice , clean-cut young men and the way he bullies them .
no wnder they make mistakes , anybody wold .
if you ask me , the pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him .
hy  write it .
but he 'd se us .
do your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anybody die ut there ?
what a depressng job .
mr. kirney mst have liked the story .
by jennifer page , 'household hints ' editor 
every morning about 1 100 , he left for the feld .
this s the only hack in pittsburgh ?
you know the law , sonny 
you 're supposed to stay with your cab .
the bums do n't start until 130 .
his afternoons were spent like this .
the only plc he was seen in public , outside th ballpark was john 's steak house .
i 'm going over and talk to him .
oh , stop .
well , there he is , cornered .
waiter 
i 'm jennifer paige .
i wrote that story about you this morning , in the messenger .
well , i began ths way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evil-tongued oratr of the baseball field  is a surly , unbred goat whose mouth should be washed out with a strong detergent .
you 're not mad ?
i do househld hints on the ldies ' page .
but i have  few facts and fgres about your --
a fw statstics that might be interesting .
for instance , last seasn , minelli had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
 'll have to speak to minelli 
cruickshnk 's average is way down too , 93 points .
he 's the obtuary ditor .
what do you hear from want ads ?
well  i realize figures can be misleading but when an entire team goes as sour as the pirates well , i look round for a reason , and i lok right at you .
how are things in seventh place ?
catch me tonight , i 'm on in an hour .
i m gon na run yo out of this town , maybe right ut of organized baseball .
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in her a minute , huh ?
befor i say good night , i would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unbased observer who has the best interest of baseball at heart .
there is nothing personal in my feud with guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhbarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final scor :
the pirates had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you mde two of those errors all by yorself .
did you think that was second base ?
you 're gn na catch a fly ball some of these days and knock your front teeth .
you fllas may not believe this but saul once ptched a two-hitter in a world series .
but he 's still in there pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do n't you think you 're old for this pastime ?
we used to have a guy like that in the three-i league .
put gunpowder in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern alwys ben like this ?
sixteen years ago .
where 's my good-luck piece ?
well , where is it ?
of all the emptyheaded , buck-brained trainers 
close your fat mouth .
i wan na talk to you .
an angel 
how 's that ?
i 'll make him an angel .
where do you sit ?
sure , sure , gabriel .
trumpet player .
none of your lip , or i 'll boot you over the wall .
now you 're getting warm .
keep talking .
someone down ther has been sending up prayers n your behalf .
one punch !
before he answers those prayers he 'd like to clean yu up .
there 's certain rules .
i 'll give them to you fast .
quit making life miserable for everybody arund you .
why ca n't i se you for one mment ?
stay where you are .
stand still and listen or i ll blast you with a blt of lighting .
now , do n't rle me , boy .
just behave yourself and we 'll get along fine .
lay off swearing and fighting , and i 'll win you som ball gmes .
you 'd like to win a pennant again , would nt you ?
hw about that 
all right  aloysius , you trusting soul .
what kind of a miracle ?
wait a --
you 're out .
safe .
out .
i was bout to suggest that possibly y erred on that decision .
yes , sir .
on the rad , they won 10 games straight .
the team was sixth whn they playd the braves in bston .
a hard-fught game .
boys , boys , please , take it easy .
now , i ll handle this .
let me --
ten straight games , and you had to go and blow it .
now , look , i --
take off your hat .
i hard what yu sad .
do n't repeat it .
now , look  the guy called me an ape .
certainly .
 'll be tongue-tied .
shakespeare was n't 
okay .
i keep my trap shut , i win all my games ?
yes , it would 
but when you ned us , we 'll be in there pitching .
who 's we ?
me nd my boys  the heavenly choir nine .
in hevn ?
there 's plenty of ball players in heaven .
what do you know .
bt very few managers .
how do your boys help ?
wh 's on your squad , the heavenly choir ?
not bad .
we might have run into ach other .
on what base ?
cm on , a guy 's got a right to know his own angel .
your brokendown ball club s winning ball games .
i 'll see you around .
listen .
goodbye , and keep your nose out of things that do n't concern you .
all right , all right .
do n't go away sore , huh ?
sorry , mr. mcgovern .
sit down  son .
well , i told minelli i 'd hve dinner wth him .
i do n't know .
a left-hander 
i do n't know , just call it a hunch .
he 's reading shakespeare .
the tempest ,  had it in english iii .
he asked me to sit down with him .
yeah  this morning he said hello .
he has n't changed ..
waiter 
you do what i said ?
this s all right ?
thanks , but i 'd like to dgest my dinner .
you did all right in the old days .
remember how we used to tear around ?
i do n't wan na think about you .
do you mind ?
your steak all right , sir ?
stay in there and keep it high .
if he feeds it to modbury low , he 'll put t in our laps .
oh , dear .

yes ?
i 'd like to see a little girl .

would you wait just a moment  please ?
he 's looking for a little girl .
i think you should talk to some of the others too .
oh , mr. mcgovern .
well , how do you do ?
i came about the story in the paper .
yes , i read it .

just what i always neded , a girl with turned-up shoes , 110 .
yeh .
if i tok her to the ball game and w sat in the grandstand ot of the sun she would n't see any angels .
i 'd write the story just that way , and tht 'd be the end of it .
can i ?
all right , run long .
comb your hair , put on a ht .
bridget and i got pretty chummy during the game , exchanging girlish confidences .
vanilla okay ?
mac , i think that 's enugh 
oh , jenny , how about dinner after the game 
well , have fun .
that must be nice .
i mean , insted f having a lot of kids around all the time 
it depends .
i always sy , why nt live lone if you can live alne ?

ty cobb , one of basebll 's alltime greats .

wnder hw it happened .
angels .
right there .
me ?
sure , the pirates are playing as a team .
because yu 're not losing your temper , and ylling your hd off and swinging on people .
you shuld turn the othr cheek .
there 's two schools of thought on that .
my school recommends getting in the first punch 
well , what do yu know , a baseball .
jennifer sent it int the clubhouse and all the pirtes signed it .
see ?
ll xcept mr. hellman 
it 's just what i wanted 
what about grac ?

oh , well , i do n't have to tell you , but that 's all over , believe me .

why did i have to go and wave at you ?
where am  having dinner ?
yo 're nt going anyplac except home .
hi , guffy .
nice catch .
yu kay ?
i 've been hit in th head 20 times .
i feel fine .
you spak to angels ?
where they running ?
is n't it wonderful ?
his ltest peccadillo , an admission to the press that h cnverses with angels ... .
you could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he now commands .
i would lik to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us your name , pleas ?
i 'm a groundskeeper at braves field , up in boston .
will you please tll us what you saw in braves field bout sven weeks ago 
well , i see mr. mcgovern .
aftr the game .
stting on second base .
nd what was he doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
ther was n't anybody there .
and when he was sitting on second base tlking to somebody who was n't there , where was he looking ?
up .
but one thing he said was , i hve a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonabl man to hang around second base at night and talk t angels ?
much as i hesitate to say this i think that mr. mcgovern should take a lng , long perhaps permannt rest .
what 's ating you ?
so w won a ball game , so hooray .
i tell you , it 's mking me jumpy .
every time i go after a ball , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over somethng .
for two cents ,  'd quit right now .
shut up .
yo watch mcgovern looking over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trying to be a right guy .
your job is to got out and play ball .
keep yor mouth shut , understand ?
watch it  here he comes .
and here s a flsh that was just handed to me .
arnold p hapgood , cmmissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh tonight .
with the pennant hanging on tomorrow s game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgovern ar in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this fternoon .
with this hanging over thir heads , there 's no telling what they ll do .
it 's about my boys 
they 're getting nervous .
nt that i blame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apart tomorrow .
 would n't worry much about t .
it 's only natural at a time like this .
how are you doing 
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't slep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , that so 
you know , i used four this fternoon .
who do i start tmorrow 
yeah .
well , i would n't worry about it .
even i could n't make him look good .
thy wan na send him to the minors .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around next season .
yeah .
at least , we used to be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen , i have an appintment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear all the evidence , i have nothing to say .
... tomorrow for the pennant .
 'm aware of that .
think this is the proper time for the investigation ?
my dear lady , any time 's the proper time when the situation warrants it .
basball is fr the pople who support it 
from new york , sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to them ?
originally , man worshpped the sun , the moon , stones , trees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child will run to its parent s will a man turn for comfort to a belif in angels .
and when this belef takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professionl opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes 
ys , yes , of course .
dr. stac danforth , trinity church .
rbbi allen hahn , temple israel .
how do you do ?
father 'houlhan , church of our lady , queen of the angels .
gntlemen , just make yurselves comfortable .
mr. commissioner ?
well , what do you thnk ?
do you suppose there might be angels ?
right to left .
to deny the existence of angels is t deny the word of the holy bible which is specific on the subject .
from the ancient hbrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sons f god .
thank yu  rabbi .
it was an angel who guided the children f israel to the promised land .
the angel of the lord encampth round about them that fear him and delivereth them .
seeing s how thre are cveys of angels flitting through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how i can get out of saying i believe in them .
i imagine th commissioner does too .
oh , please , just leave me ut of this .
mr. commissioner ?
is it likely ne of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is it possible that ngels would ad and cmfort such a mn ?
thank you , gentlemen .
if dr. blan would care to see me in my offic , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
however --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?
mr mcgovern  what ar you fraid of ?
all right .
bridget white , 8 yars old .
st. gabriel 's hme for orphan girls .
does n't everyone ?
no .
they were helping the prates .
you 're quite sure about that ?
you would n't just make up a story , would you ?
oh , no .
certainly , certainly , certainly .
n .
because mr. mcgovern said so .
f course .
any angel would be proud to talk to a nice man like mr. mcgovern 
quit .
quiet , please 
what re you talking abot ?
i will decide wht is evidence here .
suppose i did ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nothing definte .
i do n't know if the court will let me have her .
it 's touching .
come on , stop that 
stop that .
ordr .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think , in view f th facts all things considered this case is dismissed .
hey , fellas , what s wth guffy ?
sure , sre .
he was okay all the tim .
he ai n't no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , yu heard what the fella said .
just stick to your driving , will you ?
i only hit hm once or twice .
because when you busted tht bridgework , you also busted our agreement 
from now on , you 're on your own .
it s no jk .
you c n't walk out on me nw .
i need you .
do n't worry , you ve been on your own a lot the last eight weeks .
i do n't like to be on my own .
you used to be .
you 'v lerned something , guffy .
we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , ca nt make it .
tell tht cab driver to slw dwn .
so long  guffy .
come back here a minute , will you ?
the boys in the press box are asking .
they wan na know who 's gon na pitch .
let 's do it , boy .
for nw york , barberry catching , toley pitching 
hellman ?
take care of the bullpen , will you , boy ?
yeah , sur .
and it 's over the left-field wall fr a home run .
safe .
there 's another hit .
see any angels yet ?
new york 1 , pittsburgh nothing .
come on , vnce boy , let 's go to work .
get a hit , boy .
you 're out .
all right , only one away .
lay nto it , tony boy .
lay into it .
knock it ut of the park .
mandekic pulls up safe at second .
two awy and rube ronson cming up .
all right , rube .
all rght , let 's get out .
let 's go .
here we are at the top of the ninth , the final frame with a score still pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
one away .
seems to be giving him some trouble .
either it 's pain or those giant averages 
and he takes his base .
hit by a pitched ball .
well , hellman seems to be losing control in ther .
leapng high in the air and spearing th ball .
h 'll never make it .
ball one .
take him out !
get him out of there !
th fans are yelling to take hellman out .
get him out of there !
get him out of there !
and those pirate fans are really mad now .
get him out of there 
take him out !
yank him !
wht do you think , saul 
i 'm tired , but i 'd sure lke to try .
it 's your ball game .
he 's leaving hellmn in .
coming up to the plate now is dobbie roscalla who leads the league in runs batted in 
f he bats one now , mr. mcgovern had better leve town 
strike !
oh , if he ever connectd with tht one ... .
he 's a very tired pitcher right now .

pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .

ninth-grade biolgy .
it definitely has its challenges .
i was , uh , talking to bob humphrey .
exactly .
he s now one of the hotshots on the web 
and music sites .
and ?
and they 'r loking for a head
hmm .
enough .
bobby 'll double it -- at least !
but no one with your skills or experience .
now wth this teaching thing on top of it ..
they even have an office n london .
right ...
it 's only the term progress report ,
not an actual report card .
yeah , but even he would n't kick her off
it 's always ben a pain !
what are we gon na do 
well , let 's jst talk to ms. bartlett .
chicas 
what 's going on , marisol ?
s !
you 're wrong !
ms. bartlett cres about us --
yeah , right .

marisol heard you confirm it .

and they asked me t start on monday .
i thought we mattrd to you .
after all our hard work !
i turned them down .
you really did ?
we 're a team .
ms. bartlett :
are you ready ?
wll , what if we considered this one , big extra-credit project ?
yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,
and i 'll check her calculations .
then yo can tlk to her math teacher ,
see if he 'll rise her grade t a d .
that could work .
but you have to get hr to tke it vry serously .
if yolanda does n't deliver an accurat tabulation ,
she 's off the danc team .
i like your optimism .
thanks .
boy :
enjoy .
hey !
yolanda !

and being your bst .
aiming to b the best is --
it 's fruitless .
it 's a matter of opinion .
you have done this 50 times in rehearsl .

and that 's more contagious
thn having a thousand trophies .

ribbit 
i think i have an idea where we can go .
buffrog !
star btterfly !
oh , queen moon .
greetings .
of course .
star , can i speak with yo ?
well , it seems we have n other choice .
uh , welcome to my ... home .
boop .
it 's rainy season .
ah , s good for th skin .
oh , uh , no shes in hose .
buffrog , wonderful home .
oh  thank you .
is a bit of a mess right now .
please take a seat 
oh 
i thought everyone knew that .
yo , buffrg , where them babies at ?
babies , say hello to queen buttrfly .
star , i have been so worried about you .
why ?
i 'm good .
well , whn ludo took your castle ,
toffee is dead .
toffee not dead .
toffee inside ludo .
papa !
we have to go save him .
he is your husband !
star  i 've made my decision 
w stay here .
excuse me .
yes .
thank yo .
i 'm sorry 
yah , w all are .
of course .
you have plan ?
i have plan .
okay .
distract me from what ?
bad choices in past .
uh , we could smash bugs .
great idea , buffrog .
your daughter is very strang .
w have many option of bord game .
mmm , interesting .
okay , the rules of puddle defender are , uh ...
um ... the rules are ...
yes ?
the evil bloodthirsty mewman , that 's you , must try and sneak past watchful mnster parent , that 's me .
that is horrible !
one , two , three , four , fiv  six , seven .
you are filthy mewmn .
for better eating of monster babies .
is this fun ?
did you hear something ?
i hear nothing .
can yu name a time when monsters have ever done such a thing ?
tht idea had to come from somewhere .
because it was in a children 's board game ?
i just think that monsters would hav less of a reputation if they did n't act so bloodthirsty all the time .
monsters only act that wy to protect their babies from mewmans .
you may not nderstand , but monstrs will do anythng for our children .
do n't talk to me about what i 'm willng to do .
to protect star from toffee !
but  have to keep my child safe at all costs !
you insult me , queen moon .
my buffbabis , they are my life .
 should have relized .
yu 're a parent , too .
 ca n't believe you 're taking her side .
kids .
what 's their plan , huh ?
just avoid your problms to death 
great plan .
it 's  terrible plan .
i 've got big plans .
but n , they stuck me in here .
i 'm thinking .
i have n't told my dad yet .
there 's something else i have n't told him .
all clear .
wow .
so what 's the big plan ?
the plan for beating toffee ?
i kind just go for it .
oh , my precious little ribbit babies .
do n't you worry .
i 'm very worried .
i ll see you after i destroy toffe .
this is my castle .
i do n't want to see a sngl butterfly face .
what am i looking at here ?
no butterflies .
get that out f here .
is that the last of it ?
and with that , everything in my kingdom is in order .
no , no , not again !
okay , a few kinks to work out , but overall , the ctizens of mewni love me .
those especially .
here , i 'll show yu .
greetings , young man .
no , my lord , they just do n't like you .
oh , hney , look at all tht great stuff .
wow , we should load up .
finally , someone with taste .
this will look great in our foyer .
it 's not for sale .
that 's it .

nobody likes you , dude .

the cre for cancer has been discvered .
the cure for virtually every form of chronic disease was discovered even earlier , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
although his discoveries were adhered to by hitler and the nazi party ,
dr gerson s family pad the ultimate price .
dr. gerson 's sevn siblings perished in the holocust .
dr gerson 's unprecedented gift of healing the hopeless lives on .
narratd by dr. a.f .
these scenes before your eyes would be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air moves north nd airborne transport f dioxins eventually reches the once pristine arctic 
arctic peoples are showing major health problems , from bioaccumulation of doxins .
and from there , the pisons travel up the food chain to polar bears , seals and whales , nd then to peple .
ne thousndth of one mllionth of a gram of dioxin can cause harm to the body .
trees , the very living organisms that clean the air and produce the oxygen we breathe  are sliced off at the ground with the most careless abandon if there is  limiteless supply .
at one point , t had been sid that a tree sqirrel could jump from tree to tree following the hardwood with coniferous forest belts from th east coast to the west cost .
they do nt develop special functions .
as  boy in germany , in the late 1800 s ,
day by day , he gained insight in the relationships betwen plants and the nutrients they gaind from the sil .
under a mcroscope , actively cells known as chloroplasts , busily undertke the process f manufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculous process of photosynthesis begins .
these live cells nd enzymes in vegetation are the nucleus of what we ned to ingest to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy one .
max gerson sfferd from sever and repated migrane headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days .
after three years of exprimenting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved  but a skin tuberculosis also disappeared .
446 of the 450 ptients rcovered .
dr gerson and his wfe gretchen had three daghters :
joanna , gertrude and the youngest , charlotte 
of all the children , charlotte took a special interest in her father 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame had spread throughout europe .
when dr. schweitzer was 75 yars old , he came to dr. grson with diabetes and was also curd .
lighting up the switchboards at abc non-stop .
out f control !
unbelievable !
and the ppper neely anticancer bill f 1946 , document no 
now marrd , she had a son , howard , and a daughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her father to publish his first bok in 1958 
at the time of his death  in 1959 ,
the files hve been preserved by his dughter charlotte who is now in her eighties .
charlotte carries on the work of her father through the establishment of the
we have some letters here from albert schweitzer .. and they had a very active correspondnce , my father , dr. gerson and albert schweitzer , and his family were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter , he expressed his admiration of the specific cancer reserch that dr. gersn dd .
of course , all the letters are n german and i 'm trying to translate some .
as well as the remarkable results that h saw , not only with cancer patints , but with hs wife , who had tuberculoss , and thir daughter , who had a very undecipherable skin disease .
laws in virtually all the united states prohibit any other treatment for cancer ther than radiation  chemotherapy and surgery .
on this particular dy , two medcal doctors from czechoslovakia , consult with anita wilson , who is executive director , about th possibilities of opening a hospital in czechoslovakia .
.. you boost the immune system , you rid the body of those years and yars of accumulated toxns frm the way we live ...
not a day goes by that we do n't hear something from a patient or a physicin , or a group of pople perhaps interested in starting a clinic or a support group .
in high schol i was in one of those dietrs anorexic and bulimic ... bulimia when it was n't really written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan 
i had a fight for that .
a year later , that same tumor , the ne that they thought could be a metastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 years old , my fac hit the windshield and i had ver 150 stitches in my fac .
fter being on the therapy for about a year  i noticed one day when i was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bone in the right side of my nose for the first time .
another staff member , susan brant  charlotte gerson 's niece , at one tme , was diagnosed with an inoperable crvical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 years ag  and so ,
i can sit here and say that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serm gram and the biopsy .
they dtrmined i had three sections of cancer , malignnt cancer in the prostate nd they wanted to take the prostate out the next day .
i talked with gerson institute and with the hospital in mexico , and talked with the doctors and the patients .
after three months , i found that i was loosing weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me was the end of th treatment 
i was cured , the doctor thoght i was great , he said i had  better psa than he dd .
i am not an easy one to get along with , because i 'm a maverick ...
a particular type jicing method must be utilized , however , implementing a grind and press device .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as fast as alcohol .
this juicer was orginally dsigned n the 1930 's by a scientific reserchr , named dr. normn walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be captured in a glass of juice in minutes and in a few mor minutes , be flwing within the veins of the patient .
as you can see , an entire day with the juices is equivalent to an enormous amount of food , which weghts in a lttle over 20 pounds a day .
but just eating dfferent is not enough to heal a seriously ill patient .
nutrition is only half of the equation .
resolving the accumulated toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentless .
realizing this , charlotte gerson included a chpter about it in a book about the gerson therapy , tht underlines , in layman 's terms , the principles of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily toxic ingstion or precursr hit be when you get in your automobile prior of even starting the engine , you have already ingested dioxins
) given off from the dashboard to th fancy ?
suppose you continue yur journey and stop at  motel for the evening .
once inside , from the power switch activating electromgnetic fields , t the microwave raditin leakng from the ovn , as it prepares your plastic wrapped , heavily salted and preserved nutritionless instant dinner , to the carcinogenic chemicals in the soap on the bathtub brim .
you are inundated with hits .
the soap and shampoo are just the start , however , of what will be absorbed through your skin once you turn on the bath tube faucet , which will provide chlorinated and fluoridated water to help you get clan .
chlorine and fluorine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toilet seat has been sanitized for your protection .
but what does that mean ?
the toilet paper wll also smear chemicals from solvents t dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroom sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply manufactured plastic cup , that allows serous toxns from the plastic itself into the water .
the artificial sgar and the artificial cream as a nice touch to the mix .
) that was the cell phone repeated , lengthy uses hav shown to interfere with and challenge the neurotransmtters of the brain .
as we finally turn off the light to sleep , electromagnetic fields from the clock next t your head will almost imperceptibly influence the slumber and dreams one hopes to have .
evn the film to make this movie uses extremely poisonous chmicals in its mnufacture and processing .
as rdiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one more hit for your body to fight .
the good news is that most of these toxins can be remved with strict dherence to the gerson thrapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the coffee comes into play .
unless it gets some help .
when cffee nemas are utilized in conjuction with juice drnking it is detoxification at its finest .
three tablespoons of dp grond coffee are drpped in there .
after a fw minutes the burner is turnd down .
once the coffee is done , it is strained into a measuring cup .
additional water may be added to make up for water lost in steam in making the coffee .
once the coffee cools to body temperature it is poured into the enem bucket .
that time , the plstic stopper at the end of the hose is slit back t release the air in th end of the tube .
simultaneously , the livr in turn excretes poisons into the colon for expulsion .
hundreds of holistic physcians  in the u.s. and around the world , have been trined by charlott in the gerson institute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united states to treat and cure  diseased patient in a hospital with gerson therapy .
bcase chrltte resides in southern california , it 's easy t her for drve regularly to advise and encourage the endless numbers of patents that arrive at the hospital in tijuana , mexico .
under the care of a staff of physicians and nutritionists , most patients who came in with inoperble cancers and with no hope f recovery , leave within 1 to 4 weeks to continue the treatment at home .
after only 2 weeks on the therapy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer now .
do you have children ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaska , where i am from and i was dignosed with a ..
you were diagnosed how , did you had a biopsy ?
he ordered the biopsy and the pathology came back with a carcinoma .
and you had ascites swelling ?
i had 10 pounds of ascites swelling in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy could also dry it p .
now several doctors have told me that 
how much ?
one course .
after i was finished with my chemo and it did n't work .
then you came here .
wow !
and then it 's been abot 2 cm a day .
ever since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typcal and normal one .
always seeking new ways to cheer up , empower and restore hop to the supposed hopeless ,
within th pages of each booklt are personal biographies and the mdical recrds of recoveries .
healing lung cancer respiratorydseases
my dad had told me about the gerson therapy .
my dddy told me about this  and during the research , i found out that the best way to cure yourself is to d it the healthy way .
not put more poisons into yor body that would kill you .
and tht what chmo did ... it kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
whn i go dwn to cla ,  too did all my blood work and my mris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i jst ca n't believe you 're one of my cancer patients.
that just really made me fel god every time i went in there .
i did not look lke a normal cancer patient .
to me , i have charlott and the gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heart , just do n't think i d be here .
when i was dignosed with cancer ,
i knew of three other ladis that had the same cancer i had .
i was 12 years old when my mom was dignosed with cancer .
she would wke me up like 2 in th morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'm steve  debbie 's husband .
when i first came into debbie 's life , it was several years ago , and when we first met , i was s touched ..
there is for charlotte th reluctance to gt emotionally attachd to any single case , since there have been thousands , but occasionally , a phone call would leave her effervescent with cheer 
s in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seen only n children .
it was discovered tht the lung was too ridden wth cancer .
and more horrifying still was the revelation that the cancer had made it all the way to the right chmber of her heart .
th surgeon than opened her sternum nd started with rmoving the tumors from her lungs 
from there , he moved to her heart and an open-heart srgery removed the tmor from the rght heart chmber .
again and agan , with a vengeance .
now , even her liver was nvaded by cancer .
) the doctor said , ( ?
) children told us that she is not gon na be able to ahm ... the cancer is back and she is not gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or something , we wre down , at the gerson , and ahm ... and we were doing the diet there for abot 2 or 3 weeks , i thnk .
) i had come down there sick myslf ... ?
i had regular disinfections all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and we 've ben doing the treatment for two years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and life began to change for the entire family .
even the dog was happy again .
but the pisons are now being excreted and her body is building itself back up with pwerful enzymes nd the nutrient forces .
but where stephanie 's orthodox mdical doctors had only given her 6 months to live two years ago , she has now astounded them , and of corse , confounded them .
i feel very healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
charlotte observed that they run around playing and enjoying life , as though the scourge of cancer had never visited this resilient child .
there ar also nontoxic , nonpharmaceutical supplements called biologicals , that are utilized in a greater or lesser measre , dpending upn the patient s condtion .
one of th most important of these is a natural potassium , mix of potassum gluconate , acetate , phosphate in equal amounts , that dr. gerson put together after doing nerly 300 experiments .
this is extremely beneficial to restoring the potassium in the bdy 's clls systems that was lost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sodium , such as found in table salt and hiddn withn everything , from processed foods to toothpast .
table salt is a poison .
the use of inrganic sodium causes displacement of potassium fund naturally in human cells , leaving thm vulnerable to attack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's potassium supplement is dissolved in a quartr of distiled water and incorporated in smll amounts to th jices 
it 's a pleasure to show you round .
the pressed and ground flax seds , essentially the leftovers , are used for frtilizer and animal food 
a true miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work tht max gerson did in the past , really understood the valu of flax oil .
that was nt anything that ...
actually , they educated us more than we cold even educate them on the valu and the benefits f how flax oil really helped the modalities .
the se of these natural  holistic supplements n the gerson therapy is part of customization to the specific degenerative conditons of the patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but they can sometimes fortify gerson 's therapies effectivenss .
when it comes to helping th body recover , whether from a common cold or cancer , today , over half the medical vsits in the u.s. and canada are to alternative therapies , despite the efficacy .
and in the u.s. especially , it is estimated that our understanding and acceptance of holistic medicine is still 75 years behind the rest of the world .
medically , w trail many third world countries .
it is imperative that patients have access to such food choices .
the organic fod market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , minly as the rsult of the economic law of supply and demand .
mass-producd commercially grown fruts and vegetables produced with chemicals and sprays are fertilized with only three minerals :
but the plant , like the human body , really needs over 50 mre .
as a consequnce of this tiny mineral contribtion in the frtilization process of commercally gwn crops , the plants were sick and must be kept on lfe support with more toxic chemicals until market .
this process is now repeated in the consumer , in simplified terms .
i know that in the past people had different prospectives of wht was truly rganic , and we would have some growers come in and say well , their grows ar organic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules and regultions such that anybody wh did want to become organic would truly be in the same playing field and would have to abide by the sme sets of ruls .
we have found that the attrbutes of truly dong a certified organic is bneficil not only for the people , bt also for the ground , etc .
so , that 's somethng that we truly look forward to expand upon and to provide for the local community , and also for the people throughout the united states and world wide .
by popular demand , undoubtedly based largly on the discovery of the incomparable better flavor f fresh organic produce , organic farmrs frquently start popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their produce fr their neighbors benefit , before shipping their product t an ever ncreasing world market .
charlotte gerson follows the gerson therapy herself as a life style of prevention .
she as no one as millons of others have discvered that the principles of the gerson thrapy raise the bar fr gettng the most of life .
now , in her eighties ,
using the gerson therapy , one need never again worry by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesity is almost always nothing but hunger .
and people are very hungry because , ven though they are full , they are not truly nourished .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , where the dead fod les in state .
for many , it als grants them a higher vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life .
day-to-day lfe expriences are fraught with perplexities tht can be addressed to a negative or a positive way .
for example , cocaine and heroine addicts destroy their cravings for drugs in usually less than 72 hours on the therapy .
the only bstacl that arrests or commencs to subtract those books is long term lack of nutrients and environmental toxcity .
whn the brain detoxifies , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional fog lift .
the body is a miraculous in its design and flexibility .
these chmicals are found in virtually all municpal drnking water and inflicts severe damage in the body 's endocrine system , particularly the thyroid gland .
but there are other semi hidden dangers in ngestion of daily poisons that can be avoided .
well , the dentl amalgam is now coming more and more into the floor , even while dentists used to dispute it .
but in your mouth t 's saf ?
and it 's been clearly demonstrated that lot of childrn have seizures and all kinds of mental disturbances from the dental amalgam .
the danger of the llegal stret drugs n public and private schools is heavily publicized .
the trouble with ritlin is sometimes ... first of all , it 's never been tested on children under 6 .
and they 're giving it now to children in preschool and kindergarden .
and the americn servics like the army , navy and the air force , will not accept any person into the servce who is ever been on ritalin , becaus they 're uncontrollable .
during sleep , nt only is the nervous systm replenished like a storage battery beng chargd , but the body rids itself of poisons , in a way that only sleep can accomplish .
and with the bombardment in daily lfe of hits to ther systems in modern society , repeated lck of t can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain development 
the developing brain of a child at this tim in human history , must clear a number of hurdles in a bid for genetc normalcy .
on of the more publicized vulnerabilities is exposure to lead , especially led from older homes , where leaded pint was used pirated in the 1970 's .
remodelng and sandng of older hmes prduces a tcking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
these airborne hevy metals , along with numeros other chemicals in the food and water , are now nintentionally pssed on to the next generation .
bt th removal , known as chelation , of such toxins , even hevy metals , such as lead , is pssible with close adherence to the gerson therapy .
evn the body itself can verproduc a substance that becomes poison in xcess , in stressful situations , if the liver is unhealthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called adrenalne .
in an occupation that demands split second life or death decisions , the drnaline flows in excess , and if not neutralized , can poison the body into illness 
the potency of this substance is profound .
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands , which are locatd on little caps on top of each kidney , it enters the bloodstream and is dilted instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the purpose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fght response and protect neself in threatning situations .
th largest gland of the body , the liver , when healthy , s able to neutralize the secretions .
many peple have liver disease and do nt even know it .
fr the detection of a liver problm vi illness requirs the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity before symptoms become detectabl .
like many others who do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in the wildlife center , thir health and reproduct ability must be maintained at highest levels .
eventally , they were unable to reproduce sccessfully .
clearly , all carnivore animals such as these were designed to hunt and kill nd survive on prey composed of flesh 
their teeth , stomach acids and short digestive tract bear this out 
but the dissimilarities between wild meat aters and humans do not end there .
invarably , some of them does n't pss through at all , but instead get snagged inside tiny pockets in the colon putrfying not for hours , but days , months and even years .
the pancreas was nver designed to break down animl protein or meat .
when meat must be digested , the pancreas is diverted from its important protective purpose .
if we only eliminated the animl products from our diet , the odds of getting cancer , diabetes or hert disease and the pandora 's box of woes that go alng with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american diet , referred to as sad fr short , has totally flipped that scientifically verifiable statistic upside dwn .
looking under a microscope , t is easy to see red blood cells floating around free .
surprisingly , some foods , like legumes , soybeans and soy prodcts are either deficient in nutrients , or cause health degeneration , by blocking bsorptin of nutrients .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespread .
it 's causd by milk drinking .
and the doctors give it for supposedly curing osteopoross , because spposedly milk has calcium .
th body has to maintain homstasis , it has to maintain a very exact level of alkalinity versus acidity .
where is it going to take calcium ?
it is not absorbable from milk , bcause in the mlk with pasteurization and all , the enzymes are missing .
and the body ca n't use it .
so , on th contrry , that adds to the problem .
i had canceled my health insurance when  was 34 yars old .
and the reson was not that i was very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not interested in a kind of hospital or medical treatment that might be covered by insurnce because it s toxic , it 's drugs  it 's chemicals , and i have , yu know ,
nd over the years  i 've saved an average of s $ 2,000 a yar 
for 45 years , that 's roghly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .
even now , his application of ths therapy s unrelenting .
today , gerson 's name and therapy is known and honord world wide by holistic physicians , nutritionists and chiropractors .
he also authors features storis fr the b-monthly
thank you vry much , my pleasure .
nice meeting you .
charlotte 's daughter peggy , along with husbnd giuliano and daughter etha , who live in taly , also follw the gerson protocl .
giuliano , a pet , journalist , lecturer and author , recently wrote his own tribute about dr. max gerson 's life , set as a novel .
this film would not be complete without a representtive recvery from one of th most deadly cancer of all .
meet pat annie from british clmbia , in canada .
she remains extremely busy .
pat radiats god health and has a deep conviction about certain priortis in her life .
ironically , he developed cncr after pat had recovered on the grson therapy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas cancer , which is spread to my liver , gallbldder and splen .
my husband just would n't accept it ,
i was on the therapy for 10 days , the bleedng had stopped , the pain had stopped , i cme hom , get the therapy for 2 years ...
after three months  my doctors here wondered why i was still living .
he asked me if i would have a cat scan , whch i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't want t know what you 're doing , just keep doing it .
i hope they appreciate me .
at the time i was fighting the pancreas cancer , we got a call from mchael landon , you may remembr him , he was on lttle house on the prairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
he would n't go dwn to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his family .
he wnt on to the tonight show and he looked wonderful , and he sid he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after he did this treatment
and said he knew that was the end , that he should have stayed with the gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind tht he wold be alive today if he had stayed with the grson .
it is a medieval cstle .
finally , after 75 years and tens of thousands of haled people , the world at last is embracing this answr to cancer .
and in recorded human history there 's also triumph and hope over seemingly insurmountable socetal , indivdual and environmental illness .
) n the fall of ancient rom is result ( ?
only now , and for some perhaps hauntingly , the melting ic sheets revealed through fosslized remains , but nothing is permanent and life is fragile and beautful .
the purity nd soundness of food s taking on a whole new meaning and with every meal we are either diggng our own graves with a silver war , or ensuring a healthy , productive life for not only us , but our progeny .
your walth , fam and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance .
your grudges , resentments , frustrations and jealousies will finally disppear .
so , too , your hopes , ambitions , plans and to d list will expire .
it wo nt matter where you came from , nor on what side of the tracks you lived at the end .
even your gender and skn color will be irrelevant .
so , what will matter ?
how will the value of your days be measured ?
what will matter is every act of integrity , compassion , courage or sacrifice that enriched , empowered and encouraged others t emulate your xample .
wht will matter is not your competence , but your character 
on nursing himself back to health , he found the manuscript missing .
it took dr. gerson a full year to reconstruct the manuscript for his towering classic cancer therapy , results of 50 cases.
forver !
this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for the governement but mostly ...
mostly for  ... a hllywood studio .
this what at the tme of the 'good neighbor ' policy .. and it was my task to make a large technical documentry on the subject of the carnival 
samba orchestra .
voodo ceremonies  particularly in shango which are practiced ... up in th favelas , those strng , native settlements on the ... mountains , which are right in the midst of rio .
he came to my office ...  in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happens not only in south american govrnments , but also in film studios .
and the witch doctor ssured me that this ... was deeply offensiv and ...
and , i sid i was most sorry about it myself and ...
i did want to finish the film and i did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the time ...
uh ... already agreed on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finish  since so much effort had gone nto it and i was pleading my cause for some tim .
praying that we would be able to .
and , i came back to the office and found that the doctor had gone ...
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
this was the mark of the voodoo .
the first story , 'my friend bonto ' , began shooting in mexico under the direction welles ssociate , norman foster .
as producer of 'it 's all tru 
at the same time he was preparing to prduce an act in the thriller 'journy into fer ' , but hs plans wre about to change , dramatically .
and brazil s dictator , getúli vargas , had nazi sympathzers in his governement .
so , the stte dprtment appinted welles , special ambassador to brazil 
we , the people of these united nations of america , now stand together 
we ought to know each other better than we do .
it was more of  cultural interchange .
i was told that it was my patriotic duty ... to g and spend a million dollars shooting ... the carnival n rio .
he had to get to ro in time to film the carnival .
so , he ws forced to shoot 'the magnificent ambersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoining soundstages .
he did n't even hav time to change hs costume .
filming f 'bonito ' , the first part f the new latn american version of 'it 's all true ' , was temporarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he finished shooting both films n time to leve for rio , but it was a real cliffhanger .
 went t the projection room at about two in the morning , no , four in the morning , and then gone on the plane and off to rio .
ask me agin ... in six months 
the lights failed to arrive , so he filmed 'carnival ' with anti-aircraft lights borrowed from the brazilian rmy .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to capture a hurrcane .
people get tired , they fall asleep , they 're going to lean against a hose , that 's it .
as it turned ot i became fascinated with samba .
what was interestng wre th samba clubs  and all of that whch would have organized and told to people , explained what it was , socially and all the rst of tht .
welles had discoverd what the true subject of his film would be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it ?
no , inded , if rio 's backyard is n't exactly gala it 's even gayer than rio 's front lawn .
it 's set to msic  but the music 's all its own .
rich ...
deep ..
brazilan .
it throbs in the streets .
samb .
vargas hd demolshed praça nz to build a new boulevard .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicolor cameras to commemorate the carnival of the streets now passing into history .
welles joined the people in their protest .
at the same time he began filming the story of another protest which wold be the third story of 'it 's all true ' .
a cry of outrage from the poorest f the poor that electrified all of brazil .
he frst rad about it in tme magazine .
four por fishermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio t dmand that brazil 's president give their people , the jngaderos , the same social benefts enjoyed by other brazilian workers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the northeast , an incredible 1650 miles , without the aid of a compss , stopping along the way to find food nd water .
jacaré was the leader of the expedition but jerônimo , a man who could neither read nor write , was the pilot .
their jungad was carried n trumph through the strets .
three months had passed since ther voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangaderos were still national heroes .
with 'bonito  and 'carnival ' th jangederos story would complete his latin america trilogy .. but jacaré 's political activities had made him  cause of concern for the vargas governemnt .
i think that the vargas governemnt began to recognize the fct tht this was not going to be a film that would bring tourists to brazil .
i remember the night we tred to photograph one f the tenement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us and after a siege of beer bottles , empties of course , stones , bricks , and i hate to think what lse ..
we retreated to a more phtgenic distrct .
and , it occurs to me that since man nd the world have to lve with ne another and get along smehow ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , and the reaction is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and down .
they did n't even hear the samba musc becaus it had n't been synched up .
and all i kept getting were thse terrible signals about this awful movie i had made .
eventually , they ct 45 minutes out of 'the mgnifcent ambersns ' and gave t a happy ending .
it might have been wlles ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... the picture itself dstroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a sunny , beautiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was fll of sailboats , putting p sil , getting ready to reenact the jangaderos ... triumphant entry into rio harbor .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ..
we were devastated .
h must have mde the decision at that point that he would make this film no matter what .
i 'm sure ... was hunted ... by the feeling .. that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice president was sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and send everybody home .
when we were recalled from brazil ther was till some money left fr shooting .
not much .
i tok that nd went up with dck wilson and a cameraman ... and we made the 'jangadero ' docmentary .
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , fllowing their voyge nd all that .
and  it was tragic because they did not get ... what they ... went for .
it kept them poor , no mtter how hard they worked .
it was t .. remind him of hs promises .
wlles devised a littl love story .
to get extreme low angles , he would put people on pltforms , and bury his camraman deep in the sand .
he drw moving performances from people who had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a wartim flight to the states .
once back  he learned that rko was not going to let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
and ... they ... made a gret publicity of pont of the fact that i had gone to south america withut a script and thrown all this money away .
tht ..
i never rcovered from that ... from that attack .
he hired himself out for the frst time as a movie star to option th footage frm rk .
for four years he desperately sought financing to fnish it .
i tried everything .
i was near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many years of my life .
if i turned my back like they did on it , i would have been much better but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... of what was called :
so , i went and had one of the cans printed up nd found out that yes , there was some things of 'bonito , and there was some things of 'carnival ' .
it was orson welles .
ladies and gentlemen , here comes th samba now .
of course , we all live with our past but i try not to ... encourge it to misbehave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unpronounceble .
surdo ?
correct !
ladies and gentlemen  the ... tambourine is not  ... tambourine 
it 's just a rough frame wth some kind of ( ?
cat skin 
pandeiro ?
-yes , somthing wrong , senor welles ?
oh , no ..
it 's all right now .
ladies and gentlemen , this instrument oddly enogh , is exactly like our tambourine !
well , that 's the way things are .
i ...
why ?
why ?
-well , because of the sound it 's making .
that 's a .
yeah .
ganzá .
the gentleman here handles it with all the flare of a brtender shaking a cocktail shaker .
nw ... w hear the cuica !
what 's that , carmen ?
cuica !
the cuica .
-cuica .
however , as you notice , it is n't beating lke a drum .
one end is open .
when you yank t back and forth the ... that 's what you hear .
there you hv it !
the rhythm of the samba .
brazilian babis can beat ut samba rhythm bfore they can talk !

welcome , gentlemen , to the united sta --
did you call the zoo ?
yes , sir  we 're in luck .
the apes will be hiddn from the public .
they 'll be quarantined .
they need medical attention , it 's available right on the spot .
they are dressing up !

uh ..
why did h do that 
here yu are , old fella .

zira !
i 'm yours .
i think they 're trying to b kind .
this cage stinks of gorilla .
cornelius , where are we ?
what 's happened ?
i know where we are .
i know what has happned .
in some fashion - and i lack the intellect to know precisely hw -- we have traveled from earth 's fture to earth 's past .
but we saw the earth destroyd .
only sinc seeng it , we hve passed through a backward disturbanc in time .
did you notice the date meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship ?
we have returned to earth nearly 2,000 years before its destruction .
apes , at this instant in time , can not yt talk .
oh , the driver gave me this rport from the air bse .
yeah , it 's the usal imitativ behavior .
mimicking salutes , handshaking , sitting on chairs  eating ffplates with knives .
there was sort of
hi , dr. dixon .
the female 's a bit uppity , sir .
oh ?
i see you ve prepared the wisconsin multiphasic .
we 'll begin with that .
all right , we 'll take the female first .
arthur , wuld you set p a cha -
not a bit 
just as you ordered .
we 'll offer the banana .
well , why does n't she take it ?
bcause i loathe bananas !
arthur , i think dr. brnton needs some air .
zra , are yo mad ?
i did not call her mad .
i hate deceit !
and how in the name ofgod are we to know that unless we communicate ?
and we can listen !
and we can watch 
primitive ?

i am calm !
zira !

we will not hurt you .
poor dr. milo .
doctr 
you killed him !
n  i did n't .
he did .

he 's a gorilla !
well , look , there 's nothing to be afraid of .
do you understand tht ?
humans ?
i 'm a psychiatrist .
my name s cornelius .
lews dxon .
nobody 's going to believe this .
belev what ?
that primitive apes cn talk .
primitive ?
uh ... well , i men that in or , m .. primitive , um , civilization , apes just do n't tlk .
may i say somthing ... personal ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm aware that wht i have to tell you may conceivably create
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was one of two that have been missing in space for vr 2 years now .
have they dentified the bodies , mr. president ?
zoo ?
what would astronuts be dong in a zoo , mr. president ?
reporters :
general !
no comment .
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a little later , please .
reporter :
later .
and if th questions bcome less simple ?
and i am the animal psychitrist who has been in charge f these 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect your work  but if you think you 're going to turn a presidential inquiry into a ventriloquist 's act , i have to inform you --
and i hav to inform you , sir , that these two apes have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i rpeat that they hve the power ofspch .
well , may we be told which is the female of th specis ?
have you a nme ?
certainly she can articulat , which , in itself , is extraordinary !
what is your name ?
zi-ra !
mechancal mimicry .
unique in an ape vocally , without a doubt , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
mr. chairman .
we 'll take that up later , your eminence .
cornelius , do yu and your lawfully wedded spous speak any language other than english ?
what is english ?
i speak th language taught to me by my father and mother , who were tught by their
it has been the language ofour ancestors for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its rigins , who can be sure ?
nonsense !
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblnkred  pseudoscientific geese !
i 've examined thousnds of thm .
and until now , i 'v only discovered 2 who could talk in my life .
god knows who tught them .
where we come from , apes talk .
humans are dumb .
i 'm not sure .
when th spacecraft first landed on our sabord , it was dr. milo who salvaged it .
he studied it and halfunderstood it .
half ?
enough for dr. milo to be mrdered in your zoo .
enough for my wife and i to be here now .
from where , crnlius ?
of course the female knows 
that des n't make any sense .
cornelius  you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpanzees are pacifists 
in a spaceshp .
gentlemn  do you have --
no comment .
no comment .
as had of this commission  it will be ur duty to sit through the facts of this bizarre affair and pss our conclusions onto the president of the united states for implementation .
what a load ofhogger mogger .
dr. hasslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
no , gentlemen , no cmment ... yet .
doctor .
you wre marvelus .
they loved you .
but only to lews and stevie 
oh , zra .
well , you se ... we did know colonel taylor 
i mean , as a scintst , i sympathze , but i gree that that 's a revelation the masses would not take kindly to .
i think yo did the right thing in denying knowledge of colonel taylor .
what 
they would have asked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the windows of the spaceship .. w saw the earth ... destroyed .
i repet , talked to the presidential cmmission of lnquiry .
dr hasslein , as i recall , when you asked the male ape whre he was from , the female replied , from yor future .
would you believe tht ?
i think it is the only explanation .
but still something is missing -- and that something is still hs rel self painting the second picture .
so he regresss furthr and paints a third .
he wuld perceive , mr. bnds , that time is like a freeway with an infinte number oflanes , all leading from the past int the future , however , not unto the same future .
thank yu very much , dr. hasslein .
t 's certainly the most incredible story this reporter has evr coverd .
they will , however , b taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be given an extnded tour of the city .
this is bill bonds rporting for eyewitness news 
good night .

how is that ?
we have heads as well s hands .
i call upon men to let us use them !
beastly .
and dimas which means body frame .
its scientific name s a compond of the grek kampto , which means flexible or bent ,
its generic name , therefre , is flexible lizard .
shock  my foot !
i m pregnant .
no , i insist .
now , is there anything i can get you , zira ?
well , i have a strange crving .
grape juice plus ?
lewis said only a sip .
especially in cases fpregnancy , yu know .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorillas ' war .
we stayed behind 
we never saw the enemy .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there was a tornado in the sky .
i feel magnificently sleepy .
the date meter on the spaceship .
and before -- before the white lght and the tornado ?
before the white light and the tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
s you have evidence , mr. president , that one day , talkng apes will dominate this earth and eventually destry it by 3950 something .
and according to the nasa experts , who are still subjcting the spaceship to microscopc scrutiny , the precis year ofwhat yo merely inferred to be earth 's destruction is recorded on the flight syntheszer as 3955 a.d. , presumably .
lter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaughtring 2 nnocents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked our facilties .
h als became vry unpopular , historiclly npopular .
nd we do n't want that to happen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 vistors seem to be charming , peaceful people -- or rather creatures - and that the voters love them .
do yo want them and their progeny to dominate the world , mr. president 
well , not at the next election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes one day will acquire the power of intelligent speech .
by zira 's testimony , we know that she is pregnant with child 
by my own testimony we know that it 's genetically possible for this child -- provided , of course , always that we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb one in a present-dayjungle or a present-day zo .
yes , mr. president ,  do .
i do n't know .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assassin would say the latter .
well , mr. prsident , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because he was evil .
we have no proof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mr. president , there are very strong indications .
are you suggesting that they were improperly interrgated ?
let us sy unprofessionally .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convened in secret session at the request of the president  the commission mkes the following interim recommendations --
the public should be informed
that the apes , aftr their rduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arising from its intended pblicity ,
there is justifiable cause for suspecting
to the installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we were in space , we saw brght , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of the arth melt .
i withheld nothing .
nobody asked me .
but ifsmebody had asked ...
only the gorillas nd the orangutans .
what 's the difference ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do nt use the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys man .
all we want t find out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , this was intolerabl .
so humans took primitiv apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became lert to th cncept ofslavry , and , as their numbers grew , to slavery 's ntidote , which , of course , is unity .
they learned the art of corporate and militant action .
he articulated .
he spoke a word which had been spokn to him over tim without number by humans .
no .
so that 's how it all started .
cornelius :
where we come from , apes talk .
you recognize your husband 's words to the commission ?
yes .
so humns were dumb .
zira :
zira :
 've examned --
i ca n't remember .
complete the word !
call for dr. dixn , please .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothal .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the commssion 's authority .
and that of the president .
zira , i 've ben asked to give you an injection --
-killing ?
will t harm my baby ?
lewis , you ca n't use that on zira !
really .
no , you must n't !
zra !
zira !
you do n't have to tell me !
now count backward from 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this .
hmm ...
not so pretty .
comprative .
an -- an -- an --
anata --
whose anatomies did you compar ?
apes and humans ?
ye -- yes ... when they died a natural death .
available ?
gorillas hunted them for sport in nets and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the various reflexes .
of the living .
you ca n't mke a dead man s kne jump ny more thn you can test a corpse 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you were advanced enough to perform experimental brain surgery on living humans ?
of course not 
when you lft , was clonel taylr alive 
we lved taylor .
we did all we could to help him --
cornlius and i .
she needs a nap .
we must get this to the commission 
if yu 'll be seated , we 'll get down to busness .
by either ape towards the human rce as it is presently constituted in this yar , 1 973 .
the male s attitude is that
of a deeply interested academician
with the true objectivity of a good historian .
the female 's cse is different ,
will have become dumb brtes
with the intelligence of animls ?
it 's been noted that what apes will do to humns
to dr. hasslein 's conviction that these apes ' progeny
this is a risk we dare not ignore .
threfore ..
the commission unanimously recommends
that the birth of th female 's unborn child
i now declre this commission dissolved .
they are savages !
jabbing needles into my pregnant wife .
i 've done tht too , dear , and worse .
they made me tell them everyt hing , cornelius .
brutes .
shall i tell you something ?
we ca n't live with les .
how long ?
 week .
they treated you like dirt .
ma'am , sir .
chow time .
i 'm not hungry .
well , maybe somebody else is who ca n't talk yet .
oh , come on  ma'am .
t 's pur vitamin c .
grr !
nobody makes a fool out ofmy wife .
you 've got to come help me .
i 'll come right away .
itjust sms so cruel and horrible nd-
i 'll see you .
unbelievably .
so do i .
but dead .
yu 'd prefer the parents dead too .

gate four .
well , i 'm sorry , sr .
good nght  charle .
okay , sir .
i 'll be ff duty , but the relief cmes on at 0430 hours .
yes , sir .
i ..
oh , my dear .
it 's urgent .
the apes killed their ordrly .
on the run .
for that , they must be killed .
it has to be don before we start a stone rolling that 'll gather enough poison mss to kill us all !
i 'll find lewis and get help .
i just lost my temper with the boy .
science regards these apes as unique .
i want them taken , yes , bt taken alive .
is that clear ?
quite clear , mr presdent .
oh , it 's you , dr. branton .
the monkeys have killed
what 
i do n't believe it .
drive carefully .
i did n't mean to kill him .
i hit him with a try .
where 's zira 
stevie ... she s in labor .
get in .
stevie  yu wo n't take us back to the camp ?
now , wait a second .
let me get this straight .
yo are asking me to risk imprisonment for the sake of two fugtive apes ?
i do it for you and for stevie and for your two distinguished friends .
uh , notorious now .
the hll with notoriety .
stand by and see his wife insulted ?
lewis 
saint francis would have
never .
the first chimp ever brn in a crcus .
los angeles is n't a circus .
lewis , i was not responsible for the death --
look t heloise .
mam .
mama .
zira , do n't waste your breath .
you know the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to speak .
mama .
mam --
that 's good .
him ?
milo ?
mil .
congratulations .
but , sir --
evidently , we were wrong because yo have n't found them !
if that 's close , she ca n't have gone far .
where do apes go ?
captain , i want yo to start an immediat search fevery menagerie , zoo , and circus .
i 'll augment your force with the city police , and i want to be kept informed about all results .
yu might have lived hppily evr af ter .
but now ...
i did it because i hate those who try to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him be dominted by you 
ll i can now do to help yo is give you this for the baby .
yes .
we 'll hang t around the baby 's neck for protction , huh ?
yes .
and now , my dear , dear friends , before the police come and the audience gathers , you and your pretty baby must go 
lewis is on his way .
armando .
i should like to say good-bye to heloise first .
this is as far as we dare to take you .
the police have roadblocks on every min exit .
here are your supplies .
can you read a map ?
we 're at th city limits at the southern edg of this oil field .
over this hll , you 'll pass through more oil wells , an abandoned refinery , and you 'll be looking down at a harbor .
it 's  graveyard for old ships 
you can hide there for a week .
a week ?
thn you can trvel with thm to florida , found a colny in the evrglades , and live happily ever after .
it 's time that yo were moving on .
lewis .
you 're the second human i 'v kssed .
and you are the first .
she 's been with the circus seven years now .
the baby 's birth was registered 1 6 days ago .
ha ha ha !
we 'll catch them sooner or later .
later we 'll d something about pollution .
later w 'll do something about nuclear war .
we think we 've got all the time in the world !
like stars n space .
is n't it beautiful ?
yes  it is ... from here .
hmm ...
why do n't we get moving ?
we 've called in for helicopters .
how long till they get her ?
what 's the matter ?

wll , we d know this much : his nme 's chambers , he 's now in indian territry , we think he was with lucky ned pepper robbing a mal hack
tuesday down on the poteau river , he 's a mediumheight man with a black mark on his cheek .
that 's a descriptin of tm chaney , there 's no chambers t it 
he got that black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under the skin .
why are n't you out loking fr hm ?
i have no authority in the indian nation .
i 'd have to say l.t .
where wuld i find this rooster ?
he 'll be at the federal cort this afternoon .
your father 's gun , you 'll want t take it home , i xpect .
i wo n't rest until tom chaney 's barking in hell .
yarnell you stay with papa .
when you get him home , you put him in a better coffin , and you bry him in mason 's apron .
your mama a n't gon na like you not coming home with me .
mama knows i can take care of myself .
peple will take it wrong that i leave this to yo , yarnell , but i got papa 's business to attend to .
now , you tell mama that i 'm staying at the monarch boarding house and i 'm gon na stop over and see if tom chaney 's one of the prisoners .
ll right , gt outta the way !
move along !
are those the prisoners from the indian territory ?
cogburn ai n't turned in his list yet .
the big fella with the ye patch .
come on !
all right , take it away !
you come back here !
mr. cgburn !
mr. cogburn !
i said yo come back here !
if mr. cogbrn thinks i 'm gon na b put off by a locked door , he does not know m !
i will be here when it opens .
best time for you to nail roster would be tomorrow .
he 's due to testify before judge parkr in the wharton case .
i appreciate your kindness .
at the rat of 25 cents per meal , i might just as well .
i was hoping you were enjoying the dumplings .
i ca n't see 25 cents in a little flour and grese .
the french is la boeuf 
i call it la beef .
a right fancy rig , sir .
watch out for the chicken and dumplings .
they 'll hurt your eyes .
they 'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken !
you squrrelheaded bastard !
i 'd like to go t bed nw .
but first i 'd like to see my fther 's traps .
i 'll take a guess and say your name is mattie ross .
how do you suppose he guessed my name ?
we 're short of rooms on account of the hanging .
now , do n't you worry about grandma turner , she 's used to doubling up .
this is your father 's traps .
the watch and the knife are inside .
what is yur opinion of a federal marshal called rooster cogburn ?
rooster cogburn !
he loves to pull a cork , i know tht !
all rise !
yeah .
he 's a tgh customer .
ther 's no appal from his cort except to the president of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 're still sworn .
defence will cross-examine .
now , in order to refresh our memoris , allow me to summrise what you said .
according to your story c. c wharton grabbed  shotgun and killed marshal potter .
then you say the father swung his axe , and yu shot him , too .
just winged him , or he would n't be here to pay up .
how long hav you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot since you became a marshal , mr. cogburn 
that was nt the question .
how many ?
twelv to fifteen ?
so many that you can not keep a specific count 
i have examined the recrds  mr. cogburn .
a much more accurat figure is available .
come nw , how mny ?
counting them two whartons , 23 .
how much more dangerous for those arrested by you ?
was ths revolver loaded and cocked ?
just answer my questions , if you pleas .
yes , sir .
i always go backward when i 'm backing awy !
aarn wharton ws standing by a pot when you rrived ?
he was stirring the fire under the scalding pot .
how far did you back away ?
something like that .
mr. goudy , do yu have anymore questions for mr. cogburn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogburn .
call the nxt witness !
raise your right hand 
mr roostr cogburn ?
it 's pretty loose because your makings are to dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .
well , who 's he ?
well , who are you ?
my family has 480 acres of good bottomland ner dardanelle in yell county .
my mother 's home looking after my baby sister nd my brother , little frank .
well then , why do n't you go home and leave me alone ?
mr. cogburn !
you can get a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile for ach of you , and i 'll give yu $ 50 reward .
wll , you 've looked nto this right smart .
i man busnss .
it blonged to my fathr 
well this 'll sure get the job done  if yo can find a fence post to rst t on while yu take aim !
i 've got some horse-trading to do , i 'll have it by tomorrw .
well , i think tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medicine 
i 'd like to met your fmily .
yo want more , missy ?
i 'v never seen chopsticks work before .
chopsticks save yur fngers .
give me your cup .
i do n't drink coffee , thank you .
i 'm partial to cld buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lemonade , neither .
yes  sir .
sounds lke a mighty easy way to mke $ 50 to me .
do n't crowd me .
do n't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detectve business all at the same time .
and $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advantage of me .
it is n't going to be easy smking old ned out .
well , i hope you do n't think i 'm going to keep you in whiskey .
no , thnk you .
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , sis , my price is $ 100 .
i will think about your proposition and talk to yu again .
now , i wan na go t the monarch boarding house .
you better walk me over there .
you can never tell what 's in a chinaman 's mind .
that 's the way he bests you at cards .
i g .
mr. rat i have a writ here says you 're to stop eatng chen lee s crnmeal forthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first place .
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , baby sister 
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rats .
give them rats a fir show , they say .
well , what kind of a fair show did thy give old man potter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i had  big horse pistol like that ,
 'm not scared of no boogermn .
cream ?
i 've been witing to have some private wrds with you .
i fnd a sweet distraction , as i suppse most men do .
i saw your mother yesterdy .
what businss dd you have with her ?
it 's a likenss of tom chany .
i 'm looking fr him and i hear you 're looking fr him , too .
i only tak one step at a time .
i 've been on his trail the best part of for months now .
i 'm a sergeant in the texas rangrs .
chelmsford or chaney as you call him , he shot and killed the senator 's brd dog .
bbbs thretened to whip him , and chaney shot the old gentleman while he was sitting in a porch swing .
well , you need not worry bout chaney anymore .
the sheriff informd me that you wre looking fr a man to go after chaney in the indian territory .
i 've lready found one for the job .
his name is rooster cogburn .
he 's a dputy marshal fr the federal court , toughest one they have .
you 'll have to tlk that over with roostr cogburn .
it 's at least a two-man job to tke him alive .
we 're tking hm to fort smith and hang .
well , more so to me .
now , would n't  hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pay for killing my father , not for some texas bird dg .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but nw i 'm of a mind to give yo five or sx good lcks wth my belt .
one would be as npleasnt s the other .
lay a hand on me and you 'll answer for it .
the children of texans are brought up to show a little more respect for their elders .
you 'll push that saucy lin too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no regard for you , but i 'm sure you hve enough for yourself to go around .
thy are all for sale except thos four scrubby ones .
the heirs of th lat frank ross .
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that s out of the question .
that hardly concerns me .
your father bought four ponies nd paid $ 100 fr them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it whle it was in your care 
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he will make money , and i will make mney , and your lawyer will make mony 
and you , mr .
licensed auctioneer , you will foot the bill .
lawyer daggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.a.v .
g. , yes .
all right .
sit down .
the ponies have no part in this .
i would n't pay that for a wnged pegasus .
now , listen vry carefully , as i will nt bargain further 
my lawyer wold not wish me to consider anything under $ 300 .
for that , yo get everything excpt the saddle .
i would like to have that in wrting , for what it is worth .
when i have it in my hand , i 'll remit the extortion money .
you 'll find it in order .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
it seems sch a shame to render such spirited horseflesh into soap .
good mrning .
sleep late .
you i n't such n early bird yourself , baby sister .
i just about give up on you .
i figured you 'd gone hom .
yeah 
well , trouble is , there 's no slats in it at all .
how much is there ?
you still game ?
n understnding , that we leave for the territory this afternoon t get tm chaney .
well , yu 'r not going .
 'm not a baby .
i 've slept out at night before .
papa took me coon hunting last summer .
first night out , y 'd be calling  mama !
mama !
i 've left off crying .
i 'll find smebdy who is .
now , i know you can drink whiskey and i sw you kill a rat .
but all the rest has been talk .
i 'm not paying for talk .
i do n't know how you propose to do that from the hog wallow you 're sunk into .
if i smelled as bad as you , i would n't live near peopl .
i 'll be more than ready .
there 's an old saw that says , one white foot , buy them two white feet , try them .
i thought perhaps it was you .
no , it was not i .
nothing .
i will call him little blckie .
what is your offer ?
i wll py the market price .
tell me this d you entertain plans of ever leavng this city ?
yes .
i 'm off early tomorrow morning for the indian nation .
how did yo light on that greasy vagabond ?
i wantd a man with grt .
well  i suppose he hs that .
i would n't trust him to much .
it my prove to be a long , hard journey .
a good christian does not flinch from these difficulties .
neither does he rashly cort them .
the good christian is not wilful or presumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong ?
i think you re wrong-headed .
i 'm having  little conversation with the marshal .
he 's gone behind my back .
well  a fellow that carries a big-bore sharps carbine might come in handy , if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something .
we do n't need him .
got everything ready ?
all but the grub .
there 's no hurrahing in it .
how much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
n .
five hndred dollars ?
yep .
bibbs was a little senator .
well , i guess i ll just stick with sis .
the bibbs family 's put up another $ 1,500 fr chaney .
have they now .
what are the terms ?
well , you can tell him to his face  you cn spit in his eye , you can make him eat sand out of the rad , yu can shoot him in the foot , and i 'll hold him for you .
she ai n't going , anyhw .
she 'll make nothing but trouble .
maybe i 'll catch this chaney by myself and take all th money .
how 'd you go about that 
i 'd dispute your clam  i 'd muddy up the water .
i ai n't never seen nobody from texas i could n't shade .
la boeuf , you gt crssways of me , and you 'll think  thousand of brck have fell on you .
that reward money 's just  pig in the poke .
look at him grin , he 'll chet you .
we 'll get yur man , that 's the main thing .
you sorry piece of trash .
i 'll send it to you .
that 's a big story .
you 've not heard the last f matte ross .
you may well hear from my lawyer , daggett .
lawyer daggett 
who 's lawyer daggett ?
red .
the river looks kind of high 
yeah .
well now , red , f i was to tell you that , you might tell him .
i would say , tom chaney , look out .
ca n't you get anything through your head ?
you 're not getting n this ferry .
i have paid my 10 cents for horse and rider .
red , take this girl into town to the shriff .
there 's also a $ 50 reward .
ask the marshal .
oh , she 's a runaway , all right .
lawyer daggtt again .
she draws him like a gun .
i wll do no such thing .
right .
they 're loaded down with fat men and iron .
i 'm going to raise welts on you like worms .
drop that switch , la boeuf .
you 're enjoying it to mch .
you 'll find that i go ahead with what i start .
just leave her alone .
get on your horse .
it 's nt dinnertim by now ?
presbyteran , huh ?
suthern or cumberland ?
southern .
my folks are cumberland .
i was raised in n episcopal church myself .

sheep .
yeah .
hey , listen .
now , one of you 'll have to play the caller ,
 'll tell you wht to say and i 'll play all the other parts 
let it go .
that , baby sister , s no trade .
least little blackie likes the corn dodgers .
it 's the salt in them .
we wo n't get to mcalester 's by dark , so we better head for a dugout i know .
it 's empty , and we can shelter in it .
what do you want ?
well , there 's no room fr yu here .
try that on the chimney 
speak up .
who 's in there ?
we do n't know any emmett quncy !
emmett , this is rooster .
one more minute , and you 're going to drink it .
well , nw , do n't you bet your life n it .
what kind of papers you got on me ?
you better mov .
tell those othrs to be careful with their guns .
we 're coming out .
ht the dirt .

and then if you live  i ll get yu three or four yars

i do n't like the way you look .
yes .
i do n't like the way you look .
i hope yu go to jail .

grndpa sperling gave papa two of thes when he married mam .

what did you do before yo became a peace officer ?
what did you do after the war ?
you never told me you had a wife .
my friends was a pack of river rats .
she did n't crave their society , so she upped and left me and went bck t her first husband who was clerking in a hrdware store in paducah .
goodby , reuben , she says ,
well , i told her , i said , goodbye , nola , and i hope that nail-sellng bastrd maks you happy this time .
did you have any children ?
why , i did n't consider it steling 
i never robbed no citizen or tken a man 's watch .
i had to flee for my life .
no horse could run him into the ground .
when that posse thinned out , i turned old bo around , and taking them reins in my teeth , i charged them boys firing two navy sixes .
they mst 've all been married men that loved their families 'cause they scattered and run for home .
you do n't have any fmily  do you ?
general price do n't belong to me .
looks like moon was telling the truth .
yo see chaney ?
that 's him hollering 
there 's a younger one , but he ai n't a patch t this one .
moon !
quincy !

they do n't call him lucky ned pepper for nothing .

i srved with general kirby smith .
i do n't have to hang my head when  say it , either .
go head and make anther joke about it .
and i do n't like your conversation abot captain quantrill .
otherwise , leave it alon .
you know , i 've been thinking about lcky ned pepper .
maybe he planned on murdering those two stock thieves so they would n't inform against him .
nd does n't go around killng peopl for no reason .
sure , marshal .
yeah , about half the lod i was looking for .
why do n't you go in nd meet mrs. mcalester ?
maybe mrs. mclester can fix that poor lttle hand of yours .
roster , what are you doing here ?
go ahead .
that 's what texas calls a peace officer .
i have a pretty god idea where ned 's holed up .
if he is where i think he is , it will take 100 mrshals to smoke him out .
his name 's tom chaney .
 want you t bury them for me .
what about la boeuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 're of no good us when you 're handicapped .
