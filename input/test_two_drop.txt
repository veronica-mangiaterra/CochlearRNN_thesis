mrs. chatsworth .
do n't you ell a soul , but i 've discovered flubber 
that poor , poor girl .
dagett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbed by rumors that you plan to take our camps and construct a housing tract thereon .
oh , suely he ould n't .
not even mr. hawk .
but h 's an alumnus .
my dear girl , our esteemed alumnus made n extremely large loan to the college .
tha loan is overdue , and mr. hawk has us , if you 'l forgive a pertinent expression , over a barrel .
i 'd lie to sugest a meeting at the ealiest opportunity that woud be convenient to you .
i shall mae myself aailable .
psst !
however , mr. hawk ...
do n't be angry .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding again .
ook , i could n't help it .
go .
i hit my hea .
 was knocked out .
daggett :
go 
ge out .
look , the most wonderful thing happene .
wait till you hear .
look .
fluber .
i shall make myself available at any time .
... of the gretest iportnce .
no , make that of he most supree impotance .
brainar :
fluber .
flubber .
flubber .
oh .
good morning , sir .
i have the most wonderful thing to tell you .
the most wonderful thing you can tell me is goodbye .
this way .
just a minute .
anything you say would e superfluous .
dggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasant surprise .
i , too , have been wanting t hat about our loan .
brinard !
yeah , that 's right , pop .
do you know that this man flunked my boy ?
may i remind you it was wk brains that founded this town ?
i wish i could show you his examination paper .
not only did he miss every answe  he misspelled the name of the college .
do you mind ?
this means my boy ca n't play in the big game tonight against rutln .
flunkin yor star playe .
a makeup exam .
but he could n't be bothered .
so e 's ineligible .
none of your vague promises about lending money is ong to change that .
mr. hawk has already loaned e money .
proessor ,  rejoice in your sense of ethics .
but do you mind erribly if i speak for myself ?
mr. hawk .
hold it .
i 'd like t discuss our loan .
and you might bring some of those principes of yours and see how much they 're worth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
get me the file on wealthy alumni maked emergency .
we have some letters to write .
yes , sir 
then you 'll understand why i missed the wedding .
all rght , go ahead .
i 'd like that .
fo once i would really like to understand .
like mot things that eem complicated , it was actually quite simple .
do you kow wha that residue w ?
no .
ell , it 's been thrilling .
betsy , never in my wildest dreams did i hope to find a compound whose configuration is such that the deivery of energy to its surface would trigge a change in the configuration .
but they act in a direction oppsite that of the force whih triggered the change .
yes !
now that i clearly understand what happened to y wedding , will you excuse me ?
president daggett and i hae some important wrk 
it could be worth millions .
do me a personal favor .
go bounce your ball somewhere else .
we 'll talk it out tonight .
i 'll pick you up for the game 
you 're kiddng , are n't you ?
about closing the college and turning the grounds into a housing tract ?
they 're all in the same boat .
the little man is gon na get squashed .
bu you graduated from medfield .
it 's your college .
o what do you want ?
some total stranger to close it down ?
is n't there something you could do ?

or much , much ore ?
if so , what would be in it ?
did he have he from a secret book left bhind by his redecessor , or was the intelligence he received rom less audacious and ore conventionl sources ?

a lotof it is told orally , and understandably and rightfully so .

todaythepresident has a unique handle on the nuclear arsenal .
everywhere he goes he is accompanied by a military aide who arries a 45-pound briefcase known as the nuclear football .
what 's in it is highly classified , but what it does is allows the president , as the commander in hief , to be connected o the national militry command center and those force commanders who must respond to an order to initiate

one of them was dealing with a surprise attack by the soviet
missiles on the way .
our retaliatory strategy was massive retaliation during most of tha time -- mutually assure destructin .

he needed to kind of recreate the cold war with a new enemy , and tat new enemy woul be al-qaeda .
tat there was an intelligece report warning about an attack on the united sttes using airplanes .

president bush 's political rival have eagerly exposed it ?

thisis an enormously energetic , coplex syste , and different agencies have different habits and different patterns .
but as a species  we 've had conspiracy theories from the vey beginning .
oneof hemost enduring conspiracy theories that surround the office of the

roswll , new mexico .
i mean , you drive on a long , long dirt road , and there are ground sensors in that road , so that base security know that you 're coming .
eentually you arrive at jut really at a seies of signs -- there 's not really even a clearly-defined brder -- and that 's the point that you do n't want to o beyond .

and we literally spent some tme lookng at this , but there ws nothing conclusive that came of it .

they'rabletogive a unique perspcive becase they 've been there .
they now what the pressures are , they know what the isues are .
and to have a president-to-
narrator :
fivemen .
theproblemwith putting that knd of information together n one journal is that it can be stolen , copied , compromised .
i 'd be very nrvous if i were the president and i knew some other people had access to that .
gingrich :
but we keep lots of secrets .
we keep an amazing number of secrets .
i have my doubts that there is such a book .
preidentsthemselves certainly keep secrets .
it 's not even power , per se .
it 's information .
and those that do n't have , are n't .
one thing is certain :
i 'dsaythat there are things that george
bush 41 and i know that not too many other people know .
gezora , ganime , kamoeba
the progess of science is endless .
so is te dream of man to explore space .
helis 7 , the new unmanned roet to explore jupiter .
its mision is to fly 600 million kilometers , ather dat and return in about thre and a half years .
earth bores me .
are you dreaming ?
you could nt get any pictures , so you 're rying to cover p .
wait a minute .
wake up , boy .
if you think you are awak , do n't bother me .
fly to brazil again , or no job .
make up your mind .
if i take pictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell tem to another publisher .
to take picturs of you ?
no deal .
i 'm not about taking pictures of women .
no .
island ?
yes .
selgio island .
it 's located between hawaii and the marianas .
only eighty inhbitants 
it 's like it has fallen behnd the time .
an islad in the sun , surrounded by coral reefs that 's selio .
we 've invested a lot of money in it .
onc this pln has materialized , the world will be stunne .
ou want me to take publicity pictues ?
hat 's ight .
a single picture can impress people .
i refue .
but ...
please .
it 's been a long time 
yeah .
we worked togther on the series , mysteries of japan .
i see .
rember ?
monstes ?
es .
 thought you 'd be happy t go there .
well , i do n't believ monsters exist unless i see ne , but they might ...
doctor , is it here on ts map ?
yes , selgio island i there .
you 're right .
the spot you marked .
no , this is n't the mark fo selgio island .
what ?
selgio island
fishing is prohibited in that rea .
that 's why it 's good .
the natives here would n't like us to violate it .
who would believe that ?
ut they re serious about it .
every accident that happens at sea , they think the monstr did it .
that means more fish for us .
the folks coming frm tkyo ...
we 're fshing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's ust a curent of cold water .
really ?
look !
yokoyama !
akura !
ombo !
you were right !
yokoyama , true ?
ys , rico .
gezora is angry .
so , you eally believe the monsters exist ?
yes , i 'd like to be friends with them 
you could be a good writer .
and it lands i the backyard of prehistoric monsters .
enjoying yurselves ?
sure .
fro okoyama , too ?
yes .
i have n't had a chance to talk to you .
akoto obata , anthropoloist
let 's be friends .
this is where you are .
there was an accident on the island .
an accident ?
mr. skura ?
his partner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it 's interesting .
it 's  beautiful island .
it 's beautiful because nature is intact here .
i know 
do n't make un of gezora .
do the natives here speak jaanese ?
i see .
fortunately thy 'e fond of japanese .
mr. yokoyama is spposed to meet us here .
rico , why are n't your people round ?
i 'll find mr. yokoyama .
rico .
all right .
le 's take a rest .
he 'll b back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the atives would give me lodging .
the schedule for research of selgio island
i hink i 'll be difficult to research the entire island in a week .
right , we have to take pictures of undersea life  too .
over here !
the thought makes me shudder .
do 't give me that .
your firm sent us here .
no !
it read our hearts by telepathy 
you saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
he !
i 'll drive .
that wa some scream .
i thought it was a monstr .
the sea water .
look .
huh ?
what 's that ?
the light ?
this is terible .
this is a japanese watch .
it 's saura 's .
sakura s watch 
hey !
mr. yokoyama , how about othe pople 
i 'm leaving this island !
mr. yokoyama !
leave me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you will die .
shut up !
i 'll go back to japan and warn the eople do n't go to selgio island .
t 's hell on earth.
no , no !
shut up !
gezora !
finally we can eat .
where are they ?
gone .
mr. okyama !
look .
rico .
he 's alive .
come on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remember .
rico !
wait , he is scared of the ligh .
would you sop making jokes ?
t 's not  oke 
it 's not a scratch or a bruise .
no , it looks like frostbite .
frostbite ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body temperature must be ner zero .
you 're all suffering from monsterphobia like tat man .
that 's right , where is mr. yokoyama ?
plans for the selgio island uderwater hotel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
y forgot me ?
it 's me saki .
ric 
ico !
if we can bring back his memory , we may be able to find out ha happened .
let 's go .
our bags ?
right .
th island 's shaman , i think .
die , friends of the devil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a first-aid kit .
is he conscious ?
rico , rico .
there 's one good thing .
we 're luck to be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream of it .
no , i wo n't be able to sleep .
docor , but what if the monster really lives in the sea ...
that oul be wonderful .
come on 
i think this whole thing is taged .
and you ae the main character ?
let 's et this straigh .
what did you come her for ?
then why di you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are ore important .
we shouldn t have hard feelings .
do 't worry .
you 're as mean as ever .
saki .
rco .
come !
i ca n't believe i 'm alive .
the monster is a squid .
the leendary gezra is back to life .
does it hate rubbe ?
i do n't know .
my knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the shaan 
why are you so skeptical ?
the peopl here are serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo .
everybody s going to ie !
doctor !
you 're all right 
doctor , it 's just a monster squid .
it has the characteristics of a squid .
but ...
can you call that a squid ?
when the fire burnt it , he moster was upset .
any gasoline on this island ?
the company brought some , but it 's gone wit that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guns !
good .
good !
pour out the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire !
great !
gezora is brning 
here .
this will protect us .
i never imagied .
lenty of gasoline 
we 'e safe even if it comes back .
i 'm encouraged .
if it was only a simple giant squid e 'd be safe .
what does he mean ?
doctor !
doctor , if it was n't a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible creature .
tell me the truth .
you know what the monster realy is , do n't you ?
i 'm sory .
terrific !
i 'll show you .
watch out !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's oata !
it 's me !
i wondered where he went .
he wants to escape .
it 's dangerous .
come back !
he monstr ca n't get me !
we should evacuate 
go farther .
hurry .
hurry !
we are almost there .
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
do n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca n't be sure that we destroyed it completely .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto oata .
you are no longer n ordinary human being .
n use resisting .
abandon humn emotins .
i will give you an important job .
you must find our formidable enemies all over the earth and nihilate them all .
stand u , obata .
there s one here too .
yes ?
i 'll tell yu what i think .
and the giant squid we fought yesterday is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size had canged .
all the principles of genetics and biology ca n't explain i .
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab is n't ganime .
the space creatures that came with helios 7 made the crab into a monster .
as a weapon to attack us .
ou mean the space creatures got into heios 7 in outer space some hundred-millions ilometer awa from earth ?
if this creatue is highly developed , it may be able to live in a vacum .
... and it may be able o alter its own cells and pass through the atoms of metal .
i see .
space creature or not we must destroy it .
we must think of some way to fight 
i will marry rico .
we will have a wedding tonight .
wedding ?
congratutions .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico 
rico .
rco .
saki .
you reconize me ?
rico .
good !
you had amnesia for a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
yes , monster !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
bats ?
yes  bats cam .
gezora ran away .
why ?
there ee porpoises when we were in the sea ...
i got it !
what i it ?
the space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes , humas can hear sound waves up to 20,000 yces .
but bats and porpoises emit 120,000 cycles ultrasoud with which they use to guide themselves .
yes .
i gues space creatures hate it .
if we have bats , they ca n't come near us .
yes , mny ats live in caves .
yes , but they 'll come back to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bts !
there .
id the monster do this ?
i do n't know how , ut nobody else could do it .
i thoght we were safe , but ...
ven thugh hey are pace creaturs , they ca n't kill all the bats on the island .
here to .
all right .
maybe all the ats are dead .
that ca n't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 're safe now .
we cn control some bats .
mr. obata !
o course .
the monster ca n't beat me .
what 's this ?
the onster is scared of bats .
rea .
then et e seep here too .
what are you doing , obata ?
it 's about tie for the bats to move .
he went out .
wait !
doctor ...
u .
he 's not obata .
why did you cme to earth ?
we are the wanderers of pace .
we can exist only by living off othr frms of life .
wt are you going to d with us ?
you know our weakess .
rio !
no we know enoug about earth creatures .
before they arrive , i must annihilate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see mankind perish like this .
even though you 'r a wretched spy , you 're still a human being .
a human being !
kamoeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go of it !
let go f it !
i wo nt ...
obata .
do n't come .
do n't come near me !
pray !
that s all we can do .
even if a man 's cells are taken over , he has is soul .
man is more than a structure of cells .
evey man as a soul 
his soul is fighting the spce creature .
tey ve gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck !
i wish i had my caera .
what happened to the monstes ?
even space creatures .
mr. obata !
mr. obata !
obata killed the last space creature by killing himself .
mr. bata .
they must have seen the volcano erupt .
the united forces of earth creatures ...
porpoises , bas and men destroyed the invaders .
will the people believe ths stoy ?
mmm !
hmm .
huh ?
huh ?
woo hoo !

and certain politicians .
i do n't see connors ' truk anywhere .
let 's look in the barn .
if this is chyna de vere 's blood , we 're getting warmer .
looks like he had a hobby stuffed animals .
hy 's that ?
csi season07 episode22 leapin ' lizards
this i a career first .
a little tip for yu :
the nw mrs.phillips does n't need to hear about his .
are you kiding me ?
come on , pretty girl , gtta outta there  come on , girl !
i 'm so glad i 'm a veetarian 
well , no one has seen or heard from the victi 's husband , so ...
come on , seetie .
i think he fat one likes you 
they alwas do .
we wet to connors ' ranch because a wek ago , chyna de vere went missing .
she just separated from her husband , got her own place .
this is a large section f er living room carpt 
well  it 's cetainly enugh blood to suggest foul play .
connors ' name did n't come up .
how about the husband 's ?
nd he 's still missing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , distinct blood drop , not frm the victim , not from the husband .
we also found soil trace , idenified as scheelite , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club wit the victim 's husband .
loos lke armageddon came on a thursday .
i 'm not sure there 's intelligent life on this planet .
i 'll get started .
i already went through this a week ao .
you know , you 're righ .
yeah , not my boyfriend , my fried .
she was n't a ember of your club ?
if she was , i would have know her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , the lub 's getting smaller and smaller by the inute 
you 're already an accessory to one urder .
if hank connors killed chyna 's usband , too .
oh  is that wat you think happened ?
you know , this can work in our favor with the d.a .
i 'm not really worried about that .
adam and ee were not only the first humans on the earth , they were bait ..
for intelligent life forms elsewhere in the cosmos .
but hy earth ?
hi , ms.trner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me .
well , ma'am , this is standard procedure .
 know who you are .
i 'm just going to swab the inide of ..
not 
calm down .
get him away from ..
calm down .
calm down .
no !
that bitch bit me .
i go my sample .
these visiors were highly advanced ad did not appear in human form .
people of the serpents ...
of course it did .
it ws nt human .
not of this erth .
ufo 's , alien bduction ...
loks like shannon was a player .
reptles ...
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of srpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the nakes of ireland .
what is this ?
so connors cut off her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space ?
catherine ...
check this ut .
what 's hannon doing with hm ?
chillin ' in cabo .
i 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , helo , xea .
o , boy .
duct tape 
yeah , he used it to close up the laceration from a sharp force permortem ound .
could that be the fatal wound ?
give e the rest of the body and i can tell yo .
alost three inches  smooth-edge blade ...
you know  catherine found ...
why would anybody want to taxiderm a human head ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our uy had to separate the hed from the body .
fr tht , he used a serrated-edge knife .
heartwarming .
yeah , so then ... he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying musce .
then he tanned the skin to preserve it .
hydrate it with a borax and water solution to keep the bugs off .
popped in two glass eyes , and then ... and he 's got the best-looking wall mount in the neighborhood .
yeah , i 'll get it over to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a guy on the fencing team .
his thighs were incredible .
yes , the , uh , tip has been wiped clean .
gives us a height for a white female of 5 ' 6 .
how about for a male ?
did you measure te head of te femur ?
41 points ...
point five millmeters .
t 's a female .
this little piggy had chyna .
yeah .
hey , greg .
no .
i 'm having a pretty bad yer .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
good .
come here , take a look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeah .
you can see dick cheney , al gore , all nine supeme court justices shape-shift into reptilian .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , most members f congress
hey , did shannon turner have a cat ?
so did han connors .
cats are a natural enemy of repiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the swrd i found at shannn trner 's made the tool marks on te skull .
shannon 's prints were al over te handle .
and the partials on the blade , above the hilt ..
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shanno .
yeah , but brass interviewed her last eek .
she di n't have any visible uts .
warrick ?
come at me with a swod .
all right , so i push bck hard enough ... bang you on the ose .
brass would n't have seen that .
u what i do n't understand i i shannon turner nd hank connors really believed in a reptiia conspiracy and they felt threatened by the political establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a club card at a tabe game , the floor man writes down what game you played  where you sat , what time you started , time you quit .
this i the first time shannon used her card .
and te dealer is chyna .
looks ike they 're best friends .
two eeks ago .
mabe chyna was hr lucky harm .
she nver walked away a winner .
i think he was gaining hr trus .
stalking hr .
it 's ot a crime to play blackjack .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
we found your blood in chyna 's apartment .
then it was planted .
how shoud i know ?
look ... yo killed chyna ,
and connors illed preston , because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition .
you lied about knowing chyna , you going to lie bout this , too ?
his cells do n't die .
oh , 4,000 .
the new 50 .
preston is a great man .
he has th wisdom of the ages .
beyond your capacity to understan .
ms.turner ... was chyna a reptilian ?
the reptilian athena 
is that chyna de vere ?
ell me about this one .
is hat you ?
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill you .
what ?
her husband .
she does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your rig .
i eally , really hate you .
that would explain why we found boh rings in the ashes .
i found it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , and then the dome of the liver .
that 's yur c.o.d .
yeah , pelvis is female .
the femur 's the same length as the one the pigs were chomping on .
it 's her .
well , we 'll run this against connors ' guns .
then yo better turn it off before they use the oxyge destroer on him .
i do n't know why i find it so difficult to express my feelings to you .
i can see you as vividly as if you wre here with me .
as shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnet 47 , thyself away art present still with me 
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move , and i am still with them , ad tey with thee .
or , f they sleep , thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye 's deligh .
you 're supposed o let me get these things on .
i do n't know .
ou mean , like me and you , baby ?
jim .
i got a call from a passing moorist .
preston d vere ?
very glad to be ack home .
i was a captive , held against my will .
from what the sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skepticism .
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
oh , so you were abduted before your wfe was mssing .
what are you trying to tell me ?
you do n't know your wife is ead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had o ida .
come on .
prston .
if she was so sweet , what were you doing chilin ' in cabo with hannon turner ?
well , you got yor pictures on the cfee mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth of where you were the night you wife was killed .
tht 's easy .
there 's a woman , and it is romantic , very romantic .
e are victims ... and no one is listenin to us .
we 're powerless against what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has nyone talked to shannon in the last couple of days ?
they ve got her .
it 's lik we 're wtnessing some form of mas hallucination .
you know , they think the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well .
that 's why shanon attacked greg .
let 's try this again .
sorry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contact with them .
please , we come n eace .
it 's all righ .
got a warrant to tow in larissa niles ' car .
blue fluorescence is ne of the properties of scheelite .
which was found in the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same area .
ave you looked inside yet ?
i was just abot to .
preston was found naked , right ?
yeah , it 's a recurent theme in tales of alien abduction .
so clarissa drove him out tere and he left his stuff in her car .
that 's not all he left :
steam cleaner .
just what every estrangd husband needs to clean up hs ded wife 's blood .
this cse jst came down to earth .
ys ,
we were asleep and suddenly the room turned very cold .
freezing .
i ...
come on , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i man , really .
yu got way too muc on the ball to fall fr this con man .
he 's a brilliant man .
he sved my life .
it was cancer and he cured it .
he knows how to prevent human cells from dying .
they 're , they 're radioactive .
it would put the out of business .
let me sow you something .
look a this .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a nutritionist .
he 's not .
and look .
they never heard of im .
he has no place of bsiness , no job .
he got shannon urner to ll his wif for hi .
got ou to give him money .
he never asked for it .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it whle you 're sleepng so they can manipulate your thoughts .
you 're not only cancer-free , you 're fre of their control .
ow am i ever oing to be able to thank you ?
the evidence is all over yor car .
he loved me .
if they were trying to clean up all the blood , they did a goo job .
steam cleaner teste positive for blod , but there was n't enough for dna .
did you find nything ?
funny you should ask .
found a hair in the brushes .
it 's on the left .
the one on the right is chyna e vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleaner was completely wiped down , could n't find any prints .
but then i remembered this story about a csi down in l.a .
nobody could find any prints on a gas can from an arso , bu he realized that you got to gri i underneath in order to pour out the ga .
and you know what ?
he broke the case .
so whose prints are on the steam cleaner ?
i just got an afis hit :
preston d vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protector of mankind .
cut off her head , she dies .
no problem .
it was n't a reptilian conspiracy , but it was a conspiracy .
men are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a long time for her to die .
you know , every time i think about leaving this job , a guy like you comes along and reminds m why i ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus nd medusa , t.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of reland .
these are accons of battles for the survval of the human race ,
a battle we will lose unless we stop killing one another and focu on the real enemies .
they ae among us .

as andy hardy , mickey rooney was always falling in love .
esther williams played his love interest in her frst film .
a fashion model and champion swimmer esther was working in an aquacae when he caught the attention of an mgm talent scout .
in the 22 films she made at metro she was eldom out of the water .
williams :
it had been five years since my andy hardy movie .

then take another ten for your publicity men
what 's another tn more or less ?
then tke off a few incidetal
if you take off the proper

i was called america 's mermaid because it appeared tha i could stay underwater indefinitely .
for 12 years , i was the center of an amazing seris of vivd sights and water pageantry .
alyon :
each man she met she went and kissed
for a girl today do n't get the scope that cleopatterer did
williams :
if one performer could exemplify the lighthearted spirit of the mgm musical then june allson ould surely be it .
allyson :
when she went like this and then lik that
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the spot
she gave these poor eyptian ginks
this ws the original main gate at mgm .
it was all so gamorous .
that 's me on the right .
still et behid te ears from the broadway show best foot forward which the studio bought and took me along as part of the packag .
it 's not ard o tell tat nancy walker , gloria dehaven and i desperately wanted to make good at metro .
all :
yes , the barrelhouse the boogie-woogie and the blues
every boogie beat will raise your heat
oh , the blues will really get you
and the barrelouse is bound to upset you
and the boogie-woogie beat will drive ou straight to distraction
from a barrelhouse
the bog-boog-boog-boog boogie and te blues
i lov the boogie 'cuse i tickles my spine
just like a cigarette with modern design that 's why i love the boogie-woogie
yes , yes
it 's so darn ood it makes a fool of the res
it 's got a kick like mountain liquor and it 's as slick and hrd
i picks you up and then it knocks yo rigt down
it makes you laugh and play and act like a clown
no ther music has the right to the crown
like the boogie-woogie beat
do n't man the blues
she loves the boogie-woogie beat
allyson :
it was an extensive crash course designed to find those with that special something known as star quaity .
and if you had it , you got o take the next big step :
for instance , kathryn grayson had to wait two year at mgm efore she was given her first screen test represented here in anchors aweigh .
unhappy news away

llyson :

this was mgm 's scenic backdrop building where talented artists created their movie magic , and this is just one section of a huge painting re-creating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was originally 600 feet long and 60 fet hgh and wrapped around the entire interior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've alays had uch respect for gene .
both :
first , you put your two knees close u tight
hen you way 'em to the left thn you sway 'em to the right
step aound the floor kinda nice and light
then you do the eagle rock with the style and grace
gene 's first big break came on bradway , starring in pal joey .
both :
balli ' the jack
charisse :
gene had a style all his own charming and athletic , with boundless ergy .
his partner :
gene 's inventiveness seemed inexhausil .
fit as a fiddle and ready for love i can jump over the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
charisse :
gene teamed with donald o'connor to perform tis marvelously omic vaudeville routine for sngin ' in te rain .
soon all the church bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
how the church bell will be ringing
hi , diddle-diddle , my baby 's ok
charisse :
the heather n the hill fro brigadon .
you are my lucky star
charisse :
gene inspired a whole new generation of stars .
one of the brightest was a young california girl named debbie reynolds .
my lucy star
i was only 16 and still mary frances reynolds when i entered the miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous owns creaed by the world-famous designer adrian were pat of the treatment .
as well as makeup and hair departments that could accomplish any syle imaginable .
a star like joan crawford wold someties have her loo redesigned numerou times until it matched the exact mood of the role she was to play .
yu stepped out of a dream
you are too wonderful to be what you seem
culd there be eyes like yours ?
honest and truly ?
you stepped ut of a cloud
in 1941 , the glamour age had reaced its zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin 
alone ad apart out of a dream
safe in my hart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatmnt in a dream sequence to the song a lady oves in the film i love melvin .
loves a penthouse whre she 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sail aay
for a simple rivera holiday
reynolds :
now , at last , you can see our differing pints of iew .
she loves her dreams tied up with apron strings
just little pot and pans
and he 'll be handsome well , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
sayin , yu look nic oh , never mind the price
a lady loves beaucoup i'amour
but firs of all sh loves to be scure
yet there is one al thoght she will place above
all o the things i make mention of
and what is more a lady love to live
and what is more a lady live to love
thans for the present of the silver-blue mink
thanks for the yacht and fo the solid-gold sink
thanks a lot , but no hanks
reynolds :
dolores ray uses glamour as a weapon n this spoof of the power of the devastating female over the hapless male fom it 's always fair weather .
ray :
thanks for the banks and for the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am just a faithful lassie
and there 's no gift however casy
by which this lassie ca be had
thanks for losin ' your mind
thanks a ot , but no
no hanks
i do n't know why they scold me
for doig what i 'm trying not to d
reynolds :
in torch song , joan crwford made her final musical film as a fading legend prforming in tropical makeup for the song two-faced woman .
the recording was n't a new one at gm .
it 's ben suggested that they may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
i ca n't help being a two-faced woman
a littl bit of boldness a little bit of seetness
a little bit of coldness a little bit of heatness
do n't fall in love with a two-faced woman
got another lover uner cover
that goes with the breeze
my disposition
that 's why they all her a two-facd woman
a little bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a little bit of htness
black and white won and ight
they cal me two-faced woman
reynolds :
in the ealy 1940s hollyood began a fascination with things tropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transported audiences aay from cold climates and the troubled times of a worl war .
many latin artsts were recruited to add an authentic sound to these films .
one of the mst popular was xavier cugat and his orchestra .
reynolds :
ricardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the latin lover , driving female adiences wild .
reynods :
he 's got the kind of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just like was beating in ine
but you make it 109 and there is more to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reynolds :
like this before
reynolds :
one oth performers at mg whom i admired he most was the legendary lena horne .
or when
for the first time
seem to be happening again
it was a long time ago i stood in this very spot and recorded that lovely song .
when i first walked onto ths rcording stage in 1942 it looked prtty much as it does today .
i recorded all of the music for my movies here and t is still consideed hollywood 's geatest recording stage .
i never felt like i really belonged in hollywood .
s i usually just cae on  sang a song and made a quick exit .
just one of those crazy things
yeah , i got to sing a great cole porter tune in a featured appearance but what i really wanted was to e given an actig role in the movies .
just one of those fabulous flights
if e thought a bit of the end of it
e 'd ave been aware that our love afair
was too hot not to cool down
hee 's hoping w meet now and then
but it was just
said that gal , u bary
ai n't it the truth ?
in 1943 , i got to play a art .
georgia brown in cabin i the sky .
love is a rippling ' brook
you got to bait your hook
rise and shine
and cast your line
ai n' it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel tuth ?
it 's the truth
the truth
horne :
in 1946 , i played the role of julie in an excerpt from show boat in till the clouds rol by .
i was bing cnsidered for the part for the 1951 version f show bat but the production code office had banned interracial romance on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good friend ava garner .
the studio had ava rehearse singing the role to the recordings that i ha made hopin to get te part which annoyed u both .
grdner :
fish got to swim , birds got to fly
ca n't hep lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that ma of mine
horne :
thouh ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did n't get the part .
:
tat 's a rainy day
but when he comes back
that day is fin
as lat as can be
ca n't help
horne :
i was not the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get yor gun , betty hutton was a big hit as annie oakley .
judy galand had begun filming the role and completed two numbers when she suffered a breakdown and had to be replaced .
retrieved at last from the mgm film vaults i judy 's version of i 'm an indian too .
like those indians
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an honest injun indian
i 'm an indian , too
folks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see , whatever cnflicts judy struggled with as a person she always came through as an entertainer .
garland :
when you 're ut with a eler in the pale moonlight
you do n't have to look in a bok to find
what he hinks of the mon and what is on his mind
but tey cash them just the sam
grandp dick was always sick
e just died at 93
doin ' what comes naturally
the qick toboggan when yu reach the heights
horne :
words and music was the last time that judy and mickey rooney worked together t mgm ending the most popular song and dance team the studio would ever have .
garland :
no more pain
the pled-out fur of cat and cur
judy garland and i grew up togeter at mgm and completed high school between long days of shooting .
here on the lo we made 10 pictues together and even when we worked separately we turned to each other for friendship and encouragment .
we were the very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her very much .
tach me how to sing
music with a modern rhythm let m swing
mr. mendelsson swing
music is a thing
that 's no good without that rhythm
sweet and hot fast and slow
hey , swing it low
and swin it mr. mendelssohn swing
rooney :
in love finds andy hardy judy laments the fact that she 's not a little girl any longer and not quite a grownup either .
grownups ignore me
and in every snse
i 'm jut on a fence
i 'm just an in-between
for a fw years , judy was an in-between .
they found it in her first starring role :
dorothy gale in te wizard of oz .
toto , i have a feeling we 're not in kansas anymore .
we must be ove the rainbow .
follow the yellow rck road follow the yellow brick road
follow the yellow rick road
because of the wonderful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to become the most widely seen moion picture of all time and judy 's woderful performance in the picture earned her a special academy award which i was lucky enough to preent to her .
thank you .
will you do that ?
somewhere oer the rainbow
birds fly over the rainbow
why , then
i like new york in june , how about you ?
i like a gershwin tune , how about you ?
i love a fireside when a storm is due
how about you ?
rooney :
loos like we both agree
on what to do
down on an island , the southern seas
there lived a lassie named minnie breeze
garland :
and all the natives would be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
came back t trinidad
who , stole my heart aay
who , makes me dream all day
seems as though i 'll ever be blue
no oe but yo
by 1946  judy was one of the studio 's most valuable assets and made a pecial guest appearance as marilyn miller in the jerome kern biography , till the clouds roll by 
march on , little doagies
here are judy , ray bolger , cyd charisse , and a cast of hundreds in a never-before-seen march of the doagis .
garland :
we do n't know where we 're oin '
till we 're past the last fence rail
out there breaks the day
o , we do n't knw where we 're goin '
but we 'e on our way
me for a campfire out on the ral
me for an old cayuse
and i 'm all set to vamoose
and nobody asking me why give me a cowhand sng
are marching ' on
ou there lies the prairie
this is judy at the top of her career .
playing on his slide trombone
in a certain monotone
e ws knon as mr. monotony
any pleasant interlude
but the same dull melody
would emerge from mr. monotony
folks for miles would run away
she would come around and say
ca n't play
today
it only happns when i dance with you
rooney :
another legend at metro was y good friend fred astaire who always romanced a glamorous partner in hs motion pictures .
in easter parade , it was the one and only ann miller .
astaire :
why does it hppen , dear
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks
ar yours and ine
i 've danced with dozens of others
that only happe with you
ut fred astaire was as charing off the scren as he was on and he put me at ease right away .
come on , annie , let 's do it one more time .
good evenin .
miss marlowe .
astaire :
i 've seen it often enogh .
i 'll try .
that 's fine .
harry , give us the pickup on hat gag number , will you , please ?
it was a little more than a guest appearane for fred for he was soon to be under contract to rko pictures where they were about to team him with ginger rogers causing a string of hit musicals to follow .
fred did n't return to mgm until seven years lter at which time he starred with eleanor powell in broadway melody of 1940 .
miller :
in 1945 , fred and a new partner , lucille bremer stepped out to coffee time in yolanda and the tief .
its director , vincente minnelli .
that 's for me
i 'm drum crazy , yes i 'm dru crazy , ye
i 'm plumb crazy for drums
mille :
fred could mke music out of almost anything .
nd he often found new challenges that stretched his talents .
astaire :
first , soft violins
when the drum takes the melody
when he drum carries the tune
miller :
hard-boiled privat eyes were all the rage in the 50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse .
she came at me in sections .
more curves than a scenic railway .
she was danerous .
i would nt trust her an farther than i could throw her .
he was selling hard , but i was n't buyng .
miller :
in the barkleys of broadway , they dance th swing trot under the man titles of te picture , but with the titles emoed another musical gem is reveled from the most beloved dance team of all time .
it 's bill and co-y , tea for two-y
jst wath your partner 's eyes grow dewy
entrenous-y you 're slightly crewy
oh , what a natural they 've ht upon it gets ou going till you 're really gone
and you will never re the day
the day you realize the swing trot is here to stay
gon na leave my footsteps on the sands of time
i i never leave a dime
a dancing  man

miller :
yes , i am
yes , i am , yes , i am

they 're just standing there talking .
over .
and stay by the radío .
the man said thre was a certain amount of money buried in this park .
that 's right .
it wa under a big w .
i suggest that we quietly get into our cars and drive down tere at a safe , sound speed keepin each other in sight of each other .
he 's got a point .
it 's ok .
now what 's with this fair shares for everybody ?
look , ma'm .
quarters ?
you three each get a quarter , and benjy and i have to split a quarter ?
what are you trin ' to pull ?
it seems fir to me .
it just cheats us , that 's all !

yeah .
yeah .
what ?

my wife and i would be appy with ..
hold it .

ither one quarter for each car , includin ' te van , or one fifth for each gy .
one quarter or one fifth .
how dare you ?
chief , we got a situation her that is absolutely incredibe .
see ?
i think they 're arguing abou something .
and a crockett county unit has got 'em under observation .
that 's eight shares for that .
four shares for that .
that 's 12 shares already 
then five of us went down to the wreck .
we give five shares for that .
now we add the same number of shares as there were pople i each vehicle .
that 's three for your goup , two for yours , two for us and one for you .
$ 14,000 per share .
and that covrs everything including te emancipation of woen !
wai a minute .
but no matter how you figure it out , i still do n't get as much as nyboy else .
righ ?
e , us , we get 84,000 .
what do you mean , tax-free ?
i mean , if we go down to this park and we uncover the money and we ...
i 'm sure he 's not gon na declae anything .
i know he s not gon na declare anything .
look , can you explain it to him , please ?
but what he was tying to say is ...
even businessmen that rob and steal and cheat rom people eey day .
i giv up .
anybody got a fairer plan , go ahead .
there were eight of us there , so that simply means eight shars .
we 're gon na ge noplace listening to this old bag .
lady , are you tryin ' to split us up so it becomes every man for himself ?
ad every woman fo himself ?
please do n't argue .

whn i retuned , my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted .
you 've explained your magnfcence .
there will be one more guest .
what do you expect when it takes  command from my uncle to brin you to this house ?
two years more i have to study for my master 's degre .
then four years mor as a laboratory assistnt .
they 're paying for my schooling 
how ik a scosman 
i know one whse purse was not mpty , ecause he did n't even hae a purse .

i gave no permission for visitors .
good lad .
if you do n't come now , the goose will be ...
aye , and without a pause for lunch or tea .
now then , from which volcano could this pice of lava have emerged ?
mount etna ?
very close .
the lipari island group off the coast of italy .
that 's exactly what tumped me .
but that would be icelandic peridotite .
precisely .
tere 's a piece chipped off .
by me .
what 's he rock inside ?
when i saw his , i stoped chipping .
loos like a letter or some notches .
three notches made by the hand of man .
what 's your concusion ?
science does no jump to conclusions .
we 're going to melt off the cus of lava .
mr paisley .
not oo fst , you know .
i shall write to professor goetaborg of stockholm aout this .
h 's the leading authority on volcanoes .
four hours ?
jenny !
are you all right ?
that was entiely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't kn how it could have happened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendered an inestimable service to science .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not only looks like it is a plumb bob .
can you make out what it says , rofessor ?
it 's in some nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possibly .
look a tis side , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ...
rne saknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable , bu it must be tru .
a man took some tools and went where no human being has ever set foot .
into the interior of the earth , alone .
the laughter stopped whn he disappeared , never to be heard from .
until tonight .
t out of hre , woman !
 did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shouting at me , sir oier .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you have n't slept !
out , woman !
here s your post , uncle oliver .
no answer !
were is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to et here from stockholm ?
answer the bell .
did it ring ?
callers  callers .
i 'm involve in something important .
more important than our university ?
what does the name arne saknusem mean to you , genlemen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study of vocanoes .
out of a volcano came this message from him 
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , wa probably picked up by some peasant , gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it cme to me .
whoever descends into the craer of sneffels yocul can reach the center of the earth .
arne saknussem .
the center of the earth ?
an extint volcano in celand .
but , olive , this is sheer fantasy .
you have nt heard all of t .
at sunrise on the last day of may the mountain scartaris will point the path .
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scartaris ?
it s a mountain peak near the volcano .
but this is a student 's hoax .
le 's not take that tone .
more than anything , you must consult other eperts .
and i 've writen t the foremost autority in europe .
more eminent still 
professor goetaborg of stckholm .
and what ds he say ?
ufortunately i 've not yet receved is reply .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your faous corresponden sees fit to answer you .
and in the meantime we could do wit a cup of tea .
think whatever y want !
jenny , tea !
just this moment , ir oliver .
look .
well , he 's got his letter from stockholm .
did you see the sine in his eyes ?
there 'll never b a better moment to tell him about our feelings for each other .
he 'll say yes almost inadvertently .
what if he says no advertently ?
you wait and see how firm my voice can be when i speak of you .
blast and damn !
bad news , sir ?
his disappearace follows closely the date my communcaton must ave reached him .
or too important .
mcewen , go rectly to the abor .
oliver  calm down .
you heard aknusem ' message .
oliver , you 're seriously ill .
i am seriouly well .
what are you waitng for ?
i told you to hurry .
if you 'll excuse me , i must sart packing .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time .
you must take time for this , sir .
what ae you so urgent about ?
this is the most urgent moment of my life .
i have to be in icelan .
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturally .
# and chasing the roe
# wherever i go
i wish i could sing lod enough for jenny to hear me .
it is a bit painful o leave her on the first day of our engagement .
to come back to her s a wold-famous scientist is not to be sneezed at .
come here .
i neglected to tell you , sir .
well , you 'l get over that after the irst million fathoms or so .
he 's been surveying here .
your revered colleague from stockholm .

apenstocks .
food for months .
a chart of the ..
so you wanted to push in ahead of us .
fate took care of him .
why did n't they tell us at the desk ?
we 'll observe one minut of silence in memory of a great scientist , even if he was a blasted thief .
ale  you mentione fate .
slight correction .
fate plus a few grains of otassium canide .
he was against someone who was even more against him .
who ?
i 'm th wife of professor goetaborg .
oh , my dear .
wo 't you sit down for a minute before you go up ?
please , my dear .
erly in the morning he went to the mountain 
when he came back for lunch he received his guest riht in the lobby .
they went up to his oom and ate .
wha ae you trying to tell me ?
in the evening when the maid went to make the bed ...
oh , dear god !
as long as i can remember , no one ever died in my inn !
he was joking on the ier in stockholm .
madam , my dee sympathy .
my name
oliver lindenbrook of edinburgh university .
professor lidenbrook .
i see you are .
this will be dificult for ou , madm , but it must be faced .
who was the last person to see him alive ?
i did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each other every day .
i suggest that you hav an autopsy prformed immediately .
either he nor i could suspect there was a third party who would tp at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deepl distressed by your husband 's death , and i fully understand your feelings .
however , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan to ispse of the equipment your husand assembld up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off your hands .
your expdition ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from me .
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encounter .
a saknussem descendant turns p acts as if he were king of volcanoes .
ries to force me t srrender his ancestor 's secret .
saknussem called agan .
new complication .
must fight him somehow .
young man , woul you coe here a momn , please ?
who are those for ?
that 's a beginning .
what about lamp ?
lamps .
put me down 
put me down !
are we to be abdcted every day in iceland ?
ut i wish to apologize to you in plain english .
i went throuh my husband 's diary , and some of his remarks led me to lieve i did you an injustice .
i 'm sorry .
i did n't know .
do n't ive it another thought .
i sha n't .
began and tht 's all it hs done .
ir oliver , this morning you asked e for these .
if o stil want them , they 're yours .
will you say that again ?
madam .
my husband had thee bots made specially .
i hope they fit ou .
i told your man to order some for me immediately .
good , good .
wy would yu need boots like this ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm coming along .
that 's why i ' giving you all of this .
it 's a condition 
i thought you unerstood .
you did n't menion any condition .
then i do now .
whom did you intend to take along , besides this yong man ?
thn i 'll be very useful .
he does n't uderstand a ord of english .
we 're not contemplatin a stroll down piccadily or the champs élysées .
professor lindenbrook , i ve just lost my husband .
the police require yur presence for the investigation int the death .
but , madam , quite apart from the appalling danger , think of the inconvenience .
the lack f privacy .
in short , you do n't want all of this .
i may be mad on the subject of this journey , but i am not stupid !
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity !
i may have been a disturbance to men , never a buden .
you 'll sleep where we sleep , et what we eat and wash when we wash .
then you accept my proposition .
professor , look !
now we descend into blivion or ... we enter the great book of istory .
carla goetaborg .
alexander mcen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans and who ?
professor !
profesor !
hans is tying the rope o her .
i 'm a fool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule nd send her ak where she belongs .
in what language would you have told him that ?
and then ther 's alwys the blessed cance the rope may break .
are you all riht , ma'm ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only yo could see your face .
you d .
perhaps this is the wrong entrance .
but there ' no other way to continue .
eurek !
thank you .
now then , a general summary .
 :
b :
as my husband 's charts ndicated .
onward .
and le 's have some music .
the last news was that they went up mount sneffls with som heavily laden donkeys .
yes ?
and then the animas came down without their packs .
oliver s lindenbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans blker and ...
what 's it ?
a woman !
a slight tremor , coming from undefined rgions .
le us proceed .
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to sy that anything is moving away or coming towars u .
the three notches of arn saknussem .
what does that mean ?
look .
we might have taken ny one of these channels .
but our great colleagu maketh a path for or feet .
let us have tea .
with a double ration of raisins .
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ldies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , mada ?
if we 'd known that you had nightares , we 'd hae made different sleping arrangements .
omeone is walking up there .
human footsteps .
the hearing of al women is xtremely acute .
my wife used to hear rats in te attic , usually the nights befre i had an important leture .
alec , go up and find out .
they need rest .
moreover , it was stipulated that i give the orders .
there 's no need to use that patient voice with me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrok , i am a member of this expedition , and a such i intend to report any observation i make .
alec .
put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right here .
conceal these marks completely .
i ll give them some new ones .
starting from an estimated depth of 129km , limestone formation cntinues .
here are the three notches again .
good .
let 's see .
one heads 220º south-southwest , the oter 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass s right ?
quite .
what 's he sying ?
hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expedition .
alec , suppose yo tell him .
well , why does man freeze to death trying to rech th north pole ?
once a question has arisn in the uman brain , the answer mus be found if it takes 100 years .
1,000 yeas .
let s hear you rener that into a few well-chosen icelandc words 
why not simpy tell him scientists have bats in their belfries ?
are you all right ?
can you unhook yourself ?
grab his hand .
never mind about that .
how is it ossible ?
this way was clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure .
his has been here since the beginning of time .
i was not in a positon to observe it sientifically .
but where ?
we 're suppose o stay together .
tricked into the wrong tunnel .
she 's right , profesor .
madam ... heard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she 's saing it .
we must return .
why ?
you know that .
but if there is a madman loose ..
he 's against all of us .
against the very concept of this journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should o back to where alec fell .
but it ' not on our route .
if we 're to go ahead , we have no tme for detours 
then you wait here .
madam , now that the boy has gone and hans does n't undestand english ,
i 'm blushing already .
professor !
yes , i thought so .
alec !
i 've got to ake a specimen of this back to edinburgh , if it 's the last thing i do .
unique .
where the devil is he ?
it 's a blind alley !
keep back !
hans !
good god !
that 's it .
praise the lord !
alec .
professor !
hello !
professr !
proessor !
here i am !
salt .
profesor .
professor , you ca n't go on this way .
i 've kept track of the passage of days .
ou have n't .
we 'll try the cross-channel over there .
you wo n't find him there .
i 've got to find him .
i 'm esponsible .
i an see that this is a recent break 
if you 're down there , give us a sign !
alec , listen carefull .
when the echoes stop , yo must try to answer .
pick up  pebble and scratch the rock .
just ive us a ign .
how can i live with myself ?
you must continue with what you started .
it was his project as much a it was yours .
we will proceed .
down there , food and water .
so you 've lst your friends ?
just as well .
too much hat , too much loa ...
too much fear .
ou 're younger .
i 'm not you servant , count sknussem .
pride ?
rather out of place here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal the professor 's project ?
you need me as much as i need you .
you found me .
my friends coul find me too .
very well .
you 'll carry it with one arm , not two !
it 's a multiple echo , revrberating through the rock chambers .
the last echo will give us the direction .
alec .
le .
alec !
professor .
whre was he ?
i did n't think he 'd shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers hee .
you are also the murderer of my husband .
he would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of your great ancestor , put down tht preposterous gun .
you 're not going to listen to a mrderer ?
never interrupt a murderr , madam .
i resent that bourgeois classification .
you have my word of honor .
give m your hand on that .
a bourgeois trick .
so sorry .
we have t hold court .
guilty .
guilty .
then the mandatory sentence is death .
we wll follw the rute marked by the notches .
no , no , no , no , no .
i can carry something with my left hand .
you can carry yourself for a couple of days .
that 's all w can expct .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been loyal to the saknussems for generations and , well , he can not touch the gun .
this is contempt of court .
no , no , professor ...
i mean , sir oliver .
you mut nt look at me .
oh , no .
you ... you could n't consider for a moment that i could do it .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for week you 've been denying your sex , and now you all back on it .
i would say the natural execuioner would be the leader of the expedition .
we 're much too civilized to ...
what do you propose ?
dag him with us ?
stop fiddling with those lamps .
the lamp are giving out .
to save what we can ,  insist that we leave these regions at once .
you insist ?
what 's the harm ?
the har s , mdam , that he 's wasting a lamp .
madam , make a final note , while you 've still light enough to write by .
let e , madm .
this may be ou last entry .
hans and i can cut some rope into some torches .
what puzles e is that the three notches o old arne saknussem stil keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on neither do you , sir oliver .
ye , just sitch it off .
why , it 's miraculous !
look at this .
hat is it , sr ?
light without heat .
a coo , chemical light .
the sme principle is involved here .
256th day .
the phenomenal winds anished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbrook expedition , you 've written mceen epedition ?
ma i remind yo that moths ago you gave me explicit orders to that effect ?
you may ot remind me !
i do not wish to e corrcted by you incessantly .
you 're doing i with your looks , the nflection of your voice , the vry posture of yur body .
your entire preence is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had enough .
well , let me tell you , you dried-up walnut of  man , if anyone 's had enough , it 's me .
it 's i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it 's carla getaborg !
i quit !
i am leavig !
wll ...
well , at least you know i have a temper .
and from now on alec will keep the charts .
alec !
why ca n't he say around ?
a forest of mushrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grew without sun this far unde the earth !
it 's toughe than leater .
it 's like n oak tree .
mushroom steak , mushroom soup , mushroom hash .
after some months of this , you 'll be smaking your lips at he thought of salt beef .
if we only knew how many more .
there 's no erm to the work of a scentist .
bt that 's not profesor lindenbrook 's feeling .
and what is the name of the grl you love ?
the girl you love ?
what 's he name ?
jeny .
but why would you want to know that just now ?
dear alec !
professor ?
her 's some hot mushrom porridge for you , sir oliver .
i slept as i never slept in edinburgh 
i may move here permanently .
i do n't know .
is that madman still giving orders ?
the minte you fell asleep he went off in that direction , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want with all thse ?
you 've come to ask me why i did n't take m rest perid .
i do n't leep .
i hate those littl slices of death 
it 's a se .
it 's an oean ith waves and currents .
the fissures closed again .
it s the prerogative of the dicoverer .
i congratulate you .
a dimetrodon !
if i had m gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swi ?
no , thank god .
here .
i woder if it s cold where they are .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hand !
my watch !
save the instrument .
my ring 
my wedding ring .
a field of force that snatches gold awa .
this is it !
this is it 
the junctio o magneic forces from he north pole and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness over there .
after all , we did hit the center of the earth .
he wants to know where we go from here .
tired minds do n't plan well .
sleep first , plan later .
oliver , the day may come when you 'd very mch like to have that porridge .
is it incredible to you hat i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , duck .
gertrude ?
getrde ?
gertrude !
gertrude !
has !
why d you look at me like that ?
hans !
i needed food , so i took i .
stop tis fool !
hans !
you ingates !
what can you do without me ?
this is th sunken city .
after 5,000 years , behold a frgment of the lost atlantis .
all we know about it comes from the greek .
the floor of the sea opened u and swallowed the whoe island of atlantis .
this must have been the market square .
eating .
well , we 've larned one thing about the inhabitants of atlantis .
stale bread .
w must seak to the baker .
madam !
madam !
já ?
exactly .
to think that at a moment like this i 've no pad and penil to record it all .
turn arond , madam .
what is it ?
look at that tiba .
you wo 't find anything dible in there .
the chinese eat eggs over 400 years od .
gunpowder .
it 's pointing somewhere .
of coure !
this is the way up .
a direct hatchway to the surfac .
and we can climb up 
let him venture 100 meters or so on reconnoier .
the updraft ca n't carry him away .
now i 'd say let 's roll up our sleeves if we had any .
we must n't hope for much 
this liht w n't stay with us .
i 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kai-ai !
kai-ai !
flints !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be waling in darkness .
i wish i had better news .
it gives every indaion of being a pefect passage upwad , straighte than the one we descended .
there 's an obtle .
a gigantic block of stone obstrcts the passageway .
hans said only a landslide could ever ve it .
if his hopes had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , sir ?
te haversack arne saknusem 's haversack .
get it .
i guarantee that this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly , i can not guaantee .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear go , rler of heaven and earh ..
do n't set any imit to his realm , laddie .
god of the universe , we are in thy merciful hands .
look out !
a monster !
let me go !
it 's an earthquake of unusual magnitude !
more likely it 's a volcanic ruption .
stromboli , italy 
the capsule of the dead volcano broke under a tremendous explosion .
rcks of extraordinary size are being spewed out into the sea .
dammi una mano .
piano .
piano .
ecco .
hans says ...
alec was thrown frm the altar stone ... long before we hit the water .
non si preoccpi .
i 'm most gratful , ladies , but my immediate need is not a ladder .
pantaloons .
pantaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech 
fellow scots , if these shous of yours express some pleasure that we 've returned alie , i thank you deeply .
however , if they 're meat as paie for a successfl scientist ,
i ust disclaim that onor .
a scientist who can not prove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
i have no records , no hred of evidece .
i will never embarrass this distingushed university by asking that t take my word .
this , i know :
the spirit of man can not be stopped .
splendid , oliver .
profesor , here 's someone who wants to say goodbye .
hans , old friend .
id you get your njries when the volcano blew up , in the hot lava ?
he was in such a hurry leaving the church , he fell all the way down the steps .
after all that waiting .
it 's been no marriage for you at l .
you underestimat alec 
i 'm taking the night train to london an then back to stockholm .
stockholm ?
but you ave a job to do here in edinburgh .
i intend to write my memors .
what you eed is a widow who can jog your mory and take dictation .
no , none of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend one 's days and nights with a man under the earh , another under on roo in scotland .
what did i ay ?
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
frau goetaborg !

i 've gon through life so far s charlie boyle
and it is n't any sleigh ride .
who thought he , i was cool .
me .
that has never , ever happene to me before .
ever .
and i 'm going back .
ok .
charle , i 'm not your dad .
good .
right .
science 
one kid evn gave me his lunch mony
always have .
oh , look , i got this one from a street fight .
look at tha .
i got an appendix sca .
bear , bear ...
listen , it 's no the scar , all right ?
ok , girls , if you think that was something .
personal record .
well , the skeleton lcture sounded awful interesting ,
so i thought i 'd vary my rouine a little .
class :
park i , mr. anthony ,
and lose the blades .
catch you later , claire .
teacher :
all right , everyone , settle down .
and chaz anthony 's not .
honor society girls never like honor society guys .
trust me on this one .
sounds like a risky game plan to me .
and now i 'm enacting a strategy
just like any good psy --
of course , alone , it 's not much good .
to actually move .
thank you .
now , how many bones do you think are in you feet ?
big finsh .
i just wish you 'd use your powers for good , ot evl .
what are you talking about ?
ere are geniuses your age , you know .
i was talking to a colleague ove at northern .
he was telling me about a young man --
who was it that helped you ?
like i said , some loser in science club .
now , who wants to come up here
and finish charting these points on the polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter iron .
with a crude caricature
you know ...
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have become openly hostile .
not to mention the dorm food .
well , the only fatherly advice i can give you about the science stuff
is just keep plugging away .
a tutor !
dad , you 're a genius !
genius ?
my first f .
your first f .
what am i saying ?
but why are you so happy about getting your first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i guess they 're gon na kick me out of school
if i do n't get better gades .
and i would care because ...
you 're prety o .
ca n't you find anyone else ?
i mean , well , you were the first one on my list .
mayb we could work something out .
then i guess i should start practicing 
oh , great .
just what i want to d after school ,
more school .
take it .
fine .
ho nothing lasts forever
well , they 're wrog
yeah
you stood strong
you 've got the key to my hear
'cause i
t seems so long ago
when my world was upside-down
hey , nice ...
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you know , just to say thanks nd all .
that 's good , is n't that 
i mean , that 's what we 're supposed to be litening to  right ?
thank you .
hey , so , hat 's wth the museum ?
he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey , daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ..
i 'm just going to ge my things here .
haz ?
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i would have loved to have seen coach addison 's face .
i 'm glad he did n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over with claire , too .
that was 20 mles of rugh road on the apology turnpike .
hey , oc ?
you ever hve a gilfriend ?
yeah , sue .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it , charlie .
and still , there 's no sign of a graviton .
well , maybe if we take our minds off it ,
you know , if we sit back , relax ,
and , uh , have a little fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
wenever he had a problem that he could n't solve ,
eurea !
come o , dance ith me .
oh , no , i do n't think so .
uh , you o n't want to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any different .
nly as  particle up until now .
we can just as easily think of it as a wave .
you said so in your book .
microwave conflict .
how could i miss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
set up a phased harmonic ,
affected the nuclear matrix ,
in other words , groovy little hose beat
just unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
we did it , charle !
this is big !
we found the gravitn .
oh , man !
can we do t later thugh ?
i 'm kind of late for science class .
mabe you just had a god tutor .
but you are going to meet one .
i got to thiking it might be good for you to meet a kid your age
who 's not ashaed of being smart .
he can probably use some one-on-one
with a kid who 's not ashamed to kick his butt .
class :
yes , well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arrangd a field trip today to northern .
doc !
doc !
i got to show you something really cool .
h .
oh , what ?
what am i going to do ?
wait .
wait , wait , wit , wait .
6 shades of purple ?
thank you vry much .
thank you and welcome .
the youngest particle physicst
a terrible lab accident has lft young mr. boyle
temporarily disfigured .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agreed o come out and talk to you anyway ,
mr. charlie boyle .
charlie ?
charlie , in gravely vice :
thank you , fellow teens .
will eventuall subside .
since i am in obvious discomfort ,
i will now ake my leave and let professor kricktein
well , uh ...
psst !
ust talk amongst yourselves .
wha ?
how do i get the purple stuff off my face ?
it 's tarting to burn .
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is -- is pretty muc like the universe --
i got ta go pay the water bill .
xcus me .
krickstein :
chaz ?
this is a very valuable clue as thymine is changed to uracil .
uh , here at the unversity , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i wanted to meet charlie boyle .
from the head of the anthropology --
and schedle another feld trip .
i 'm sure i an convince charlie to com back .
what are you doing to me ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
what are you dong ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
k .

he 's fine , he 's fine .
really .
you kids do your omework .
bye .
i decided to move my stuff back in .
i need some help .
you ...
with what ?
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
you have everythin .
i could say the same about you .
women , poise ...
women .
losing my scholarship ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bd trade-off .
yeah , right .
look , i want more than that out of life , charlie .
what 's her name ?
s-shut up .
listen to me .
everything you 've learned --

hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game 
'cause half the people up there think i 'm a genius ,
and the the other haf think i 'm a puk .
hey , i 'm oing to use the paticle accelerator while you 're gone .
might as well get some work in ,
as long as i 'm stuck down here .
mi particle accelertor es su particle accelerato .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle acceleratr .
and i wanted to say thanks or passing me .
hey , you have nobody to thank but yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's from me an the guys .
hey  good luck today .
so rumson 's goin ' dow .

i do n't know of any way to defend aganst it .
 might .
go home !
to the conference championshi game ,
boy :
come on , dude .
all right , now the 3 to wory about are stoker ,
now cross will usully distract the referee here ,
while stoker and ryder rack our best player ,
which is me .

that 's chaz .
he wore your golden goalie ma --
claire , let me explain .
explain ?
just what was all of this ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a study of the lcal culture ?
then i gues you wer just having a laugh at my expense .
imagine  me thinking i could teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fat liar .
i also left the particle accelerator on 
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
annoucer :
do not venture onto he ice !
get off the ice !
this game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and we ere this close .

formerly known as cha .
claire :
come on , guys .
what are you reading ?
breakaway .
i love breakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron finds , uh , subatomic particles
and how they 're connected to a ysterious quantum force .
o , yeah .
but you know something ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 
swiss scientists were able to spli a photon ,
and even though the particles ae 6 miles apart ,
whatevr one does , the other one does
cool !
and maybe unlock the secret as to how it works .
and then ...
defy gravity .
let 's get to work .
and the output level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antigravity halves .
why the rubber coating ?
they all act like superballs .
and when i press this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i can make amends
well , with what we just discovered ,
i figured out a way to hlp northern beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can eep his job ,
and my frieds 'll be happy with me again ,
nd maybe ...
claire might like me again , too .
a little .
yo have n't let me down .
you saved me !
charlie , i could never have done this without you !
you 're my friend .
thanks , doc .
but i got ta go .

welcome to nothern arena !
thi is base ops .
video ?
roge that .
blades ?

roger that , ops .
video 's in place , ops .
roger , video .
hey , deion .
how 's it going ?
where 's blades ?
right here .
let 's jus hpe this works .
mike , you kno they 're comin ' after you .
first sign of touble , i 'm pullin ' you out !
you just try and do that !
for the re-scheduled central conference championship
how 's this supposed to work again ?
how is that possible ?
like he super balls i sowed you 
corresponding microchips wth othr graviton halves
whatever our skates do , their skates will e focd to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
ad i helped you get a c in cience .
you sure did a number on this lab .
na .
besides , i 've arranged his schedule o that he 'll be gone al day .
and he 's never here during hockey games .
lmot never .
this has one way too fr !
i told you i had to do what  had to do .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop right now .
yo know i 'm n your side

the chance to make up for all the selfish things i did ...
so please ...
chaz !
odie , tight up .
omar , you 're in !
mike , get off !
we got ta stop the rumsen rack .
deion , flip he switch .
take ...

yeah !
power play !
number 2 !
i 'm stoer .
you re ryder .
let s go !
whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leaving the box .
he 's out of control !
do something !
he 's hading staight for mike !
i ca n't find it !

aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !
hey .
whoa , we 're to light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reversed the charge of the ravitons !
they 're repelling against the positive charge of the earth !
game announcer :

ca n't we mark it rest in peace ?
not as long as scientist try to prove porpoises have brains rivaling man 's .
even superhuman .
and they think that he might be teaching them ?
tat 's right , lieutenant .
but admiral ...
is that a good likeness ?
perfect .
ys .
at least that 's the way he loked bfore ...
well , you know ...
how he was when ...
and this taken by one of our divrs .
is there ny doubt in your mind ?
no , that 's him .
skipper !
we have no choice , lieutenant .
orders from the very top .
they 're recalling him to active dty .
henry always lived in a world of his own 
thank you , miss barnes 
well , did you have your physical this mornng ?
i 'm afrad not .
really ?
no , my eyesight .
they do n't want my blood .
well , i hpe s .
and very healthy .
they may take her .
henry ?
yes , he is .
that 's nice .
they ejecte me .
rejected ?
do n't hang around that pet shop .
do 't be upset , miss barnes .
there s a fish n the water cooler .
hi , hen old boy !
george , good o see you .
do n't you look mportant ?
tat uniform and al those doodads on your sleeve .
just a couple of hash marks 
do n't apologie .
you look first-class to me , george .
what kind of a machine are you mated to ?
hey , bess !
time to take over .
lover-boy 's her .
hello  dear .
hello , henry .
i forgive yo , casanova .
george has liberty the whole weekend , and he wants o spend it with us .
the whole weekend ?
no , i missed te subway train , but i ...
washed out completely , i hear .
you ca n't win them all , george .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks for action , go dancing ?
feel like shaking a leg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
how many times must i tell ou , you do not rumba with your eyes !
now , do n't worry .
why do n't w go to the university for professo hofmeyer 's lecture ?
you know , he 's go na talk about the mating habis of the shellfish .
it 's a little risqué .
sort of for adults only , you know .
i 've got it !
why do n't e run out o coney island tomorrw morning ?
well , i do n't kow ...
i hate to miss that lecture , but i do like the water .
water and fish .
look at him .
always draing into his sell , going off into his fish world !
george , come here .
the what ?
devonian period of the paleooic era .
you know , it folowed the silurian and preceded the carboniferou eras .
i 've given it a lot of thought .
a lot of thought .
maybe go in fr parakeet .
he 's read many books on he subject .
he claims yars ago there was nothing but fish in te world .
the some o those creatures became ampibian they crawled out on land .
hope for what , henry ?
wit the war in europe and new weaons being invented what if men were oolish nough to destroy themselves ?
then the fish would develop into a new race of men and this time they might turn out better .
fish have a better life than people .
the water !
wht a mess !
you are floating yourself out of your hom with tis hbby !
i 'm gon na run down to the stoe an get a regulator for the intake hose .
you mean gt rid of them ?
but bessie !
either those fish go or i do !
which is it to be ?
who looked urt ?
my fish .
for once .
i left out the most exciting details .
see , i do n't like to rag but , i tell yu , that one morning ..
it was at night , was n't it ?
right .
good memory .
we went out with me in the engine room ...
i thoght you were on the bridge with the dmiral ?
the uss elias j. starbright , s n't it ?
i can tell you this , though .
there are so many nazi subs below the surface you could walk to europe .
the ocean 's jumping with u-boats read to go if uncle sam gets in the fight .
i do n't want to start a panic , so you keep all this under your hat , right ?
riht , besse ?
old boy , did i ever tell you about the caribbean ?
what a libery we had in a port near trinidad !
and miam .
did you ever do the rumba , henry ?
n , i hve falty equilibrium .
es , sir .
join the navy ad hae a whirl !
barbados , kinston , the vrgin islands !
lunch is amost ready .
come along , henry !
more han anything , i wish i could be one of you right now .
i wish i were a fish .
henry !
save him !
what will we do ?
get some hep !
call the lifegards !
get the police !
police !
help !
come on .
it 's all over .
he does n't even know hw to swim .
he does n't know how to swim !
what ' go na happen to oor bessie ?

all riht , folk , back up , please .
let us trogh .
and i thought it all would be so beautiful .
wish i ere home with bessie .

now , hoist your tail and get !
why , o 're a splendid specimn of a pagurus pollicaris .
i 'm glad to meet you , crusty .
hey !
i do n't wan na iht !
let that be a lesson to yo  you confouded , four-eyed ...
say , what are you , anyway ?

shark !
jumping jellyfish !
just swing about and let that shark chase you full speed away from ere !
did that come out of me ?
huricane !
stand by for a blow !
that belch of yours could capsie me in the backwash .

if only i cold help .
come on , let 's shove of .
gangway , get me out of here !

now shall we go ?
i 'd sure like ...
well , that is to say ...

sources say the president will ask ongress ...
our country at war ?
look , flatbush , if you 're in trouble , you can count on me .
if you 'd stay hee and look out for ladyfish , i 'd be grateful .

ship ahoy !
do n't be alarmed .
please do n't !
are you on a raft ?
i 'm a fish 
ahoy there !
what are you doing ?
why did n't you idntify it ?
give the recognition signal !
give the recognition signal !
i fell in the ocean and was drowne .
only i was n't drowned , exactly .
give the recognition signal !
commence firing !
commence firing !
acivate sonar dome .
you missed e su .
left standard rudder .
he old mn should hear this .
pipe it to the bridge !
ll engines ahead full , left standard rudder ?
400 yards straight ahead .
a direct hit .
could be a nazi trick .

i 'l never leave you , and i hope yu 'll never leave me .

in that case , there might be more before long .
there , that 's my wife .
not much to look at , is she ?
let 's get this over with , limpet .
hello , bessie .
henry , is that you ?
do n't you recognie me , bessie ?
henry , you really are ...
a fish ?
yes , bessie , you can say it .
to think yu 're actually still alive , and i 'm married to a ...
a fish .
is that so terrible ?
it does n't appen every day .
well , what 's new ?
i mean , ow have you been , bessie ?
i 'm bewildered , henry .
henry , am i the widow of a man or the wife of a fish ?
let 's be logical .
you could n't keep me in a tub , oud ou ?
i mean , what woul the nighors say ?
i shdder to think .
why ..
oh , good heavens .
if you nly knew , bessie .
i guess this is goodbye , henr .
if you 'll come up to the steps , i have something for you .
remember how you catch cold when you get your feet wet .
do n't break up , bessie .
maybe i was meant to be a fish .
maybe nature just corrected her error .
goodbye , bessie .
goodbye , henry .
goodbye , henry , i said .
i thought hat was it .
bessie and i ave been happy .
the cief of naval operations ordered it .
do they really think that henry is teaching porpoises ?

isaburo ssahara of the escort group has tested it .
that 's enogh for me .
i 'll tell the chamberlain you both approve .
 'd rather see you two duel than merely test swords .
there are rumor in our can .
the reason you do n't fight is because it would hurt the family of the loser .
perhaps protecting your family name ather than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to gt aong in this world .
isaburo , you 're to attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
i married into my wife 's family and have been henpecked for 20 years .
would ou like to look at the november border record ?
no , not if nothing unusual happened .
mking rice cakes in november
but there are no customer
the god who came down in february and brougt the rice hrvest departs tomorrow untl hs return next year .
do yo really believe that ?
no ,  was just
perhaps you want a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is the problem .
it mut be someone she approves of .
someone strong , loving and faithful .
is hat the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were pobably idly chatting away to asan about useless things like martial arts again .
to have the steward honor us with a visit has never happend in the sasahara family .
the truth is , isaburo 
lady ichi has been dismissed from the castle .
it has bee decided to have her marry yogor , your son .
steward , why was ady ichi dismissed ?
 'll return for an answer in a few days .
why should we accept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa to rest .
the daughter of gohe yamagiwa , the man in charge of he castle wardrobe , was sering beside him .
lady ichi lost her head on seeing this .
he sprang at lady tama , slapped he face , and drgged her by the hair .
how can w aept her ?
i think we should gratefully ccept her without being difficult .
no matter what you say , we must accept he .
it ' an order from our lord .
i ' afraid ...
i do n't feel very enthusiastic about it .
nither do i .
but if i refuse , there may be trouble later .
yogoro has said nothing , but he would n't be happy marrying a lord 's mistress who has born a child .
i do n' want him to repeat my mistake .
hey said you 'd be t the border .
i hear everything .
the stewar and chamberlain are good judgs .
alert even in times of peace .
but , isaburo .. as for the marriage and other matters ,
i suggest you keep things quiet .
you 'll probbly receive a larger fief .
so be modest abot it or the others will think you 're showing of .
a happy event .
he 's not thining of you or your family .
will you draw on your secret pinciples of swordplay ?
but at the last moment , you skillfully switch from defnse to offense .
yet you never attack .
you wait until your opponent tires .
unworthy ?
yes .
we can not accept our lord 's favored lady .
there 's no need to be so reserved .
it 's happned before , not just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decline the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will not be allowed .
it is our lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wish .
it 's an order !
to decline is to defy the order !
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree to it ?
i wish to accept the honor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn .
may you enjoy long lfe together
we 'll all be at your side as long as you live
ths is a day f celebration
keep hat in mind .
no .
a woman ho was dismissed after bearing a child 
i 'm sorry i did n't notice you return .
mother took her along for prayer at shonenji temple .
she kindly teaches me domestic duties .
i o n't believe it .
father ?
but depite that , he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes , right away .
yo must n't .
the world never seems to go right .
i wish to retire and have yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
 'm very sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but his son has married , so
so isabro saahara 's retiing at last ?
i did n't realize it at the time , but it 's a great relief .
i wonder wha i 've done all my lif , though it ' not like me to do so .
yogoro 's marriage is a very happy one .
fear often exceeds the perceived danger .
so it was in your case .
yogoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just the same s before , but ichi is always pleasan and never talks back .
why did se attck our lord then ?
like yourself , i do n't understand it either .
check the weapons in the armory against the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appointed days .
i do n't say to alwys yield to hem , but at times , the 're unrasonable .
rice cakes ?
enjoy .
wait , ichi .
i 'm going to retire sn .
yogoro will become the head of our family , and you 're his wife .
you need n't hold back for the old oman .
take over the houshold duties .
understand ?
even so , she is my mother , and i will treat her a such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i d n't understand .
that she 'd grasp her lord by hi clothing .
it was hrd for me to believe too , so i asked her the other ay .
it was the year before ast .
ichi .
accept the honor gratefully .
i was more angr thn srprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
our lord does not do this just to satisfy a whm .
daimyo must have heirs or teir hoses will be abolised .
the only heir to our lor right now is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ichi , not just anyone can become ou lord 's mistress , for her son may one day become our lord 's heir .
she must be beautiful and ind like you .
you are referring to sannojo asai , your fiancé ?
kasai ?
yes .
our parents aranged our engagement .
then if sannojo agrees , you wil gratefully agree to serve our lord ?
what do you ay ?
but he bowed to or lrd 's wishes and gve you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you said you would serv our lord if sannoj agreed .
he has clearly agreed to t .
as summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ici is her in answer to your wishes .
then i thought
no , it was more like a prayer .
i would bear him sons .
any , many sons .
then other girls need ever know my misery .
it would end with me .
it was lik a prayer .
my thoughts were realy ike a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year latr .
then i went to a spa for postatal rest at my lord 's rders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i could never have ound a better wife .
beginning tonight ,
what ?
our lord means nothing to me .
i hav been so worried about the son  bore .
so worried .
i will forget about him too .
i wil forget him .
yogor , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wit nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would hae been better .
and what 's her name ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brains ver his and named her tmi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so ic is birth mother to the heir .
if she remains the wife of a vassal , there would be muc talk .
you say this s our lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for yogoro t submit a request to our lord nd say he will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he rfuses .
naturaly .
well , i do n't blme him .
but you know very well ... that we ca n't have all our wishes granted in this world .
group hea kotani came ovr in he afternon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is callg you .
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , i must tell you something .
come into the rom .
first  father 's words .
he says he 's retired  so i am the family head , nd i am to do what i think is right .
however , he also says you 're too important to u to send away .
that we must take the best possible care of you .
i must tell her soer or later .
do 't worry .
no matter what anyone says ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
chi is not a doll .
yes  you 're right .
but you ca n't reason with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo , what 's your opinion ?
it 's all up to hm .
what is it ?
i 'd like him to come agai now and explain in his words why we must return er .
when his son 's mother proves inconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasnable .
e has no undrsanding of huan emoions .
kotani-san , our family did n't accept ichi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi heself know yogoro or the sasahara family .
se was none too happy about it either .
but the reason they are getting along is because they 're kind to each other and care for each other .
what ?
even if the heavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think this is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give u omi an return to the castle ?
would you run our family because you 've lost your head over a woman ?
i this case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you wee me , would you return ichi ?
of course i would !
restrain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the head of the family .
right or wrong  it 's all up to him .
if you love yogoro and tomi  be prepared to defy such sneless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are a wf worth protecting , ven if that mens ruining our family .
i am not worthy of it .
but this wo n't be the end of it .
i gave her the message .
she will be here son .
ove her , sister .
we 've heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it 
do yo want to stay with yogoro , even if it means ruining the sasahara family ?
i would like to stay .
even if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiom , has asked our lord that you be sent back to the castle as soon as possible .
 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the casle to plead with him to send you back .
he 's done this several times .
father is father .
i am me .
i would rather die than eturn .
please tell the chamberlains and seward how i feel n whatever words yu tink wil best help my case .
we ask you again , ich !
the family does n't mater ?
not only the sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeoprdized as well .
i ca not be helped .
i see .
there 's no use trying to convince a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's your misforune that a woman like her has favoed you .
return .
return to the castle .
why do you sy that now ?
what 's the ashara family to you ?
listen to me .
in othe words , i 'm a worthless , good-for-nothing man .
so in order to prove myself , or these pas 20 years
i have fought to preserve our good name and social standing .
the cruel injustice involved , for one thig .
but your bautiful love for eac ther has touched me most o all .
there s never been a shred of love in my married life !
no matter what happens , never leave him !
my husband 's with the chamberlain ?
yes , and he 's waiting for you to come .
i saw him in the castle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you both .
he ha some questions for ou .
you need n't worry .
i wil ccmpany you .
if you lose heart nw , what will it ean for my brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything new at the castle ?
no , nothig yet .
i hpe nothing happens .
he went out .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ch ?
bunzo , you tricked her .
no matter how many times  'm told ,
i 'm going home .
ihi  take my advice an return to the casle 
if ou go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain is wiling to overlook everythin .
but if you insist on returning home , not only will yogoro , but also his father , isaburo , be ordered t commit seppuku for lax supervision of their home .
honorable lady ichi , please return to the castle .
es .
my name is kiku .
the chamberlain 's orders ?
what orders ?
go home !
but ... if i go home without
say no more !
but
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool .
yogoro 
but he did request time off due to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid woman .
ten everything 's all over ?
yes .
we just took a roundabout path .
defyin the clan gets us nowhere .
isaburo  do you rally mean that ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on this matter .
to e honest , the clan 's treatment of our fmily and your attitde in response have weighed on my mind .
weihed on your mind ?
it 's like your swordplay .
pushed , you step back .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
it was more lke force .
in fact , it was more like kidnapi .
if te shogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal mistake or the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow them to end here .
ou 're saying i must formally ask the castle to ake her back ?
yet i must ask them to take her back ?
it was wise of you to hold bak .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed by your retraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remember sending he back to the castle .
why do n't you do as he sas ?
that 's ridiculou , fathr !
never !
she suppressed her tears , left everything behind , and uietly returned to the castle .
now , now , yogoro 
in any cae , please go for now .
yogoro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will report today and say he wishes to return her ?
that 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
since it would have come to ths nyway , how dare they cause all that fuss !
yogoro was wrong , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he 's always henpecked by his wife .
and defying clan orders like that
 mut say he seems like a different man .
his conduct has been admirabe .
it calls for a sight increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the escort group has arrived !
i 'm gld you 've reportd for dut .
yes , completely well .
taking into consideration my father 's wishes , i have decided .
please accept this .
that ' good of you .
thank you .
fool !
petition .
this is the cruelest form of tyranny .
it runs couter to the laws of humanity and can not be condoned by the heavens .
we hereby appeal for her immediate return .
someone may use my father 's name or my own to submit a request to return ich to the casle .
but it will not be from us .
please keep that in mind .
thank you fr coming every day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at tmes like these .
so ur feet wo n't lip in the blood .
this ma be the last time .
will you do me a favor ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach 
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accept obediently !
i said orders from our lord !
will you not obey 
let 's hear what the orders are .
oders !
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolent conduc an defiance toward our lord , you are ordeed to comit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of our lod to pemit it .
i thought men would come arrest us and then either hang or cruify us .
faher .
however , we ant something before we kill ourselves .
bring us three heds !
those of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler of the aizu doain ,
chamberlain yanase , ad steward takahashi .
ring me the heads of the villains who took my on 's wife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear you are
isaburo 's only equal s a swordsman .
if you think he 's too muh for you , take four or five strong men wth you .
re they not now riminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of borer gats .
this is no time to discuss jurisdiction .
you 're wrong .
if you order me to kill the , please promote me to superintndent here and now and obtain our lord 's romise to increase my fief to 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so fomal now ?
never mind .
go !
we must ather men , use forc and kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsman without peer .
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's aone .
it 's bunzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu 's plae ?
listen t the festival rums .
father !
you were pressed by our relaives at kenmotsu 's place o come here as their messeger and say ,
we 've defied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
but remember :
each must live his own lif .
as for what happened ,
each must live his own life .
and tell everyone this for me :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doing ?
what if oher clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather some men and take care of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervention would aggravate matters .
father , the drum from the suwa srine hs stopped .
it 's lte .
i remember it too .
outside he castle , it was the inok fstival , whn the harves god left .
inside the castle , it was the day befoe the suwa shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that 's as it should be .
it 's not unmanly at all .
but yogoro , do n't be too worried about chi .
we will die here , but she is the moher of our lord 's heir .
no one can orture her , and no one will edanger her life .
but father , are n't they late in comng ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter , but the gate was open , so i came in .
i will now convey r lord 's orders .
we have heard of the ordr to commit sepuku 
he changed his orders .
isaburo and yogoro sasahaa , for your insolence and attitude toward our lord , you will be confined at enshoji temple outide the castle .
why the sudden change ?
will you gratefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 's wrong !
it was not as the heir 's other .
i am still the wife of ogoro asahara .
but our lord rceived  in his udience .
i do n't undrstand wat this s all about .
steward , it seem we do n't understand what you just old us .
if you two admit that ichi is no longer a famly member and that she has been returned , our lord will listen to her plea for a lighter puishment .
will you acknowledge her return and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared for the worst .
then there is no alternative ?
please return her at once 
i 'll ask lady ichi now .
or will you let their puruers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , he sasaharas ar men .
you have already returned to erve our lord .
if you tell them that you sever your tis wth them once and for all , then all will be well !
if you do , their lives will be saved .
we need no ask them to return you .
wait !
do n' move !
do n't move .
lad ichi , will you sever your ties with them and save their lives ?
or will ou let them de as traitors ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ichi , dos your silence mean you will do as i say ?
am i correct ?
no .
i
father ...
tomi , bd your father and mother farewell .
have a ood look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us who are still alive lsten to them 
let 's listen to what they want us to do .
n  i know without being told .
they want us to tell the world of our clan 's cruelty !
very wl .
i understand .
we promise to do that for you .
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestal !
first , tomi and i will go to ed together and see he shogunate elders 
we 'll lave immediately for edo .
tomi and i are going to edo .
if this is for the clan , show me your pass .
if it s private business , show me the clan ticket .
i have neither .
then i 'm afrid  can not let you pass .
you mean to pass from this domain without having either ?
i must fobid it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quiet .
i 'd like to put her in the house away from the wind .
but men we dislike are in there .
venomous men .
i fed her before dawn .
i do n't think she 's hungry .
we 'll make do with this .
you be quit now , toi .
do n't cry even if i do n' return .
let me remain .
it 's better that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
 .
no matter ow strong ou are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ...
without fail .
i will win without fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance of winning .
take tomi with you o edo .
we ca n't go to eo anymore .
no one will ever know the story of your father and mother now .
just one word .
when you grow up , become a woman just like your mother .
be sure to do that .

us
psdh
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun tkes 225 million years to go around the galax ce
the inosaur era lasted 180 millin years .
this is a comet .
i 's all ice and roc .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for the earth ... fas .
but this is n't the erth that we know , not really .
at thi time the masters of the earth are dinosaurs .
this is patagoia .
a vast region of argentinean south america as it is today .
and ther was only one immense ocean ,
we are north of the south american plate , in the sea that ill grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
etreme forms of life also appeaed on land during the dinosaur era .
in many places there , one wals today on the ery ground thee giants walked upon a 100 million years ago .
this phenomenon sees to depend on another peculiar twist of evolution .
regions that produce great dinosurs also tend to produce great palaeontologists .
many doctoral students com to pursue their esearch .
sometimes younger people , like my daughter ludmila , just come to satisfy their curiosity .
i love talking about dinosars with everyone , whether they are exprts or not .
it 's a busy life , and it would have been plenty for most people , but early in my career new horizons opened up for me .
things became muh largr than ife .
a rancher hd stumbled upon a surprisigly large bone .
after several digging seasons we ended up facing the largst dinosaur ever found .
we named it argentinosauus
ths discovery have a profound effect , n the way we lok at suth ameicn dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a big place in my lif to say the leas .
ye it starts its life in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit .
predators and hazards abound .
oly a few will reac adulthood .
it cover more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 million year ld .
we believe that it was chosen as a nesting site by generation upon generation of these dinoaurs .
the nests are so cose together , that the females could not walk between them .
it was warmer than today .
a great part of the dinosur era , there were no broad leaf tree and no flower bearing plants .
during the dinosaur ra there is no arcti ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
for tens of millions of years seasons barely changed .
the water of the ocean is also much wrmer .
hurricanes are frequent .
the magnetic poles changes position ontinuously .
professor oria has contributed to the discovery of more than a dozen of new dinosaurs .
as a cientist , he insists that each new find is importat , no matter how big or small .
and sometimes he says what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hands .
i like to think that  am lucky , just inredibly lucky .
many paleonological discoveies are not made by prfessionals .
that 's what happened with the argentinosaurus , and i happened again with yet another inosaur .
they were relatively big , so at first , we thought that tey belonged to a herbivore , beause in general tes dinosaurs tend to be larger .
but istead , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a very large on .
professor coria 's team had unveiled a first species of a grup o ferce predators called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in this group surpasse the famous t. rex in terms of size .
although rare for repties , caring for the young has be observed among crocodile for instance .
in dinosaurs , this caring behavor evolve enough to remind us of birs .
this baby female is named long tooth .
however small and vlnerable , and cute she may appear now she is genetically programmed to rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like her mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and the largest predator , living at roughly the same period and n the same territry .
there is no easy nswer .
evoluion followed a number f particular paths .
bu a sipler interpretation rest on a warm climat and the fertile land , with all the vegetatio you can eat .
yet another theory tells us that large herbivores had to grow big enough , to acommodate a large stomach required to digst high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finaly , large spans of flat space could have led naturally to argntinosaurus , as the vast seas have le to whales .
the highest branches belong to those who can reach them , and many predators are too small to be threatening in those situation .
she is growing fast too .
her primitive feathers have almost all disapeared .
they thrived for 180 million years .
this is  messag for us here .
by the way , t is more than time to introduce sharp featers .
he is unelagia , a 6 foot , 50 pound mae raptor .
he is related to birds , as are to some extent velociraptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need space .
this is the carmen fune museum , which also happens to be my second home .
sometimes as a joke e say that it is a scienc filled with holes .
we av nly found about 700 species of dinosaurs on the whole planet .
this is n't many for a reign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percnt of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , most of them in the last 30 ears .
through technology our knowldge grows faster every day .
fossilisation is a proces hat requres extremely rare conditions , and even then very little of an organism is preserved .
we could easily conclude that a tremendous number of species just disappeared without a race .
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you also need to be very careful before proposing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish i could travel in time to see thes amazing creatures alive .
strong one has rached maturity .
for many scientists he is at full size .
he s 20-year-old , and is at the beginning of more than  century of life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , if they were alone or in a grup , if they were wanderng , unting , or being hunted
the pattern clealy show association between contemporary species , and this is very rare .
his work is intimatly linked to nature , its intimately varied terrain and ever changing climate .
so there were hardships , but there are moments , sometimes when science just blend with the pue bliss of being outside and wonderful places .
you just look around .
but fnding required a trained ee .
with time yu realise that the number of questions grows faster than te number of answers .
again , like many times before ,
a good hint and an answer came unexpectedly .
in fact , we did n't fid just one specimen but a chamber of bones beoning to at least seven indiiduals .
for me , and my caadian colleague phil curry this was pointing at something we had considered , but have no evience for until then .
so long truth belongs to his new species of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , she is fully grown .
strong on is unknowingly in a critical time .
tearing off pieces of skin and letting the large rey bee to death , or die from infection is a strtegy more likel o succeed .
giganotosaurus could wait days ven weeks between meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep on drifting , the earth begins to resemble more what it is oday .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
nature neer stops changing .
we are in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolution gave it nthing to survive the impending dramatic events .
several factors could have contributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mammals became bigger and more cmpetitive .
drifting isolated continents uched each othe .
new rvalries appeared .
new dseases spread .
the climate was growing colder , possibly because of increased volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable n many places .
veetation suffered from the acid rain and also from the darkened and dust-filled skies .
but still , many dinosaurs made i through for  little while longer .
it covers the distance rom the moon to the earth n two hours .
all the forest of north and south america are destroyd by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the animals that suffered mos .
in a relatively short time , dinosurs become history .
not all the inosaurs disppear .
if they have n't become extinct maybe we just would n't b her .
more discoveries await me here perhaps but as i move forward in life ,
and the best food in paris , some say , is made by chef auguste gusteau .
gusteau 's restaurant is te tast of paris , boked five months in advance .
he is the yungest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but not everyone celbrates its success .
what 's even more amusing is that gusteau actually eems to believe it .
i , on the other hand , take cooking seriously .
this is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethin my life a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all tha ?
tis is emile , my bother .
he 's easily impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impresse .
he also happens to be the leader of our clan .
so , what 's wrong with having highly eveloped enses ?
what 's going on here ?
suddenly , ad did n't think my talent was useless .
clean .
cleanerific .
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad proud .
now , do n't ou feel better , rmy ?
you 've helped a noble cause .
we 're thieves , dd .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't steling f no one wants it .
if no one wants it , why are we stealng it ?
bu to my dad ...
you get picky about what you pu in the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up and eat your garbage .
secondly , stay out of the kitchen nd away from the humans .
it 's dangerous .
thy discover , they create .
how can i describe it ?
goo food is like music you can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it .
h , gusteau was right .
oh , mmm , yeah .
eah flavor was totally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only one who knew about it was emile .
hey , emile .
emile .
come on , you 'e good at hiding food .
he des n't understand me , but i can be myel around him .
why are you walking like hat ?
i do n't want to constantly have to wash my paws .
did you ever thnk about how we walk on the same paws that we handle food with ?
ou ever think about what we put into our mouths ?
all he time .
but if dad sees you walking like that , he 's not goin to like it .
what have you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you foud cheese ?
an no just any cheese .
that would o beautifully with my mushroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundown o , you know , dad 's gon na ...
emile !
there are possibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep turning it .
that storm s getting closer .
hey , remy , you think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to taste this !
it 's got , like , this ba-boom , zap kind of taste .
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 's lightning-y !
we got to do that again .
okay , when the next storm comes  we 'll go up o the oof ...
i know what this needs 
saffron .
saffron .
do n't like it .
she 's on na wake up .
she turns on the cooking channel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been here a million times ?
gusteau swears by it .
okay .
who ' gusteau ?
just the greatest chef in the world .
wrote this cookbook .
you rea ?
and they have  which is why i read .
 do n't like secrets 
all this cooking an reading and tv-watching while we red and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's takng thos kids o long ?
ah , l'aquila saffon .
italian .
gusteau says it 's excellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love ...
frget mysique .
grea cookig is not for the faint of eart .
you must be imaginative , strong heated .
you must try things that may ot work .
and you must not le anyone define your limits because of where you come from .
anyone can cook .
but only te fearess can be great .
gustea 's restaurant lost one of its five stars after a scathing review by france 's top food critic , anton ego .
it was a severe blow to gusteau , and the brokenhearted chef died sortly afterwards , which , according to tradition , meant the loss of another star 
oh !
oh !
oh !
run !
no , you 'll lead her to the colony !

solène leclaire .

someon is asing about your soup .
hat are you playing at ?
am i still fired ?
you ca n't fire him .
what ?
if she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook responsible ...
he 's a garbag boy .
how can we claim t represent the name f gusteau if we do nt uphold his most cherished belief ?
he has taken a bold risk and e should reward that , as chef gsteau woud have .
oh , yeah .
you will make the soup again , and this time , i 'll be paying attention .
very close attention .
they think you might be a cook .
ut you know what i think , linguini ?
get th rat .
what should i d now ?
kill it .
no , not in the kitchen .
they 'd close us down 
take it away fro here .
kill it .
go !
do n't look at me like that !
they expect me to cook it again !
i mean , i 'm not ambitious .
 was just trying to stay out of roubl .
you 're the one who was getting fany with the spices !
what did you trow in there ?
oregano ?
i eed this job 
i 've lost so many .
did you nod ?
have you been nodding ?
so i 'm not crazy !
wait a second , wait a second .
you can , right ?
loo , do n't be so modest .
you 're a rat , for pete 's sake .
whatever you did , hey liked it 
do you think you could do it again ?
right ?
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not much , but it 's , you know ...
there 's heat and light and a couch with a tv .
the best kid of dream .
one we can share .
but why here ?
why now ?

that s what i get for trusting a ...
hi .
is that for me ?
look , it 's deliciou .
but do n't steal .
i ll buy some spices , okay ?
and on the first day !
though i , like many other critic ,
had written off gusteau as irrelevant since the great chf 's death ,
the soup was a revelation .
olène leclaire ?
against all odds , gusteau 's has recaptured our attention .
only time will tell if they deerve it .
well ...
you know .
welcome to hell .
now , recrate the soup .
take s much time as you need .
soup .
you litte ...
you son of  ...
something that does n't involve any biting , or nipping , or running up and down my body with your little ra feet .
the biing !
scampering !
no !
no scamering or scurrying .
littl chef ?
oh , you 're hungry .
okay .
o let 's think this out .
we eed to work out a system so that i do what you want in a way that does n't look like i 'm being controlle by a tiny rat chef .
would you listen to me ?
i 'm insane !
i 'm insane !
i will never pull this off !
linguini ?
we got ta communicate .
i saw it !
a rat ?
yes , a rat .
what are you doing in her ?
get out .

that 's strangey involuntary !
ne look and i knew we had the same crazy idea .
okay .
huh ?
where are you taking me ?
i 'm sorry .
whoa !
mm-hmm ...
okay .
whoa !
whoa !
à votre santé !
all right .
mmm .

rattouille .

if you 're going to name a food , you should give it a name that sounds delicius .
ratatouille doe nt sound delicius .
it sounds like at ad patootie .
at patootie .
which does not sound delicious .
and finding someone to replace you for poison checker hs ben a disaster .
nothing 's been poisoned , thank god , but it has n't bee easy .
i am sorry  dad .
why i that ?

we 're rats .
we make them bigger .
i 'm tired of taking .
i want to make things .
oh , yeah ?
what makes you so sure ?
i 'v been able to observe them  a close-ish sort of range .
yeah ?
how close ?
close enough .
and they 're , you know , not so bad as you say the are .
come with me .
i gt something i want you to see .
you want me to stay and clean ?
is that a problem ?
no .
good boy .
w 're here .
the world we live in belongs to the eem .

i mean , i would n't have done that .
i would 've followd the recipe .

i have this ...
little ...
a tiny chef ?
yes .
he 's ...
he 's up here .
here we go .
you inspire me .
i 'm going o risk looking like the biggest idiot psycho you 've ever seen .
ou want to know why i 'm such a fast learner ?
do n't laugh !
no !
no !
what is it , ambrister ?
guteau 's .
more financial trouble ?
no , it 's ...
announced a new line of microwave egg rolls ?
what ?
i said , gusteau has fially found his rightful place in history
right alongside anothe equally famos chef ,
touché .
that was my last word .
te last word .
then tell me , ambrister , how could it be popular ?
the dna matches , the timing works , everything cecks out .
this ca n't just happen !
the whole thing is a setup !
the boy knows 
lo at him out there , pretending to be an idiot .
string ?
pying dumb .
taunting e with that rat .
deliberately trying to make m think it 's imprtant .
the rat .

if i fire him now , everyne will wonder why .
is 't it good to have th press ?
is n't it good to ave gusteau 's name gtting headlines ?

something 's stuck in my teeth .
health inspector .

you are monsiur liguini ?
hello .
pardon me for interrupting your premature celebatin , but i thught it only fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game .
game ?
yes .
and you 've been playing wihout an pponent .
whih is , as you may have guessed , against the rules .
you 're aton ego .
if i do n't love it , i do n't swallow .
listen , we hate to be rude , but we 're french , and it 's dinnertime .
do n't give me that look .
you were distracting me in front of the press .
how am i supposed to concentrate with you yanking on my hair all the time ?
yur opinion is n't the only one that mattes hre .
all right , that 's it !
yo take a break , little chef .
i 'm not your puppet , an you 're not my puppet-controlling guy !
you cool off and get your min right , little chef .
ego is coming , and i need to focus !

yeah .
this is great , so .
an inside job .
oof !
hey , litle chef .
then when you were n't there , i do n't know ...
it did n't seem right to leave things the way that we did , so ...
look , i do n't want to fight .
i 've been under a lot of , you know , presure .
i 'm suddenly a gusteau .
and i got to b a gusteau or , you know , people will be disappointed .
i hav n't been fair to you .
you 've never failed me , and i should never forget that .
you ve been a good friend .
the most honorable friend a guy could ever ask ...
what 's going on ?
hey ...
you 're ...
you 're stealing food ?
i tought yu were my friend !
i trusted you !
get out !
you and all your rat buddies !

i 've lost my appetite .
do you know what you would lik thi evening , sir ?

you are the boss .
attention , everyone .
tonight is a big nght .
i mean , ego .
the critic .
and he 's going to rder something .
just ca n't leave it alone , can you ?
it 's not safe .
i 'm hungry !

no , wai !
oh , no !
no , no !
you migh think you are a hef but you are still only a rat .

au revoir , rat !
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
yes , i think i do .
after reaing a lot of overheatd pufery about your new cook  you know what i 'm craving ?
a little perspective .
can yo suggest  good wine to go with that ?
very wel .
you proide the food , i 'll provide the perspective .
which would go nicely with a bottle of cheval blanc 1947 .
i m afraid i ..
tell hm to hit me with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i ve given u .
s you are .
oh , plese .
i retend you exist so i have soeone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here !
what the ...
dad !
where are you going ?
they 'll fail without me .
why do you care ?
becuse i 'm a cook !
it 's your recipe .
i did n't write it down .
it jus came to e .
because we ca n't serve this !
where 's my order ?
ca n't we serve something else ?
something i did n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell tem we 're all ot .
we just opene .
i have another dea .
what if we serve them what they order !
we will make it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the customers something .
then tell them ...
tell them ...
emy .
we 'r not talkng about me .
we 're alking about wht to do ight ...
remy !
get my knife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , ut ...
well , the truth sounds insane soetimes .
but that does n't man it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i have no talent at all .
but this rat , he 's the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding under m toque .
he 's been controlling my actions .
e 's the reason i can cook he food that 's exciting everyone .
i know it 's a hard thing to believe .
we can be the greatest restarat in paris , and this rat , this brilliant litte chef , can lead us thre .
wat do you say ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i c n't choose between two halves of yself .
i 'm not talking about cookin .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
yu tell us what to do , and we 'll get it done .
stop that health inspector !
delta team , go , go , go , go !
the rest of you stay and help remy .
tea three will be handling fish 
team four , roasted items .
team six , sauces .
get to your stations .
those handling food will walk on tw legs .
i 'm sorry for any delay , but we 're a little short tonight .
please , take all of the time you need .
make sure that steak is nie and tenderized .
easy with that sole meunière .
nly use the mimolette cheee .
compoe the salad ike you were painting a picture .
do n't let that beurre blanc separate .
genly poach the scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
god .
sorry .
just tell me what the rat wants to cook .
it 's  peasant dish .
i am making ratatouille .
tey must be joking .
mmm .
no , it c n't be .
i demand to know !
i asked a waiter to give my compliment to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight 
then who do i thank for the meal ?
you must be the hef ...
if you wish to met the chef , you wll have to wait until all the other customer have gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react beyond askig an occasiona question .
and when the story is done , ego stands , thanks s for the meal ...
we risk very little , yet enjoy a position over those who ffer up ther work nd their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , whic is fun o write and to read .
the world is often unkind to new talent , new ceation .
the new neds friends .
last night , i experienced something new , an extraodinary meal from a singularly unexpected source .
but i realize only now do i truly understand what he meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a great arist can come fom anywhere .
it is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the enius now cooking at gusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinin , nothing less than the finest chef in france .
i il be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
i wil be returing t gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a great night .
well , we had to let skinner and the health inspector loose , and of course they ratted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n't feel too bad for him .
he seems very happ .
how do you know ?
got to go .

i , who saved you from certain death ?
after all i 've done for you , you betray me ?

we should stop mojo , and i know how !
i whipped up an antidote to chemical x !
we love you too !
-and we 'e realy sorry .
-we messed up really bad .
-but we 're ready , professor .
if it was nt or them , none of this would have happened .

yes , that was super , just super !
-amazing !
-stupendous !
you ock !
thank you .
can we , professor ?
okay , but only if it 's before your bedtime .
elp !
sugar , spice and everyting nice .
these wer the ingredients chosen to create the perfect ittle girl .
but professor utonium accidentally aded an extra ingredient to the mix :
chemical x .
using their ulra super powers , they 've dedicated their lives to fighting crime and the forces of evil .
the powerpuff irls !
hey , that 's a good name for them .
powerpuff irls , yeah !

powerpuff girls !
it all began when the silence of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound .
it was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungl .
it was a man cub !
i would 've oeyed my first impulse and walked away .
then it occurred to me .
oh , i knew there 'd be n problem with the mother thaks to the maternal istinct , bt ...
tn ties the rains had come and gone .
he was a avourite of all the young wolf cubs of the pack .
n man cub was ever hppier .
and yet , i knew that someda ... h would have to go back to his own kind .
ere khan will surely kill th boy and all who try to protect him .
now it is m unpleasant duty to tell the boy 's fathe .
rama .
u , come over here , please .
the man cub can no longer stay with the pack .
leave ?
there is o other way .
but
but , rama , even the strengt of the pack is no match for the tiger .
perhaps i can be of help .

you 'll be just as talented after college .

i hae made so many mistake in my life , and i 'm determined not to have our daughter make the same mistakes i did .
she 's not going to make the same mistakes .

no one is ever ready for their dreams to fall apart .
but when she 's older , we 're nt going to be there to help her put them bck togeher .

she 'll either come or she wo n't
did you notie , last fall i was in the same shape as you 're in now
i knew i was in top for
yet i 'd build up the lactics wa too easily
specially when climbing
started working on my ablity to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics were boiling
sounds extremely rough
it was , for months
then suddenly a week ago- a breakhrough !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i wo the race
ok .
a ridiculous idea 
it 's the nly cance our team has
ok .
on three conditions :
neither of yo blows the other 's chances .
sme program he 's been on all spring 
if i 'd used the same method , i 'd already be on the nationl team
you do n't mind that your best friend kept such a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat him once more- he would have killed himself .
it can be a good thing .
taking things seriously
eetu !
coach agreed we could train ogether for the nationals
i 've quit .

an average girl with average breat sounds promsing
hey , cut it out !
man and ape descend from the same ancestors
man easly adjusts to hot climates
causes of death vary greatly cell which often tays inactive throughout its life cycle muscles start at the radius ...
listen , here comes a sure bet
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somtic and psychological changes rpidly , unexpectedly ...
k calling eetu !
eetu receiving

making excessive exertion on the heart impossible .

the winner ets a paid day off and a kilo of russian chocolate
did you oversleep ?
yeah , my muscles are totally jammed
what the hell jewel ?
who cares .
let 's find it and split the week etween us

sometimes small chage can make a big differne
a lousy deal !
two weeks into the job , and you alred got five days off
now i can stdy for the exam .
exactly
who won ?

what ' bugging him ?
ca n't deal with disappointments and takes it out on others

great laps you 're doing !
i 've been wacking my brain over the tactcs for the race
i had planned tha eetu would help k to win
you can both race for first plce
it would be great f one of you gets lucky
let 's go for a swim after work .
mr .
ski is totally mind-oggled .
he thought you were history
you calle on saturday .
for a while i susected you were hitting on oona behind my back
but i knew you would never do  thing like that to me
especially at a time like this
that 's what i thought
if you ee him ...
then what ?
you need eetu 's help
and he needs mine just the same .
h called me
apologized for his behavior .
and ?
about us ?
about us of course
why would i lie to him .
i feel stupid enough a it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , if yu did n't hve the guts to tell him
and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta
your hert has to be operated on
is it a major operation ?
yes , and difficult
if you were on the national team , maybe ...
i have the nationals on sunday .
and i forbid you to take part
consequently , the vtricles cntract
seemingly lcking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidy , unexpectedly ...
am i botherng you ?
looks like my exam wen really well .
thanks again for the tapes .
why not
should we go some place ?
i have to finish thi
do n't worry
are you mad at me ?
i dd n't mean it exacty that way .
i am what i am
here they are , 40 hungry racers , ready to give their best shot ...
a few names stand out as promisig
how 's it going ?
and you ?
busy as hell .
is the national team all sttled ?
one man missing .
my guys will ettle it on the road
keep an eye on this promising rider , only 19 yars old
oona !

any drink left ?
lf i had , i would n't gi you any
thanks
they 're coming !
k !
just go !
will you be all right ?
i m glad to see you eating again .
why am i packaed up like this ?
that 's why you 've got to keep still
they 're numb
your doctor believes there 's a good chance of recovery
you can ell me the truth
if it 's temporary spnal shock , as the doctors believe- you should be moving your legs in a month 's time
but you 'll never become a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a relif
i told them i 'd ask you first
we 're in a hurry
hi !
never seen parallel bas this long
i asked the staff to set them up
i left it to the very last moment , but i cam anyway
with the under twenty-thre national team
congratultions
i woud n't have made it without you .
just thank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages
i 'm glad yo made i
i thnk oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can manage on my own .
certainly no
hey , why do n't you leave
wil you just ge lost !
it 's cming along
but they wo 't let me cycle fo a year
strange how distanes take twice as long as they used to
i passed the exm .
by the skin of my teth .
congatulations
it must have been the sure bet
do n't you remember ?
seemingl lcking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly ...
unexxc ... unexpectedly .
unexpectedly
i wan to apologize
i really did n't treat yu right
that was then
just about to do it
a socket sock
and suddenly socked him into a real cerebral high
growing his mind into the kid
and a smile upon his face
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed

dean higgins , today , a computer can hardly be considered a luxury .
oh , very well .
now , unfortunately ,
medfield has quite a long list of necessities , and a computer jst does not have a very high prority on that list .
now , it 's not tat i 'm old-fahioned .
you all know that i have an open ear fr pogress , and w do all that we can .
why , when mrs ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we went to the expense of live frogs .
we 're not dragging or feet , quiley .
why  i just put an order in today for two garbage disposals nd an electric dishwasher
anythng yet , bradley ?
how 's he doing ?
yeah , that figures .

you ust do n't understand the problem .
do you know what the elephone bill alone is here evey mnth ?
 do n't want to hear about stae .
yeah , but do you realize that thy gve an entire coure in compuer technology ?
now , i d n't lik to draw comparisons , gentlemen , but if we wan o keep abreast of the times and raise our academic average ,
we have got to modernize .
modernization is n't everythig .
yes , uh , gent deeds .
thank you very much .
gentlemen , i  uh , i would n't ike this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are down to the nitty-gritty on ur budget .
hy , we raffld off everything on the campus but the women 's gym .
it 's tough , tough , tough .
unest .
oh , uh , hat part about the unrest , that 's , uh , that ' off he record , mrs. winifred .

leonard ...
the not-o-gifted students ' needs are just as great as those of he gifted ones .
now , um , quigley , we do have certain ne'er-do-wells that mst be seen to .
probation is no ubstitute for catching the interest of the studen , for firing his imagination .
come on , quig .
thattaboy .
joh colligan , roger demey ,
henry fathinger ,
... myles harris ,
ada jervins ,
keith richards , dexter reill ...

sliver roth .

hey , that 's right .
oh , yes , of course .
richard schuyler .
he 's sick .
you know , quig really cares , bt the guy ca n't even reason with im .
well , swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive higgin righ over te edge .
you guys mus be dreaming .
he guy who 's selling it wants 10 grand .
a.j .
arno .

goodbye .
goodbye , boys .
thanks a lot for giving us your time , mr. arno .
well , a.j .
rno never forgets an old employee .

take it easy .
what a slave driver .
yeah , if he 'd been in charge of that russian 5-yea plan , they 'd have made it .

yeah .
professor , can we just take a few econds of ?
oh , sue .

but you ca 't blam the boys , sir .
oh  good fait , bad faith , who cares ?
the 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
we still have th computer .
you know , i do n't like to brag , but if it ha n't been for the fact that i used to work there ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmeti and loic , and output 
and , uh , even though it 's an imitation , in many ways , the machine we 've develoed can oprate more efficiently than we can ourselves .
now , i the past couple of wees ,
i 've been , uh , working on a small experiment , uh , which is intended to show how we can be replaed by a computer .
hey ... this may be a way of gtting rid of dean higgins .
we live in hope , dexter .
now , le 's suppose that your parents are going away for the weeknd , and they leave you the folowing istructions ...
all right ?
and being the conscientious and reliable young people
i kow you to be , you promptly forget to do it .
now , this is a rain gauge , and it 's , uh , sitting on a roof of a building .
the memory bnk , in turn , activates the electronic circuits , the winow loses , the oor opens ... hopefull the cat comes in ... and te automatic telephone goes into action , right ?
the rain ... falls .
computerized male voice :
this is s recording .
hmm .
that 's enough of that .
thank you .
now , another very important eature is its infallible memory .
and they were kind enouh to send us this agnetic tape , which will call forth from the computer solutions to a sries of problems that would occur on a simulated fligh to the plnet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center panel , please .
hey , quig .
hey .
well , it seems like our flight to saturn will be a litte delayed .
this is dean higgins .
now , as many of you know , we came in 36th lat year .

oh , yah , but i know all that stuff .
cars and buses going from place to plae .
one guy stops for lunc for 20 minutes .
i got it all , prf .
yes , i 'm sure you do have it all , dexter , but if i were you , i would look it over again this afternoon .
aw , honest , rofessor .
it would n't d any good .
i 'm up to here with it .
lt me go to mrshfield .
believe me , the drive and fresh air will do me good .
it could n't be a .
the answer to he last to questions was a .

i tell you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a octor .
that 's ridiculou .
he did n't cheat , dean higgins .
now , we usually allow an hour and a half for hat test .
dexter finished it in 41/2 minutes , and he did n't make a mistake .
mn :
yes .
listen , at this rate , you 're gon na faint in front of all those pople .
dexter  it is n't that easy .
thigs are n't the same .
you hae a responsibility now .
yeah .

mayor collins and there 's councilman cooper over there and supervisor straight and there 's , uh , oh , he 's not aything .
ello , dean !
what 's he doing here ?
well , i do n't like it .
every time i see him , i have to hear about his building program .
it 's enough to make you sick .
hello .
i 've been hearin great things .
well , you know , at medield , he scholastic ...
nce to see you .
i would have gotten over here sooner , but i 've been tied up plannin our ew science building .
you knw , quigly , sometimes i think i should have taken up contracting instead of education .
no .
i-i mean , he 's all booked up .
uh-huh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies and gentlemen .
oh , i 'd btter take my seat .
i 've been invited to sit in the control room .
in the control room .
i tell you , he 's tying to steal that boy away from us .
i 'm sure of it .
you do n't understand him , quigley .
the man is greedy .
he 's up to his throat in state mney , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each of our learned guests wil be allowed 3 questons .
our first question will be from dr rufus schmidt , head of the department of higher matheatics at purdue universiy .
r. schmidt .
well , i ...
i , uh , i guess i am .
i see 
mr. relly , using the fdamentl theorem of avanced calculus , and applyin the formula that the square of a distance from te origin to p
is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared .
you see ?
he 's getting his confidence .
your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th power would b 10,604,499,373 .
te sqare root of that product woud be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct .
hey .
an :
i must say , that was rally something .
yes , i suppoe it was , but would n't it speed things up a bit if we could save the applaue till the end ?
yes , uh , i 'm sure the audience would be glad to comply .
good .
your third question , dr. schmidt .
gentlemen , please .
i hope you 're aware that i 'm erfectly equipped to go into other fields .
of course .
uh , perhaps now w could hear from , uh , dr. seigel , professor of foreign languages at lasing university .
getting his confidence is one ting , but this is ridiculous .
i liked him better the way he was .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reily .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexte reilly .
t promises to be exciting , so stay with us as our cameras follow dexter reilly on his journey through otham .
there 's been s buzz of excitement around the big city this past wee , ladies and gentlemen .
everywhere you go , you hear the same question ... is dexter reilly for real ?
should be any second now .
and there he is !
well ...
uh , m. reilly 's being greeed by tw youn ladies who came all the way from yonkers just to greet him .
ths is priscilla cummings ...
queen of the yonkers btanical society ,
i always knew if he had any brains , he 'd be dangerous .
look , i kno dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind of undertandable .
ook at hat crowd , quigley .
what a boon for the colege .
why could n't the boy have been carying a medield pennant ?
do n't you hink that would have been pushing it a litle  sir ?
yes ?
from universal encyclopedias .
oh , tel him we already have a set .
he 's no salesman , sir .
he 's the president of uniersal encyclopedia 
the president ?
sure .
the quiz program where they ask the questions fom the encyclopedia , and they gve away $ 100,000 ?
it 's a real pleasure .
thank you .
who are you ?
who am ..
that 's good .
i like that .
who am i ?
and i like tha set of encyclopedias of ous .
displaying again his remarkable intellectal prowess ,
dexter reilly was able to converse with eac delegate to the u.n. in his own tongue .
they 're waiting for him in the security cuncil .
earlier today  dr. suzuki of the international school of languages stated that with s computer-type brain such as dexer reilly has , he 'll soon be able to master every language the word has ever known .
i think he 's given s good indication of that toay .
professor mertns , we need tha boy .
he can wap up that college knowedge prgra for us .
of course , but we ca n't take any chances .
parsons ?
uhh , just a minute , qigley .
tremendous .
well , t-this is rather important , sir .
it 's about the college knowledge program .
dexter will chew up those encyclopedias .
it seems that mr. van dyke is explaining the operation to he boy wonder .
only maybe we do n't have dexter .
what ?
find ot when his plane arrives !
quigley , how could you let this happen ?
the first operation of cutting the diamond in two exact halves is the mos important .

well , it 's just , uh , a little thing , dexter .
it , uh , seems that we need , uh , three more members for the panel .
i see .
well , you know me , quigley , i 'm not a proud man .
if , uh , dexter does n't like my suggestions , then he can have anybody he wants .
who does he want ?
hmm .
schuler , henry , and myls .
schuyler , henry , and yles ?
and i 'm afraid that if we tried to force anyone else on him  he might ...
y
i mean  we want to keep that boy happy .
but schuyler , henry , and myles .
but the answer to part one is the battle f thermopyla ,
well , lockhurst has answered two parts out of three correctly .
okay , schuyler , you anwer this one .

it does n't ook good if i answer all the questions .

a nude descending a staircase.
boy , that 'd never mke payboy .
oh , dean collingsgood , nice to se you .
you 're scouting , i imagie .
and i would like to say right at the beginning ,
if you had an ounce on integrity , you 'd withdraw him .
withdraw whom ?
it 's unfair .
he 's an intellectal freak !
unfortnately , tis year , medfield has the horses .
are thoe the horses ?
for 10 points each , could you give us the highest and lowest points in south america ?
the highest point is mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feet .
that is absolutely correct .
hey , i did n't try to get him arrsted , you know .
but , boss , how did i know there was gon a be a raid ?
i want to hear this .
soe of that consumpion was in the liquid form .
can you give the phrase in slang for the central unfrozen portion in a container of frozen cider ?
that 's absolutely right .
applejack .
hey , boss , i had nothin ' to do wih this .
i swear .
what was i talking about ?
mr. arno , if you could please elx for just a little ..
out , out 
but ...
this is applejack .
i do n't want a trace of tat operatin left .
shut down ?
why ?
what 's the matter ?
whatevr you say .
we got ta put that kid on ice .
look , we need time to fgure his out .
hello ?
i want the pmpey palace on franklin road in charlottesville .
yeah .
you know , if that kid had n't been stopped , he 'd have metioned every jint i own in this state .
tak him out o the hancock place .
right .
no , i do n't know the area code .
hello , dexter .
go ahead .
start the car .
you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happened , lieutenant .
he was supposed to be at my house about 8:30 last night , and he never showed up .
and nobody 's seen him ince .
well , we 'v checed all over .
he has n't een in n accidet nor has he een arrested .
lieutenant , i wonder if h could have had an attack of amnesia .
could be miles awy by now .
mm-hmm .
i 've alertd the state patrol to be o the lookout for his ar .
ad if they do n't pick him up pretty soon  then i 'm afraid we 'll have to suspect foul play .
foul play , huh ?
well , hat 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean collingsgood over at state ?
oh , do n't you see it , quigley ?
i mean , if dexter is n't back tomorrow for that college knowledge progra , hen springfield state will get the $ 100,000 grant .
uh , wait a minute .
wait a mnte .
the dean of a collge , a kidnapper ?
wll , you do n't know him .
you do n't know him at all .
the an is ruthless .
he gets all that taxpayers ' money and still he 's ruthless 
y
yeh 
i see .
i guess that 'll be all for now .
pte ...
 just do n't think
animals 740 , tables 600 , amusements 500 .
applejack , charlie ...
gee , all those places and always applejack.
he did n't have the foggiest idea what they were .
maybe it does 't mean anything .
then all of a sudden , he mentions appljack , and whm !
just like that , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses throgh a book on an oriental language , and then speaks it fluntly , remembering every accent .
how come he does n't remembr this ?
pete , it does n't make sense .
unless ... unless he 'd never read it or seen it or heard it befre .
it was i th computer .
and now he blurts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missing .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack .
... for something , something he does n't want anybody to know about .
i .
i do n't care who believes it , just as long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell the if they look up these places , they 're gon na find out wt applejack is up to .
and the rason why we know applejack is aro is 'cause it cm from the computer int dexter 's head .
and tat 's why dexter does n't remembe it .
come on .
that 's why pete remembere hat applejck was arno .
arno ?
yeah , because it was the only thing he could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered .
because h could nt ?
exactly .
well , uh , thank yu , mr. schuyler .
sure .
oh .
i 'll be sure to notify you .
ever seen anything like that before ?
let 's hit this tape .
w
what do we do now , pete ?
well , if there 's any dirty work to be done ,

kuberne was kind of a sad boy , but a good person .
one was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had families .
it leads to sfferng , pain , danger and death !
we do n't have ... any wrtten education ... we get our knowledge from our parents and families .
tey teach us about or destiny , about bein an indian ... being a uman being , and about life .
if we do n't rspect our elders ... we 'll be lost .
during the republic they tried ... to change us into whites overnight .
we were cofused ... nt knowing how to live in this new situation ... and after the ears ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defend ourselves .
but how ?
we 'll see i we will have to operate .
we teach our children to read .
we want to learn only the good things from the whites .
that 's wh we teach our childrn , so that o n't happen .
yes .
i liked it very much , i was very happy .
i have missed him a lot since i lost him .
and now , when i saw him ...
i was very happy indeed .
i 've ben feeling so sad ... and ths was great for me .
it was great to see hi alive .
when i saw him moving ...
he was steering the canoe .
the water was very low .
when the canoe passed over a crcodile ... it went crazy and attacked my faher ... right at his neck .
in tis village ... a lot of things hve changed since your last visit .
but for me the saddest thing is that i 've ost my husban .
i miss the safety he gave me .
i remember long ago , one night he came into my hut ... and the nxt morning we were husband and wife .
he was a very good person , very kind and hard working .

except for the activity up in the hayloft , th farm was pretty quiet that morning .
they coud sleep through anthing .
but a lot of the other animals were awakened by all that currying overhead .
some of them just accepted it .
some were pretty annoyed .
but the mood was ery differnt up in the hayloft .
she was determined to be a good mother and never yell at her kittens .
but that aproach would not last very long , bcause milo , ne of her kittens , was trouble from the very beginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that 's not a good idea !
come back here , milo !
ou 're a strangelooking cat , milo said .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , all right , a dg .
but , um , really , deep down inside , we 're all cats , right ?
u , no , otis barked .
the kitten were now big enough to leve the hayloft and see the world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo ot into roule .
he was the frst to start callig out for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemed to milo she yelled a lot .
milo  did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down thee is the river .
everyone understand ?
what 's too loe ?
mlo asked .
is this ?
oh !
ah !
milo , get ack hre , his mther demnded .

he was swept away by the river .
right no .
and behave whle i 'm gone .

eh , yes , milo meowed .
i thin so , milo said .
all right , be careful , his mother orderd , nd began swimmng .
all right .
i 'm not going o yell , his mother said .
now dry yourself off , like this :
and follow me back home .
that was fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
get over here !
the monhs passd , and the farm was huming with the sound of summer .
milo had some new hiding places he could n't wait to try out .
otis sniffed around the yard for a while .
you 're in the pipe , milo .
try aain .
cat 's in the can !
and milo slipped off to another hiding place .
it was n't eay fooling a dog 's nos .
milo tried a harder spot .
but otis found him there to .
now milo needed a brilliant idea .
aha .
he thought of a place where otis could never sniff him out .
it worked .
but milo wondered if it was eally worth the trouble .
milo and otis went to see what al the commotion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rng out :
nd all the hens left in a clucking flurry because that was loria talking , a young chicken who had scratched and pecked hr way to the top rung of the ehouse .
gloria had a good reason for wanting to be aone 
there it is , fellas , gria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg 
so it finaly happened .
is she stayig at home with it or is she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you ant me to kick it back to you , otis ?
milo asked .
otis said .
i kickd it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how long do we have to stick arond this hnhouse ?
until gloria comes back .
aybe you do n't realize it , milo , but this is a major dy for me because ...
well  maybe you do n't realize that this is the day i 've bcome a wtchdg .
some trange noises brought milo out of he henhouse .
what was all thi abut ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
come here , otis , a frog croaked .
ots aid .
otis , it 's your cat budy 
otis , come on .
at that oment , ilo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog croaked .
and outside , mil and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
ots growled .
just try something .
probbly rotten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird animal .
the noise attracted a group of local snoops looking to dg up some scanal .
i tin we 're having a baby .
momy !
mommy !
mommy !
yor mommy 's a chicken .
the other animals told otis he 'd better take the chick to gloria , and quily , which he did .
but th chick ket comin back to otis .
now go back to gloria 
d you understand ?
woof , the chic peeped .
woof , woof , mommy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you 've got to be a rough , tough , man , fighting dog , lie his .
oay , puppy , otis odere .
give t a try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , oti thought .
i 'll mis hi .
i 'll miss him .
come on , sai milo .
phew .
wow , lok at this thing , otis , mlo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle the core wth that --
that , uh , thing .
ha , ha .
this 'll be fn !
he , this is great .
hurry up , tis !
maybe milo was having a trific time , but otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
mybe he could jump off the bridge ino the box if h hurried .
but he was too late .
o , boy .
god .
but that did 't work eiter .
otis ust coud n't swim fas enugh and the river ook ilo farther dwnstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost sigt of otis .
suddenly he heard something moving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duk low in the box so the bear would n't see him .
but the box was drifting right towards the hungry anial 
but ufortunately muc too soon .
the bear saw what was in that box .
then came tis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the riverbank , leading the bear away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he was getting a little concerned because the river wa beginning to move faster ... and faster .
he 'd lost track of otis ow , and he was drifting farther and farther from home .
by the time the moon rose , the rvr had carried milo deep into te foret .
and he heard mysterious hoots and growls and cries in the night .
he began to ws he 'd never jumed into this box and e began to wish he wa home .
it semed to be trembling as muh as he was in the chill , misty night .
he drifted on through the darkness , hoping to find the morning waiting just around the bend .
wen daylight ame ,
milo sa a farm on the riverbnk .
for one happy mome , he thought h was hoe and cried out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't know when he would ever see t again .
here comes the dog your life he -- ♪♪
he deadwood swamp .
a bog where skeleton trees grew withot leaves or branches , and where no creature could live , except for the dreaded deadwood birds .
and one f them was perching n a familiar wooden box .
okay , pnk , otis barked .
there 's te box .
poor cat .
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
look in the bx .
otis prepaed himslf and peeked in the box and saw only a solitary blac feather .
in act , milo was nowhere near the deadwood swamp 
after his box got stuk there , he ran .
he ran from those ird as quickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
the ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow where he aw a kind of anial he 'd ever seen before .
feeling pretty hungry , he immeditely wonered ,
is that something you can eat ?
heh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , a .
i must e ver careful , milo thought .
and aboe al , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt soeone watching him .
and he begn burying his lunch where he figured no one wold ever be able to find it .
yeah , here  my precious muskrat .
you should be safe there ill dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crept slowly own he tree and watched the fox run over the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to get his paws on a big , tasty muskrat lunch .
otis , meanwile , hd traveled through the wetlands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered there was oe magic word everyone understood and that was pleae .
so he marched up to a clam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds were getting darker nd darker and a chilly wind was whipping across the countryside .
milo was several miles from the beach caught in the same storm .
he got a little wet and he felt awfully onesome without otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide came in so fast that the rock otis had been sitting on was completel surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd never be able to swim to shore .
and the water was growing higher .
now the wtr was up to his paws .
he 'd have to try to swim .
he took a deep breath , but just when he was ready to die in ...
oh , no again , the sea turtle gurgled .
every time the tide comes in some fool gets stuk out here .
otis was n't sure what this turtle wanted .
well , now you know .
now , just tay on the shore , where you belong , the turtle grumble .
hph .
thanks , nothing .
next tim he tide comes in , i 'll have to escue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said otis , i di n't know that .
heh .
otis esumed his sarch for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otis calle out , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
i have n't got time , otis sad , sensing tis fox ws n't gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis was outraged .
a !
he marveled at this roa made of wood and iron and decided to follw the road and see where it would take him .
it could 've run right over me .
ut mio was determined .
no milo was plenty tired .
yu look tired and thirsty , a deer whisperd .
i 'm not sure cas know how to bound , milo said .
bound and leap , like a zephyr set free .
bound an , of course , leap .
it just does n't look right when  do it .
frolic with me , friend .
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm folicking .
i 'm frolicking .
you see ?
ahem .
you can sto frolickin now , the deer cooed .
i think i 'm a little tuckered out , milo said .
yes , it is possible to over-frolic , the deer murmured .
and the deer took milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trailed milo from the deadwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the frind he mised so much .
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling .
as evening was falling 
milo decided the safest place o spend the nigh would be in a tree 
and what are you doing up here ?
hiing from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest belong to you ?
yes , and it 's not just an nest , i 'll have you know .
i 'm the night bird , and tht is a daming nest .
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear ct , anyone sleeping there will have his sleep flooded with dreams , the bird sid .
but it 's a safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... we 'd hink of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so they wo n't be recognized .
two , three , four .
whoo !

on september 17 , 1955 ...
mrs. white : dear dr. luthe ...
narratr :
in winter , endless darkness is brightened by the frisky dane of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar bear familie .
oe hudred and fity thousand years ago som brown bears moved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywhere else .
polar ears have alwas hunted from floating patforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctic is arming twice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percet more ocean than it does now .
if the currnt trend continues the arctic ocean could be free of sea ice each summer by the year 2050 .
even if we ca n't sop this loss , we can slow it dow .
most arctic glaciers are meltin faster than ever before .
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a olar bear in search of sea ice oftn has further to go .
soe ubs do survie especially i the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do the inut people like simon qamaniq .
simon :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
but ow the ancient weather patterns have changed .
our grndfathers fed their families well .
my family has always dependd on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall trough .
my friend adam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years into raising their young .
walrus moms send even longer .
they dive down from rafts of ice which drift along and carry them to fresh supplies of teir favorite treat .
mothers teach their young survival sills such as scaring off intruders .
one morn sent me a very clear message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
thi water is lterally as cold as ice 
the salt keeps it from freeing .
down here , there 's only one exit and t 's pretty scary thinking you could be trapped .
ech spring in alaska large herds of caribou set ut on a long journey .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what the caribou mothers go through and to see this migation from their perspective .
leanne :
thee newlyweds will fllow the caribou all the way to their birthing grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calves are just a week or two old , and they 're easy pickings for ears and wolves .
this is the place where the caves have their best chance to survive .
these bugs are potentally deadly to these caribou .
o et aay .
caribou mothers are having a tugh time as the arctic warms .
but polar bear mothers face an ven greater struggle .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of this ship .
narrator :
there are ove 20,000 polar bears in the world and most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especialy helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when you 're only 3 months old .
next year we 're coing back with stronger cases .
narrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to impossible .
then the team gt lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
because the sun never sets in the summer betime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males prefer seals but in a pinch , they have alway gone after defenseless cubs .
the mother seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finally spotted a male quite a was off zeroing in on the mother and he cubs .
ow that seals are so hard to catch , staring mals might be argeting cubs moe often .
but next time things could be much different .
playful cubs can really work up a appetite .
borne :
when you want to grab a bite to eat up here timing is everything .
te ubs finish everything on their plate but the scent of fresh seal meat aacts atention .
but the male pics up the family 's scent again .
we atch helplessly as the mal sneaks up .
the mae keeps gaining on the family .
ten the mother turns to face him ... ... slowing him down just long enough for her frighened cubs to escape .
at the moment of truth , the mother sent a very clear message :
you cn get to my cubs i you want ut you 'll have o kill me first .
narrator 
bu se s pwerless to save the habitat they nee to survive .
there are few truly wil places left and one so majestic as this .
but the arctic is warming faster tan it has for thousands of years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the mothers here nurture their young so lovingly .
perhaps they can inspire us to protect their home with that same care .

the cutlass belongs to robert .
robert the terrible .
you have his cutlass , but you 're not he .
he others were foole , but i know bettr .
you know where we could find this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of an island , past the rocks of malabar 
not that i 'd go looking for it .
and why should n't they ?
they do n't call him robert the terible for nothing .
he 's te king 's own brother , but e 's as bad as the king is good .
and , for his treachery , was banished from moneria .
so he 's a little nasty .
a little ?
story says he 's waiting for the king to step away , just long enough to grab hs beloved children and take the throne for his own .
for robert to claim the throe , they must be goe !
on vacation ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , that 's enough adventure for this goud .
clearing tables is realy kind of fun when you think about it .
which way would be home ?
sedgewick !
where are you going ?
somewhere else .
the helpseeker brought you here , and only the elpseeker can send you back .
just get me back to 1972 .
i do 't understand .
you 're our heroes !
brave as lions and cunning as oxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
who are you ?
i do n't know .
i 'm like a sleepy litte panda .
there 's no island anywhere .
i 'll leave the interpretation up to you .
wel , let 's at least go look .
our work will e done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to it .
great plan , georg .
raise the mast on the steadfast !
we play the haddock for a hat rick
we got the hammocks on the man deck
we got the buler doing the henpeck
screaming so
we do n't know
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a relic from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're n the bad mood swing
we have n't done one thing
not even the minium daily equirement
but if you 're feeling a little seasick
and you wat to get off the guilt trip
what are you gon n show hi ?
g , heroes
standing n the gap taking up the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up the slack
folloing the king 's map
seady at the wheel keep an even keel
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's it .
the island may stil lie ahead .
what is that ?
el remolino , the great whirlpool !
i thought it was pirate legend  but there it is .
captain george 's death cruise ,
brought to you y george , the crazy grape .
i thought you were on our side .
thank you , george .
might be a giant whirlpool .
that wirlpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huh .
how about that ?
water droplets in the air reflecting the sk so perfectly they block the island from view .
right on time .
nd look who they left behind .
do you think ther are snakes on this island ?
'cause snakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
and spiders and bars .
i do n't folow you .
sail to the rocks , do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here ith captain weather channel on my way to be sliced ad dice by edward sissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i were a cae , where would i be ?
we ca n't sneak up on them in  pirate boat  you ninny .
i do n't know .
or maybe a billboard .
too oviou .
if a sailor were to look for me ,
the east is where he 'd start .
he d reach the isle of walking rocks
ad the lapping ass would part .
then gaze wit pride upon my keep ,
not found on any chart ,
till he would spy my steely eye
ooh .
copyright robert the teribl .
oh , yeah .
so , what do we got ?
we head east to ...
holy mackerel !
what ?
pieces of eight ?
spanish gld ?
even better .
cheese curls !
i 'm not going back to the boat .
what do you mean yu 're not going back to the boat ?
the way i see it , i have wo choices .
but , the princess , she thinks we 're heroes .
we are n't any of those things .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
where do i sart ?
how about you , my little friend ?
what ?
she 's sailing away .
aybe she id n't need them after all .
are yu beeping ?
the ball .
what ?
t means our work is done 
where 's the roboat ?
we can go hoe .
hold on a sec .
how long has that been here ?
it 's one of robert 's boats .
it 's blinking !
something ai n't right .
they 've got te princess 
we ot to help her !
come on !
listen , when the ball blinks , our work is done and we can go hom .
do n't you want to go home ?
but i also want them to want to see me .
you know , maybe the reaso they do n't look up to me is because i have n't given them something worth looking up to .
it was wrong about tat .
it could be wrong about this , too .
if you want to go home , you can go home .
but eloise needs me .
let 's go save  princess !
help is n the way !
what kind of a crazy b movie am i in 
lt 's be reasonable .
i was n't really going to eat you , but you were impersonating a snack food !
i think you 're right .
then we 'll just have to follow the clues .
had ast to the island of walking rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like roaches !
i bet george knew about those little things from the weather channel , too .
it is n't worth it .
eaten by his own favorite snack food .
at least that one day , from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'd want me to come back .
what ?
sorry , boys !
gourd is off te menu !
what do you want , rober ?
indeed .
he took monteria 's wealh , our wealth , my wealth , and squandered it on strangers .
when the crown is ine , i can once again enjoy the benefits of royalty .
you 're not strong enough to ake the crown from my father s head .
of course , i ca n't just leav them in the harbor waiting , or i 'll blow up my own ships .
he did n't say .
alexander !
surely you must know when your father is returning !
if you can manage to remember ,
you have two hours to think it over .
ut them in their cell .
oh , papa 's got a pork chop , nellie ,

after the 32nd verse , it grates .
but there 's supposed to be a pas .

a miracle .
i thought smeo should tell you .
father trdone .
father pat , before you start espousin yet another miracle , i advise you to take a breath .
he is wih us here in auburn .
the people from the revival of angels meeting are all talking about t .
nother miracle .
a revival tent ?
i warned you about this joshua .
hey , i ' not the onl one .
everone says it 's a miracle .
i have kept my eyes open and y vision clear , lie you advised m to ,
corrpte ?
as soon as this joshua completes the statue , i want you to end your association with him .
he 's my friend .
goo morning .
good morning , bishop .
thank you for seeing me .
i 'll gt right to the point .
he seemed simple enough , but he 's shown a powerfu influence ove a great many people .
the proestant clergy ad i would like ...
and the purpose of this meeting would be to investigate these miracles ?
we ll have etter things to do with our time .
that i 'm glad to hear .

my own father hyes follows him around like a lost puppy .
this s a small fire , father tardone .
this is a smal fire , father tardoe .
ather tardone , hello .
hw are you ?
it 's the artist you have a problem with .
i 'm surprised you found time to finish your work , consideing al your other chores .
 suppose i do n't think of them as chores .
you know , fater , we could use your help down at the baptist church .
join you ?
it 's the others whose eyes are not open .

a miracle worker ?
i hve neer made that claim .
a miracle worker ?
and i think it 's time for everyone else to find out .

yes , tey 've definitely made progress .
i know most of you .
what joshua has persuaded you to do with this church i wondrful .
but i want you all to look ...
does anyone do somethin for nothing 
does a complete strangr offer to help without wanting something in return ?
preaching ?
i do n' think you know what this is .
it 's a love letter .
a love letter ?
what about sin and god 's law ?
how dare you assume the role of the clergy ?
wat a minute .
what joshua has done is a miracle .
living next to ach other did n't make us neighbors .
make us care about one another , did it ?
but by working together here with joshua --
led by him .
come on .
se the goo in this an --
f you can look at this church and how everybody here has changed for te better ...
and say , this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no , no .
whatever it is you stand for , father tardon , i do n't want to be a part of .
i ca n't .
i w n't wear this anymore .
i wo n't take it .
may god have mercy on you .
he 's just araid .
no .
about this .
i am part of the clery in tis town , and , uh ,
i 'm oo-
so i might as well ...
it 's nt true , pat .
what do you know about being a priest , joshua ?

you 're just  guy .
you 're just a guy .
it just needs to be undrstood , and --
you 're wrong , pat .
hi , maggie .

no , this was in ode days .
i read about it in milly 's book .
a book 
why , his is history .
this really happened .
tell you out them sobbing ' women who lived in the roman days
so they took them all back home to dr
seems they crie and kissed and kissed and cried
all over that roman countryside
so do n't forget that
when you 're taking a bride
sobbin ' , fit to be tied
gathe round , i 'll tell you .
they never did retur their plunder
to rotundas small but cute
them women was sobbin ' , sobing ' , sobbin '
passin ' them nights
while the romans was out hobnobbin ' , starting up fghts
is that so ?
they kept occupied by ewing lots of little old togas for tem tot and saying ' , someday womenfolks wil have right
-while the roman had fights
listen o tis .
when the menfolk went to fetch them
the women woud not be fetched
nw , let this be because it 's true
 lesson to the likes of you
or else they 'll think yu 're etched
oh , they acted angry and annoyed
them poor little dears
why a you sitting there ?
go get them !

attaboy , giden !
i do n't know .
let 's go !
we 'll get them .
make them stop ellin .
hre we go .
there she goes !
what have you done ?
help us , milly .
we 've been kidnapped !
make them take us back .
you take thse girls back at once !
e ca n't .
the valanche !
thy 'll just have to wait till spring , that 's all .
it came out of that book about them sabine women .
what ind of men are you ?
swooping down , carrying off poor innocnts !
they 're just yug boys in love .
go on in th kitchen .
you 'll eat and sleep in the barn with the other livestock .
i 'm ashamed of you .
you 're taking this too hard .
me and the boy will get a parson here some way .
do you think those girls would marry them now ?
i ca n't abide to look at ou !
what are you doing ?
you ca n't stay up ther alone .
it s us she 's mad at .
there 's nothing like a hot cup of tea when you 're all tuckered out .
can you hear me ?
i hear .
please , milly .
snowblls with rocks in them !
what do you want ?
i need an extra blanket .
who is it ?
bejamin .
my leg is feeling poorly .
we wanted ...
it began at first by wars and acts of hostility and then ..
does n't it do anything but snow up here ?
we 've had a blizzard every day for two months .
alice , why do n't you read out lu to us ?
we 've heard that book three times .
go on , read about the sabine women .
get a dress from lly , and i 'll fit it .
no one ?
we 're o one .
i wish i could hunt eggs .
i love to hunt eggs .
dorca gaen !
what 's the matter ?
i saw you !
do n't you dare say that about marha !
girls !
stop it this minute !
you ee , i 'm countin on all of you o help me bcaue i 'm going to have a baby .
oh  milly , sit down !
that 'd be silly .
but when 
in the spring .
dorcas !
i 've always wanted to be a june bride and have a baby right off .
and the bridegroom who marries in june
of a spring that lasts al summer long
home yu ride
wit the echo f mendelssohn 's tune
in your hearts
as you rie
the day a maiden marries
here comes the bride
they 're each promising to love and bey
when you marry in june
in november , the snow starts to fly
ankle-high
coe december , it 's up to your knee
still , the bride 's a brid-to-be
still he snow never melts
oh  the barnyard is busy in a regula tizzy
and the obvious reason is because of the season
each nest is twitterin ' they 're al babysitterin '
every fiel wears a bonnet with som spring daisies n it
sun 's getting shinery to spotlight the finery
and affixin ' his lady with a legal eye
screams , suppse we set the date thi week ?

she d be wasting he breath .
i do n't figure to go .
not even to see the aby ?
yu own kin ?
your own little girl ?
a girl ?
i might have known she 'd have a girl .
i 'l be back when the pass is open .
now et !
the pass is open !
bring your rifles , our sids , yur guns , axes , any kin of weapon !
the pass is open !
what are you starin at ?
i said i d be back when the pass was open .
go upstairs , girls .
put plnty o blankets and straw in it .
what do you call hr ?
hannah .
i 'd string him up the nearest tree shot him down like i would a thieving fox .
i thought about you too while i was up there .
it seemed like i could n't get you off my mind .
the wagon 's red .
al righ .
they ai n't going .
i 'm taking them back .
what do i have to do , beat some sene into your dumb heds ?
taking them back 's the only way .
the whole town 's coming here .
let them come .
we 'll fight them all .
someone 's bound to get hurt .
a father , a brother .
i stand wit adam .
the girls have gone .
they 've run away !
get them back .
come back here !
they can hear us from here .
please , alice !
whe are you ?
come back , martha .
i 'm not going bac !
i want to stay here with you !
come on , ruth .
you 'll hit dorcas .
oh , no ...
not that !
why , pa !
i heard a wee babe crying in the house .
whose is it ?
do n't be afraid to tell .
mine !
we do .
do you , benjmin , caleb , daniel , ephraim , frankincense , gideon take these girls to be your lawfully wedded wives ?

it 's actually about a young , energetic , dynamic , evn a sexy einstein .
wht woul i see if i rode on a beam of ight ?
perhaps ome sort o electrica force is emnating ouwards from the wire .
what ?
it is my grat ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system ;
the people ...
lavoisier .
why ascribe to an object a vague and immeasurabe force like vis viva ?
it is a retur to the old ways !
are you capable of dicovering something of your own ?
there is no right time for te truth .
frãulein meitner ?
yes ?
oto hahn .
the nucleus is our focus .
the jwess endangers our institute .

thank you .
its author ws a youthful abert einstein .
it 's the most fmous equation in the world :
all aboard !
but while e 've all heard of einstein 's big idea , very few of us know what it means .
e 've only got sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but firs ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughig at einstein .
he 'd united in one stunning insight the work of many who had coe before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't think in term of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to understand the hiddn mysteries of nature would begin t change all that .
young michael faaday hated his job .
he was uneducated , the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder 's apprentice .
but faraday craved one thing .
all of his free time and his meager wages were poured into his self-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pas ?
of course , of course ...
pass , pass .
this way to a better lfe .
n the eary 1800s , science was the pursuit of gentlmen , something faraday as clearly not .
he had a rudimentry education , he 'd read widely , he 'd gone to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets to hear sir humphry avy , the most prominent chemist of the age .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of their day .
their lectures wer hugely popular .
tickets were hard to com by , and davy reveled in hi sttus .
they 're waiting .
metls ... unknown , that is , until i isolated potassium from molten potsh and sodium , a i showed you last time , from common salt .
hlp me be part of the great circle that is your work and love .
my desire , sir , is to escape from trade , which i find icious and selfish , and to become a servant of science , which , i imagine , makes its pursuers amiable and liberal .
really ?
well ,  shall leave it to the experience of a few years to set you right on that score .
look , i have n't anything t the moment .
faraday was detemined to break fre fom his daily toil .
newman .. meet mr. michael farday .
perhaps with god and faraday n charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe in our place of work .
just stick to your job and do as you 're told and yo 'll be fine , faaday .
araday became the laboratory assistant , eagerly absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excitement of the day was electricity .
another chrge , newman .
but no one really understood what this strange force of electricity was .
he academic establishment at the time thought that electricity was , you know , lie a fluid flowing through a pipe , pushing its way along .
but in 1821 , a danish rsearcher showed that whn you pass an electric current through a wire and place a compass near it , it deflected the eedle at right angles .
farday , come look t this .
perhaps yo cn work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing finding .
now , that is remarkable .
but if the electrical forc is flowing through the wire , why does the needle not moe i the same direction , parallel t the wire ?
again , newman .
what ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating otwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you that at the university of ambridge , eectricity flows throuh a wire , not sideways to i .
that my be what they teach at cabridge , but it does nt explain what 's happening before our eyes .
no , nw , let 's jst get on .
it was a fascinatin inspired by his religion .
for him , the problem was a way to understand god 's hidden myseries .
there is a small , almost persecuted group in london called the sandemanians .
they were a religious ...
faraday was a member of that group .
that if you opened up one little part of it , you could see how everything was cnnected .
faraday was different from anyody else .
by methodically placng a compass all round an electrified wire ,
frady startd to notice a pattern .
and then he imagine tat a magnet had similar line emering frm it and that those lines wuld get caught up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , nwman .
underneath , i 'm shaking .
yes .
ths is the eperiment of he century .
scale up th magnets and the wires , make them really big , atach heavy weights to them and they 'll be dragged along .
although he did n't realize it at the tim ,
the chemicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in the wire , which had combined with the magnt to produce motion .
bhind all these varous force there was a common energy .
so , faraday , what dos wollaston make of all this ?
he 's written to m and assures me that he 's taken no offense , and he acknowledges that wat i published wa entrely my own work .
in fact , he is still vehemently opposed to you being elected  member of the socity .
and what do you think ?
faraday , my dar boy , you have my vote .
it 's the sience that counts .
so  tell me , how does this wire of yours spi ound its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i see a swirlin array of lines of force spinning out of the electrified wire like a spiraling web .
but invisible lines of force ...
it 's all a bit ague , i n't it ?
farday , might i ave a word in private ?
listen , faraday , let 's stop this nonense .
i want you to take down your ballot paper fom the notce board .
sir humphry ,  see no reason to tke it down .
it is they who put the pper up .
i ill not take it down .
my father and uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing electric light to the streets of germany .
from an early ge , i loved to look at machines , understand how things work .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a mirale when my ather showed me a compass .
there ad to be soeting behind obects that lay deeply hidden .
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the same to me whicheer way they run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shown , that energy could be converted from one form nto another .
they alo believed that all forms of energy had already been discoverd .
einstein was going to prove thm wrong .
deep in the heart of matter .
a hundred years before einstein 's birth ,
foget the rain .
the french revolution was just round the corner .
and they flt that one of the frst tasks that lay ahead of them was to rationalize and to classify evry singl kind f matter so they could see how it all interacted together .
antine lavoisier , a wealthy , aristocratic young man , decided to take up this task , to see if there was sme basic connection between al the stuff of everyday life :
all the different substances in the world .
his meticulous , even obsessive attention to detail ...
was also to be his downfall .
your precise observatons commend you as a lady of scientific curioity ,
most unsual .
for the last ive weeks , i have taken nothin bt milk .
i would rather die than fat on milk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the reatest of respect to a member of the royal academy of sciences , your gut must think your throat has been slit !
how dare you inslt the count ?
do n't forget what the count ofers ... not just marriage , but think of how you will be introduced to all the salons .
you will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to marry d'amerval ?
thn i must contre to save you .
lavoiser was nt a scientist by profession .
he was the head of tax enforcement in paris .
but his taxes on the simple things in life ...
did not endear him to the aveage parisian .
this scrupulous , fastidious young man did still allow himself the occasional act of passion .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anne paulze , the daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thus he saved her , as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 years her elder .
allow me to show you something .
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or iron and leave it outside n the rain for months on end ,
madame laoisier 
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metals ...
is this a verbal examination prior to a examination proper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let me press yo further .
hmm ?
very last citzen in france of sensible age knows that when a metal rusts , it wastes away , it gets lighter and eventualy disapears .
ah , but ...
i have not finished .
contain yourself , sir 
there is more .
in a recently publshed pamphlet by a brillin young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier demonstrates hat the iron combines with the air .
it , in fact , becomes heavier .
she learned english so that he could translate contemporary scientific works .
onsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a chee man .
messieurs ... it is my great ambition to demonstrate that nature i a closed system , that in any tranformation , no amount of matter , n mass is ever lost and none is gained .
over here , please .
fom this end we cool the stem but , interestingly , we collet less water than we stared with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of water .
now , when we combine these two increase ...
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas we ave collected ...
they are exacly qual to the weight of the lost waer .
so what he had done is get the oxygen to stick to the inside of a red-hot iron ifle barrel .
now , that left the hyroen , what he called combstible air , and that was just floating around as a gas 
in the next few months i hope to demonstate tht i can recombine this combustible air with vital air and transform tem both back into water .
i will re-create exactly te same amout of water that was lost here in this process .
it is my hpe to complete he ycle ...
bu to prove this  he hd to perform thousands of experiments , and he had to do the measurements ith incredible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth from being a tax collector came n .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the acaemy aske you to assess his designs .
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to peddl .
monsieur .
i hae invented a device which projets an image of the substnce of fire onto a scren .
my device renders the substance of fire visible .
have yu colecte it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjeture , mnsieur .
no , no .
if you will you excuse me .
i am xtremely busy today .
thank you 
so that is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that our invntion does not onform to the vrsion f the tuth as laid down by the academy .
lavoisier .
he talks bout facts , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my friend .
they are all the same , the roal acadeies ...
they insult the liberty of the mind .
they hink they are th sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core ...
do n't wory .
in my next pamphlet i will expose this persecutor of yours .
the crowning glory of this opus was their remarkable use of ttic electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogn t recombine back into water .
to the frenc revolutionaries of 1790 ,
he was denounced y a failed scientist turnd radical journalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a century later , all of nature had been classifed into two great domains .
there was energy ... the forces that animated objects ;
and there was mass ...
the whole of 19th-centuy science rested on these two mighty pillar .
the laws that governd one did not apply to the other .
but young , newly enroled physics student albert enstein did n't like laws .
extremely well , herr einstein .
all the better for seeing you have escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that 's about all you ever do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein maric .
would yo care to take a walk ith me ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tel you what you have missed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations with just incredible determination .
we know from is leters that einstein , even from the age of 16 , as literally obsessed with the nature f light .
everyone he could speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on this beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us just imagine we two ar young ...
idicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to understan .
what would we se , do you think ...
with light he would reinvent the universe and fnd a hidden pathway that would unite energ and mass .
it stands for celeritas ..
long before the 19th century , scientists had computed the spee of light , but no one knew what liht actually was .
invisible lines that can emanat from electricity in a wire , from a magnet or ... even from th sun .
for it is my contention that light itself is just one form of these vibrating lines f electroagnetism .
maxwell and the aging faraday became close friens .
james , forgive me .
do n't gt old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that magnetic charge moves , it creates a little piece of electricity .
electricity .
electricity and magnetism are interwoven , lie a ... a never-ending braid .
so it is always pulsing forward .
michael .
670 million miles per hur .
that is the speed of light !
well , that means you were right all along .
maxwell had proven faraday rght .
we have lectures in half an hour .
we ca n't .
come with me , we ll read maxwell and think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they said you could never catch up o a beam of light .
even if you were raveling at 670 million miles an hour , you would still see lght squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an hour .
yes .
you see how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and th wave are traveling at the same speed .
but relative to her , it ust sits there .
so is light like that ?
comon sense would say that if you caught up to a light beam , there would be a wave of light just sitting there .
maybe it would be shimmering , a bit of electricity and a bit of magnetis .
so if she was traveling alongside the ight wave , it ould n't be moving .
it would be static .
but maxwell says you ca n't have static light .
maybe maxwell is wrong .
the light travels from my face to the mirror and i see my face .
that does n't make sense 
einstein was aout to enter a surreal universe where energy , mass and the speed of light intermingled in a way no ne had ever suspected .
long before the french revoution , scientists were not sure how t quantify motion .
du châtelet 's translatio is still the standard text in france today .
muse , my memory causes ..
for what offence the queen of heaven began
to perseut so brave , so just a man 
only the other night ,
i fear , however , that my wit is only a curiosty to others .
if only my mind were permitted pportunity .
my earest émilie .
use them both and the world will all at your feet .
no ...
in one sense , she is a woman utterly out of her true time and place .
du châtelet married a general in the french army at age 19 and had three children .
she ran a busy household , all the while pursuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mathmatics .
she enthusiastically took lessons from one of the greatest atematicians of the day ,
e was an expert on newton , and she was his eager young studet ;
it seems they had a brief affair .
a fierce citic of the king and the catholic chuch ,
voltaire had been in prison twice and exiled to englnd , where he became enthralled by the ideas of nwton 
du châtelet hid him in her cuntry home .
he went to his publisher to plea voltare 's case to kee voltaire out of jail .
and it is also true that émilie du chtelet did have several affairs of a fleeting nature .
bravo !
she created an institution to rival that of france 's royal aademies of siences .
ah , monsieur ...
you are young .
i hope that oon you will jdge me for my own merits , or lack of them , but do not look upon me as n appendage to this great gneal or that renowned scholar .
i am n my own right a whole person , responsble to myself alone for all that i am , all tat i say ... all that i do .
d châtelet earned from the brilliant men around her , but she quickly developed ideas of her own .
much to the horror of her mentors , sh even dared to supect that there was a flaw in the great sir isaac newton 's thinking 
neton stated that the energy of a object , the force with which it collided with another object , could very simply be accounted for by its mass times its velocity .
he proposed that moving objects had a kind of inner spirit .
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four slabs along one edge and four along the other .
wel , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplication , this building up by squares , is something you find in nature all the time .
it is a return to the old wys !
it is the ocult !
so all leibniz is asking is , where does all this force ome from ?
you 're infuriating !
criticize this , denounce that .
i discovered you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been dropig lead balls into a pan of cay .
so , messieurs , care for a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
messiers ,
i feel mr. newton 's reputation dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis 
well .. the ball travels fo ties further .
it 's the best way to express th energy of a moving object .
if you drive a car t 20 miles an hour , it takes a certain distance to stop if you slam on the brakes .
yo 're going 60 miles an hour ...
h .
really ?
do be careful , madame .
do you think the academy is ready for suc an opinion ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a geat man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
or is it your hsbad ' .
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du hâtelet knew that n the 18th century for a woman to become pregnant at the age of 43 was really very angerous , and all the while she was pregnant she had terrible premonitions about what ws going to hppen .
in the end , it was an affair with a young soldier hat led to her demise .
sx days after giving birth to her fourth child , she suffered an embolism and died .
einstein pursued ight right through university and beyond .
unfortunately , h 'd upset so many professors hat no one would write him a reerene .
e accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the young family strugld .
but , listen ...
abut your promotion .
i 'm sorry .
ll wll be fine , you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very charming , bt kind of a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in around him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't bother him .
i 'll tell you what is truly yterious :
the mathematics are fne , if a lttle unconventional , but this only works for big systems .
i disagree .
hee we go ...
what would happen if one applied those formulae to electromagetic radiation ?
albert , you ca n't just take one bt of physics and apply it without proper regard to a ompletely different area .
why not ?
i know you lie the grand linkages , the big theories , but would n't things be better all round if you just go going in some small area ?
spoken like a true bourgeois .
they ad corered the question of liht from every possible angle .
as einstein and esso were ruminating on how much time it would take ligh to reach them fro clocks at different distances ,
thnk ou .
what einstein did was completely turn the problem on its head .
tht light woul always move away from you at 670 million miles an hour , even if you , too , were traveling realy fast .
hi extraordinary insight is that time ... a you approach th peed of ligh , tme tself will slow down .
it 's a monumenta shift in how we see the world .
you see  beore then people had assumed that time was like a wristwatch on gd 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate troughout the universe , no matter were you were .
that the tick , tick , tik of ths wrstwatch was actually the click , click , click
of electricity turning into magnetism turning into eletricity .
it starts with his publication of a paper on how to work out the true size f atoms .
two monts later is the ublication of his paper on the nature of light ...
tha 's what will earn him the nobl prize .
in it einstein sets out his theory of light  time and space .
it was the theory of special relativity .
in einstein ' new world , the on true constant was not time or even space , but light .
in one last great 1905 paper , he would propse an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from ou point of view , the train actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredible iea .
even einstein is aazed by it .
i think i have foun a connection between energy and mass .
if i am right , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they ca be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he simply stated that energy and mass were connected by the sqae of the speed of light ..
e  m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year journey ito liht .
there is a deep unity beten energy , matter and light .
you multiply that by itself and you get 90 quadrillio .
probably the mst miracuous year in science end in silence .
the articles are published to resounding .
 think the gods are lauging at me .
for four years einstein swered each inquiry dutifully , tryig to explain his difficult , complex ideas to a cofued physics cmmunity .
here are these universe-changing papers circling around , and the world is ... strugling to come to terms wih them .
luckily it happened to be the most important living physicist 
he has sent his assistant .
after four years of waiting , he is appointed proessor of physics at zurich university .
from there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he ivorced mileva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numeous affairs .
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of ast rserves of energy locked deep inside the atm .
but he had n't anked on the second wrld war and the genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-yea-old austian lise meitner was painfully shy .
despite her anxiety , the young doctor of physics arrived in berlin determined o pursue a career in the exciting new field of radioacivity .
german universities di no empoy female graduates .
otto hahn 
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i think i could really hlp with the physical analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematics .
stdying radioctive atoms hs bcome so much a collaboration between emistry and physis these days .
yes , yes .
i 'll ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
at this time , not a lot was known about the atom .
but then ... in what are called radioactive metals , things like radium and uranium ...
the nucleus itself seeme to be unstable , leaking out energy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus turning int eery .
he was iven a laboratory .
she was forced to work in a wood shop .
i se you have n't set your hair on fire .
good day , herr ahn .
good day .
yes , where would we chemists be without the steadying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
yes , well , i have , m ... asked her to mrry me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for you .
very pleased .
lise metner was warm-hearted by nature .
she had many friends and she may have wanted to have a closer relationship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear research .
meitner and hahn wee leading the race to see if even bigger nuei could be created y adding more neutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty famiar :
the nucleus , made up of protons ... and neutrons .
now , the largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess edangers our institute .
he was hounded ot of gemany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
wht is it ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ...
we 're speaking tomorrw .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn , who was known for his ani-nazi views , did his best to protect her , at least initially .
not now  i 'm too bsy .
we have o protect her .
what can we do ?
and she may soon be forbidden to leave germany .
lise ...
horlein demands that you leave .
you ca n't throw her out .
horlein say you shoud not com into the institute anymore .
well , i have to write up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to come in .
you 've given u .
when it became clear that meitner would be dismissed and probably arrested , physicists al aund europe wrote ltters inviting her to conferences , giving her an excuse to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague traveled to berlin and illegally took lise back with him n a train t holland .
she hd lost everythig ...
her home , her position , he books , her slary , her pension , even her native language .
she had been cut off from her work just at the time when she was leading the field and was on the brink of a major cientific discovery .
no matter what privations sh sufered ,
aunt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getting strange results .
he ound no evidence to uggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increas in size .
from afar , sh was strting to suspect that something very different was happening in their eperiment .
hahn and strassman are getting some stange rsults with the uranium work .
really ?
a couple of mnts ago , hahn told me that they were finding radim amongst the uranium products .
and now he writes to me and tlls m that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that 's even smaller .
it is at least possible that barium is being produced .
so hahn sill needs you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there , cn i ?
h as n't done what you told him to .
it turns out that a bg nuceus like uranium is just like that .
now or four years , meitner and hahn nd all other physicists hd thought that if yo pump more neutrons into ths nucleus , it 'll just get bigger and heaier .
realized this nucleus might just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is o big that it has troble stayin together , then coud n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but something has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no , no ... you 've split the atom .
of course , in the laboratory we 're talking about tiny amounts of uranium and correspondingly tiny amounts of energy .
but the point is that the oun of nergy released was reltively large and that came from the mass of the uraniu itself .
meitner and frisch published the discovery of what they called nuclear fission
to great acclaim .
but betryal awaitd them .
hahn maintained it was he and not meitner who had discovered nuclear fssion .
shall my scientific past also be taken from me ?
and why is it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , bt that was enough .
in 1942 , an intse effort t build an atom bomb was begun .
all over america , secret installations sprang up under the code name the manhattan projet .
she refused to hve anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but robert frisch was different .
vast amounts of nery , in the form of electromagnetic radiation , were released from a few pounds of uranium and plutonum .
today , young physicists carry on einstein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been used o delve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest question of all ...
in the first moments of creation , the uiverse was this immensely dense , mmensely oncentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed aart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles and atoms and it eventually fored the first strs .
it comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creates life itself .
eventually , a massive star dies , te debris floats around , clusts together , gets pulled into the rbits of another star and becomes a planet .
uilding on the work of scientits through the ages , ne generations are searching for answs .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , ometimes joyfu .
it is as old as human curiosity itself and ever , ever ends .

~ and it always will ; tomorrow will always come .
yeah ?
but you do n't know if what the zashiki-warashi said is true or not .
i know .
let 's go home .
we 're getting the bullet-train tat departs in the afternoon 
we ca n't go back till then .
has coo ever left te place e was born in ?
his is the first time .
kamaishi station
wait and see .
do n't throw me like that !
sea ?

wha salt water !
i doubt there are any fish in such saly water .
they must be really salt fish !
let 's look for kappas elsewhere .
ure .
east kuume staton
i 'd like to hear your stoy about your kappa .
just r a bit !
take a photo !
i did n't do anthing !

wha—
i 'll teach you properly about thm next time .
coo 's really amazing !
apparently coo can swim by farting .
coo 's about to appear in a magazine .
just think bout what we 're going to do now !
that 's right !
i have a ouvenir for hitomi !
is n't it ?
t s an apoogy for eating your mai-mai the othr day .
it 's beautiful ... what about a thanks ?
is n't it ?
he 's beginning to take huh ?
alright then !
that 's all .
humans do scary suff sometimes ...
middle magazine : footage of an actu kappa !

yes ?
i 'm sorry but we do n't wan interviews .
thank you for visiting .
i 'm sorry but ...
about what ?
come on .
keep it trong !
that is ... and we 'd like to decline all interviews .

it s prbably false information .
but afterwards our cameraman had a fever .
excuse m .
hold on a second !
they 're scry ... this matter 's becme huge .
it 'd be really coo if you did have some supernaturl power !

i a n't trouble you all anymore .
thank you !
kappa
filmed b
direct investigation !
an you lower your head ?

bu they 're ignoring it ?
be careful .

ecuse me !
let me throgh !
this is the plan for a dama series !
coo-chan !

i do n't smell 
wlcome .
we 'd lie to take a closer look at the mysteries surrounding kappas .
shimizu-san is someone who has long believed in the existence of kappas and researched ... what 's wrog ?
coo-chan .
sure .
what could that be ?
i just could n't tink of kappas as just being imaginary monsters .
wold you be able to show it to us ?
i want to see it .
that arm ...
bcause i can !
but ...
wha to do ?
your ancestor kille my daddy !
my daddy was n't a mischievous kappa !
he was an expert kind and ...

your ancestor sddenly drew out his sword and killed dddy !
the daddy who i realy loved !
coo ...
coo-chan has the ability to ee the ast ?
do n't cry .
what 's going on in the studio ?

tere 's an old comanche saying about females .

you do n't have any dea how big .
i 've only been out here for a short time .

you 'll find i 'm pretty well-conneted her .
i an show you a shortut to the whole proposition .
he got here first .
the peos river runs through he middle of his land .

i 'm afraid of wht he might do .
whatever he does , it 'l be legal 
jess evans rode up right after the shooting .
it 's hard to believe about henry tunstall .
yes , and it 's hard to beeve he carried a gun .
resisted arrest .
that 's too bad .
it 's just too bad .
would you excuse us , jess ?
all right , awrence .
howdy .

govrnor axtell has appointd a new sheriff :
and i 'm ading a further reward ... of $ 1,000 , dead or alive .
have you got anything you want to add to that , sheriff ?
john , since governor axtel hung me out to dry ... there 's nothing i can help you with .
i 'll head bck to mesilla in the morning .
all right , j.b .
i 'm writing president hayes a letter asking for an impartial investigation ...
by that tim , murphy 'l have his ae on everything between arizona and texas .
mr. murpy ... just how much of lincoln county are you after ?
you have anything to say to that , mr. chisum ?
you 're not just getting started .
the line 's been drawn .
but if one of your men cross my land , or even touch one of my cows ... r do anything to that store ...
i 'm coming to see you 
mr. chisum , that sounds like a threat .
wrong word :
fact .
billy , why did you come back ?

how do i get down there ?
you see that seond tunnel there ?
yeah .
the door on the right is the pirate clubhuse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates ' exhibition this afternoo reducing their standing to seventh place in the nationl league .
by the way , i 'll not be with you for the balane of the season .
steps have been taken and brefly , your announcer has been canned .

pess .
gangway .
he ' unhappy .
i think it was a waste of tim t send me .
i do n't know the game and i have n't ay sory .
but  can tell you what 's wrog with th piates that mcgovern person 
and all those nice , clean-cut young men and the way e bullies hem .
no wonder they mae mistakes , anybody would .
if you ask me , the pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better o without him .
hey , write it .
but he 'd sue us .
do your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anybody die out thre ?
what a depressing job .
mr. kirney must have liked the story .
y jennifer paige , 'household hints ' editor .
every morning about 1 1:00 , he lef for the field .
this is the only ack in pittsburgh ?
ou know the law , sonny .
you 're supposd to stay with your cab .
the bums o 't start until 1:30 .
his afternoons were spent like this .
the only place he was een in ublic , outside the ballpak was john 's steak house .
i 'm going over and talk to him .
oh , stop .
well , there he is , cornered .
waiter ?
i 'm jennifer page .
i wote that story about you this morning , in the messenger .
wel , i began this way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the il-tongued orator of the basebal field , is a surly , unbed goat whose mouth should be washed out wit a strong detergent .
you 're not mad ?
i do household hints on th ladies ' page .
t i have a few facts and figures about your --
a few statists that might be interesing .
for instance , last season , minel had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i 'll hae to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's average is wa dwn to , 93 points 
he 's the obituary editor .
what do you hear from want ads ?
well ,  realize figres can be misleading but when an entire tem goes as sour s the pirtes well , i look around for a reason , and i look right t you .
how re thngs in seveth plae ?
catch me tonight , i 'm on in an hour .
i 'm gon na rn you out of this town , mybe right out of organized baseball .
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in here a minute , huh ?
before i say good night , i would like to reiterate my opinions are those of an unbiasd observer who has th bes interest of baseball at heart .
there is nothing personal in my fud with guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
finl score :
th pirates had a total of hree hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors al by yurself .
did you think that was second base ?
you 're gon na catch a fly ball some of these days and knock your front teeth .
you fellas may ot believe this but saul once pithed a two-hitter in a world series .
but he 's still in there itching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do n't you think you 're ld for this pastime ?
we used to have a guy like that in the three-i league .
put gunpowder in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern always been like this ?
sixteen years go .

you speak to angels ?
where they running ?
is n't it wonderful ?
his latest peccadillo , an admission to the press that e converses with angels ... .
you could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he now commands .
i would like to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us your name , please ?
i 'm a groundkeeper at braves field , up in boston .
will you please tell us what you saw in braves field about seven weeks ago ?
wll , i ee r. mcgovern .
after the game .
sitting on second base .
and what was e doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
there was n't nybody there .
and when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who was n't there , where was he looking ?
up .
ut one thing he said was , i have a rigt to know the name of my ow angel .
yes , sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable man to ang around second base at night and talk to angels ?
much as i hesitae to say this i think that mr. mcgover should tke a long , long prhaps permanent rest .
what 's eating ou ?
so w won a ball game , so hooray .
i tell you , it 's makng me jumy .
every time i go after a ball , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over omthng .
for two cents , i 'd quit right now .
shut up .
yu watch mcgovern looking over his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trying to be a right guy .
your job is to got out and play ball .
keep your mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he coms .
and here 's a flash that was jst handed to e .
arnold p. hapgood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburg tonight .
with te pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afaid the pirates and mr. mcovern are in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon .
with this hanging over their heads , there 's no tellig what they 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
they 're gettin nervous .
not that i blame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apt to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't worry uch about it .
i 's only natural at a time like this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do ' sleep nights , i do n't eat .
oh , that so ?
you know , i used four this afternoon .
who do i start toorrow ?
yeah 
well , i would n't worry about it .
even i could n' make him look good .
they wan na send him to the minors .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around next season .
yeah .
at least , we used to be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen , i have an appointmen with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9:00 .
until i her all the evidence , i have othing to say .
.. tomorow for the pennant .
i 'm aware of tha .
hink thi is the proper time for the investigation ?
my dear lady , any tim 's the proper time when the situation warrants it .
baseball is for the people who suppot it .
from new york , sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to them ?
riginally , man worshipped the sun , the moon , stones , tees .
invented ?
just as a hurt child will run to its parent so will a man turn for comfort to a belief in anges .
and hen this belief takes the form of actual conversation with ngels hat is your professional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes ?
yes , ys , of course .
dr. eustace danforth , trinity church .
rabbi allen hahn , temple isrel .
how do u do ?
father o'houlihan , church of our la , queen f te angels .
gentlemen , just make yourselves comfortable .
mr. cmmissioner ?
well , what do you think ?
do you suppose there might be angels ?
right to left .
to dny the existence of angel is to deny the word of the holy bible which is speific on the subject .
fro the ancient hebrew text , we have the words benei elohim he sons of god .
thank ou , rabbi .
t was an ngel who guided the children of israel to the promised land .
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and deliveeth them .
seeing as how there are covys of anels litting through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new testaments i do n't see how i cn get out of saying i believe in hem .
i imaine the cmmissioner does too .
oh , please , just leave me out of this .
mr. commisioner ?
is it likely one of your angels r a group of angels would led support to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is it possibl that angels would aid and comfort uch a man ?
thank you , gentlemen .
if dr. blane would cre to see me in my office ,  'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would .
however --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get he out of here ?
mr. cgovern , what are you afraid of ?
all right .
bridget white , 8 yars old .
st. gabriel 's hoe for orphan girls .
does n't everyone ?
no .
they were helping the pirates .
you 're quite sure abut that ?
you would nt just make up a story , wold you ?
oh , no .
cerainly , certainly , certainly .
no .
because mr mgovern said so .
of course .
ay angel would be proud to talk to a nice man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , plese .
what are you talkng about ?
 will deide what is evidence here .
uppose i did ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nothing definite .
i do n't know if the court will let me have her 
it 's touching .
come on , stop that .
sop that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i hink , in view of the facs all things considered this case is dismissed .
hey , fella , what 's with guffy ?
sure , sure .
he was okay all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , you heard what the fella said .
just stick to you driving , will you ?
i only hit him once or twic .
because when you busted that bridgework , you also busted our agreement .
rom now on , you 're on your own .
it 's no oke .
you ca n't walk out on me ow .
i need you .
do n't worry , you 'v been on your own a lt the last eigh weeks 
i do n't like to be on my own .
you used to be .
you 've learned something , guffy .
we 're a little proud of you .
sorry , c n't make it .
tell that cab driver to slow down .
so long , guffy .

i was , uh , talking to bob humphrey .
exctly .
he 's now oe of the hotshots on the web .
and music sites .
and ?
and they 're looking for a head
hmm .
enough .
obby 'll double it -- at least 
but no one wih your skills or experience .
now with this teaching thing on top of it .
they even have an ofice in london .

it 's only the term progress report ,
not an actual report card .

after all our hard work 
i turned them down .

yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,
and i 'll check her calculations .
then you can talk to her math teacher ,
se if he 'l raise her grade to a d .
that could work .
but you have to get her to take it very seriously .
if yolanda doe nt deliver an accurate tabulation ,
she 's off the dace tem .
i like your optimim .

you are flthy mewman .
for better eating of monster babies .
is this fun ?

tha idea had to coe from somewhere .

monsters only act that way to protect their babies from mewmns .
you may nt understand , but monsters will do anything for our children .

the cure for cancer has been discovered .
the cure for virtually every form of chronic disease was discvered even earlier , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german ew named dr. max erson .
although his discoveries wee adhered to by hitler and the nazi party ,
r. gerson 's family paid he ultimate price .
dr. geron 's seven siblings perished in he holocaust .
dr. gerson 's unprecedented gift of healing the hopeless lives on .
narrated by dr. a.f .
these scenes befoe your eyes would be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air moves nrth nd airborne transport of dioxins eventually reaches the once pristine arctic .
arctic peoples are showing major health probems , from bioaccumulation of dioins .
and from there , the poisns travel up th food chai to polar ears , seals and wales , and then to people .
one thousadth of oe millonth of a gram of dioxin can cause harm to the body .
trees , the very living orgaisms tat clean the air and produce the oxygen we breathe , are sliced off at the ground with the most careless abandon if there is a lmiteless supply .
at one point , it had been said that a tree squirrel could jump from tree o tree following the hardwood with conferous forest belts from the east coast to the west coast .
they do not develop special fnctions .
as a boy i germany , in the late 1800 's ,
day by day , he gained insight in the relationships between plants and the nutrients they gained from the sol .
under a microscope , actively cells known as chloroplasts , busily undertake the procss of manufacturing chlorophyll and the miraculous process of photosynthesis begins .
these live cells an enzymes in vegetation are the nucleus of what we need to igest to heal a sick body or maintain a ealthy one .
max gerson sufferd from svere and repeated migraine headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days 
after three years of exerimening ,
not nly had the migraine been relieved , but a skin tuberculosis also disapeard .
446 of the 450 patints recovered .
r. gerso and his wife gretchen had three daughters :
janna , gertrude and the youngest , charlotte .
of all the childrn , charlotte took a special interest i her father 's work .
by the late 1920 's , dr. gerson 's fame ad spread throughout europe .
when dr. schweitzer was 75 years old , he came to dr gerson with diabetes and was also cured .
lighting up the switchboards at abc non-stop .
out of control !
unbelievable !
and the pepper neely anticancer bill of 1946 , document no .
now married , she had a son , howad , and a daughter , peggy .
charlote encouragd later her father to publish his first book in 1958 :
at the time of his death , in 1959 ,
the files have ben preerved by his daughter charlotte who is now in her eightis .
carlotte carries on the work of her father through the establishment of the
we have some letters here frm albert schweitzer ... and they had a very active correspondence , my father , dr. gerson and albert schweiter , and his family were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter , he expressed his adiation of the specific cancer reearch that dr. gerson did .
of course , all the letters are in german and i 'm trying to translate some .
as well as the remarkable results that he saw , not only with cancer patents , but with his wife , who had tubrculosis , an their daughter , who had a very undecipherable skin disease .
laws in virtually al the united states prohibit any other treatment for cancer other than radiation , chemotherapy nd surgery .
on this particular day , two medical doctors from czechoslovakia  consult with anita wilson , who is executive diretor , about he possibilities of opening a hospital in czechoslovakia .
... you boost the immune system , you rid the ody of those years and ears of accumulaed txins from the way we live ...
not a day goes by that we do n't hear something from a ptient or a pysician , or a group of people perhaps interested in starting a clinic or a support group .
in high school i was in one of those dieters anorexic and bulimic ... blimia when it was n't eally written about .
they finally gave me a cat scan .
i had a fiht for that .
a year later , tha same tumor , the one that they thought could be a metastasis , was gone .
when i ws 16 years old , my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in m face .
after being on the theray for about a year , i noticed one day when  was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bne in the right side of my nose for the irst time .
another staff member , susan brant , charlotte gerson 's niece , at one time , was diagnosed with an inoperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 years ago , and so ,
i can sit here and say that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and he biopsy .
they determined i had three sections of ancer , malignant cancer in the prostate an they wanted o take the prostate out the next day .
i talked with gerson institute and wih th hospital in mexico , and talked with the doctors and the patients 
after tree months , i found that i ws loosing weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 months my psa howe 0.06 , hich to me was the end of the treatment .
i was cured , the doctor thught i was great , he said i had a better psa than he did .
i m not an easy one to get along with , because i 'm a maverick ...
a particular type juicing method ms be utlizd , however , implemeting a grind and ress device .
when juice is drunk , it can ener the bloodstream almost as fast as alcohol .
this juicer was originally desined in the 1930 ' by a scientific researcher , named dr. norman walker .
an enormous amount of nutrition can be captured in a glass of juice in minutes and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the patient .
as you can see , an entire day with the juices is equivalent to an enormous amount of food , hich weights i a little over 20 pounds a day .
but jst eating different is not enough to eal a seriusly ill patient .
nutrition is only half of the euation .
resolving the accumlated toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentless .
ealizing thi , charlotte gerson included a chapter about it in a book about the gerson therapy , that underines , in laman s erms , the principles of the geson therapy .
a typical exampl of daily toxic ingeston or precursor hit be when you get in your automobile prior of even starting the engine , you have already ingested dioxins
) given of frm the dashboard to the fancy ?
suppoe you contiue your journey and stop at a motel for the evening .
once inside , from the power swith activating lectromagnetic fields , to the microwave radiation leaking from the oven , as it prepares your plastic wrapped , heavily salted and preserved nutritionless nstant dinner  to th carcingenic chemicals in the soap on the bathtub brim .
yu are inundated with hits .
te soap and shampoo ae just the start , however , of what wil be absorbed through your skin once you turn on the bath tube faucet , which will povide chlorinated and fluoridated water to help you get clean .
chlorine and fluorine help destroy the thyoid gland .
the toilet seat has been saitized for your proetion .
bt what does tht mean ?
the toilet paper will also smea chemicals from solvents to dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bthroom sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply manufactured plastic cup , that allows serious toxins from the plastic itself into the water .
the atifcial sugar and the artificial cream as a nice touch to the mix .
) that was te cell phoe repeated , lengthy uses have shown to interfere with ad challenge the neurotransmitters of the brain .
as we finally turn off th light to sleep , electromagnetic fields from the clock next to yur head will lmost imerceptibly ifluence the slumber and dreams one hopes to have .
even the film to make this movie uses extremely oisonous chemicals in its manufacture and prcessing .
as ridiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one more hit for your body to fight .
the ood news is tht most of these toxins can be removed with strict adherence to the gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accomplished ?
and this is where the cofee comes into play .
unless it gets some help .
when coffee enemas ae utilized in conjuction with juice driking it is detoxification a its finest .
three tablespoons of dip ground coffee are dropped in there .
after a few minutes th burner is turnd down .
once the coffee is done , it is strained into a measuring cup .
dditional water may be added to make u for ater lot in steam in aking the coffee .
once the coffee cools to body temperature it is poured into the enema bucket .
that time , the plastic stopper at the end of he hose is slit back to release the air in the end of te tube .
simultaneously , the liver in turn excretes poisons into the colon for expulsion 
hunreds of holisti physicians , in he u.s. and around the world , have been traind by charotte n the gerson institute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united states to treat and cure a diseased patient in a hosptal with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides in southern california , it 's easy to her for driv regularly to advise and encourage the endless numbers of patients that arrive t the spital in ijuana , mexico .
under the care of a staff of hysicians and nutritionists , most patients who cme in with inoperable cancers and with no hope o recovery , leave within 1 to 4 eeks to continue the treatment at ome .
after only 2 weeks on the terapy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer no .
do you have children ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaka , where i am from nd i was diagnosed with a ...
you were diagnosed how , did you had a biopsy 
he ordered the biopsy and the pathology came back with a carcinoma .
and you had ascites swelling 
i had 10 pounds of ascites swelling in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy could also dry it up .
now several doctors have told me that .
how much ?
one course .
after i was finishd with my chemo and it did n't work .
ten you came here .
wow !
and then it 's been about 2 cm a day .
ever since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typical and normal one .
always eeking new ways to cheer up , empwer and retoe hope to the supposed hopeless ,
within the pages of each booklt are personal biographies and the medical records of recoveres .
healing lung cancer respiratorydiseases
my dad had told me about the gerson therapy .
my dady told me about this , and urig the research , i found ot that the best way to cure yorself is to do it the healthy way .
not put more poisons into your body that wuld kill you .
and that what chemo did ... it kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
when i go down to ul , i too did all my blood work and my mris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ca n't believe you 're one of my cancer patients.
that just really made me feel good every time i went in there .
i did not look ike a normal cancer patient .
to me , i have charotte and the gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heart , just do n't think i 'd be here .
when i was diagnosed wih cancer ,
i knew of three other ladies that ha the same cancer i had .
i was 12 yers old when my mom was diagnoed with cancer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'm steve , debbie 's husband .
when i first cam into debbie 's life , it was several years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ...
there is or charlotte the reluctance to et emotionally attached to any single case , since there have been thousands , but occasionally , a phone call would leave her efervescent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer see only in children .
it was discovered that th lung was too ridden with cancer .
and more horrifying still was the revelation that the cancer had made it all the way to the right chamber of her heart .
the surgeon than opened her sternum and started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from there , he moved to her heart and a open-heart surgery removed the tumor from the right heart chamber .
again ad again , with a vengeance .
now , even her liver was invaded by cancer .
) the doctor said , ( ?
) children told us that she is not gn na be able to ahm ... the cancer is back and she s not gon na make it .
we went back home and then , i think it was january or something , we were down , at the erson , and ahm ... nd we were doing the diet there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
) i had come down here sik myself ... ?
i had regular disinfectins all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and we 've been doing the treatment for two years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and life began to chang for the entire famiy .
even the dog was happy again .
but the oisons are now being excreted and her body is building itself back up with powerful enzymes and the nutrient forces .
bt where stephaie 's orthodox medical doctors had only given her 6 months to ive two years ago , she has now astounded them , and o course , confounded them .
i fel very healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
charlotte observed that they run around playing and enjoing life , as though te scourge of cancer had never visited his resilient cild .
there are also non-toxic , non-pharmaceutical supplemets called biologicals , that are utilized in a grater or lesser measure , depending upon the patent 's conition .
ne of the mst important of these is a natura potassium , mix of otassium gluconate , acetate , phosphat in equal amounts , that dr. gerson put together after doing nearly 300 experiments .
this is extremely beneficial to restoring the potassium in the body 's cels systems that was ost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sdium , such as found in table salt and hidden within everything , from processed foods to toothpaste .
table salt is a poison .
te use of inorganic sodium causes displacement of potassium found natrally in human cells , leaving them vulnrable to attack by diseass .
d. gerson ' potassiu supplement is disolved in a quarter of distiled water and incoporated in mall amounts to the juces .
it s a pleasure to show you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , essntially the leftovers , are used for fertilizer and animal food 
a tue mircle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max gerson did in the ast , really understood the value of flax oil .
that was n't anything that ...
actually , they edcated us more than we could even educate them on the value and the benefits of how flax oil really helped the modalities .
the use of these natural , holisti suplements on the gerson therapy s part of customization to the specific degenerative conditions of the patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but they can sometimes fortify gerson 's therapie effectivenes .
when it comes to helping the body recovr , whether from a common cold or cancer , today , oer half the medical visits in the u.s. and canada re to altenative therapies , despite the efficacy .
nd in the u.s. espcially , it is estimaed that our understanding and acceptance of holistic meicine is still 75 years behin the rest of the world .
medically , we trail many thrd world countries .
it is imperative that patients have access to such food hoices .
the organic food marke has increased almost 20 % annually for te past 7 years , mainl as the result of the economic law of supply and demad .
mass-produced commercially grown fruits and vegetables produced ith chemicals and sprays are fertilized with only the minerals :
but the plant , like the human body , really needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertilization rocss of commercialy gown crops , the plants were sick and must be kept on life support with more toxic chemicals until market .
his process is now repeated in the consumr , in simplified terms .
i know hat in th pst people had different prospectives of what was truly organic , and we would have some growrs come in and say well , their grows are orgnic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules and regulations such that anyboy who did want o become organic would truly be in the same playig field and would hae to abide by the sme sets of rules .
we have found that the attributes of truly doing a certified organi is benefical not only for the people , but also for he ground , etc .
so , that 's something that we truly look forward to expand upon and to rovide for the local community , and also for the people throughout the united states and world wide .
by popular demand , undoubedly baed largely on the disovery of the incomparable better flavor of fresh organic produce , organic farmers frequently start popular lcal farm stands with delicous samples of their produce for their neighbors benefit , before shipping their product to an ever increasing world market .
charlote gerson follows the gerson therapy herself as a life style of prvention .
she as no one as millions of others have discovered that the princples of the geron therapy raise the bar for getting the mst o life .
now , in her eighties ,
using the gerson therapy , one need never again worry by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesity is almost always nothing bu hunge .
and people are very hungry because , even though they are full , the ae not truly nourished .
it has been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , whee the dead food lies in state .
for many , it also grants them a higher vibration or spirtual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life .
day-to-day life experieces are fraught with perplexities that a be addressed to a negative or a positive way .
for example , cocaine and heroine addcts desroy heir cravings for rugs in usually less than 72 hours on the therapy .
the only obstacle that arrests or commences to subtract those books is long term lack of nutrients and envionmntal toxicity .
when the brain detoxifes , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional fog lift .
the body is a miraculous in its desig and flexibility .
these chemicals are found in virtually all municipal drinking water and inflicts severe damage in the body 's endocrine system , particularly the throid gland .
but there are other semi hidden angers in ingeston of daily poisons that can be avoide .
well , the dental amalam is n coming more and more nto the floor , even while dentists used to dispute it .
but in yur mouth it 's safe ?
nd it 's been clearly demonstrated that lot of children have seizures and al kins of mental disturbances frm the dental aalgam .
the danger of the illegal street drugs in public ad private schools is eavily publicized .
the rouble with ritalin is sometime ... first of al , it 's never been tested on children under 6 .
and they 're giving it now to children in preschool and kindergardn 
and the american services like the army , navy and the air force , will not accept any person into the service who is ever been on ritalin , because they 're uncontrollable .
during sleep , not only is the nervous system replenished like a storage battery being charged , but the body rids itself of poisons , in a way that only sleep can accomplish .
and with the bombardment in daily lif of hits to their systems in mdrn society , repeated lack of it can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain developmet .
the developing brain of a child at this time in human history , must clear a number of hurdls in a bid for genetic normalcy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabiliies i exposure to lead , especially lead from oldr homes , where leaded pant was used pirated i the 1970 's .
remodeling and sanding of oder homes produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust is breath in .
these airbrne heavy metals , alog with numeros other chemicals in the food and water , are now unntentionally passed on to th next generation .
but the reoval , known as chelation , of such toxins , even heavy metals , such as lead , is ossible with close adherence to the gerson therapy .
even the body itself can overproduce a substance that becomes poison in excess , in stressful situations , if the liver is unhealthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called adrenaline .
in an occupation that demands split scond life or dath decisions , the adrealine flos in excess , and if not neutralized , can poison the body into illness .
the ptency of this substance is profound .
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glnds , which are located on little caps on top of each kidney , it entes the bloodstream and is diluted instatly o between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the purpose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and protect oeself in threatening situations .
the largest gland of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able to neutralize the secretios .
many people have liver isease and do n't even know it .
for the detection of a liver problem va illness reuires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity before symptoms become detectable .
like many others who do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in h wildlife center , their health and rproduct ability must be mainained at ighst levels .
evetually , they were unable to eproduce successfully .
clearly , all arnivore animals uch as these were designed o hunt ad kill and survive on prey composed of flesh .
their teeth , stomach acids and short digestive tract er this out .
but the dissimilarities between wild meat eaters and humans do not end there .
invariably , some of them does n't pass through at all , but instea get snagged inside tiny pockets in the colon putreying not for hours , but days , months and eve years .
the pancreas was never designed to break down animal potein or meat .
when meat must be dgested , the anceas is diverted from is important potective purpose .
if we only eliminated the animal poducts from our diet , the odds of getting cancer , diabetes or hert disease and the pandora 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american diet , referred to as sad for short , has totally flipped that scientifically verifiable statitic upside down .
looking under a mcroscope , it is easy to see red blood cells floating around free .
urprisingly , some foods , like legumes , soybeans and soy products are eiter deficient in nutrients , or cause healh degneration , by blocking absorption of nutrients .
osteoporosi in the u.s. is very widespread .
it 's caused by milk drinking .
and the octors give it for suposedly curing osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the body has to mantain homeostasis , it has to maintain  very exact level of alkalinity versus cidity .
where is it going to take calcum ?
it is not absorbable from milk , because in the milk with pasteurzaton and all , the enzymes are missing .
an the body ca n't use it .
so , on the contrary , that adds to the problem .
i had canceled my health insurane when i was 34 years old .
and the reason was not that i was very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not interested n a kind of hospital or medical treatment that might be covered by insurance becae it 's toxic , it 's drugs , it 's chemicals , and i have , you know ,
ad over he years , i 've saved an average of us $ 2,000 a year .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
but that is not the only benefit .
even now  his applcaion of this therapy is unrelenting .
today , geson 's name and therapy is known and honored world wide by holistic physicins , nutritionists and chiropractors .
he also authors features stories for th bi-monthly

nice meeting you .
charlotte 's daughter peggy , along with husband giuliano and daughter etha , who live in italy , also follow the gerson protocol .

she remains etremely busy .
pat radiates good health and has a dep convicton about certain priorities in he life .
ironically , he developed cancer afte pat had recovered on the gerson therapy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas ancer , which is spread o my liver , gallbladder and spleen .
my husband just would n't acet it ,
i was on he therapy for 10 days , the bleeding had stopped  the pain had stopped , i came home , get the herapy for 2 years ...
after three months , my doctors her wondered why i was still living .
he asked me if i would have a cat scan , whic i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't wan to know what you 're doing , just keep doing it .
i hope they appreiate me .
at the time i wa fihting th pancreas cancer , we got a call from michael landon , ou may remember him , he was on little house on the praiie.
he had pancreati cancer .
he would n't go down to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy t ome with his family .
he wet on to the tonight show and he looked wonderful , and he said he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after he dd this reatment
and said he kne that was the end , that he should have stayed wih the geron .
and there is no doubt in my mind that he would b alive today if he had stayed with the gerson .
it is a meieval castle .
finally , after 75 years and tens of thousands of healed peple , the world at last is embracing thi answr t cancer .
and in recrded human hisory there 's also triumph and hoe over seemingly insurmountabe societal , individual and environmental illness .

your wealth , fame and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance .
your grudges , resentments , frustrations and jealousies will finally disappear .
so , too , your hopes , amitions , plans and to do list will expire .
it wo n't matter where you came from , nor on what sid of the tracks you lived at the end .
even your gender and skin color will be irrelevant .
so , what will matter ?
how wil the value of your ays be measured ?
what will matter is every act of integrity , compasson , courae or sacrifice that enriched , empowere and encouraged others to emulae your example .
what will matter is not yor competence , but your characer .

this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for the governement but mostly ...
mostly for a ... a hollywood studio .
this what at the time of the 'good neighbor ' policy ... and it ws my task to make a large technical documentary on the subject of the carnival .
samba orcestra .
voodoo ceremonies , paricularly in shango wich are praticed ... up n the favelas , those strange , native settlements on the ... mountains , which are right in the idst of rio .
he came to my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happens not only in south american governments , ut also in film studios .
and the witch doctor assured e that this ... wa deeply offesive and ...
and , i said i ws mos sorry about it myself and ...
i did want to finish the film and  did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in he time ...
uh ... already agreed on .
left th doctor , in my ffice 
to finish , since so mch effort had gone into it and i was pleading my cause for some time .
prayig that we would be able to .
and , i came back to the office and found tht e doctor ha gone ...
and to te neele was attached a length of re .. wool .
this was the mark o the voodoo .
the irst story , 'my fiend bonito ' , began shooting in mexico under the direction welles assocate , norman foster .
as producer of 'it 's al tue '
at the same tim he was preparing to produce an ac in the thriller 'journey into fear ' , but his plans were about to change , dramatically .
an brazi 's dictator , etúlio vargas , had nazi sympathizers in his governement .
so , th state department appointed welles , special ambassador to brazil 
we , the people of these uited nations of america , now stnd together .
we ought to know each ther better than we do .
it wa more of a cultural interchange 
i was told that it as my patriotc duty ... to go and spend a million dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
he had to get to rio in time to film the carnival .
so , he was forced o shoot 'th magnificet amersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoinng soundstages .
he id n't even have time to change hs costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , the first part of the new latin americn version of 'it 's all true ' , was temporarily suspended .
never to be resumed .
he finished shooting bth films in time to leave for rio , but it was a real cliffhager .
i went to the proection room at bout two in the mornng , no , four in the morning , and then gone on the plane and off o rio .
ask me again ... in six monts .
the lights failed to arrive , so he filmed 'arnival ' with anti-aircaft lights borowed from the brazilian army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to aptre a hurricane .
people get tired , they fall asleep , they 're going to lean against a house , that 's it .
as it tuned out i became fascinated with samba .
what was interesting were the samba clubs , and all of that which would have organized and tod to people , explained what it was , socially and all the rest of that .
welles had discovered what the true ubject of his film ould be .
thre 's nother side of rio .
can you hear it ?
no , indeed , if rio 's backyard is n't exatly gala it 's even gayer than rio 's front lwn 
it 's set to music , but the music 's all s own .
rich ...
dep ...
brazilian .
it throbs in the streets .
samba .
vargas had demolished praça onze to build a new boulevard .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his techncolo camera to commemorat the carnival of the streets now passing into histry .
welles joined the people in their protest .
at the same time he began filming the story of another protest whih would be th thir story of 'it 's all true ' .
a cry of outrage fro he poorest of the poo that electrified all of brazl .
he first read about it in time magazine .
four poor fihermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demand that brazil 's president give their people , the jangaderos , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazilian workers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the northeast , an incredible 1650 miles  without the aid of a compas  stopping along the way to find food and water .
jacaré was the leader of the exedition but jerônimo , a ma who could neither read nor write , was the pilot .
their junada was carried i triumph through the streets .
three months had passd since their voyage whn welles cme to brazil and the jangaderos wee still natinal heroes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' the jangederos story would complete his ltin america trilogy ... but jacaré 's political activities had made him a cause of concern for the aras governement .
i think that the vargas governemnt began o recogniz the fact that this was not going t be a film that would bring tourists to brazil .
i remember the night we trie to photgaph one of the tenement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us ad after a siege of beer bottles , empties of course , stones , bricks , and i hate to think what else ...
we retreated to a more photogenic district .
and , it occurs to me that since man and te world have o live with one anothe and get alng somehow ...
and they see a lot of people , lack people , and the reaction is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and down .
they did n't even hear the samba music because it had n't been synched up .
and all i kept getting were these terrible signals about this awful movie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 mnutes out o 'the magniicent ambersons ' and gave it a happy nding .
it might ave been wlls ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'amersons ' .
and ... the pictue itself destroyed me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a sunny , beauiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was full of sailboats , putting up sail , getting ready to reenact the jangaderos ... triumphnt entry into rio haor .
and ten , the impossible happned .
a wave of ...
we were devastated .
he must have made the decision a that pint that he would make this film no matter what .
i 'm sure ... was haunted ... by the feeling ... that the picture did have a cure on it .
a vice president was sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and send everybody home .
when we were recalled from brail there was till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i took that and went up with dick wilson and a cameraman ... and we made the 'jangaero ' documentary 
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , following their voyage and all that .
and , it was tragic because they did not get ... what they ... went for .
it kept them poor , no mattr how hard they worked .
it was o ... remind him of his prmises .
welles devised a little love story .
to get exreme low angles , he would put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performance from people who had never seen a caera before .
welles and his team finished shootig 'four men n a raft ' just in time to catch a wartime flht to the states .
once back , he learned that rko was not going to let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so , i was fired from rk .
nd ... they ... ade a great pubicity of point of the fact that i ad gone to south merica without a scrpt and trown all his money away .
that ...
i never recovered from that ... from tha atack .
he hired himslf out or the first time as a movie star to option the footage from rko .
for four years he desperatel sought financing to finish it .
i tried everything .
i was near it , near it , near it  and i wasted many years of my ife .
if i turned my back like they did on it , i would have been muc better ut
hat i discovered were 300 cans ... of what was calle :
so , i went and had one of the cans printed up and found out that yes , there as some thing of 'boito , and there was some hings of 'carnival ' 
it wa orson welles .
ladies and gentlemen , here comes the samba now .
of course , we all live with our past but i try not to ... encorage it to misbehave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unpronounceable .
urdo ?
correct !
ladies and gentlemen , the ... tambourine is not a ... tamburine !
it 's just a rough frae with sme kind of ( ?
cat sin !
pandeiro ?
-yes , something wrong , snor welles ?
oh , no ...
it 's all ight now .
ladies and gentlemen , this instrument oddly enough , is exactly like our tambourine !
wel , that s the way things are .
i ...
why 
why ?
-well , because f the sound it 's aking .
that 's a ...
yeah .
ganzá .
the gentleman here andles it with all the flare of a bartender shaking a cocktail shaker .
now ... we hear the cuica !
what 's that , carmen ?
cuica !
the cuica .
-cuica .
however , as you notice , it is n't beating like a drum .
one end is open .
when you yank it back and forth the ... that 's what you hear .
there you have it !
the rhythm of the samba .
brazilian babies can beat out samba rhythm before they can talk !

i think they 'r trying to be kind .
this cage stinks of gorilla .
cornelius , where are we ?
what 's happened ?
i knw where we are .
i know what has happened .
in some fashio -- and i lack the intellect to know precisely ho -- we have traveld from earth 's future to earth 's past .
but we saw the earth destroyed .
only since seein it , we have pased through a bckward disturbance in time .
did you otice the date meer clicking down aftr he shck wave it our shi ?
we have returned t earth nearly 2,000 years before is destruction .
apes , at this intn in time , can not yet talk .
oh , the river gave me this report from the air base .
yeah , it 's the usual imiative behavior 
mimcking salutes , handshaking , sitting on chirs , eating offplates with knives .
there was sort of
hi , dr. dixon .
the femal 's a bit uppity , sir .
oh ?
i see you 've preared the wisconsin ultiphasic .
we 'll begin with that .
all right , we 'll take the female fist .
arthur , would you set up a cha --
not a bite .
just as you ordered .
we 'll offer the banana .
well , why does n't she take it ?
because i loathe bananas !
arthur , i think dr. banton needs some air .
zira , are you mad ?
i did not call her mad .
i hate deceit !
and how in the name ofgod ae we to know that unless we communicate ?
and we can listen !
and we can watch .
primitie ?
could n't test the inelligence of a newt !
i am calm !
zira !
zira !
we 'll need a full autopsy .
let us know he the report comes in .
we will not hurt you .
poor dr. mil .
dotor .
ou killed him !
no , i did n't .
he did .
one of your own kind .
he 's a gorilla !
well , look , thre 's nothing to be afraid of .
do you understand that ?
humans ?
 'm a psychiatrist .
my name is cornelius .
lewis dixon .
nobody 's going t believe ths .
believe what ?
that primitive apes can talk .
primitive ?
uh ... well , i mean that in our , um ... primitive , um , civilization , apes ust do n't alk .
may i say something ... personal ?
good afternon , getlemen .
i 'm aware that what i have to tell you may conceivably create
omewhat wider thn th grand anyon .
it was one of two that have been missing in space fr over 2 years now .
have they identifed the bodies , mr. presiden ?
zoo ?
what would astronauts be doing in a zoo , mr. president 
reporters :
general !
no comment 
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a little later , please .
reporter :
later .
and if the questions become less simple ?
and i am the animal psychiarist who has been in charge of these 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect your work , but if you think you 're going to turn a presidential inquiry into a ventriloquist 's act , i have to inform you -
and i have to inform you , sir , that these two aps have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i repeat that they have the power ofspeech .
well , may we be told which is the feme of the species ?
have you a name ?
certainly she can articulate , which , in itslf , is extraordinary !
what is your name ?
zi-ra !
mechanical mimicry .
unique in an ape vocally , without a doubt , but , uh , does the other one tal ?
mr. chairan .
we 'll take that up later , your eminence .
cornelius , do you and your lawfully wedded spuse speak any language othr than english ?
what is english ?
i speak the language taught to me by my father and mother , who were taught by thei
it has ben the language ofour ancestors for nealy 2,000 years .
as to its origins  who can be sure ?
nonsense !
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkeed , pseudocientific geese !
i 've examined thousands of them .
and until nw , i 've only discovered 2 who could talk in my lie .
god knows who taught them .
where we come from , apes alk .
umans are dumb .
i 'm not sure .
when the spacecraft first landed on our seaboard  it wa dr. milo who salvaged i .
he studied it and halfunderstood it .
half ?
enough fo dr. mil to be murdered in your zoo .
enough for my wife and i to be here now .
from where , corneliu ?
of course the female knows !
that does n't make any sense .
cornelius , yo spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpanzees are pacifits .
in a spaceship .
gentlemen , do you hve --
no comment .
no comment .
as head of this commission , it will be ou duty to sit through the facts of thi bizarre affair and pass our cnclusions onto the president of the united states for implemetation .
what a load ofhogger mogger .
dr. hasslein .
no comment , please .
no commen .
no , getlmen , no comment ... yet .
doctor .
you were marvelous .
they loved you .
but only to lewis and stevi .
oh , zira .
well , you see ... we did know colonel taylor .
i mean , as a scientist , i sympathize , but i agree that that 's a revelation the masses would not take indly to .
i think you did the right thing in denying knowledge of colonel taylor .
what ?
they would have asked ifhe was still alive .
and is he ?
because from the windos of the spaceship ... we saw the earth ... destroyed .
i repat , talked to the presidential commission of lnquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recal , when you asked the male ape where he was frm , te female replid , from your future .
would you believe that ?
i think it is the only explanation .
but still somethng is missing -- and that something is still his real self painting th second picture .
so he regesses further and paints a thir .
he would perceive , mr. bnds , that time is like a freeway with an infinite number oflanes , all leading from the past into the future , however , not unto the same fture .
thank ou very much , dr. hasslein .
it 's certainl the most incredible story this reprter has ee covered .
they will , wever , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and the will be given an extended tour of the city .
this is bill bonds eporting for eyewitness news .
good night .

ho is that ?
we have heas as well as hands .
i call upon men to let s use them !
bastly .
ad dimas which means body frame .
its scientific name is a compoun of th greek kampto , which means flexible or bent 
its generic name , therefore , is lexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i insist .
now , is there anything i can get you , zira ?
well , i have a strange craving .
grape juice plus ?
lewis said only a sip .
especilly in cases ofpregnancy , you know .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorilla ' war .
we stayed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
whn we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
hen ther was a tornado in the sky .
i feel magnificently slepy .
the date meter on the spaceship .
and before -- before the whie ligt and the tornado ?
before the white light and the tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 ... something .
so ?
so you have eidence , mr. president , that one day , talking apes will dominate this earth and eventually destroy it by 3950 something .
and according to the nasa experts , who ae sill subjecting the spaceship to microscopic scuiny , the precise year ofwhat you merely inferred to be earth 's destruction s recorded on the flight synthesizer as 3955 a.d. , presumably .
alter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of them is pregnant .
mr. presidnt , herod lacked our facilitis 
he also became very unpopular , historically unpopular .
and we do n't wat that to happn , do we ?
i am saying that or 2 visitors seem to be charming , peaceful people -- or rathe creatures -- an that the voters love them .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the wrd , mr. president ?
well , not at the next election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know tht apes one day will acquire th power of intelligent speech .
by zira 's testimony , we know that she is pregnant with child .
by my own testimony we know that it 's genetically possible for this chid -- provided , of course , alays that we pemit its birth -- to bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb one in a presentdayjungle or a present-day zoo .
es , mr. president , i do .
i do n't know .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny 
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an assassin would say the latter .
well , mr. resident , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because he as evil .
we have no proof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mr. prident , ther are very strong indications .
are you suggesting tat they were improperly interrogated ?
let us say unprofesionally .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
havng convened i secret session at the request of the presidet , the commissin makes the folloing intrim recommendations -
the public should be informed
that the apes , afte their arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arising fom its intended publicity ,
there is justifiable cause for suspecting
to the installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we wee in space , we saw brigh , white , blinding light 
ooh .
then we saw the rim of the earth melt .
i withhed nothing .
nobody asked me .
but ifsomebody had asked ...
only the orillas and the orangutan .
what 's the difference ?
you 're all monkys .
please do ot use the word monky .
it is ffensive to us .
man destroys man .
all we want to find out is ow apes rose .
an cats .
of course , for man , this was intolerable .
so humans took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alert to the cncept ofslavery , and , as their numbers grew , to slavery 's antidote , which , o course , is unity .
the leared the art of corporte and militant action .
he articulated .
he spoke a word which had been spoken to him over time withot numer by humans .
no .
so that 's how it al started .
corneius :
where w come from , apes talk .
you recgnize your husband 's words to the commission ?
ys .
so humans were dumb .
zira :
zira :
i 've examined --
i ca n't remember .
complete the word !
call for dr. dixon , please .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothal .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the commissio 's authority .
and that of the president .
zira , i 've been asked to give you an injection --
-killing ?
will it harm y baby ?
lewis , you ca n't use that on zira !
really .
o , you must n't !
zira !
zira !
you do n't have to tell me !
no count backward from 1 0 .
thank you , dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this .
hm ...
not so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an --
anata -
whose anatomies did you ompare ?
apes and humans ?
ye -- es ... when they died a natural deat .
available ?
gorillas hunted them for sport in nets and wit guns .
noses , nervous systems  the various reflexes .
of the living .
you ca n't make a dead an 's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you ere advanced enough to perform experimental brain surgery o lving humans ?
of course not .
when you let , was colonel taylor alive ?
we loved taylor .
we did al we could to hlp him --
cornelius and i .
she needs a nap .
w must get this to the commission .
if you 'll be seated , we 'll get down to business .
by either ape towards the human race as it is presently constituted in this year , 1 973 .
the male 's attitude is hat
of a deeply intersted academician
with the true objectiit of a good historian 
the female 's case is different ,
will have become dumb brutes
with the intelligence of animals ?
it 's been oted that what apes will do to humans
to dr. hasslein 's convicton that these apes ' progeny
tis is a risk we dare not ignore .
therefore ...
the commission unanmously recommends
that the birth of the female 's unborn child
i now declare this commission dissolved .
they are avages !
jabbing needles into my pegnant wife .
i 've done tht too , dear , and worse .
they made me tell them evryt hing , cornelius .
brutes .
shll i tell you something ?
we ca n't live with lies .
how long ?
a week .
they treated you like dirt .
ma'am , sir .
chw time .
i 'm not hungry .
well , maybe somebody else is who ca n't tal yt .
oh , come on , ma'am .
it 's pure vitamin c .
grr !
nobody akes a fool out ofmy ife .
you 've got to come help me .
i 'l come right away .
itjust sems so cruel and horrible and-
i 'll see you .
unbelievably .
so do i .
but dead .
you 'd prfer the parents dead too .
gate four.just a minute , sir .
the lieutenant has n't checked in ye .
gate four .
well , i 'm sorry , sir .
good night , charlie .
okay , sr .
i 'll be off duty , but the rlief comes on at 0430 hours .
yes , sir .
i ...
h , my dear .
it 's urgent .
the apes killed their orderly .
on the run .
for that , they must be killed .
it has to be done before we start a stone rolling that 'll gather enough poson moss to kill us all !
i 'll fnd lewis an get help .
i just lost my temper with the boy .
science regards tese ape as unique .
i wan tem taken , yes , bt aken alive .
is that clear ?
quite clear , mr. president .
oh , it 's you , dr. branton .
th mokeys hve killed
what ?
i do n't blieve it .
drive caefully .
i did n't mean to kill him .
i hit him with a tray .
where 's zira ?
stevie ... she 's in labor .
get in .
sevie , you wo n't take us bac to the camp ?
now , wait a second .
let me get this straight .
you are asking me to risk imprisonment for the sake of two fugitive apes ?
i do it for you and for stevie and for your two disinguished friends .
uh , notorious ow .
the he with notoriety .
stand by and see his wife insulted ?
lewis !
saint francis would have
never .
the first chimp ever born in a circus .
los angeles s n't a circus .
lewis , i was not responsible for the death --
look at heloise .
mama .
mama .
zira , do n't waste your breath .
you know the child of two primitive ape ll never learn how to speak .
mama .
mam --
that 's good .
him ?
milo ?
milo .
congratulatios .
bu , sir --
evidently , we were wrong because yo have n't found them !
if that 's close , she ca n't have gone far .
where do apes go ?
aptain , i want you to start an immediate search ofevery menagerie , zoo , and circus .
i 'll augment your force with the city police , and i wnt to be kept inormed about all results .
you might have lived happily ever af ter .
but now ...
i did it ecaus i hate those who try to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him be dominted by you .
all i can now do to help you is give you this for the baby .
yes .
we 'l hang it around the baby 's neck for protecton , hh ?
yes .
and now , my dar , dear friends , before the polie come and the audience athers , you and your pretty baby must go .
lewis is on his way .
armando .
i should like to say good-bye to helois first .
tis is as far as we dare to take you .
th police have roadblocs on every main exit .
here are your supplies .
can you read a map ?
we 're at the city limits at th suthern edge of this oil field .
over this hill , you 'll pass throuh more oil wells , an abandoned refinery , and you 'll be looking down t a harbor .
it 's a gaveyard for old ships .
yo can hde there for a week .
a week ?
then you can travel with them to flrida , fond a coony in the everglades , and live hapily ever after .
it 's time that you were moving on .
lwis .
you 're the second human i 've kissed .
and you are the first .
she 's been wit the circus seven years now .
the baby 's birth was registeed 1 6 days ago .
ha ha ha 
we 'll catch them sooner or later .
later we 'll do something about pollution .
later we 'll do soething about nuclear war .
we think we 've got all the tme in the world !
like tars in space .
is n't it beautiful ?
yes , it is ... from here .
hmm ...
why do n't we get moving ?

now , in order to refrsh our memories , allow me to summarise what you said .
acording to your story c. c. whrto grabbed a shotgun and klld marshal potter .

just winge him , or he would n't e here to pay up .
how long have you been a dputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
hw many mn have you shot since you became a marshal , mr. cogburn ?
that was not the question .
how many ?
twelve to fifteen ?
o many that you can not keep a speific count .
i have examined the records  mr. cogburn .
a much more accurate figure is aailable .
come now , how many ?
countng them two whartons  23 
how much more dangerous for those arrested by you ?
was this revoler loade and cocked ?
just answer my questions , if you please .
yes , sir .
i always go backward when i 'm backing away !
aaron wharton was standing by a pot when you arrived ?
he was stirring the fire under the scalding pot .
how far did you back away ?
something like that .
mr. goudy , do yu have anymore questions for mr. cogburn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogburn .

aise your rigt hand .
mr. rooster cogburn ?
it s prtty loo because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .

my family has 480 cres o good bottomland near dardanelle in yell county .
my mother 's home looking after my baby sister and my brother , little frank .

mr. coburn !
you an get a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile fr eah of you , and i 'll give you $ 50 reward .
well , you 've looked into this right smart .
i man bsiness .
it belonged to my father .
well this 'll sure get the job done , if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim !
i 've got some horse-trading to do , i 'll have it y tomorrow .
well , i think tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medicine .
i 'd like to met your famiy .

i 've never seen copstiks work before .
chopsticks save your fingers .

i 'm artial to cold buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lemonade , neither .
yes , ir .
sounds ike a mighty easy way to make $ 50 to me .
do nt crowd m .
do n't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective bsiness all at the same time .
and $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advantage o me .
it is n't going to be easy smokig old ned out .
well , i hope you do n't tink i 'm going to keep you in whiskey .
no , thank you .
genuine , double-rectified busthead .
well , sis , my price is $ 100 .
i will think about your proposition and talk to you again .
now , i wan na go to the monarch boarding huse .
yu better walk me over there .
you can never tell what 's in a chinaman 's ind .
that 's the a he bests you at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i have a writ ere ays you 're to stop eating chen lee 's cornmeal forthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first place .
you ca n't serve papers on a rat , baby sister .
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rats .
give them rats a fair show , thy say .
well , what kind of a fair show did they give old man potter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i d a big hore pistol like that ,
i 'm not scred of no boogerman .
cream ?
i 've been waiting to have sme private words wit you .
 find a sweet distraction , as i suppse most men do .
i saw your mother ysterday .
what business did you have with her ?
it 's a likeness of tom chaney .
i 'm looking for him and i hear you 're looking for him , too .
i only take one step at a time .
i 've ben on his trail the best part of four months now .
i 'm a sergant in the texas raners .
chelmsford or chaney as you call him , he shot and killed the senaor 's bird dog .
bibbs threatened to whip him , and chaney hot the old gentleman while he was sitting in a porch swing .
well , you need not worry about chaney anymoe .
the sheriff informed me that you were loking for a man to go after chaney in the indian territory .
i 've already found one for te job .
his name is rooster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the fedral court , toghest one they have .
you 'll have o talk tat over with rooster cogburn .
it 's at least a two-man job t take him alive .
we 're taking him to fort smith and hang .
well , more so to me .
now , would n a hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pay for killing my father , not for some texas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but now i 'm of a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt .
one would be as unpleasant as the ther .
lay a hand n me and you 'll answer for it .
the children of texans are brougt up to sh a little more respect for their elders .
you ll push that saucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no regard for you , but i 'm sure you have enough for yourself to go arond .
the are al for sale except those four scrubby ones 
the heirs of the late frank ros .
i 'm matti ross .
i fear that is out of the question .
that hardly cncerns me .
your faher bought four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it while it was in your care .
you have no case .
you are impudet .
and he will make money , and i will make money , an your awyer will make money .
and you , mr .
licensed auctioneer , you will foot the bill .
lawyer dagett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.a.v .
g. , es .
all right .
sit down .
the ponies have no part n this .
i would n't pay that for a winged pegasus .
now , listen very carefully , as i wll not argain further .
my lawyer would not wish e to consider anything under $ 300 .
for that , you get everything except the sddle .
 would like to have that n writing , for hat it is worth .
when i have it in my hand , i 'll remi the extortion oney .
you 'll find it i order .
i prefer cah .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
i eems such a shame to redr suc spirited orseflesh into soap .
good morning .
sleep late .
you ai n't such an early bird yourself , baby sister .
i jus about give up  you .
i figured you 'd gone home .
yeah .
well , trouble is , tere 's no slats in it at all .
how much is there ?
you still game ?
one understanding , that we leave for the territory this afternoon to get tom chaney .
well , you 're not going .
i 'm not a baby 
i 've slept out at night before .
papa took me coon hunting last summer .
first night out , you 'd be calling , mama !
mma !
i 've left off crying .
i 'l find somebody ho is .
now , i know you can drink whiskey and i saw yo kill a rat .
bt ll the rest ha been talk .
i 'm not paying for talk 
i do n't know how you proose to do that frm the hog wallow you 're sunk into .
if i smelled as bad as you , i would n't live nea people .
i 'll be more than ready .
tere 's an old saw that says , one white foot , buy them two white feet , ty them .
i thought prhaps it was you .
no , it was not i .
nothing .
i will call him little blackie .
what is your offer ?
i will pay the market rice .
tell me this do you entertain plans f ever leaving this city ?
yes .
i ' off early tomrrow morning for the indian nation .
how did yo light on that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with grit .
well ,  suppose he has that .
i would n't trust him too much .
it ma prove to be a long , hard journy .
a good christian does not flinch from these difficulties .
neither does he ashly curt them .
the goo christian is not wilful or presumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong ?
i think you are wong-headed .
i 'm having a little convrsation with the marshal .
he 's gone behind my back .
well , a fellow that carries a big-bore sharps carbine might come in handy , if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something .
we do n't need him .
got everything ready ?
all but the grub .
there 's no hurrahin in it 
how much she paying you ?
is she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
five hundred dollars ?
yep .
bibbs was a little senator .
well , i guess i 'll just stick wit sis .
the ibbs family 's put up nother  1,500 for chaney .
have they now .
what are the terms ?
well , you can tll him to his face , you can spit in his eye , you can make him eat sand out of the road , you can shoot him in the foot , and i 'll hold him for you .
she ai 't going , anyhow .
she 'll make nothing ut trouble .
maybe i 'll catch this chaney by myself and take all the money .
how 'd you go about that ?
i 'd dispute your claim , i 'd muddy up the water .
i ai n't never seen nobody from texas i could n't shade .
la boeuf , you get cossways of me , and you 'l think a thousand o brick have fll on you .
that read money 's just a pig in the poke .
look at him grin , he 'll cheat you .
we 'll get yor man , that 's the main thing .
you sorry piece of trash .
i 'll send it to you .
that 's a big story .
you 've not heard the last of mttie ross .
you may well her from my layer , daggett .
lawyer daggett ?
who 's lawye daggett ?
red .
the iver looks kind of high .
yea .
well now , red , if i was to tell ou hat , you might tell him .
i would say , tom chaney , look out .

you 're not getting on this frry .

go ahead nd make another joke about it .
and i o n't like your converation abou captain quantril .

ned does n't go around killing people for no reson .
