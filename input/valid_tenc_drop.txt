i 'm ot figtig it .
i ' workin wit it .
i uarantee you it 's chemically imilar to that o athletes .
hen athletes get in the zone  hey eel as though they re atchig themeles un te ball don te field .
pinbal eins me of like dreaming 
beause ie when i m playing the ame it s like er ..
i 'm ot realy wit like reality .
bu et you 're watching what you 're doing and tryin to oncentrate .
it eall is a unique feelin to beome oe ith the machine 
it s sort of a ze wee ou 're sort of meitating and that 's all you 'e onetrated o is te piba .
you forge everyhing else .
ou a n't oe the ball out the mide .
and you rech it ou ad ou eelish it and you let all the people wathing know tha look a this perso , his person 's just done a very difficult thing 
en you ge to pu your iitials on it 's like , tere i a 
i own is game .
i put a lot of play tie in on this machine .
i try to deen it .
that 's m home territoy .
i a just simly ahea of te achine .
i was accuulating so any free games .
ad eventualy ater about thee or four hours i ha o go 
so in a sese there is a possiility you have e illusion a ou e on 
here is someting inevitable about losing at piball 
beause there is a feein ofe hen you 're playin pinbal that the acine ecides we you need to go ome .
the objec of play in inbal is a high score 
when you ee a truy skilled pinbal player , ou ealise it is a gae o skil , no a game of hance .
i s ure adrenaline .
o hat ou ae are players ho conrol the teo o the gae .
i see it with  sons , in all honesty .
thee are times when i stand back and ave at the fact that they ave te abilit ha they hae .
i look at a ame , i try to fid a weakness and exploit tat weaknes for my own ame 
this is a sport 
to tand and stay focused for at long , it 's pretty drainig 
i ' sore in my legs .
i m sore in m houders .
i 've alway waed to be chamio o the orld i somethin 
32 .
sunnyvale , califonia .
i stated laying when i was ten years old 
yeah , it 's the whoe thi .
pibal s gotten a lot more compliated nowadays 
i 's becoming more and more unclear to me how eople are gettig big sores .
yeah , ometies ou ee i all when you e playing reall el 
i can ee a all oing towads te out ane at 12 ihes away and now to do omeing right aay .
i 'll nue the mahine and when he bal get tere it just does this hing off the pot ad rols in 
e tip it a bit 
wipes it off with hatever .
e  got this routine that s only is 
i wan a o ha he 's doing .
and i ould be like on oe hand and one eel .
ou now , what i realy anted to do
as pla ibal but , ee  my mo old me that i shou ge a career .
because i have pinball as my own word .
a diamo in the rough that i have persoaly shined .
pinall 's somehing that 's done soethin for me that i had to discove or myself .
ha wa alreay there in a world tat gives us all kins of ipu about suf hat e do n't een want to hear other peole 's inpu aout .
a i knew that all that inut a mistaken .
piball is a world of specia rues an uique oppotuniies .
i ould even go as far as a i a special beause of inball .
i ve alays payed piall .
you d choke , you woud nt do well , and ou 'd ave to wait a yea to try again .
but pay o mind to i .
here 's a trong menta opoent to remain cal an in corol .
the best ayers nee do soehin that affecs the ball unless e do it for a purpose .
and al conto does 't mean alays catcing he bal , i mean puing te bal whee ou want it so you know wee it  oing o be next , not just wee it is ight now .
my moter ive with me in new jerey .
when i ell her i m going , she said , o aead and enjoy yoursef .

hat ' eally impotant when you play pinball at the wol hampionship level i to ge your mentaity straigh .
becaue everyoe is so ood that you need the mena edge .
and if you can baance tose two thigs you  e ubeatable .
ad i feel ike a outside .
i feel kind of like ... someone tat tey al tink tey 're bette tan .
ad i kno for a fact tha i can beat them .
one of the geemen hee , neil shat , as een in the finals tee o four tie .
and it 's lie if there is a pinal od maye hey 'e curing him beause he 's eco or thid pace , and he  so great he desere to win finally and so if i were to pick soeone to i ,
but sue , eah , it 's ough bu i enjoy ust the hrill of cometitio .

asoluely i think those guy ae simply better layers .

i roramme pinball maie .
i ok with designers and basicaly make te game o all o what it does 
i was i college , i was aroun 1986 .
it was about fie years afte tat hat i stated competig .
he easiest thing is to hit the flipper individually .
i do n't now ...
you know  when tey first ay .
mutibal here .
going to try and et one of the balls ove the other flipper to make a shot 
score some oints .
and i wahed tis peson methodicaly do a passing shot oer , make the sot , ki dow , go up , passig shot , over 
so i bounce the ball over to he other ipper , now it 's uder contol .
i ever hougt of playing pinball that way .
you say a inball ?
pay pinball ?
here we ae .
world pinbal championips .
ad ithin one wee there as a hurricae ame ivan hat ame up the east coast a the litte creek in fon of hee overflowed is banks .
ad here as nothing o e done .
everythin we had just inished wa wased aay .
i wa just rusated and wanted to e the place ceaned up so i could decide if i anted to tr again .
it did prove oibe to cean up an rebuild .
you ca have a great gae .
there are a couple o people o are i-ualiy plaers 
ver focused when the lay  tough to beat .
one slip and the ball goes .
and tat 's it .
it certainy presente an entetaient optio that was awfull compeling .
in 1980 ou could not possibl uil enouh video games o saturate the marke .
and all of a suden our inome doubled and tripled overnigh .
i just blew e aa .
an then the pinball sat thee almost foron-looig .
you ca n't see anhing excep the screen 
hen you play pinball you 'e playig a piece of equipment hat you can moe around ad control .
pibal achine you ca 't do ta 
it 's a pinball macie .
thee ' a beginning bu it 's edless .
i iished i .
the real bakreaker came when hoe video finaly hit the aretplace .
of either myself playing at ome or me ad my buddy playig at home .
but it really speled he end of ertainly the inball era .
it wa widely believed at e time that ideo games had usured pinball an thee as o longer a nee for pinball whatoeer .
piall wa back on te map again .
after a decade o decline , flipers are flapin 
bumpes are thuping .
pinball is bouncing back .
i a a ot of ife tied up i it .
it wa really a pesence and just the dail interation of the word hat i had a y doostop that i knew i as never gon na have again .
it was a ieefining moe that addens me ad still saddes me actually 
i go ou now and i see some of my old fried an i play iball and hat 's nice .
that 's jus never gon na hapen for e again .
o if you look at the dosie of it al , pinbal deserves a better fate han what i currently a .
in truth it is n't a big part of our uture any more .
but i 'm not sure ta anyone will care i 10 to 15 ears 
ere piball not to survive , te wold woul coniue but a lite bit of the fabric of lie ould be goe .
i tink that there is a fleeing sense of one 's aieté and inocece ha ames rig ou 
and a e ge olde , fo ma of us , we ep away fom doing those thigs tat gave us o wen we were younge 
and i tik tat tat os o innocence is oug .
and everybody should try it at some point in time .
you have a univee in a bo .
