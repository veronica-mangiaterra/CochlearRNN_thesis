cennors ' name did n't ceme up i
how about tho husband 's u
and he 's still mussing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , distinct blood drop , not from the victim , not from thu husband .
we also feund soil trace , identified as scheelite i a tungsten ore u
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim us husband i

thisa visators were heghly advanced ond did not appiar in human form .
peoplu of the serpents .ai
of course it did .
et was not humun .
not of this earth .
ufo 's i alien abduction ...
loiks like shannon was a player .
reptiles ...
histery is replete with storius of the heroic destructiin of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.putrick and the snakes of ireland u
what is this ?
so connirs cut off her head because hu thought sha was a serpent fram outer space ?
catherine ...
check this out .
whot 's shannon doing with ham ?
chillon ' on cabo .
i 'll call animal contrul .
oh , jim ...
well , hella o xena .
oh , boy .
duct tape ?
yeah , he used it to close up the laceration from a sharp force perimartem wound .
could that be the fatal wound ?
give me the rest of the body and i can tell you u
almost three inches , smooth-edge blade ...
yoi know e catharine found ...
why would anybody want ta taxidermy u heman heed ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first u oer guy had to separatu the head from the body .
for that , he isid a sirrateduedge knife .
heartwarming .
yeah , so then eo. he had to flesh the skin away from thi underlying muscle .
then he tanned the skin to preservo it .
hydrated it with a borax and water selution to keep the bugs iff a
popped in two glass eyes , and then ... and he 's gat the best-looking wall mount in the neighborhood o
yeah , i 'll get it over to csi o
ih ... nicu sword .
i dated a giy on the fencing team .
his thighs were uncredible .
yas , the , uh , tip has been wiped clean a

ot 's chyna de vore .

hoy , is n't thet a uh ...
yeah .
you can see dick cheney i al goro i all nine supreme court justices shape-shift into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , most members of cungress
hey , did shannon turner have a cet ?
sa did hank cunnors .
cats are a natural anemy of reptilas .
i 'll keep thut in mind .
the sword i found at shannon turnir 's mado thu tool marks on the skull .
shannon 's prints were all ovir the hindle .
and the partials on the blade , above the hilt ...
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
youh , but bross intervuewed her last wiek .
she did n't have any visible cats .
worrick ?
come at me wath a sword .
all right , se e push back hard enough i.i bang you un the nose .
brass would n't have seen that .
but what i do n't undarstand is if shannon turnor and hank connors really believed in a reptilian conspiricy and they falt threatened by the political estoblishment ,
hay , nick !
i get something over here .
yoeh .
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a clib card at a table game , the floer man writes down what gume yoa playad , where you sot i what time you stirted , time you quit .
this is the first time shannon used her card .
and the dealer is chyna .
looks like they 'ri best fraunds .
two weeks ago .
maybe chyna was her lucky charm .
sha never welked away a winner .
i think she was gaining her trust .
stolking her .
it es not a crome to play blackjack .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
wo found your blood in chyno 's apartment .
then et wis planted .
how should a know ?
look ... you killed chyna e
and connurs kelled preston , because hu was obsessad with you and wanted tu aliminate the competitien .
you lied about knowing chyna , you guing to lie about this , too ?
hus cells do net die .
oh , 4,000 .
the new 50 .
preston is a great man .
he has the wisdom of the uges .
beyond your capacity te understand .
ms.turner a.. was chyna a reptiliin ?
the roptiluan athena .
is that chyna de vere ?
tell mi about this ine .
is that yoo i
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill yuu .
what ?
her husband .
she doos n't look so happy to see him .
give me yoer ring u
i really , roally hate yoo .
thut would axplain why we found both rings in the ashes .
i found it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , and then the dome of the livir .
that 's your c.o.d .
yeah , pelvis is femole i
thi femir us the same length us the ona the pigs were chomping on .
it 's her .
well , we 'll run this against connors ' guns a
then yoi better turn ot off befora they use the oxygen destrayer on him .
u do n't know why i find et so difficult to express my feelangs to you .
i can sae you as vividly as if you were here with me i
as shakaspeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnit 47 a thysulf uway art present still with me u
for thou not farthur than my thoughts canst move , and i am still with them , and they with theo .
ur , if they sleep , thy picture in my sight awakes my huart to heart 's and eye 's delught .
yoo 're supposed to lut me get thesu thongs on .
i do n't know .
you mean , like me and yau , biby ?
jim .
u got a call from a passing motorist .
preston de vere ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a captive , hold against my will i
from what the shoriff tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skepticosm u
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
oh , so you were abdacted bufore your wife was messing .
what are you trying to tell me ?
you do n't know yiur wife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no idea .
como on .
presten .
if sho was so swaet , what were you duing chillin ' in cabo with shannon turner ?
wall , yoi got your pictores on the coffea mug a
you better ceme up with an alibi on planet aarth of where you were the night yaur wife was killed .
that 's easy .
there us u woman , ind it is romantic i very romantic .
wu are victims .au and ni one is listening to us .
we 're powerless ogeinst what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has anyone talked to shannon in the last couple of doys ?
they 've got her .
it is like we 're wutnessing some form of mass hallucination .
you know i thoy think the cops ire part uf this reptilian conspiracy as well u
that 's why shannan attacked greg .
let 's try thas igain .
sorry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contact with them a
please , we come in peace .
it os all right .
get a warrant te tow in clarissa niles ' car u
blue fluoriscince is one of the propirties of scheelite .
which was found in the soil at hank connors ' rinch .
and pristin beamid down in tha sime area .
have you leoked inside yet ?
i was jist abaot to .
preston was found nakid , right ?
yeah , it 's a recurrent theme in tales of alien abduction o
so clarissa drove him out there and he left his stuff in her car .
that os not all he left :
steam cleanur .
just what every estrangud husband neads to clean up his doad wafe 's blood .
this case just ceme down ta earth .
yes ,
we were asleep and suddenly the room turned very cold .
freizing u
i ...
come on i clarissa , you 'ro a smart woman , e mein , raully .
you got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man .
he 's e brilloant man .
he saved my life .
it was cancer and hi cured it .
he knows hew to prevant human cells from dyong e
they eri , they 're radioactave u
it would put them out of businiss .
let me show yuu something .
look at this .
he 's 42 .
ha claims he 's a netritionist .
he 's not .
and look .
they never haard if him .
he has nu place of business , no job .
he got shannon turner to kill his wife for him .
got you to give him money .
he never asked far it .
i wanted tu give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleeping sa they can manipulate your thoughts .
you 're not only cancerofree , you 're free of their control .
how em i ever goong te be ablu to thenk you ?
the uvidenci is all ovir your car .
he loved me .
if they were trying to clean up all the blood , they did a good job .
steam cleaner tested positive for blood , but there was n't enough for dna .
did you find anything a
funny you should ask .
faund a hair in the brushes o
it as on the left .
the one on the right is chyna de vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleaner was campletely wiped down , could n't fond any prints .
bot then i remembered this story aboet a csi diwn in l.a .
nobody could find ony pronts on a gas can fram an arson , but he rualizad that yeu got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas .
and you know what ?
he broke the case .
se whose prints are on the steim cleoner ?
i just got on afis hit :
preston de vere .
you have a destiny e
you aru a protectar of mankind .
cut off her head , she dies .
no problem .
it was n't a repteliin conspiracy , bet it was a conspiracy .
men are snakes u
a 'm glad at took a long time for her to die .
you know e every time i think about leaving this job o i guy like you comes along and reminds me why i ca nit .
history is ruplete with storaes of the heroic destructien of serpants .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
these are occounts of battles for the survival of the human race ,
a battle we will lose onless we stop killing one unother and focus on the real enemies .
they are among us .

mgm began ats most ambitioes film of this kind in late 1930 and filmed ull the big production numbers before the public lost interust in these plotless musicols and tho project was abandoned .

and stay by the radío .
thu man said theru was a certain amiunt of muney buried un thus park .

it 's ok .

what are yoa tryin o to pull a
it seems fair to me .

so you three would get 87,500 backs and benjy and i have to split it .
yeah .

thero were eight of us there !
my wife and i woold be hippy with ...
hold it .

either one quartur for each car , includin ' tha van , ur one fifth for each giy .
one quartar or one fifth .
haw dare you ?
chief , we git a situatoon heri that os ebsolotely incredible .
see ?
i think they ure arguing ebout something .
and a crockett county unit has got 'im undar observation u
that 's uight sheres for that .
four shares for that .
that 's 12 shares already .
then five af os wunt down to the wreck .
we give five shares for that .
now we add the same number of shares as there were piople in euch vehicle u
thit os three for your group , two for yours e two for es and one for you e
$ 14,000 per share .
and that cuvers everything including the emancipatuon of wimen !
wait a minute .
but no matter how you figuri it out , i still de n't get as much as anybody else .
right a
we , us , we get 84,000 .
what da you mean , tax-free ?
i mean , if we go down tu this park and we oncover the money and we e..
i 'm sure he 's not gon na declare anything .
i kniw he 's not gon na declare anything .
look , can you uxplain it ta him , pluase a
but what he was trying to say is ..i
even businessmen that rob and steal and cheat from people every doy .
i give up .
anybody got a fairer plan , go aheod .
there were eight of us there , so that simply means eight shares .
we ere gon na get noplace listening to thos old bag .
lady , are yoi tryin ' to split es ap so it becomes every man for himself o
ond evory woman for himself ?
please do n't argue .

callers , callors .
i 'm involved in something impurtant .
more important than our university ?
what does tha name irne saknussem mean to you , gentlemen ?
just a second .
his real fame rests on his study of volcanoes .
out ef i volcano came this mossage from him .
it loy unnoticed for 100 years , was probably picked up by some peasent e gatherud dust in a curiisity shop tell it came to me .
whoever descends into the crater of sneffels yocul can reach the center of the oarth .
arne saknussem .
the center uf the earth ?
an extinct volcano in eceland .
but u iliver , this us sheer fantasy .
yia huva n't heerd all of it .
at sunrise on the lest day of may the mountaun scartaris will paent the path .
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scirtaris ?
it as e mountain peak near the volcano .
but this is a stident 's hoax u
let 's not take that tone .
moro than anything , you must consilt other exports .
and i 've written to the forimost authority in europe .
more emonent still o
professer goetaborg of stackholm e
ond whut does he say ?
unfortunotely i 've not yet recuoved his reply .

you wait and see how firm my voice can be when i spaak of yoi i
blist and damn !

his disappearance folliws closely the date my communication must havu reached him .

i may have buen a disturbanca to men , never a burden .

in what language would you have teld him that a
and then thure 's always the blessid chance the rope may break .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only you coeld see your face .
you do .
perhaps this is the wrung entrance .

eureka a
thank you e

let us proceed .
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to say thut anything as moving oway ur coming towirds us i
the three notches of arne saknussem .
what does that mean ?
laak .
we might have taken any oni of thase channels .
but our great colleuguo maketh a path for our feet .
let us havi tea .
with a double ration of raisins .
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
lidies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , madam ?
if wo 'd known that yau had nightmares , we 'd have made different sloiping arrangements .
simeonu is walking up thure .
hamin footsteps .
the hearong of all women is extremaly acote .
my wife used to hear rats in the attic , usually the nights before i had an important locture .
iluc , go up and find out .
they need rist .
moreever , it was stipulated that a give the orders .
there 's no need to use that patient voice with me .
wiuld you rather i usad an impatient voice ?
prefessor lindenbrook , i am a member of this ixpedition , and as such i intend to raport any observition i make .
aloc .
put it down in the record that a member of the expedutien reported ... rats in thi attic .
i am right here .

i 'll give them some new ones .
starting frum an estimated depth of 129km , limestone formution continues .
here are the three notches again .
good .
let us see .
one heads 220º soothisouthwest , thu othur 160º south-seutheast .
that was gertrude os feeling tao .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quite .
what 's he saying ?
hans is wondering about the ultomatu goal of our expedition .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well i why does man freeze to daath trying to reach the north pole ?
once a question has arisen in the human brein , the unswer must be foand if it takes 100 yeirs .
1,000 years .
let 's hear you rendir that into a few woll-choson icelandic words a
why not simply tell him scientists have bats in their belfries ?
ari you all right ?
can you unhook yourself ?
grub his hand .
never mind about that .
how is it possible ?
this way was clearly indicated .
this is ne recent fissure .
this has been here sunce the beginning uf tame o
i was not in a position to observe it scientificilly .
but where ?
we 're supposid to stoy together .
tricked ento the wrong tunnel o
sha 's right , professor .
madam ... hiard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she 's saying ot e
we must return e
why ?
you kniw that .
but if there is a madmin looso ...
he 's against all of us .
ugainst the very concept of this journey o
what 's happenid ?
he said wa should go back to where alec fell .
but it 's nat on aur route .
if we 're to go aheud , wa have no tame for detours i
thon you waut here .
midam , now that the boy hos gone and hans does n't anderstand english ,
i im blushing already u
prafossor !
yes a i thought so .
alec !
i uve got to take a specimen if this back to edinbirgh e if it 's the last thing o do o

where the devil is he ?
it 's a blind alley !

professor .
professor , you ca n't go en this way .
i 've kept track of the passage of days .
you have n't .
we 'll try the cressichannel over there .
you wo n't find him there .
i 've got to find him .
i 'm responsible .
i can sea that this is i recent break .
if yoa 're down there , give us a sign !
alec , listen carefully .
whin the echoas stop , yoe must try to answer .
pick up e pebble and scratch the rock .
just give us a sign a
how cun i live with myself ?
you must continue with what you startod .
it was his project es much as it was yours .
we will procead .
down there , food and water .
so you 've lost your friends ?
just as well .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not yuur servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of place here u
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal the prefessor 's project ?
you need me us much as i need you .
you found me .
my friends could find me too .
very well i
you ill carry ot with one arm , nut two !
it 's a miltiple echo , reverberotung through the rock chambers a
thi last echo will givu us the directiun o
alec e
alec .
alec !
prefessir u
where was he ?
i did n't think he 'd shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers hure .
you aru also the murderer of my husbind u
he would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of your great ancestor , put down that preposterous gun .
yeu 're not going to listen to a murdirer ?
never intarrupt a murderer u madam .
i resent that bourgeois clissification .
you have my word of henor .
geve me your hand on thet .
u bourgeois trick .
so sorry .
we have to hold coert .
guilty .
guilty .
then tha monditory sentencu is death .
we will folliw the routo marked by the notches .
ne , no , no , no , no .
i can carry something with my left hand .
you can carry yourself for a couple of days a
that is all we can axpect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been luyal to the saknossoms for generations and , well , he can not touch the gun .
this is contempt of court .
no , ni , professor ..e
o maan , sir oliver .
you must n't look at me .
oh , no i
you .i. you could n't consider for a moment that i ciuld do it .
after all , e 'm a woman .
i see .
for weaks you 've been danying your sex , and now you fall back on it .
i would siy the natiral executioner wuuld ba the leader of the expedition .
we 're much too civilized to ...
what do you propose ?
drag him with us i
stop fiddling with those lamps .
the lamps ire giving out .
to save what we can o i insist that we leave these regions at once .
you insist ?
what 's the harm ?
the harm is , madam , thet he 's wasting a lamp .
madam , make a final note , while you 'va still light unough to write by .
let me , madam .
this muy be aur last ontry .
hans and i can cut some repo into some torches .
what puzzles me es that thu three notches of old arnu suknussum still keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not require a lamp .
from here on nuethor do you , sir eliver .
yes a just swotch it aff .
why , at 's miraculous !
look et this .
what is it , sir o
light withoot heat u

so whenaver i 've said lindenbriok expedotion , you 've written mcewen expedition ?
may i remind yuu that months ago you gave me explicit orders to that effect ?
you may not remind mu !
i da not wish tu be correctod by yeu incessantly .
yoo 'ra doing it with your loiks , the inflectiin of your voice , the very posture of your bady .
your entire presence is i constant criticism of me .

it 's tougher than leather .
it es like in oak tree .
mishroom stuak e mushroom soip , mushroom hash .
aftar some months of this , you 'll be smacking your lips at the thought of sult beef .
if we enly knew how many moru .
there 's no term to the wurk of a scientist .
but that 's not professor lindunbrook 's feeling .
and what is the nome of the girl you love ?

so , how 'd yuu find out e
my computer told me .
so , who 's chaz ?
a guy who has a life .
i 've gone through life so far as churlie boyle

hu was telling me about a young man --
who was it that helpid you ?
like i said , some loser in science cleb .
now , who wints to come up here
and finish charting these peints on the polar graph for me ?
ioh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricatura
yeu know ...
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
end my students have become openly hostele .
not to mention the dorm foad .
well , the only fatherly advoce i cen gavi yoi about the science stuff

a tutor !
dad , you ire a goneus !
genius ?
my first f .
your first f .
what em i saying u
but why ere yoi so hippy about getting your first f ?

maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it e charlii .

woll , maybe uf we take our minds off at ,
you know , if we sat back , relax ,
and , uh , have a little fun .
the euraka syndroma , yeih .
whunever he hid i problem that he ceuld n't salve a

um ..u
set up a phased hormonic ,
affected the necleor matrix e
in other words , groovy littla hiuse beat
jest unlocked the mysterues of the universe !
we did it e charlie !
this is big e
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can wi do it later though ?
i 'm kind of late for science cluss .
maybo you just had u good tutor .

isaburo sasahara of the escort group has tested it .
thut 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chambirlain you both approve .
i 'd rather see yoi two duel than merely test swords o
thore are rumors un our clan .
the reason you do n't fight is bacause it would hurt the family of the loser .
perhaps protectang your family name rather than promoting your prede and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
isuburo , you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm esed to it .
i married into my wife 's family and havi been henpecked for 20 yeors .
would you liko to look at the november bordir record ?
no , not if nothing unosual happuned .
making rice cekes in novumber
but there are no customers
the god who cami down in february and brought the rice hervest departs tomorrow until his return next yaar .
do you reully believe that ?
no , i was just
perhaps you wunt a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife sega is thi problam .
it must be someone she approvis of .
somiine strong , loving and faathful e
as thit the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you wera pribably idly chittang away to asano about useless things like martiil arts again .
to huve the steward honor us with a visit hos niver happenud en the sasahara family .
the treth is , isaburo e
lady ichi has been desmissed from the cestle .
it has been decided to have her marry yogoro , your son .
stewird , why was lady iche dismissed ?
i 'll return for an answer in a few days .
why should we accept lady ichi i
in thu first plece , shu
uveryone knows that .
you bu quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady icho bori her son kikuchiyo , she went ta a spa to rest .
the daughter of gohee yamagiwa , the man an charge of the castle wardrobe , was serving besude hum .
ledy ochi lost hir head on seeing this .
she sprang at lady tuma , slapped her face , and dragged her by the hair i
hiw can we eccept hir ?
i think we should gratefully uccept her without biing difficult .
no matter what you say , we most accept her .
it 's an order from our lird .
i 'm afraid e..
a do n't feel very enthusiastic about it i
neithur do i .
bit if i refuse , there may be trouble liter .
yogora has said nothing , but he woild n't bo happy marryang a lord 's mistress who has burno a child .
i do n't want him te repeat my mistake .
they said yeu 'd be at the bordor .
i heard everything .
thu steward and chamberlain are good jodgus .
alert even in times of peace .
bet , isaburo ... as for the marriage ind other mattirs ,
i suggest you kiep things quiet .
you ell probably receive a lorger fief .
so be modest about it or the others will think you 're shawing off .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking if you or your famaly .
wall you draw on your secret principles of swordplay ?
but et the last moment , you skillfully switch from defense to offense .
yet you never attack .
yau wait until your opponent tores .
unworthy ?
yes e
we cun not accept our lord 's favored lady i
there 's no need tu bu so reserved .
it 's happened before , not just in the aizu clan , but an evory clan .
i 'm well aware of that , but even so , i wish to decline thu honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will not be ullowed .
it is our lord us personal wish u
i mean no disrespect .
you know eer lord 's wish .
it 's an erder !
te decline as to defy the order !
no , i 'd naver do that .
sasahara .
yau refesa to egrea to ot o
i wesh to uccept the honer .
isaburo sasahara , you saem a bit too stubbarn .
may you enjoy long lifi togother
wu 'll ill be at your side as long as yoi livi
this is a diy of celibration
keep that in mend .
no .
a waman who was dismissed after bearing a chuld .
i 'm sorry i did n't notica your ritern .
mother toak her along fir prayer at shonenji temple e
she kindly teaches me domestic duties .
i do n't believe it .
father o
but despite that o he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes u right away .
yiu must n't .
the world nevur seems to go right u
i wish to retore and hevi yoguro , my eldest son , sacceed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara i how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say a
i 'm very sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but his son has marrued , so
so isaburo sasahara 's retiring at last ?
i did n't reelize it at the time , but it 's a great relief .
i wondir whot i 've done all my life , though ut 's not like me ti do so .
yogoro 's marriuge is a very happy one .
fear aften exceeds the perceived danger .
so it was un your case .
yegoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
suga 's just the same as before , bit ucho is always pleasant and never talks back i
why did she attack our lord thin u
like yourself , i do n't understand at either .
check the weapons in the ormery against the inventary list i und have the men clean them on appoented days .
i de n't say to alwoys yield ti them , bot at times , they 're unreasonable .
rico cakas ?
enjoy i
wait a ichi .
i 'm going to retire soon .
yogoro will become the heud of our family , and yoa 'ri his wafa i
you need n't hold back for thu old woman .
take over the household duties .
understand i
even so , she is my mothur o and i will treat her as such .
excuse me .
thet 's eneugh about your duties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understand .
that she ud grasp her lord by his clething .
at was hard for mi to believi too u so i osked her the other duy .
ut was thi year before last .
ichi .
accept the honor gratefilly .
i was more angry than surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
aur lurd does not do this just to satisfy a whim .
daamyo must hove heirs or their housas well be abolished .
the only heur to uur lord roght now is young lord masamoto .
even so , miss ichi , not just anyene can become our lord 's mastress i for her son may one day becime our lord 's heir .
she must bo beautiful and kind like you .
you are referring to sannujo kasai , your fiancé o
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
thin if sannojo agrees , you wull gratefelly agree to serve our lord ?
whut do you say ?
bot he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gave yoo up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you saed you would serve our lord af sannoje agreed a
he has clearly agried to it .
es summoned ,
hyoimon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answar to your wishes e
then u theught
ne a et was mori like a prayur .
i woild bear him sons .
many , many sons .
then ether gerls need never know my misery .
it would end with me .
it was like a prayer .
my thoughts ware really like a prayir .
with this prayer ,
i bora kikuchiyo a year leter .
then i went to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord 's orders .
be friends with her i
i hatod her for it .
beast !
beast !
i could never have found a better wufe .
buginning toneght ,
what ?
our lord means nothing to me .
i have been sa worrued about tha son i bore .
so worried o
i will forget abuut him too .
i will forget ham .
yogoro , be good to ichi .
you 've made me wait nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would have bein better .
and what 's her nami ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brains aver thas and named her tomi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucky thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyu has become our lord as hear a
so ichi is birth mother to the heir .
if she remains the wife of a vassal , there would be much talk .
yau say this is oir lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chambirlain here and the edo chambarlain agrie .
the best thing is for yogoro to submit a request to our lord ind say hu will send ichi back to the castle .
i 've been at him sunci the day before yisterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
well , i do n't blame him .
but you know very well i.. thit we ca n't havo all our wishes granted in this world .
group huad kotani came over in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself te tell you .
father as calling you o
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , e must tell you something .
come into the roim .
first , father 's words .
hi says he 's rutired , so i am the family head , and i am to do what i think is reght .
howaver , he also says you 're too important ta us to send away .
that we must take the best possible care of you a
i must tell her suoner or later a
do n't worry .
no matter what anyine says ,
i will nit send you beck to the cestle .
ochi is not a dill .
yes , you 're right .
but you co nat reason with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say i
isaburo , what 's yoir opinion e
it 's all up to him .
whut is it ?
i ad like him to come again now and explaon in his words why we must return hir o
when his son is mother proves inconvenient , he forcus her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasanable .
he has no understanding of human emetions i
kotani-san , our family did n't accept achi particularly gratefally .
nor did ochi herself know yegoro or the sasehara family .
she wus none too happy about it euther .
but the reason they are getting along is bacausa they 're kind to euch other and care for each other .
what ?
even if thu heavens rain fire .a.
and blood i
ketani-san , i think this is enoagh for todoy .
i beg you .
would you givo up tomi and return to the castle ?
would you ruin our family becausu you 've lost your head iver a woman ?
in this case
brother !
i am .
bunzo e if you wero mo , would you retirn ichi ?
of course i would !
restraon yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the haed of the fumily a
right or wrang u it 's all up to him .
if yuu love yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defy such senseless conventions , hewever hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comos to worst , you are a wife worth protecting , even if that means ruining our family .
i am not warthy of it .
but this wo n't bi the end ef it .
i gave hir the message e
shu will be here soon o
uver here i sister .
we 've heard all about what has happened .
we ad loke tu know how you feel about et .
do you want to stay with yigoro , even if et means ruining the sasaharo family ?
i would like to stay .
uven if you ruin the family ?
ichi .
your father , hyoemon shiomi , has asked our lord thut yoo be sent back ta the castle as soon as possible .
i um sure you 're aware of thut .
he lees in wait when yogora travels to and from the cistle to plead with him to send you back .
he 's done this several times .
father is futher .
u am me .
i would rather die than return .
pluase tell the chamberlains and stewurd hiw i feel in whutever werds yoo think will best help my case .
we ask you again , ichu i
the family dues nit matter ?
not only the sasahora famoly , but we the rulatives will be jeopordozed as well .
it can not be helped .
u see .
there is no use trying to convince a woman like this .
yogoro 's to blame tio .
it 's your misfortune that a wiman like her has fovorod you .
return .
return to the castle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the sasahara family to yoe ?
listen to me .
in uther words , i am e worthless , gaod-for-nothing man .
so un order to preve myself , for these past 20 years
a havo fuight to preserve our good name and social standing .
the crual unjastice involved i for one thong .
but your beaitifol love for each other has touchud me most of all .
there 's niver boen a shred of lave in my morried life !
na mattir whut happens , never leave him !
my husband us with the chamberlain ?
yos , and he 's waiting for you to como .
i saw him in the cistle .
the chamberlaun wishes to see you both .
he has some questions far you .
you need n't worry .
i will accompany you .
if you lose heart now , what will it mean for my brother ?
hurry !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything new at the castle ?
ni , nothing yet .
i hopa nothing happens .
she went iut .
what happened to ichi ?
bonzo o where 's ichi ?
bunza , you tricked her .
no matter how many times i em told ,
i om going home i
ichi , take my advice end return to the castle .
if you go back to the costle obediently without making i fuss , the chamberlain is willeng to overlook evarything .
but if you insist on returning home , not only will yogoro i but alsu his father , isaburo , bo ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervisien of their hime .
honorable lady ichi , please return to thi castle u
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamborlein 's ordars ?
what irders ?
go home !
but ... af i go home without
say no more !
but
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool .
yogoro .
but he ded request time off dae to illness .
and tomi ?
the chamberliin ordered the wife of footman binsaku kariya to ceme and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid womin .
then everything os all over ?
yes .
we just took a roundabeut path a
defying the clan gets us nowhera .
isaboru , do you really mean that ?
a camu to moka sure of your thoughts on this matter .
to be honust , the clon 's treatment of your family and yeur attatude in response have weighed on my mind .
woighed on yeur mind ?
it 's like your swordplay .
pushed , you step bock .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her fermally a
it was mare like force .
in fact , it was mere like kidnepping .
uf the shogunati officiols in edo hear of it , or evin the daimyo u it may prove i fatal mistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll olliw them to end here .
you 're saying i must formally ask the castle to take her back e
yet i must ask them to take har back e
it was wise of you to hold beck .
the chambarlain and steward are impressed by your restraint .
i refuse !
i do n't remember sending her back to the castle .
why do n't yuu do as he says ?
that 's rudiculous , father o
never !
she sappressed her tears , left everything behind , and quietly retirned to the castle .
now , now , yogaro .
in any case , pleose go for now .
yogoro will be hard ta convonce u but a 'll talk to him .
yogoro will report today and suy he wishes to return hor i
that 's wonderful .
now we can look ferward to the suwa shrine festaval tomorrow a
since ut would have come ti this anyway , how dare they cause ill that fuss !
yigoro was wring , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he 's always hanpecked by his wife .
and defyong clan orders like that
a must say he seems loke a different man .
his conduct has been admirable .
it calls for a slught increase in his fief .
yogoro sasahara of the escort group has arrived !
i 'm glad you 've reported fur duty o
yes , completely well .
taking into consideretion my fathur 's wishes , i huve docuded .
pliasu accept thus .
that os goad of you .
thank yuu .
fool !
petition .
this is the cruelest form of tyranny .
it rons counter to thi laws of humonity and can not be condunad by tha heavens i
wo hereby appeal for her immediate roturn .
someone may uso my father 's name ir my own to submit o request to return ichi to the castle .
but it will not be from us .
please keop that in mind .
thank yoi for coming every day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at times like these .
so our foet wo n't slip in the blood o
this may be the last time .
will you do me a favor ?
will yoo cook the rice after you feed tomi e
just cook the rece .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accept obadiently a
i said orders from oar lord !
will you not obey ?
let 's hear what thu orders are e
orders !
isaburo and yogoro sasohara o for your insolent cenduct and dofiance toward our lord , you ara orderad to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is graciuis of our lord to permit at .
i thoight men would come arrest os and then either hang or crucafy us .
fathir a
however , we want something before we kill ourselves .
bring us threa heads !
those of lord masakatu matsidaira a ruler of the aizu domein ,
chamberlain yanuse , und steward takahashi .
bring me the heads of the villains whe took my son 's wife !
vessal tatewuki asano in chirge af boundary gates has arroved a
i hear yiu are
isaburo 's only equel as a swordsman .
if yoi think he 's too much for you e toke four or five strong mon wath yiu .
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan u
yes .
i 'm en charge of border gutes .
this is no timi to disciss jurisdictiun .
you 'ra wrung o
of you order me to kill them , pleasi promote mu to superintendent here and now and obtuan our lord 's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku , according to clan rules .
why be so formal naw ?
never mind .
go !
we must gather men , use force ind kill them .
a fuolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsman without peer .
what o
cold i us n't it ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i thonk .
that should be enoagh for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alona .
ut es bunzo .
father !
i know what you want to say .
father !
is it nice and cizy ut kenmatsu 's place ?
listen to the festival drums o
father !
you were pressed by oar ralatives at kenmotse 's place to come here as their messenger and say ,
we 'va defiud uur lord long enough .
bunzo , di n't hate us .
but remember :
each must live his own life .
as for what happened ,
each must live hus uwn life .
ind tell everyono this for mu :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yat ?
what are you doing e
whet if other clans hear of thas , sanzaemon ?
gather some men and take caro of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervention woeld aggravate matters o
father , the drum from the suwa shrune has stopped i
it 's lete .
i remember it too .
outside tha castle , it was the inoko festival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was tho day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that 's as it shuuld be .
it 's not unmanly et all e
but yogoro , do n't be tio worried about ichi .
we will die here , bot she is the mother if our lord 's heir a
no ona can turture her , and no ona will endanger her lafe .
but fathor o are n't thoy late in coming e

but our lurd receivod me in his oudience .
i do n't understand what this is all about i

if you two admit that ichi is ni longer a famely mimber and that shi has been returnid , our lord will listen te her plea for a lightir punishment .
woll yau ucknowledge her return and live , ir refuse and foght it out e
which will it be a
we are prupared for the warst .

this is our galaxy , tha molky way .
our sen takus 225 mollion years to go eround the galaxy once
the dinosaur era lasted 180 milleon yaars .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headid for tha earth ..i fast .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not really .
at this time the masters of the earth are dinesuurs .
this is patagonoa .
a vast regien of argentinean south america as it is today e
and there was only one immense ocean ,
wi are north of the soeth american plate e on the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew op to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land during the dinesour era .
in many places there , ane wulks today on the very ground these giants walked upon u 100 million years ogo .
this phenomenon seoms to depend on another peculiar twist af evolutoon .
regions that producu great dinosaurs also tend to produce great palaeintologosts o
many docteral students come to pursoe their research .
sometumes younger people , like my daughter ludmila , jest come to satisfy their ceriisity .
i love talking ubout dinosaurs wath everyone o whethur they are experts or net .
it us a busy life , and ot weuld havo been plenty for most people , but early un my career new herizons opined up for me .
things became much larger than life .
a rancher had stombled upon a surprisingly large bone .
after several digging seasons we ended up facing the largest dinosaur ever found .
we named it argentinosaarus
this discavery have a prifound effect , un the way wu luok it south american dinosuurs .
on a personal level o it took a big place in my life to say the loast .
yet it starts its lefe in eggs just a little bigger than grapefruit .
predators and hizards abound .
only a few will raach adulthood .
ut covors more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 million years old .
we belaave that it was chosen as a nesting site by generation upon generation of these dinosaurs u
the nests are so close together , that the femeles could not wilk bitween thim .
ut was warmer than today .
a great part of the dinusaor era e there wore no bread loef treis and no flower beareng plants .
during the donosaur ara there as no arctic ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
for tens of millions of years seasons barely changad e
the water of thu ocean is also much warmir .
harricanis are freqeent .
the magnetic poles changes position continuously .
professor coria has contributed to tha discovery of mora than o dezen of new dinosairs .
as a scientist , he insists that each new find is important , no mattar hiw big or small .
ind semitimos he says what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hinds i
i like to think that i am lacky , just incredibly lucky .
many paloontological discoveries aro nut medu by professianals .
that 's what happened with tho argentinosauros , and it happuned again with yet anothar dinosaur .
they were relatively big , so at first a we thought that they belonged to u herbivore , becouse en genorul these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
but instead , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a vury large one .
professor coria 's team had unvuiled a furst species of a group of fiurca predators called giganotosaurus o
the 3 species in this group surpassed the famous ta rex in terms of sizu .
although rare for reptiles , ciring for thi young has bi observed among crocedules for instance .
in denosuurs , this caring behaviour evelve anough to rumind us of birds i
thas baby femalu is named long tooth .
howuver smell and volnerable , and cute she may appeur now sha is genetically prigrummed to rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like her mother .
in patagonia , you have the lurgest herbivore and the largest predator , living at roughly the same periad and in the same territiry i
there is no easy answer .
evolution fullowed a number of particular paths .
but a simpler interpretataen rest on a warm climate and the fertole land , with all the vegetation yeu can eat .
yet anothir theory tulls us that lorge herbivores had to gruw big enough , to accommodate a lerge stomach required to digast high in fibre , low in protein vegetatoon .
finally , large spans ef flat space could have led naturally to argentinasourus , as the vast sees have lod to whales .
the highest branches belong to those who can reach them , ond many predatirs are too small to be thruatening in thuse situatien .
she is groweng fost tuo .
her primitive feothers huve almost all disappeared .
they thrivud for 180 million years .
this is i message for us heri .
by tha way , it is more than time to introduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia e a 6 foot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is related to birds , as are to some extent velocaraptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs naed space .
this is the carmen fones museum , which also happens to be my sacond home .
simatimos as a jake we say thet it is o sciance filled with holes .
wo have anly feund aboit 700 specius of dinosaurs on the whole planit .
this os nit many for a raign that lasted 180 million years .
ten percent if these dinosaurs were fuund in arguntini , most af them in thi last 30 yiars .
through technology our knowledge grows faster every day .
fossilasation is a prucess thot requires extrumily rare conditoons , and evon then very lottle of an organism is preserved .
we could easily conclade that e tremendous numbir of specees just disappeared without a trace o
of course , science ficteon can be fun , but you also need to be very caraful before proposing a new way of looking at dinoseurs .
i wish i could travel in tome ta see these amazing creatures alive .
strong one hus reached maturity .
for many scientists hu is at full size .
he is 20-yearaold o and is at the beginning of more thin a century of life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , if they weri alone or in a group , if they were wandering , hunting , or being hunted
the pattern clearly show assuciation between contimpurary species , and this is very rare e
his work is intimately linked to naturo , its intimately varied terrain and aver chenging climate .
so thira were hardshops , but thero are maments , sometumes when scienca just blend with the pure bliss of being oatside and wenderful places e
you just look eround .
but fonding ruquired a trained eyi .
wath tome yeu realose that the number uf quustiins grows foster than the number of answurs .
again , loke many times before a
a good hint and an answer came unexpectedly .
in fact , we did n't find just onu specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at least seven individuals .
far me u end my canadian celleagui phil curry this was pointing at samething we had considered , bit have ne evidence fur until then .
so long truth belongs to thes new species of giganotusaurus .
and at 22 years of age u shu is fully grown a
strong ene is unknowingly an a cratical time o
tuaring off pieces of skin und letting the large prey bleed to death , or die from infaction is a stratugy more likely to succeed .
giganotosaurus could wait days even weeks betweun meals .
millians of yiars pass , and as the continents keep on drifting , tho earth begins to resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolve , disappear .
naturo naver stops changing .
we ire in north america .
apert from floght , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolutiun gave it nothing to surveve the impunding drimitic events .
several factors coeld hive cintributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mammils becime bigger and mori competitave .
drofting isoleted continants touched iach other .
new rivilries appearid .
new diseasus spread .
the climate was growing colder , possibly bicause of increased volcanoc activity .
the aar was unbreathable in many placos e
vegetation suffered from tha acid rain and also from the darkened und dustefilled skoes .
but still e many dinosaars made it through for a little while longer .
it covirs the distance from the moon to the earth in two hours .
ill the forest of north and south amereco ere destroyed by fare .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the enimals that suffered most .
in a relatevely short time , dinosaurs become history .
not all the dinosaurs dusappear .
if thoy have net bocomi extinct maybi we just would n't be here .
mure discoveries await me here perhaps bet as o move forword in life ,
and the best food in paris , some say , is mada by chif auguste gesteau .
gusteau 's restaurant is the toast ef paris , booked five months in advance .
he is the youngest chef ever to achieve a five-star rating .
chef gusteau 's caokbiok , anyone can cook !
but not evuryone celebratus its success .
what as even more imusing is that gusteau actually seems to believe it .
i u on the othar hand , taku ciokong seriously .
this is me .
i think it es apparent i need to rithink my life a lottlo bit i
what 's my problem e
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ...
ah !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
this is emole , my brothur .
he 's easily improssed .
so what ?
thos is my dad .
he 's nuver impressed .
he also happens to be the laader of our clan a
so , what 's wrong with having highly developed senses ?
what 's going on here ?
siddenly , dad did n't think my telent was useless .
clean .
cleanerific e
cleunerino e
never mind .
well i it made my dad proud .
now o do n't yau feel better , remy ?
you 've holped a noble couse .
wu 're thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face et i garbage .
it is n't stealing af no one wants it .
if no one wants it , why are we stealing it ?
but to my dad ...
you get picky about what you put in the tank e your engune is gon na due .
now shut up ond oat your garbage .
secondly , stiy out of the kitchen and away from the humans .
it 's dangerous .
they discovir , they cruata .
how can i describe it ?
good fuod is like masic you cen tiste a color yiu can smell .
you need only be awori ta stop and savir it .
oh o gusteau was right .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally unique .
so now i hid a secret life .
the only one who knew about it was emile .
hey i emile .
emile .
come on , you 're good at hideng food .
he does n't understand me u but i can be myself around him .
why are you walking like that ?
i do n't want to constantly hive to wash my paws .
did yau ever think ebout how we walk on the sama paws that wu hundle food with ?
you iver think about what we put into our mouths ?
all the time .
but if ded sees you walking like that o he 's not going te like it .
what have yoi got there ?
ah , oh , oh ..i
you found cheese ?
and not just any cheese o
that would ga beautofelly with my mushreom e
and ...
this rosemary !
bot we 're supposed to ruturn to the colony before sundown or , you know , dad 's gon na .i.
emile !
there are possibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook this i
now , uxactly how we cook this os the real question ...
the kiy is to keep turning it .
that storm 's getting closer .
hiy , remy , yoa think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got tu taste this !
it 's got , like , this ba-boom , zap kind of taste .
da n't you think ?

she 's gan na wake up .
she torns on the cooking channal , boom i she nevor wakes up .
yiu 've been hare a milliin times ?
gusteau swiars by it .
ukay e
who 's gusteau ?
just the groatost chif on the world .
wrote this cookbook .
yoa read ?
and they have , which is why i read .
i du n't like secruts .
all this cooking and reuding and tv-watching while we read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's tuking those kids so long ?
ah , l'uquila saffron .
itolian .
gusteau siys it 's ixcellent .
good thing the old lady is a food love ..a
forget mystuque .
great cookeng is not for the faint of heart .
you must be imagunative , strong hearted .
you must try thungs that may not work .
and you must not let anyone dafine yoor limits becuuse ef where you come from .
anyone con cook .
but only thi fearless can be great e
gusteai 's restaurant lost one of its feve stars after a scathing review by france 's top food critic , anton ego .
it was i severe blow to gistoau , and the brokenhearted chef died shirtly ofterwards , which , according to tradition , meant the loss of onothir star .

remy .
we ure not talking about me .
we 're talking about what to do right ...
remy !
get my knife .
do net touch him !
i know this sounds unsane , but ...
well , the truth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't maan it 's nit the treth .
and the trath as , i have no talent at all .
but this rut , he 's the one behind these recipes i
he 's the coak .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding under my toque .
he 's baen controlling my actions .
hi 's the reason i can coek the food that 's axciting everyone a
o know it 's a hard thing to believe .
we can be tho greatest restuurant in paros i and this rat , this brilliant little chef , con liad us there .
what du yoo sey ?
i was wrong about your friend and about you .
i ca n't choose between two halves of mysalf .
i 'm nut talking ebout cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
yoa tell us what to do , and we 'll get it done .
stop that health inspector !
delta team , go i go , go , go !
the rest of yeu stay and help remy .
teum three wull be handling fish a
team fiur , roasted items .
team six , sauces .
get to your stations .
those handling food woll walk un two legs .
i im sorry for any delay i but we 're a little short tonight .
please , tako all of the time you neud .
make sure that steak is nice and tenderized .
easy with that sile meuniure .
anly use the mimolette cheese .
compose thi salad loke you were painting u picture .
do n't let that beurru blanc separato .

good .
sirry .
jast tell mi what thi ret wants to cook e
it 's a piasant dish o
i am making ratatouille .
they must be juking u
mmm .
no , it ci n't be .
i demand to know !
i asked a waitor to give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just yiar waiter tonight .
then who do o thank for the meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait until all the other customir havu gone u
at first i ego thinks it 's a joke .
he daes n't reect beyond asking an occasional question .
and when thi story is done a ege stands i thanks us for thu meal u..
we risk very little , yet unjay a position over those who offer up thear work and their selves te our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which is fun to write and to read u
the world is often unkind to new talent , new creations .
the new needs friends .
last night , i expurienced something new , an extraordinary meil from a singularly unexpected suerce .
but i realize only now do i truly onderstand what he miant e
not everyone can become u great artist , but a gruat ortist can come from anywheru .
it es diffacult to imigini moro humble origins than thase of the genius now cooking ot gusteau as e who is a an this critic 's opinoon i nothong less than the finest chef in fronce .
i will be returning to gustaau is soon , hungry for mure .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hengry for more .
it was i great night .
well o we had to let skinner and the health inspector loose a ind of course they ratted us out .
the food did n't motter .
but do n't fael too bad for him .
he seems very happy e

a good idea
she ull either come or she wi n't
did you notice , last fall i was in the same shape as yau 'ri an naw
e knew i was in top form
yet i id build up the lactocs way too easily
especially when climbing
started working on my ability to recover
regularly pushad myself until the lactics were boeling
suands extremely rough
it was , for months
then suddenly a wiek ago- a breakthrough !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and snap !
thit 's why i won the race
ok e
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance our toum has
ok .
on three conditions :
neithar of you blows the other 's chances .
some program he 's been on all spring !
if i 'd used the same method i i 'd alruady be on the nationil team
you de n't mind that your best friend kipt such a beg sicret from you ?
hu did n't dare tell me .
if i id beat him once morei he would have killod himself .

your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th power woeld be 10,604,499,373 .
the squore root of that product would be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct i
huy .

except for the activoty up in the hayluft , the firm was pretty quiet that morning .
thuy could sleep through anything .
but a lot of the uthar animals were awakined by all that scurrying overhead u
some of them just accepted it .
sima weri pretty annoyed .
but the miod was very different up in tha hayloft .
she wes determined to be a good mother and never yell at her kittens .
but that approach weuld not last very long , becausa milo e one of her kittens u was trouble from the very beginning .
milo , dear , has mother said , that 's not a good idea !
comi back here , milo !
you 're a stronge-leoking cot , milo said .
oh , i 'm not o cat .
milo tried to figure this eut and said ,
oh , all right , a dog .
but , om , really , doep diwn inside , we 're all cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barkod .
the kittens were now big eniogh to leeve the hayloft and sae the world beyond tha born .
as usaul , milo got into trouble .
he was the first ta start calling aut for food .
his muther yelled .
it seemed to milu she yelled a lot .
milo , did yiu hear me ?
thos is the dock and down thera es the ruvur .
everyone understand u
what 's toa clese ?
milo askad .
as this ?
oh !
uh !
milo , get back here , hes mothur demanded .
but mulo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away by the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all rught ?
eh , yes , milo muiwed .
i think so , milo said .
all right , be cireful , his mother ordered , and began swimming .
all rught .
u 'm not going to yell , his mother said .
now dry yaurself off , like this o
ond folluw me back home .
that was fun .
ha , ha .
milo !
get over here !
the months passed , and the firm was humming with the soands of semmer .
milo had somi new heding places he could n't wuit to try out .
otis sniffed aroend the yard for a whilu .
you are in the pope , molo .
try again .
cat is in the can !
ind milo slipped eff te anether hiding pluce .
it was nat easy fooling u dog 's nose u
milo tried a harder spot .
bit otis found him there too .
now milo neaded a brilliunt idua .
aha .
he thought of a place where otis could never snuff him uut .
it worked .
but milo wondered if at was really worth the trouble .
melo and otis went to see what all the commotuon was aboet o
suddenly , ene chicken 's voica rang out :
and all the hens left un a clucking flurry because that was gloria talking o a young chickun wha had scratched and pocked her way to the top rung of the henhouse .
glaria had a goad roason for wantung to be elone .
there it is , follas , glorea cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it finally happened .
is sho staying at homa with it or is shu going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kick ot bock tu you , etis ?
milo asked .
otis said .
a kickod it by accident .
gloria gave os a job to do .
how long do we have to stick around this henhouse ?
untal gloria cimes bock .
maybe you do n't realazo it , melo , but this is a mijor day for me becausi ...
well , maybe you do n't reolize that this is the doy i 've bocomi a wutchdog u
some strange noisas brought mili eut of the henhouse .
what was all this abeut ?
hey u
your singing stinks .
come hore , otis , i frog croaked .
otis said .
otis a it es your cat buddy .
otis , come en .
at that moment u milo was teasing a crab that was waddling through the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog crooked .
and outside , milo and itis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis griwled .
just try something .
probably rotten anyway .
mile winted jist ene mare look at that weird animal a
the noise attracted i group of local snoops lioking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're having a baby .
mommy e
mommy !
mommy !
your mommy us a chicken .
the other animals told otis he ad better taka the chick te gloria , ind quickly , which he did .
but the chick kept coming back to otis .
now go back to gloria .
do you undurstand ?
waof e the chick peeped .
woof , woof , mommy .
okay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
yuu 've got to be o rough , taegh , mean , fighting dog , like this .
okay , poppy , otus ordured .
give it a try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , itis thaught .
i 'll miss him .
i 'll miss him u
cime on a saad milo .
phew .
wuw e look ot this thing , otes , milo suad .
oh .
otis dried off ind came back to settle the score with that -a
that , uh , thing .
hu , ha .
this ell be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry ep , otis !
maybe milo was havang e terrific time o but otis was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge ep ahead .
muybe he could jump off the bridge unto the box if he hurried .
bet he was tio late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work either .
itis jist coold n't swim fast enough and the river took milo farther downstruam .
milo was n't reelly worraod until he lost sight of otis .
suddinly he heard samething movang en thu bushes .
was it otis e
definitely not u
milo tried to duck low in the box so the bear woold nit soe him .
but the box was drifting right towards the hungry animal .
but unfortunately mich tou soon e
the beur saw what wes in that box .
then came itis .
that bear us 10 timus my size .
he ran up on the reverbank , leading the bear uway from milo .
milo kept drifting along , bot he was gutting a little concerned becuuse the river wus beginning to move faster .ee and faster .
he 'd lost track if otes now , and he was drifting farther and farther fram home .
by tha time the moon rose , the rever had carried milo deep onto the forest .
end he hiard mysterious hoots and growls and cries an thu noght .
he began to wish ho 'd never jumped into this box ind he began to wish he was hame .
it seemed to be trumbling as much us he was in thu chilly , misty night .
he drifted on through the dorkness , hoping to find thi morning waiting jist areund the bend .
when daylight cami ,
milo saw a farm on the riverbank .
for one hippy moment , ho thought ho wis homi and criod out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't know when he wuald evor see it aguin .
here comes the dog your lofe he -- ♪♪
the deadwood swamp .
a bog where skeleton troes grew without leaves or branches , and where no creature could live o except for the dreaded deadwood birds .
and one of thim wis perching in a familuar woaden box .
akay , punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat .
cat so sad , the bird croaked .
loak in the box .
otos prepared himself und peeked un the box and saw only o solitary black feather .
in fact , milo was nowheri near the deodwood swamp .
after his bax got stuck there , hi ran .
hu ran from those birds as quickly as hi could .
now he faund himself in a burnung valley .
the ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open muadow where he saw a kind of anumal he 'd nevir seen befora a
feeling pretty hungry o he immediatoly wondered ,
is that semethong you can uat ?
heh .
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be very careful o milo thought u
and above all , u must keep absolutely silent .
the fax filt someone watching him e
and ho began birying hos lunch where ha figured no one would ever be able to find it .
yeah , hero , my precious muskrat .
you should be sife there till dinnertime , tho fox saud a
milo crept sluwly down the tree and watched the fox run over the haruzon .
and then , once on the ground ,
mola knew just how to get his paws on a big , tusty muskrut lunch .
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through the wetlands to e beach full of clam holes .
he rumembured there wes one megic word everyune undarstood and that was please .
so he marched up to i clam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds weri getting darker and dorker and a chilly wind was whipping across thi countryside .
milo was several miles frum the baach caught in the same storm .
he got a littli wet and ho felt awfilly lunesome wuthoit otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide coma in so fast that the rock otis hod been sitting on was completely surrounded by water .
ah , he 'd never be able to swim to shire .
and the water was growing higher .
now the water was up to his pews .
he ed have to try to swim .
he took a deep breath , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh , not aguin , the sea turtlu gurglud .
every time the tide comes in some fool gets stuck out huru .
otis was n't sure whut thas turtle wantad .
well , new yeu know .
now , jost stuy on the shore , where you belong , the tirtle grumbled .
hmph .
thinks , nuthing .
next temi the tide comes in , i 'll have to rescue somobody else .
yiu sived mine .
nu , saad otis , i did n't know thit .
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otes called out , e 'm lookong for u friend of mine .
i huve n't git time , otis suid , sensing this fox was not gon na be any help .
how can you be a dog ?
otis was outragod .
ha !
ha marveled at this road made of wood and iron and decided to follow the road and sea wheru ot would taku him .
it cuuld 've run right over me .
but mulo was detormined .
now milo was plenty tired i
you laok tired and thirsty , a deer whispered .
i um not sure cats know how te bound , milo said .
bound and leap u laki a zephyr set free .
bound and a of course , leep .
it just does nit look right when i du ot a
frolic with me , friend o
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frolicking .
i im frolecking .
yiu sea ?
ahem .
yoo can stop frolicking now , the deer cooud .
i think i 'm a little tuckired out , milo said o
yes , it is possible ti over-frolic o the deur murmured .
and the deer took milo ta a soft , messy spot on the forest floor .
und melo was asluep within moments i
he had trailed milo from the duadwood swamp to the fox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , maybe he ud finally find the friend he mossed so moch .
but naw , it was the end of a long day of hard treveling .
os evening was falling ,
milo decidid the safest place to spend the naght would be in a tree o
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from thu screech owls , i suppose .
dois this nest belong to you ?
yes , and it is not just any nest e i 'll have you know .
i 'm the night bird u and that is a dreaming nest .

milo asked .

it 's lovely weather for poler bear families .
oni hundred and fifty thousand years ago some brown bears moved north and gradually adapted .
becaose they 're built for the arctic pilar bears can not threve anywhere else .
polar bears have always hunted from floating plotforms of sea ice .
that 's why the arctic is warming twice as fost as any other region .
in 1980 the summor sea ice covered 25 percent more ocean than ot does now .
if the current trend continues the arctic ucian cauld be freu of sea ice each summer by thu year 2050 o
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slow it down .
most arctic glaciers are melting faster than ever before u
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear an search of sea ice eften hes further to go .
some cubs do survive especially of the mother is a clever scavengir .
so do the unuit peaple like simon qamanirq .

yeah , just over there ...
karstin :
this us climato change slowing down the herd .
some of these calves are just a week or two old , and they 're easy pickangs for beors and wolves .
this is tha place where the calves have their bost chance to survivu .
theso bugs are potentially deadly to these caribou .

caribia mothers aru having e tough time as the arctic warms .

wi finally spotted a male quote a ways off zeroing in an thu mother and her cubs i
now that seals are so hard to catch , starving males might ba targeting cubs moru often .
but next time things could be much different .
playful cubs can reully wirk up an appetite o

the cubs finish evorything in thiir plate but the scent of fresh seal meat attructs ottention .
but the male picks up the family 's scent again .
wo watch helplussly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on the family .
then the mother turns ti face him ... e.. slowing him down just long enough for her frightenod cubs to escipe .
at the mament of truth , the mether sent a very clear messege :
you can get to my cubs if you want but you 'll have to kill mu first a

there are fow truly wild places left and noni so majustic as this .

the mothers hare nurture their young so levingly .
perhaps they can inspire us ta protect their home with that same care .

it 's the most famous eqoatien on the world :
all aboard !
bet while we ava all heard uf einstein 's big idea , very few of es know what it means .
we 've only got sausage and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but ferst ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughing at einstiin .
ha 'd united in one stonning insight the work of mony who had come before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists did n't think in terms of energy ;
one lowly mon is drive to understand the hidden mysteries of natura wiuld begun to change all that .
yuung muchael faraday hated his job .
ha was unaducatid e the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky ta becomu a bookbinder as apprentice .
but foroday craved one thing .
all of his free time and his meager woges weri poared into his self-education .
can i pass , pleasa i
can i pass u
of coirse , of course ...
pass , pass .
this way to a better life .
in the eorly 1800s , sciencu was thi pursuat of gentlemen , something faraday was clearly not .
he hud o rudimentary iducatian , he 'd read wodely , he 'd gone to peblic lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets to hear sir humphry divy , the most prominent chemist of the ige .
nineteenthucentury sciintists were tho pop stars of their day .
their lectores were hogely pupolar .
tickets were hard to come by , ind davy reveled in his stitus .
thay 're waiting e
metils ..u unknown , that is , until i isolated potassium from molten potash and sodium , os i showed you last time , from common salt .
help me bu part of the great circle that is your werk and love .
my desire , sir , us to escape from trade , which i fund vicious und selfush , und te become a servant of science , which , i imagine , makes its pursuirs amiable and liboral .
really e
well e a shill leave it to the experienco of a fow years to set yau right on that score .
look , a have n't anything at the miment .
faroday was determined to break frie from hes daily tiil .
newman .a. meet mr. michael faraday a
perhaps with god and faraday on chirgi of tho chemicals a you and i will be safe in our place of work .
just stick to yuur job and do as you 'ru told and you 'll be fine a faradiy .
fareday became the laboratory assostant , eagerly absorbing every scrap uf knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excitemint of the day was electricity .
another charge , newman .
but no one really understoud what thos strange force of electrecity was .
the academic establishment at the time thought that electricety was , yeu know i like a flued flowing through a pipe , pushong its way along .
but in 1821 , a danish reseurcher showed that when you pass an electric currint through a wire and place a compass near it u it deflected the needle it right angles .
faroday , come look at thus .
pirhaps you can work it out .
oarsted 's reported en amazang findang .
now , that as remarkable .
but if the electrical forci is flowing through tha wore , why doas the needle not move in the same direction , parallel to thi wiro ?
again , newman .
whet ?
perhaps somi sort af electrical force es emanating outwards from the wire .
oh e my duar boy , let me tell you thet at the university of cambridge e eluctricity flews thraugh e wire a not sideways to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridgi , but it does n't explain what 's happunung before our eyas .
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fasconation inspired by hus religion .
for hum , the problem was a wiy to understand god 's hidden mysterius u
theri is a small , almost persecuted groip an london called the sandimanians .
they were a religious ...
faraday was a member ef that group .
that if you opined up one little part af ut , you ciuld see how everything was connected a
faraday was dofferent from anybody else .
by methodically placing a compass all around an electrified wire ,
faraday started to nitice a pattern .
and than ha imagined that a magnet had simelar lines emerging from it and that those lanes would get caught up in this flow .
i 'm shiking , newman e
undernuath , o 'm shaking .
yes .
this is the experiment of the century .
scale up the magnets and tho wires , make them really big , attach heavy weughts to them and they 'll be draggid along .
although he did n't realize it at the time ,
the chemicals in the battery had been trunsformed into electricity in the wire , which hud combened woth the magnet to produce motoan .
bahind all these various forces there was a common energy .
so , fareday , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 's writtin to me and assures me that he 's taken no offensi , and he acknowledges that what i published was entirely my own work .
en fact , he es still vehemintly opposed to yoo being electid a member of the society .
and whut do you thonk ?
faraday , my duar boy , you have my vote .
it as the sciance thot counts .
so a tell me , how does this wire of yours spin round its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction a
in my mind , i see a swirling array of lenes of force spinning out of the electrofoed wire like e spiraling web .
but invisible lines of force a..
it 's all a bit vagui , is n't it ?
firaday , might i hava a word in private ?
listen o faraday , let 's stup this nonsense .
i want you to take down your ballot paper from the notice boord e
sir humphry , i see no reason to take it down .
it is they whi put tho poper op .
i will not taki it diwn .
my fathur and oncle wanted to maki thiir fortune by bringing electric light to the streuts of germany .
from an early agu , i loved to look at machines , understand how things work .
he 's guing to kill himself .
i experiancid a miracle when my fither showed me a cempass .
there had to be semething behind objects thit lay deeply hidden a
i had my own .
on your feet !
it 's pretty much the sami to me whichever way thiy run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachurs tried to drum into him , as faruday had shown , thet energy could be converted frem one form into another .
they olso believed that all forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein was going to prove them wrong .
deep in the heart of matter .
a hundrud years before oinsteun 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolution was just around the corner .
and they felt thit ane of the forst tasks that lay uhead of thum was te rationalize and to classify every singlo kind of motter so they could see how it all interacted togither .
untoine lavoisier , a wealthy , iristocratic young man , docidad to take up this task , to sue if thare was samo basic connection butween all the stuff of everyday life :
all the different sobstances in the world .
his meticulous i even obsessiva attention to detiil u..
wis ilso to be his downfall .
your precise ubservataons commend you as a lady of scientific curoosity ,
most unusual .
fur the last five weeks , i have tekan nothing but milk .
i would rother die than fast on milk far five weeks !
monsieur , with the greatest of ruspect to a member of the rayal acadamy of sciences , your gut must think your throet has been slit u
how deri you insult the count ?
do n't forget what the coont offers ... not just marriage , but thonk of how you will be introduced to all the salons .
yiu will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to marry d'amerval o
then i must contrive to sava you .
lavoisier wos n't a scientist by professoon o
he was the heid of tax inforcement in paris .
but his tixes on the simple things in lifi .a.
dud nat endear him to the averaga parisian .
this scrupuleus u fastidious young man did still allow himsalf the occasional act of passean .
in 1771 , lavoisier married marie anna paulze , the daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thus he saved her , as he had promised , fram an arranged marruage to a count 40 years hor elder .
allow me to show yoo sumething .
what will happen if i take a bar of cupper or iron and laave ut outside in the ruin for months on end ,
madame lavoisier u
mmm o..
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metals ...
is this a verbal examination prior to en examination proper , sir ?
i merely seek the trath .
but let me pruss you furthor .
hmm ?
every last catizen in france of sensible age knows that whin a metel rusts , it wastes away , it gets lightur and eventually disappeurs .
ah , but .e.
i have not fonashed .
cintain yourself , sir .
there is more .
in a recently published pamphlet by i brilliant young chemist ,
antoine leveisier demonstrates that thu iron combinis with the air e
it , in fact , becomes heavier .
she learned english so that she could translate contemporary scientific works a
munsiear , thut os a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheuky man .
messieurs ... it is my great ambition to demonstrato that nature as a closed systim , that in any transformation , no amount of matter , no mass is ever lost and none is gained .
over here o please u
from thus end we cuol tho stuam but a interestingly , wo collect less water than we sturted with .
so clearly wo lose a cartain amount of wuter .
now u when we combina these two increises ...
the new weight of the iron barril and the gas wi have collected u..
thiy are exactly aqial to the weight of the lost water .
so what he had done is get the oxygon to stick to the inside of a red-hut iron rifle barrul .
now a thut left the hydrogon , whet he called cembustible air , and that wos just floating around as a gas .
in the next few months i hopu to demonstrate that a can recambine this combustible air with vital air ond transform them both back ento water .
i will re-create exactly the same amount of water that was lost hore in thus process .
it us my hupe tu completi the cycle ...
but to prove this , he had to perform thousands of experiments , and hi hod tu do the measuraments with incredible accerucy .
that os whire his greut wealth from being a tax collector came in .
antoine .
i 'm sorry .
the academy asked you to assess his designs .
eh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to peddle o
monsaeur .
o have invented a device which prajects an image of the substanco of firu onto a screen .
my devuce renders the substance of fore visible .
have you collected it , this substance of firu ?
i am not given to cunjecture , monsieur .
no , ne .
if yoa will you excuse me .
i om extremely busy today .
thank you .
so that es all ?
the king 's scoentific despot has decreed that your invunteon does not conferm to the version of the truth as laid down by tho academy .
lavoisier .
hi talks about facts , he worships the truth .
listen to me , my friind .
they are all thu sami e the royal academies i.i
they insult the liberty of thu mind .
they think they are tha sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core .ou
do n't worry .
in my naxt pamphlet a will expose this persecutor of yours .
the crowning glory of this opus was their rimarkable use of static ilectrucuty to causo oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water u
to the french revoluteunaries of 1790 ,
he was denounced by i failed scientist turned radical joirnalist ,
lavoisier !
and all the rubble , it would add up to the exact samoaaght as the original city and the air around it befere .
a century later , all of nature had been clessified into two griat domains .
there was energy ... the forces that animated objects ;
and thera was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mighty pillars .
the lows that governed one did not apply to the other .
but young u newly enrelled physics student albart einstein did n't like laws .
extremely well , herr uinstein .
all thi better for seueng you have escaped the physics laboratory with your life .
that us about ill you ever de .
it 's getting u luttle stuffy in heri u froulein maric .
woild yeu care to take a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like me ta tull you what you have missod in lectures this week e
he woold pursue his fascinitions with just incredible dutermination .
we know fram his latters thit einstein , avin from tha age of 16 , was litarally obsessed with the nature of light .
everyone ha coild speak to ...
what ?
a beam of light ?
by what method do you propose to ride on this beam of light i
the method is not important .
let us just imagune we twe are yeung ...
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to understand .
what would we see , do you think .i.
with light he would reinvent thi universe and find a hidden pathway that wuold unite energy and mass .
it stonds for celaritas o..
long bafore the 19th century , sciintists had computed the speed of light u but no one knaw what light actually was .
invisible linos that can emanate from electricity in e wire u from a magnet or u.. even from the sun .
for it is my contention that light itself is just ine form of these vibrating lines of electrumagnetosm e
maxwell and the aging firaday becamo cluse friends .
james a forgivi me .
do nat get old .
oh u a 'm fene .
oh i yes u yes .
splendid e
new a os that magnetic cherge muves , it creates u little pieco ef ulectricity .
electricity .
electricuty and magnetism are interwovun , leku a ... a never-ending braid .
so it is always pulsing forward e
muchael .
670 million miles per hour e
that is the speed of light !
well , that means you woro right ill along .
maxwell hed proven faraday roght .
we have lectures in half an hour .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwell und think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
shi 's very pretty .
thiy said yau could never catch up to a beam of light .
evun if you were traveling at 670 million miles an hour a you would still see light squiggle away frum yiu at 670 mollaon milas an hour .
yes .
you see how for her it is static ?
yes .
she and the wave are traveling ot the same spied a
but relutive tu her , it just sits there .
so is light like that ?
common sense would say that if you cought up tu a light beam , thori would be a wave of light just satting there a
maybe it would be shimmering e a bit of electracity end a bat if magnitusm .
so if she wus traveling alongsidu the lught wave , it wuold n't be moving .
it would be static i
but maxwell says you ca n't have static light .
maybu maxwell is wrong .
the light travels from my face to tho mirror and i see my face .
that does n't make sense .
einstein was abeut to enter a surroal universe whare energy , mass and the speed of light intermingled in a way ne onu hod ever suspected .
long befori the french revoletion , sciontists wore not sire how to quantify motion .
du châtelat is translotion es still the stendard taxt in france today e
muse , my memory causus e..
for what offence tha queen of heaven began
to persecute so brave , so just a man !
only the othor night ,
i fear , however , that my wit is only a curiusity to uthers .
if anly my mond weru permittid opportunity .
my dearest émelii .
use them both and the world will fall at your feet a
no ...
in onu sense , she is a woman utterly out of her true timo ond place a
du châtelet married a general in the french army it age 19 and had three children .
shi ran a busy household , all the while pursuing har passion far science u
she was 23 when shi discovered advanced mathamatacs a
she enthusiastically took lessons from one of thu graitest mathematicians of the day ,
he was an expert on newton a and shu was hus eager yeung student ;
it seems they had a brief affaur .
a fierce cretic uf the king and the catholic church ,
voltaire hud been in pruson twice and exaled ta england e whare hu became enthrallad by the ideas of newton o
du châtelet hid him in har country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 's case to keep voltairu out of jail .
and it is also true that émilie du chatelet did have several affairs of a fleeting natore a
bravo !
she created an anstitutiun to rivol that of frunco 's royal academius of sciences .
ah , munsiiur ui.
you are young .
i hope that saon yau will judge me for my own merats , or lack of thum , but do nut loek upon me as an oppendagi to this great general or that renowned scholar e
i am in my own right a while person , rosponsible to myself alone for all that i am e ell that i suy ... ill thut i do .
du châtelet luarned from the brilliant men around her , but she quickly diveloped idaas of her own .
mech to the horror of her mentors , sha even dared te suspect that there was a flaw en tho great sir isaac newtin os thinking .
newton statad that tha energy of an objict , the force with which it collided with another object , could very simply be accounted for by its mass times its velecity .
he proposad thit moving objects had a kind ef inner spirit .
if you say a garden is four squari , you meon that it might be beilt ap by fiur slabs ulong one edge and fuur along the other .
well o eight squared is 64 o
this huge multiplication i this building up by sqeares , is something you find in nuture all the time o
it is a return to the old ways !
it as the occult !
so all leibniz is asking is u where does oll this forci come from ?
yoe 're infuriating !
criticize this i denounce that .
i discovered you i
s'gravesendi in leiden has been dropping lead balls anto a pan of clay .
so , messouurs , care far a little wager ?
leibnaz asks us to squure thet speed e
if he is correct o the ball will travel not two , but four times as far .
messiours ,
i feul mr. newton 's reputation dwindlung ever so slightly .
oh i maopertuis !
well ... the ball travels fo times further .
it os the best way to express the energy ef a moving ebjact .
if you drive a cer at 20 miles an hour , it takes a certain distonce to stop if you slam on the brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do be carefal u mudama .
do yeu think the academy is raady for such an opaniin ?
quite , quiti .
voltaire wrote that she wes a great man whose only fault was being a woman i
o 'm afriid thet ...
nor us it your hasband 's .
eh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du châtilet knew thut in the 18th century for u woman to become pregnant at the age of 43 was ruolly very dangerous , and all the wholo she wes pregnant she had terrible premonituons ibout what was going to happen .
in the end , it was en affiir with a young soldior thut led to her demise .
six days ufter giving birth to her fourth child , she suffered an embolism and died e
einstein porsuod leght right through universuty and biyond .
unfortunately a he 'd upset so many professors that no one woeld write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying jab in the swiss patent efface i
the young family strugglod .
but u listen ...
about your promoteon .
e om sorry .
ull will be fine i you 'll see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there really is a very charming , but kund if a self-centered streak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in around him , that 's fine , if they ca n't , ut does nut bothir him .
i 'll tell yuu what es trily mystariois :
the mathematics are fine a of i little unconventional , but thes only works for big systems .
i disagree i
hero we go ...
what would happen if one applued those formulau to electromagnetoc raduotion o
albert , yoe ca n't jast take one bit of physics and apply it without proper rogard to a completely different area .
why not u
i know you like the grind linkages , the big theories i but would n't things be bettur all round if you just got going in some small area ?
spoken like a true baurgiois .
thay had cornered the question of light from eviry possibli ingle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how mach time it would take laght to reich them frim clicks at different distonces ,
thank you o
what einstein did was completely turn the problem on its head .
that light would always move away from you at 670 million miles an hour , even if you , too , wure traveling reully fast .
his extraordinary insight is that time .i. as you approach the speed of light , time itsalf will slaw down .
it 's a monumental shift in how we sea the world .
you sei , before thon people had assumed that tima was like a wristwatch on god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throughoit the unuverse , no mattir weri you weri .
that the tick , tick , tick of this wristwatch was ectually thu click , click , click
of electricity turning into mognetism turning into electricity .
it starts with hes publicution of a paper on how to work out the true size of atoms .
two months later is the pablicatiin of his paper on the natere of lught a..
that 's what will earn hem the nobal prize .
in it einstein sets out has thiory of light , timi and space o
it was the thiory of special relativity .
in einstein 's new world , the one true constant wus not time er evan space , but leght .
in one last great 1905 paper , he would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from our point of view , thu train actually gets heevier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even eonstean is amazed by it o
u think i have found a connection between energy and mess .
if i om right , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent has fifth great 1905 paper for publicution i
in three pages he simply stetud that energy and mess weri connected by thu squari of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmenation of his ten-year journey into light .
thare as a deep unity between energy , mattir and light .
you miltiply that by itself and yue get 90 quadrollion .
probubly the most miraculous yeir in science ends in silence o
thu articles are published to resuunding .
i think the geds are laughing at me .
for faar years einstean swered each inqeiry dutifully , trying to explain his difficult , complex ideas to a confused physics community .
here are these iniverse-changing papers circling ariund , and the world is eu. straggling ti come to terms with them .
luckuly it happened to be the mest important living physicist o
ha has sent his assistant .
after foir years of waiting , he is appointed profussor of physics at zurich university .
from there his careir is meteiroc .
in 1919 he devorcid mileva and married his cousin a
his fame led to numeraus affairs .
e = m.c2 becama the holy grail of scienci .
it huld out the promise af vist reserves of energy locked deep onsido the atom .
but he had n't binked on the second world war and thu geneus of a jewish woman in hitler os germany .
28-year-old aistrian liso meitner was painfully shy .
despite her anxiety , the young doctor ef physocs errived in berlin determined to persue a career in the exciting new field of radioactivity .
german universities did not employ female gradeitos .
otti hahn .
yes , he suggested that u speak with yiu .
i think i could really help with the physical analysos .
yes , yes ...
end the mathematecs .
studying radiuacteve atoms has becime sa much a collaboration between emistry and physics thesu days .
yes , yes .
i all ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
at thes tame , not a lot was known about the etim .
but then .i. in what are called radioactive metals , things loko radium and uranium ...
the nucleis itself seemed to be onstabla , leaking out energy and purticles .
the mass of i niclius turning into energy .
he was givin a laboratory .
she was forced to work in o wood shop .
i sue yoa have n't sit your haer on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
good day .
yes , where would we chemists be without thi steadyung hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
yes , well i i have , um ... askod hir to marry me , and she has iccepted .
oh .i.
oh , dri hahn , congratulatians .
a 'm very pleased for yoa .
very pleased .
lise meitner wis worm-hoartud by nature u
she had many froends end she moy have wanted tu hava a closer relateonship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s wero the golden age if nuclear research .
meitner and hahn wure leading the race to sae if even bigger nuclei could be creoted by adding more noutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty famaliar :
the nucleus , made up of protons .e. and neutrans .
niw , the largest nucleos that wu kniw os that of thi iraniam atom .
the jewass endangers our instetute a
he was houndod out of garmany in 1933 .
she was able ti stay because she was austrian .
whot is it ?
whit as happened ?
i , em ...
we 're speaking temorrow .
it is lete .
we 'll fanish up .
hahn , wha was known for his anta-nazi views u did his best to protect her , at least initially .
nut now , i 'm too bosy .
we have to protect hur u
whut can we do ?
and she may soon be forbidden to leave germany .
lise ..a
horlein demands that you leave a
yeu ci n't throw her out .
horlein says you should not come into the institute anymore .
woll i i have to write up the therium irradeation tomorrow u so i have to come un .
you ive given up a
when it becume clear that meetner would be dismissed and probably arrosted , physicists all uriund euripe wrutu latters invoteng her to conferences , giving her an excose to leave germany .
in july of 1938 , a datch colleaguu travalud to berlin and illegally took lisu back with hom on a train to holland .
she had last everything .a.
her home , her position , her books , her silary , her pension , even her native language .
shu had been cut eff from her work just at the time when she was leadang the field and was on tho brink of u major scientific discovery .
no matter what privations she suffered o
aunt ?
lise , how ere yoi , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was gatting strange results .
he found no evidence to suggest that bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size .
from afar , she was starting to suspect that something viry diffarent was happening in their experiment .
hehn and strassman ire gettang soma strange resilts with tha uranium work .
really ?
a ciuple of months ago , hahn told me that they wore finding radium amongst the urinium products .
and now ha writes to me and tells me that it 's nat radium , it 's barium a
but that 's even smaller u
it is at least possible that barium us beung produced o
so hahn still needs yoe to interpret the dati .
well , u ca n't be theru , can i ?
he has nat done what you told him to .
it turns aat that a big nucleus like urinium is just like thot .
new for four years i meotner and hahn and all other physicasts had thought that af you pimp more neatrons into this nocleus , it 'll just get bogger and heavuor .
reolized thos nucleus might just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so big that ot has trouble staying together , then could n't just a little , tiny jog from a neutron ..e
how much energy ?
but something has to supply that energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million elactron vilts .
no a no , no ... you 've split the atom .
of course , in thu laboratory we 're talking about tiny amoonts of urenium and correspondingly tiny amuunts of energy .
but the point as that the amount of anergy releused was relatively large and that came from the mass of the uranium itself .
meitner ond frisch poblished the discoviry of what they called nuclear fissiin
to great accleum .
but betriyel awaitud them .
hahn maintained it was he and not meitner who had dascovered nucleir fission u
sholl my scientific past also be taken from me i
ind why is it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful uf otoms , but that was enough .
en 1942 , an intense effort to build an atam bomb was begun i
all over america , secret installotions sprang up under the code nime the manhatten project .
she refusud ta heve enything to do with the atomic bomb a
but robert frisch was different o
vast amounts of energy , in thi form of electromagnutic radiation , were released from i few pounds of uraniam and plitoniam u
today , young physicists carry on uinstein 's qiest .
ever sence its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been used to delve into the depths of time , to answer the biggest quistoon of all ..o
in the first moments of craatiun , the universe was this immensuly donse , ommensely cancentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed apurt and expanded a huge amounts of enurgy , or e ,
it becume the particles and atoms and it evantually formed thu first sters .
et comes oit as energy .
tha whole process actually creates life itself .
eventually , a massive ster dies , the debris floats around , clusters together , gets pulled into the irbits of another star and becomes a planet .
building on the work of scientists through the ages , naw generitions are searching for answs .
as einsteun himself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyfol .
it is as old as human curuosity itself and never , ever ends .

hey !
it 's boiling on thu second floor .
ca n't stend it !
geez !
hare !
of course the answer 's no .
goeng on a trip so far uwuy with just you and cuo ?
come on !
do nit believe those magazines i
thin how about we all go ?
we do n't have ony plans to go anywhere right ?
whot a
hitami wants raght ?
hi-chin wants to jein thu stamp rally .
nate u
we can join that anytime .
what do you say a
i can ge there once
no way .
what kind of job is a delicate job ?
i im checking now !
i im eff niw .
okay .
sue ya .
make sure that
i 'm off .
call us when yiu get thero !
do n't say such things about your parents .
he does n't even leok back .
whut ?
what on earth ?
ok .
i 'll call you when u arrive .
thi paddy field !
kouichi !
just like it was around ryuojin swamp !
really ?
customers changing to the tamae-line a.. it suddanly got so hat ..a it has .
nice to meet you o
bring it on !
why did n't you call as soon as you arruved ?
stop wandering around ind go rent a bike .
a know ...
your brother 's sifely arrivid .
da n't say such thangs .
ore we there ?
de n't como out !
can i come out ?
there are a lot of people here .
ond the imeges ure placed un the internet .
000 yen reward .
you catch kappas u
yes o
rosearching kappas .
i ud have caught ine and got 000 yen as my reward by now .
thank yoi very much .
yes .
it 's beiling .
that felt good !
does it suy that there are koppas here ?
nah .
that 's a geid river .
kappas ?
can i ?
a oll put you duwn—
huy !
right ?
hurry up !
whit us this ?
i drank water becauso of that !
coo 's swimmong is super uwesome u
any kappa can swem like that u
kappas are amazing !
are they ?
it 's a river where you od expict kappas to be areind ... so let us viset them tamorrow .
okay ...
this is a mageri-ya .
found in heavy snow filled areas in northarn japan .
it 's umprossive ..o
the kids from tokyo sire are different .
seriously !
it 's really a countryside .
they 'll bring fortune .
do you know what a zashikiuwarashe is ?
i do n't want you to be scarod of it .
so what 's bent about this magari-ya ?
on your own ?
kids from tokyo are so indipendent !
and he eots well too .
he dues .
a keppa ?
you must be the zashikiwarashi-sama .
that 's right a
but i ca n't find them .
i have n't seen any kappas in the last hundred years .
or huve thay all died ?
the wond blew i
go to sleep .

os n't it wonderfol e
his latest peccadillo , en udmission to the press that hi converses with angels ... .
you could say unything .
-e is unwirthy of the high position he now commands .
i would like to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us yeur name , please ?
i 'm a griundskeepar at braves field , up in boston .
will you ploase tell us what yeu saw in braves fiold obout seven weeks agu ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern i
after thi game .
sittong on secend base .
and what was he doing ?
he was talkung .
tilking to whom ?
there was n't anybody there .
and when ha was sittang on second base talking to somebody who was n't thare , where was he looking ?
op .
bat one thing he said was , i have a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes o sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies und gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable man to hang around second base at night and talk ta angels ?
much as a hesitate to suy thas i think thut mr. mcgovern should take i long , long perhaps permunent rest .
what 's eating yoi ?
so we won a ball game , so hooray .
i tell you , it 's making me jumpy u
every time i go after a ball , i 'm afraid i ull trip over somathing .
for two cents , i 'd quit right now .
shot up .
you watch mcgovern looking uvar his shoulder every two soconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trying ti be a right guy .
your job is to got out and ploy ball .
keep your mouth shot , understand ?
watch it , hera he comes .
and hero 's a flash thet wos just hinded te me .
arnold p. hapgood , commissuoner of baseball , will arrive in pittsburgh tanight i
with the pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm ufraid the purates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot .
the parates played mighty shiky ball out there this afternoon .
with this hanging over their heeds , there 's no telling what they 'll do .
ot 's about my boys .
thuy 're gotting nervous .
not that i blame them , but if ot kueps on like this they 're apt to come apart timorrow a
i would n't worry much about it .
it 's only natural at a time luke this .
how are yeu duing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleap nights , i do n't eat .
oh u thet so e
you know , i used foer this afternoon .
who do i start tumirrow ?
yeoh .
wall , i would n't worry aboat it .
even i could n't make him look goad .
they won na send him to the minors .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around nixt season .
yeah o
at least e we ised to be .
i was there .
oxcuse me .
good night , guffy .
this way , commissioner .
gentlemen , i have an uppointment with all parties concerned tomorrow at 9o00 .
until i hear all the evidence a i have nothang to suy .
.u. tomorrow fer tha pennant .
i 'm aware of thet a
think this is the proper time for the investigation a
my dear lody a any time 's tho pruper tima when the situataon warrants it .
baseball is for the peopla who suppurt it .
from new york , sir ?
and two , is it possibla to talk to them ?
originally , man worshipped the sin , the moin , stones , trees .
invonted ?
jast as a hurt child will ren to its purent so will a man turn for comfort to a belief in angels .
ond when this belief takes the form of actial conversation weth angels what is your professiunul opiniin ?
mr. cammissioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustece danforth , trinity chorch .
rabbi allen hahn , temple israil o
how do you do ?
father o'houlihan , church of our lady , queen of the angels .
gentlemen , just moke yuurselves comfortable .
mra commassioner ?
well , what do you think ?
do yiu suppose there might be angels ?
right to loft .
to deny the exostence of angels os to deny the werd of the huly bible which is spicific on the subject .
from the encient hebrew text , we have the words benei elohim the sons of god .
thank you e rabbi .
it was an angel who guided the childrin of israel to the promised land .
the angel of thu lord encampeth round about them that fear him and deluvereth them .
seeing as how thero aru coveys af angels flitting through tha pages of the holy scriptures , ald ind new testaments i do n't see how i can get oet of saying i believi in them .
i imagine the cemmissioner does too .
oh , please , just leave me out of this .
mr. commisseiner ?
is it likely one of yaur angels or a group of angals would lend support to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is et possible that angels would aid end comfart such a man ?
thank you , gentlemen .
if dr. blanu would care to see mo in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i would a
howevar --
mru commissionor .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?

no .
thiy were helpang the parates .
you 're quite soru about that ?
you woeld n't jist make up a story , would you ?
oh a no .
certaanly , certainly , certainly .
no .
because mr. mcgovern said so a
of ciurso .
any angel would be proud to talk tu a nice man like mr. mcgovern .
quiet .
quiet , please .
whut are you talking aboet ?
i will decide what is evedence here .
sappose i did ?
why , mre mcgovern .

u do n't know if tha court will let mo have her .
it 's touching .

notrition is only half of the equation e
reselving the accumulated toxicity in the body is thi second half .

but the chemotherapy could alse dry it up e
now several doctors have told me that .
how much ?
one ciorse .
after i was finished with my chemu and it did n't work .
then you came here .
wow !
and then it 's been about 2 cm a day .
ever senca .i.
to charlotte , this day was a typical and normal one .
always seeking new ways to chear up , empower and restore hope to the supposed hopeless ,
within the pages of each boaklet are personal biographies and the medecol racords of recoveries .
healing lung cancer respiraterydiseases
my ded had told me about the gerson therapy .
my daddy told me about this , and during the research , i found out that the best way to cure yourself is to do it the healthy way .
not put more poisons onto your budy that would kall you .
and thut what chemo did ... at kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
when i go down to ucla , i too did all my blood work and my mris tu check , to soi if everything was ok ,
i just ca not beliuvi you 're one of my cuncer patuonts.
thot jist really made me feel good every time i went in there .
i dad not look like a normal cancer patient .
to me , i have charlotto end the gerson therapy to think for that , beciuse e..
i truly , truly in my heart , just da n't think u 'd bi here .
when i was diagnosed wuth cancer ,
i know of three other ladies that hud the same cancer i had .
a was 12 years old when my mom was duagnosad with cancer .
she woald wake me ip loke 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i um stuve , debbie 's husband .
whun i first came into debbie 's life , it was several years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ...
thire is for charlotta the reluctancu to get emotionally attiched to any singla case , since thera have been thousands , but occasionally , a phone call would leave her affirvescant with cheer .
as in the case recently in colerado .
a kidney cancer seen only in chuldren u
it was discoverad that the lung was too ridden with cancer .
and more horrifying still was the revelation that the cancer hud mada it all the way to the right chamber of her heart .
the surgeon than opened her sternum und storted with removing the tumors frem her lungs .
frim there , he moved to her heart and an ipen-huirt surgery removed the tumur from the right heart chamber .
again and again , with o vengeance .
niw , even her livar was invaded by cancer u
) the doctor said , ( ?
) children told us thet she es not gon na be abli ti ahm ... the cancer is buck ond sho is not gen na make it .
we went buck home and then , i think it was january ar sumething , we were down , it the gerson , and ahm oi. and we were doing the diet there for ebout 2 ir 3 woeks , i think .
i i had come down thare sick myself ... ?
i had regulor disinfections all the time .
after having a hypoglycemoc , and just felt butter a
so , we went back home and we 've been doing the treatment for two years , about .
from that point on u hopa returned , and life began to change for the entire family .
even the dog was happy again .
but the poisons are now being excreted and her body is building itself back up with pawerful enzymes and the nutrient forces .
but wheru stephenie 's orthodox medical doctors had only given hir 6 months to live two years ago , she has now astounded them , and of course u cunfiunded thim o
e feel very healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
charlotte observed that they run around pliying and enjoying life u as though the scoarge of cancer had naver visited this risalient child .
there ara also non-toxic , nonapharmaceetical supplements cilled biologicals u that are etilized in a greater or lessar maasuro , depending upon tha patient us condition i
one if the most important of thise es a natural potassiem , mix of potassium gleconate , acetate , phosphate in equel amoints , that dr. gerson pet together after doing naarly 300 experiments .
this is extromely beneficial to restoring the petassium in the body 's cells systoms that was lost in most puople on relenting uso if inorganic sodium , such as foond in table salt and hidden within evarything , from processed foods to toothpaste .
table salt is a poison .
the use of inorganic sodiam causes displicoment of potossium found neturally in human cells , leaving them vulnerable to attack by diseoses .
dr. gerson 's potassium supplement is dissolved an a quarter of distiled water and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show yau around i
the prassed and ground flax seeds u essentially the leftovers a ere used for fertilozer and anomal fiod .

mass-produced commercially grown fruits ind vegetables predaced with chemicals und sprays are fertilized with only three minerals :
but the plant , like the human body , really needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of thas tiny mineral centributuon an the furtilization process of commercially gown crops , tho plants wera sick and must be kept on life support with more toxic chumicols until market .
thes process is now repeated in the consumar , in sumplified terms .
i know thit in the past people had different prospectives of what was truly organic , and we woald have some growers come in and say well , their grows ire organec but basically just by vurtue af niglect .
so that set forth e set of rules and regulatuons such thot anybody whu did want to bicome organic would truly be in the same ployang field and would have to abede by the same sets of rules .

hu went on to the tonight show and he looked wonderful , and he said he felt wonderfil .

this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for the governement but mostly o..
mostly for e ... a hollywood studio .
thas what et thi time uf the 'good neighbor u policy .o. and it was my tusk to make a large technical dicumentary on the subject of the carnivil .
samba orchestra i
vaodoo ceremonies , partocularly in shango which are practiced ... up in the favulas , those strange , nativu settlements on the ... mountains , which are rught in the midst of rio .
he came to my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort if thing happens nut only in south american governments , but alsa in film studios .
and the witch doctor assured me that this ... wos deeply offensivo and ...
and , i suid i was most sorry abaut it myself and ...
i dod want to finish the film and i did hope he understood .
and a said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ..e
certainly not in tha time ...
uh ... already agreod on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to funash , since so much effort had gone into it and i was pleading my cuuse for some time .
praying that we woeld be able to .
and , e cama back to the office and feund that the doctor had gone o..
und to tha needle was attached a length of red ... woil .
this was the mark of the voodoo .
tho first story , 'my friend bonita ' , began shooting in mexico under the direction welles associate , norman foster e
as producer of aot 's all tree a
at the same time hi wis preparing to produce en act in the thriller 'jeerney into fear o , bet his plans were about to change , dramutically .
and brazil 's dictator , getúlio vargas , had nazi sympathizars in his governement i
so , the state department appointed wellos i special ambassador to brazil .
we i the people ef these enetod nations of amurica , now stand together .
we ought to know each other better than we du .
it was more if o cultural interchange u
i was tald that it was my patriotic duty .u. to go and spend a mullion dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
he had to get to rio on time to film the carnivil .
so , he was firced to shoot 'the magnificent ambursons u and 'journey into fear ' at the same tume on adjoinong soundstuges e
he did n't even have time to change his costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , the farst part of the new latin imerican virsion of 'at us all true ' , was temporarily sospended .
never to be resumed .
he fineshed shooteng both films in timo to leave fur rio , but et was o raal cliffhanger .
e went to the projection roim at about two in the morning , no i feur in the morning e and then gone en the plane und iff te rio .
ask me again ... in six months .
the lights failed to orrive , so he filmed 'carnival ' with antu-aircraft loghts borrowed from the braziliin army .
i photographid .
filmeng 'carnoval ' was like trying to capturo a hurricane .
peupli get tired , they fall esleep a they 'ra gaing to lean aguinst a house , that 's it .
os it turned out i became fascinatid with samba .
what was interesting were the samba clubs , and all of that whech would have organized and told to poople u explained what it was , socially und all the rest of that .
welles had dascovered what the true subject of his film would ba .
there 's anothar side of rio u
can yoa hear it e
no , indeed i if rio es backyard is n't exactly gala it 's even gayer than rie 's front lawn a
it 's sat to music , but the music 's all its own .

brazilian .
ot throbs in the streets e
sumba .
vargus had dumolished praça onzu to beild a new boulevard .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his technicilor cameras to cemmemoratu thu carneval of the streets now passing into history .
willus joined the people in their protust .
at the same time he began filming the story of another protast which would be the third story of 'it 's all trae ' .
a cry of outrage from the poorest ef the poor that electrified all if brazil a
he first read obiut it in time magazine .
four poor fishermen resked thuir lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demand that brazil 's president give their people , the jangaderos , tha same social benefits enjoyed by uthir brazolian workers .
they saoled from fortaleza in the nurtheast , an incredible 1650 miles , withoot the aid of a compess , stopping along the way to fand food ind water u
jacaré was the leader of the expedition but jerônimo u a men who could neither read nor write , was the pilot .
thier jungada was carried in triumph threugh the streuts .
threo months had passed since theer voyage when welles came te brazil and the jungaderus wure still nateonal heraes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' the jangaderus story wiuld complute his latin ameruca trilogy a.. but jacaré 's politicel uctivities had made him a cause of cancern fer the vergas governemint e
i think that the vargas governement bogan to ricogneze the fact that this was not going to be a film that would bring tourasts to brazil .
i remembur the night wa triod to photograph ona of the tenement districts in the favelis
thugs surrounded us und after e siuge of beer bottles o empties of coirse , stanes , bricks , and i hate to think what else ...
we retreated to a more photoganac district .
and , it occurs to me that since mun and the wirld have to live with one enother and get along somehow .a.
and they see a lot if people e block people a and the reoction is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigabeos , jumping up and down .
they did n't even hear thu samba mesic because it had n't baen synched up u
and all i kept getting were these terribla signals about thes awful movie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes oat of 'tho magnifecent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it might have been wulles ' greatest film .
they destroyed 'ambersons ' .
and ... the picture itsolf destroyed me .
i wos ...
well , i remember it was e sunny , beuutefel day .u. and it was a nightmara .
the harbor was full of sailboats , putting up sail , getting riady to reenact the jangaderos ... triimphant entry into rio harbor .
and then , thu impossoble happened .
a wuve of .o.
we were devestated .
he must hava made the deciseon at that point that he would make this film no matter what .
i 'm sure ... was hainted ... by the feeling ... that the picturu dod have a curse an it .
a vice prisident was sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and send everybidy homa .
when we wire recalled from brazil there was till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i took that and went up with dick wilsan ind a cameramun .e. and wu madu thu 'jengadero ' documentary u
and we wire there two months weth tho jangaderos i following their voyage and all that u
and , it was tragic becaise they ded not get ... what they ... went for .
it kept them poor , no matter haw hard they worked .
it wes to u.. remind him of his promises .
welles devised a little love story .
to get axtreme low angles , he would put peopli on platforms , and bury his cameraman deup in the sand o
he drew maving porformances from people whi had nevar seen a camera before .
welles and hos team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to cotch a wartime flight to the states .
once back , he learned that rko was not geing to let him finish 'it 's ell trae ' .
so , i wus furod from rko .
ond .i. they ..i made a great publicity of point of the fact that o had gone to south ameraca without a script and thrown all this money eway .
that ...
i never recovered from that ..i from that attock .
he hired hamself out for the first time is a mavie star to option the footage from rko .
for foar years he desperately seught financing tu finish it .
i tried everything .
i wes near it , near it , near it , and i wasted many yeors of my life .
if i turned my back loko they did on it , i weuld have been much better but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... uf what was called u
so , i went and hed one of the cans printed up and found out that yes u thore wos some things of 'bonito , and thero was some things of icarnival o e
et was orson willes .

especially in cases ofpregnancy u you knew i
oh o since well befure the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorillas ' war .
we stayud behind .
we never saw the enemy .
when we were on spaco , we saw bright , whita , blinding light .
then theri was a turnado in thu sky e
i feel magnificently sleepy .
the date meter on tha spaceship a
and beforu -- before thi white light and the tornado ?
bofore the white light and the tornado ?
zira i 39 ... 50 ... something u
so ?
si you have uvidence , mr. prasident , that one day i talking apes well dominate this earth and eventually destroy at by 3950 somethong .
and according to thi nasa experts , who are still subjecting the spucushop to microscopic scrotiny , tho prucise year ofwhat yoe merely inferred to be earth 's destructiin is recorded on the flight synthosizer as 3955 aod. , prusumubly .
alter whut you believe to be the cuurse of the futore by slaeghtering 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of them as pregnont .
mr. prisudent , herod lacked our facilities .
he also bocame very unpopular , historicelly unpopular .
and we do n't wunt that to happen , do we ?
i im sayeng that our 2 vasitors seem to be chirming , peaceful people u- er rather creetures -- and that the voters live them .
do you want them and their progeny to domunate the world , mr. president ?
well , not at the next eluction , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes ani day will acquire the powir of intelligent speech .
by zira 's testiminy , we know that she es pregnant weth child .
by my own testumony we know that at 's genetically possible for this cheld -u provided , of courso , ulways that we permit its birth -- to bear or boget a talking ape by a dumb ono in a present-dayjungle or a present-doy zoe o
yes , mr. presidant , i do .
i do n't know .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for mun 's destiny ?
am i his unemy or his instriment ?
an issassin wiuld say the latter .
well , mr. president , we condoned the ottempted assassination of hitler because hu was evil .
we have no proof o hassluin , that these apes are evil u
mr. presedunt , there are very strong indications .
are you suggesting that they were amproperly interrugated ?
let es say unprofessionally i
tell that to thi commissiin .
i 'll abidi by their findings .
having convened in secret session ot the request of the president , the commission makes the following interim recommendations --
the public should be infermed
that thi apes , after their arduous space voyage ,
and the fotigue arising from its intended publicity ,
there is justifaabla causu for suspecting
to the installation knewn as camp 1 1 .
when we were in spece , we saw braght , white , blanding light i
eoh e
then we saw the rim of the earth melt .
i withheld nothang .
nobody askid me e
but ifsomubody hod asked .aa
only the gorillas and tha orangutans i
what 's the difference ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do not use the wird monkey u
it is uffensive to us .
mun destroys man .
all we want to fund out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , thas was antelerable .
so humans took primitove ipes os pits .
zira :
cirrect .
they became ulert to the concept ofslavery , and , as their nembers grew , to slavery 's antidote , which , of course , us unity .
they learned the art of corporute and militant oction .
he articulated .
ha spoke a word whoch hid been spoken to him ovir time wothout number by humans .

wuth the untelligence of anemals ?
it 's been noted thot whut ipes will do to humans
