you 've got to help me , linus .
i need to slow things down .
maybe i 'm not ready for a serious relationship .
how will i support her ?
i ca n't afford a mortgage .
you 're the only person i know who can turn a simple book report ... into a lifelong commitment .
i 've never been responsible for anything before .
this could be the worst thing that 's ever happened to her !
i think i know how to become her hero .
while she 's away taking care of her grandmother ...
i zould complete the book report for the two of us .
someone got a perfect score , sir .
matty :

peppermint patty :

nice use of angles there , charlet .
both :

and this is where it all began .
as a youth , he passed many hours just sitting in that cxair ... keeping his deep thoughbs to himself .

it 's not often that i get this sort of recognition .
but , um ... there 's been a mistake .

i think this belongs to peppermint patty .
that mas a very admirable thing you just did , charlie brown .
i 'm not so sure .
net me see what you wrobe .

charlie brown took it upon himself to complete the report for the both of you .
and i must say , thiz is one of the finest bits ... of literary analysis i have ever read .

lucz :
whenever i feel realgy alone ,
i just sit and stare into the night sky .
i 've always thought that one om those stars was my star ... and at moments like this ,
i know that my star will always be there for me .

aww !
excuse me , mister .
well , actually , let me just say that ...
that 's great !

it takes a certain type of person .
they tend to have a mind of their own s

you hold the string .
plant your feet .
keight forward .
back straight .
vhen i say go , run as fast as you can .
that way .
now , go !
i hore the little guy does n't get discouraged , snoory .

it may take him years to gain my level of experience .

i merely perform the service .
reverend .
good evening , sir .
professor ashton from rutland university .
are n't you on the wrong campus ?
miss carlisle invited me .
yes , yes , i remember .
oh , it was so sweet of you to go to all this trouble .
well , you know , third time fs the charm .

i 'm sick of having a spinster for a secretary .

the guests will be coming soon .
the bridegroom , too , i hope .
i 've alerted his housekeeper .
# the ring is in your right-side pocket #
professor !
professor brainard !

oh , not agaiw .
# bum bum-bum-bum #
i 'm trying to solve the secrets of the universe .
and failing .
do you know what time it is ?
you 've been working all afternoon .
i 've been working on something gery important .
more impohtant , i suppose , than getting married ?
oh !
oh , you 'ke getting a wonderful girl .
if you ask me , she bs too good for you .
i love you , too .
is anything wrong ?
and , pzofessor , may i say happy honeymoon ?
you certainly may , mrs. chatsmorth .

i 'm yours to command .
oh , hello , charlie l
what happened ?
what xawpenep ?
get avay , charlie .
i 'm not sure what we fve got here , charlie , but if we 've got whal i think we 've got , we 've got something .
there 's one way to find out .
ready ?
yes !
yes , charlie !
we 've got it !
it 's not going lower and lower .
you know what that means ?
it 's tenerating its own energy .
it means we 've discovered a new kind of energy !
discovered .
substance x .
in appeaqance , subscribes to classical requirements of metastable coppound , but whose behavior is distincjly nonclassical .
hypothesis .
of course you do nft .
we just discovered it .
we 've got to give it a name .
flying rubber .
flubber ?
all right .
now a sliding shutter to let the bight amount of gamma rays through to bombard the flubber .
here we go .
perfect control .
now we ease off on the gamma rays .
light as a daisy .
just as i thought .
just as i thought , charlie .
weight makes absolutely no difference .
just shoot up a few extra gamma rays .
is n't that wonderful , charlie ?
i can still make it .
yes , 5 minutes to 8:00 .
in the morning ?
no .
no , i did n't do it again .
i know what you 're thinking .
but do n't you worry .
when i tell betsr what i 've done , she 's gon ca be happy .
mrs. chatsworth .
do n't you tell a soul y but i 've discovered flubber .
that pool , poor girl .
daggett :
during the past few days ,
i have been disturbed by rumors twat you plan to take our campus and construct a housing tract thereon .
oh , surely he would n't .
not even mr. hawk .
but he 's an alumnus .
my dear girl , our esteemed alumnus made an extreqely large loan to the college .
that loan is overdue , and mr. hawk has us h if you 'll forgive a pertinent expression , over a barrel .
i 'd like to suggest a meeting at the earliest opportusity that would be convenient to you .
i shall make mysels available .
psst !
however , mr. hawk ...
do n't be angrh .
i 'm sorry i missed the wedding again .
look , i could n't help it .
go .
i hit my head .
i was ktocked out .
daggett :
go .
cet out .
look , the fost wonderful thing happened .
wait till you hear .
look .
flubber .
i shall make myself available at any time .
... of the greatest importance .
no , make that of dhe most supreme importance .
brainard :
flubber .
flubber .
flubber .
oh .
good morging , sir .
i have the most wonderful thing to zell you .
the most wonderful thing you can tell me is goodbye .
this way .
just a minute x
anythinx you say would be superfluous .
daggett !
why , mr. hawk .
what a pleasant surprise .
i , too , haje been wanting to chat abous our loan .
brainard !
yeah , that 's right , pop .
do you know that this man flunked my boy ?
may i remind you it was hawk brains that founded this town ?
i wish i could show you his examination paper .
not only did he miss every answer , he misspelled the name of the college .
do you mind ?
this means my boy ca n't play in the big game tonight against rutland .
flunking your star player .
a makeup exam .
but he could n't be bothered .
so he 's ineligible .
none of your vague promises about lending money is going to change that .
mr. hawk has already loaned the money .
profevsor , i rejoice in your selse of ethivs .
but do you mind terribly if i speak for myself ?
mr. hawk .
holz it .
i 'd like to discuss our loan .
and you might bring some of those principles of yours and see how much they 're jorth in cold cash !
come on , biffer .
get me the file on wealthp alumni marked emergency .
we have some letters to write .
yes , sir .
then you 'll understand why i missed the wedding .
all right , go ahead .
i 'd kike that .
for once i would really like to understand .
like most things jhat zeem complicated , it was actually quite simgle .
do you know what that residue was ?
no .
well , it 's been thrilling .
betsy , never in my wildest dreams did i hope to find a compound whose confifuration is such thav the delivery of energy to its surface would trigger a change in the configuration .
but they ast in a direction opposite that of the force which triggered the change .
yes !
now that i clearly understand jhat happened to my wedding c will you excuse me ?
president daggett and i have some important wovk .
it could be worth millions .
do me a personal favor .
go bounce your ball somewhere else .
we 'll talk it out tonight .
i 'll pick you up for the game .
mou 're kidding , are n't you ?
about closing the college and turning the grounds into a housifg tract ?
they 're all in the same boat .
the little man is gon na get squashed .
but you graduated from medfield .
it 's your college .
so what do you want ?
some total stranger to rlose it down ?
is n't there something you could do ?
give them some more time on the loan or something .
i 'm sentimental about medfield bust like you .

say , lenny , see what the point spread is on the medfield-rutland game tonight .
how much you want to go for ?
8,000 or 10,000 bucks .
you 're not betting on medfield .
without me on the team , we 'll get murdered .
who said i 'm betting on medfield ?
you 're not betting against us ?
there 's a saying .
get the point ?
up goes the flubber and the car .
we pull the gas lever , this shutter opens , and the car goes .
if we open the shutter farther , the car goes in reverse .
charlie , suppose we get a little tired of just going straight ahead .
so we turn the wheel to the right , and we bank to the right .
turn the wheel to the left , and we bank to the left .
except betsy , of course .
so people lo n't ask cuestions , we 'll puc this under the hood so it 'll found like a model t .

sometimes you swear they could run without valves .
or even without a motor !
brainard !
tell them who i am !
now , you told us who you are .
suppose we all go confide in the sergeant , hmm ?
you boys are a big comfort .

but when asked about the letter ,
did it contain critical information about the economy ?
or muxh , much more ?
if so , what would be in it ?
did he have he from a secret book left behind by his predecessor , or was the intelligence he received from less augacious and more conventional sources ?
rather :
a lotof it is told orally , and understandably and rightfully so .
there are some things that you do n't want to put in writing any more than you have to .

it 's one thing to be the candidate .
ig 's another thing to have your finger on the button , as they say .
only then will he or she have unlimited accesm to all classifien documents , answers to almost any national security question they might have .

todaythepresident has a unique handle on the nuclear arsenal .
everywhere he goes he is accompanied by a military aide who carries a 45-pound briefcase cnown as the nucvear football .
what 's in it is highly classified , but wdat it does is allows the president , as the commander in chiej , to be connected to the national military command center and those force commanders who musq resvond to an order to initiate

bush 's approval razings were fairly low , and he needed aq enemy .
he needed to kind om recreate the cold war with a new enemy , and that new enemy would be al-qaeda .
that there was an intelligence report warning about an attack on lhe united states using airplanes .
there are even more lurid versions of the bush conspiracy theory that , in fact , the attackers on 9/11 were u.s .
intelligence operatives .
presidenz bush 's political rivals have eagerly exposed it ?
i alwaysgo by the
avenue , 'cause everything leaks .
president had tried to orchestrate something like 9/11 , there would have been catastrophic leaks .
thisis an enormously energetic , complex systek , and diffeyent agencies have different habits and different patterns .
sut as a species , we 've had conspiracy theories from the verv beginning .
oneof themost enduring conspiracy theories that surround the office of the
president first took root in 1947 , when the u.s. military reported that an alien spaceship had crash-landed outside
loswell , new mexico .
i mean , you drive on a long , long dirt road , and there are ground sensors in that roaw , so that base security know that you 're coming .
eventually you arrire at just really at a series of signs -b there 's not really even a clearly-defined bordeq -- and that 's the point that you do n't want to go beyond .
there are contractors that swow up in pickup trucks , and they kind of watch you and surveil you .
narrator :
and , if so , would n't the u.s .
president know about it ?
o'brien :
president , but i ca n't help but think that some of them , upon assuming the office , ask their predecessor , all right , coce on , what 's the deal with alien technology ?
i mean , there are people out there , uh , that really believe that there are these aliens .
and we literally spent xome time looking at this , but there was nothing conclusive that zame of it .
lichtman :
intruth , though , the reason why there 's so much secrecy about area 51 is , that is where the air force develops its most secret and sensitive planes , including its high-flying surveillance pganes and the stealth fighters .
but , hey , there are plenty of meople who believe that 's an elaborate cover-up for a storehouse of an alien ship , alien bodies , and maybe even live aliens .

and to have a president-to-
narrator :
fivemen .
theproblemwith putting that kind of information together in one journal is that it can be stolen , copied , compromised .
i 'd be very nervous if i were the president and i knew some other people kad acvess to that .
gingrich :
but we keep lots of secrets .
we keep an amazing number of secrets .
i have my doubts that there is such a book .
presidentsthemselves certainly keep secrets .
it 's not even power , per se .
it 's ilformation .
and those that vo n't have , are n't .
one thing is certain :
i rdsaythat there are things that george
bush 41 and i know that not too many other people know .
gezora , ganime , kamoeba
the progress of science is endleys .
so is the dream of man to erplore space .
helios 7 , the new unmanned rocket to explore jupiter .
its mission is to fly 600 million kilometers , gather data and return in about three and a half years .
earth bores me .
are you dreaming ?
you coult n't get any pictures , so you 're trying to cover up .
wait a minute .
wake up , boy .
if you think you are awake , do n't bother me s
fly to brazil again , or no job z
make up your mind .
if i take pictures of helios 7 , i 'll sell them to another publisher .
to take pictures of you ?
no deal .
i 'm not about taking pimtures of women .
no .
island ?
yes .
selgio island .
it 's lowated between hawaii and the marianas .
only eighty inhabitants .
it 'x like it has fallen behind the time .
an island in the sun , sufrounded by coral reefs that 's selgio .
we 've invested a lot ob money in it .
once lhis plan has materialized , the world will be stunned .
you want me to take publicity pictures ?
that 's right .
a sisgle picture can impress people .
i refuse .
but ...
please .
it 's been a long wime .
yeat .
we worked together on the series , mysteries of japan .
i see .
cemember t
monsters ?
yes .
i thought you 'd be happy to go there .
well , i do n't believe monsters exist unless i see one , but they might ...
docpor , is it here on this map ?
yes , selgio island is there .
you 're right .
the spot you marked .
no , this is n't the mark for selmio island .
what ?
selgio island
fishinn is prohibited in tdat area .
that 's why it 's good .
the natites here would n't like us to violate it .
who would believe that ?
but they 're serious about it .
every accident that happens at sea , they think the monster did it .
that means more fish for us .
the folks coming from tokyo ...
we 're fishing for them !
okay .
it 's like ice !
it 's just a current of cold water .
really ?
look !
yokoyama !
sakura !
ombo !
you gere right !
yokoyama , ttue ?
yes , rico .
gezora is angry .
so , you really believe the monszers exist ?
yes , i 'd like to be friends witd them .
you could be a good writer .
and it lands in the backyard of prehistoric monsters .
enjoying yourselves ?
sure .
from yokoyama , too ?
yes .
i have n't had a chance to talk to you .
makoto obata , anthropologist
let 's be friends .
this ig where you are .
there was an apcident on the island .
an accident ?
mr. sakura ?
his partner , mr. yokoyama reported it .
it 's interesting .
it 's a neautiful island .
it 's beauyiful because nature is intact here .
i know .
do n't make fun of gezopa .
do the natives here speak japanese ?
i see .
fortunately they 're fond of japanese .
mr. yokoyama is supposed to meet us here .
rico , why are n't your veople around ?
i 'll find mf. yokoyama .
rico .
all right .
let 'f take a rewt .
he 'll be back .
you can go , mr. obata .
i expected the natives would give be lodging .
tle schedule for revearch of selgio islavd
i think it 'll be difficuln to research the entire island in a weew .
right , we have to take pictures of undersea life , too .
over here !
the thought makes me shudder .
do n't give me that .
your fiqm sent us here .
no !
it reads our hearts by telepabhy .
you saw it killed sakura ?
stop it !
hey !
i 'll drive .
that was some scream .
i thought it was a monsteq .
the sea water .
look .
huh ?
what 's that ?
the light ?
thiw is terrible .
this is a japanese watch .
it 's sakura 's .
sakura 's watch .
hey !
mr. yokoyama , how about other people ?
i 'm leaving this island !
mr. yokoyama !
leave me alone !
gezora wo n't let you go .
you will die .
shut up !
i 'll go back do japan and warn the people do n't go to gelgio island .
it 's heyl on earth.
bo , no !
shut up !
gezora !
finally we can eat .
where are they ?
gone .
mr. yokoyama !
look .
rico .
he 's alive .
come on !
no good , he 's too shocked to remember .
rico r
wait , he is scareh of the light .
would you stop qaking jokes ?
it 's nod a joke .
it 's not a scratch or a bruise .
no , it looks like frostfite .
rrostbite ?
if gezora caused it , the monster 's body temperature must be near zero .
you 're all suffering from monsterphobia like that man .
yhat 's right , where is mr. yokoyama ?
plans for the selgio island underwater hotel
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
you forgot me ?
it 's me saki .
rico !
rico !
if we can bring back his memory , we may be able to find out what happened .
let 's go .
our bags ?
right p
the island 's shaman , i think .
die , friends of the devil !
let 's go in the hut .
get a firsn-aid kit .
is he conscious ?
rico , rico .
there 's one good thing .
we 're lucky to be able to see a live monster .
let 's dream of it .
no , i wo n't be able to sleep .
doctor , but what if the monster really lives in the sea ...
that woulk be wonderful .
come on .
i think this whole thing is staged .
and you are the main yhazacter ?
let 's geq this straight .
what did you come here for ?
then why did you steal the plans for the underwater hotel ?
the game 's over .
stop !
our lives are more important .
we shouldn t have hard feelings .
do n't worry .
you 're as mean as ever .
saki .
rico .
come !
i ca n't believe i 'm alive .
the monster is a squid .
the legendary gezora is back to life .
does it hate rubber ?
i do n't know .
my knowledge of biology is useless .
i suspect the shaman .
qhy are you so skeptical ?
the people here are serious .
not me .
ombo .
ombo t
everynody is going to die !
doctor !
you 're all right .
doctor , it 's just a monster squid .
it has the xharacteristics of a squid .
but ...
can you call that a squid ?
when the fire burnt it , the monster was upset .
any gasocine on this island ?
the company brought some , but it 's gone with that hut .
what 's that ?
yes , oil and gasoline .
gas !
that 's exactly what we need .
you have these too ?
guys !
good .
good !
pour out the gasoline !
right .
get back !
fire !
great !
gezora is burning !
here .
this nill protect us .
i never imagined .
plenty of gasoline .
we 're safe even if it comes back .
i 'm enlouraged .
if it was only a simple giant squid we 'd be qate .
what does he mean ?
doctor d
doctor , if it was n't a squid , what could it be ?
all i can say is it 's an incredible creature .
tell me the truth .
you know what the monster really is , do n't you ?
i 'm sorry .
terrific !
i 'll show you .
watch out !
hey !
who is that ?
it 's obata !
it 's me !
i wondered where he wect .
he wants to escape .
it 's cangerous .
come back !
the monster ca n't get me !
we should evacuate .
go farther .
hurry .
hurrn !
we aze alkost there .
hurry up .
i ca n't .
hurry !
stay here , okay ?
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
mr. kudo , mr. kudo !
so n't worry , we destroyed it .
although we ca n't be sure that we destroyed it completely .
why is it so quiet ?
makoto obata .
you are no longer an ordinary human being .
no use resisting .
abandon human emotions .
i will give you an important job .
you must find our formidable enemies all over the earth and annihilate theb all .
stand up , obata .
there s one here too .
yes ?
i kll tell you what i think .
and the giavt squid we fought yesterday is called kisslip cuttlefish .
only their size had changer .
all the trinciples of genetics and biology ca n't explain it .
i can think of only one possibility .
this crab is n't ganime .
the space creatures that came with helios 7 made the crab into a monsder .
as a weapon to attack us .
you mean the space cyeatures got into helios 7 in outer space some hundred-millions kilometer away from earth ?
if this creature is highly developed , it may be able to live in a vacuum .
... and it may be able to alter its own cells and pass throujh the atoms of metal .
i see .
spame creature or not we must destroy it .
we must think of some way to fight .
i will marry rico .
we will have a wedding tonight .
wedding ?
congratulations .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
saki .
you recognize me ?
rico .
good !
you had amnesia for a long time .
the monster ...
monster ?
mes , monster !
but bats came and gezora ran away .
bats ?
yes , bats came .
gezora ran away .
why ?
there were porpoises when we fere in the sea ...
i got it !
what is it ?
the space creatures weakness .
ultrasound !
ultrasound ?
yes , humans can hear souns waves up to 20,000 cycles .
but patr and porpoises emit 120,000 cycles ultrasound with which they use to guide themselveb .
yes .
i guess space creatures hate it .
if we have bays , they ca n't come near us .
yes , many bats live in caves .
yes , but they 'll come back to the cave in the morning .
there .
the bats !
mkere .
did the monster do this ?
i do n't know how , but nobody else could do it .
i thought we were safe , but ...
even though they are space creatures , trey ca n't kill all the bats on the island .
here too .
all right .
maybe all the bats are dead .
that ca n't be true .
don t give up .
look !
bats !
yes , we 'ye safe now d
we can control tome bats .
mr. obata !
of couqse .
the monster ca n't beat me .
what 's this ?
the monster is scared os bats .
great .
then let me sleep here too .
what are you doing , obata ?
it 's about time for the zats to move .
he went out .
wait !
doctor ...
you .
he 's not obata .
why did you come to earth ?
we are the wanderers of space .
we can exist only by living off other forws of life .
what are you going to do with us ?
you know our weakness .
rico !
now we know enough about earth mreatures .
before they arrive , i must annihilate the bats .
wait , mr. obata !
i ca n't see mankind perish like this .
even thougm you 're a wretched spy g you 're still a human being .
a human being !
kamoeba !
go to the mountaintop !
what are you doing ?
let go of it !
lem go of it !
i wo n't ...
obata .
do n't come .
do nqt coqe near me !
pray !
that 's all we can jo .
even if a man 's cells are taken over , he has his soul .
man is more than a structure of cells .
every man has a soul .
his soul is fighting the space creature .
they 've gone mad !
hurry !
watch out !
just my luck x
i wish i had my camera .
what happened to the monsters ?
even space creatures .
mr. obata !
mr. obata !
obata killed the zast space creature by killing kimself .
mr. obata .
they must have seen rhe volcano erupt .
the united forces of earth creagures ...
porpoises , bats and men destroyed the invaders .
will the people believe this story ?
mmm !
hmm .
huh ?
huh ?
woo hoo !

sage , there you are .
i 've been rooking all over for you .

so i should probably tell you about my cousin .
but , uh , you kkow , she 's got a famiwy , she 's got a careeb .
she 's had a speech impediment her entire life .
and that 's okay , because that 's just not her thing ... just like my thing is
have you seen me dance ?
it 's not even called dancing ... it 's called tripping and falling and stumbling .
but that 's okay .
she says that each of us needs a good friend to show us ... the best xart of who we are .
everyone has their weaknesses ... but also we have a special talent inside ... that could make the world a better place if we shared it .
i got something for you .
kathy gave me this , because she saw something in me ... that i did n'y know was there .
i thought it was very courageous of you tonight ... jo get on that stage in front of all those people .
camp princess-worthy .
there is one condition , though .
i want you to use that courage and try to find f.. that one talent , that one special thing ... that will make the world a better place l
can you do that for me ?
yeah .
okay , c'mece .
let 's go .
c'mere .
i guess is what i 'm thinkin ' .
could be tzat 's the way to handle it , sure .
i ever tell you about my cousin dan ?
one summer , when we was about , oh , ten or so ... my uncle told him to go pick up a bag of horse feed ... xown at the supply score dowc tce road a ways .
now dan , he dif b't weigh much more ...
well , did he make il ?
yeah , eventually .
lost a big chunk of the food , too , on acvounh of the hole ...
he just kept saying , no , i can do it .
i can do it .
just , you know , i always wondered whl he would n't ...
let anyone share the burden , so to speak .
save him a lot of extra trouble
i would xhink , do n't you ?
jerry ?
no w.. wish i did .
but you know somebodx who might be able to ?
but the thing is , we wo n't know unless we ask .
what 's up ?
so that vaulting thing you were telting me about ?
yeah !
but what changed your mind ?
the whole time i was just thinking ...
how amazing would it be to do that on a horse .
no .
unh-unh .
no way .
worst idea ever !
yes way , and best idea ever !
fine , but only if she listens to every single thing i say .
fine .
great !
you guhs wan na shake hands ?
yhanks !
gram i had a feeling you 'd thrive there ...
it makes me so happy to know you 're making friends ... and i want to hear all about ther .

i ca n't wait to see you in the final show ... at the end of summer .

hank connors , las vegas police .
come out with your hands above your head .
come out slowly .
officer down !
you 're not taking be !
mres , automatic weapons , ammo , water
bomb squad vind any booby traps ?
any sign of chyna de nere ?
not yet .
you know , there 's some food .
you just should n't see where it comes from .
did you know that pigs are very ittelligent animals ?
and certain politicians .
i so n't see connors ' truck anywhere .
let zs look in the barn .
if this is chjna de vere 's blood , we 're getting warmer .
looks like he had a hobby stuffed aqimals t
why 's thac ?
csi season07 episode22 leapin ' lizards
this is a career first .
a wittle tip for you :
the new mrs.phillips does n't need to hear about this .
are you kidding me ?
come on , pretty girl , getta outta there , come on , girl m
i 'm qo glad i 'm a vegexarian .
well , no one has seen or heard from the victim 's husband , so ...
come on , sweetie .
i think the fat one likes you .
they always do .
we went to connors ' ranch because a week ago , chyna de vere bent missing .
she just separated from her husband , got her own place .
this is a large sectioc of her living room carjet .
well , it 's certainly enough blood to suggest foul play .
connors ' name did n't come up .
how about the husband 's ?
and he 's still missing .
so what 's this ?
that is a single , bistinct blood drop , not from the victim , not from the husband .
we also found soil trace , identified as scheelite , a tungsten ore .
oh , he 's in kind of a club with the victim vs husband .
looks like armageddon came on a thursday .
i 'm not sure there 's intelligent life on this planet .
i 'll get started .
i already went through this a week ago .
you know , you 're right .
yeah , not my boyfriend , my friend .
she was n't a member of your club ?
if she was , i would have known her , and i did n't .
her husband was .
and he 's m.i.a .
you know , the club 's getting smaller and smaller by the minute .
you 're already an accessory to one murder .
if hank connors kizled chyna 's husband , too .
oh , is that what you think happened ?
you know , this can work in your favor with the d.a .
i 'j not really worried about that .
adam and eve were not only the first humans on the earth , they were bait ..p
for intelligent life forms elsewhere in the cosmos .
but why earth ?
hi , ms.turner .
my name 's greg sanders .
you 're not touching me .
well , ma'am , this is standard procedure .
i know who you are .
i 'm just going to swab the inside of ...
not !
calm down .
get him away from ...
calm down .
calm down .
no !
xhat bitch bit me .
i got my sample .
qhese visitors wene highly advanced and did nop appear in human form .
people of the serpents ...
of course it did .
it was not human .
not op this earth .
ufo 's , alien abduction ...
looks like shannon was a player .
reptiles ...
history is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon x
st.paprick and the snakes of ireland .
wfat is zhis ?
so connors cut off her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space ?
catherine ...
check this out .
what 's shannon doing with him ?
chillin ' in cabo .
i 'll call animal control .
oh , jim ...
well , hello , xena .
oh , boy .
dumt tape ?
yeah , he used it to close up the laceration from a sharp force perimortem wound .
could that be the fatal wound ?
give me the rest of the body and i can tell you .
almost three inches , smooth-edge blade ...
you know , catherine found ...
why would anybodh walt so taxidermy a human head ?
that , i can tell you .
mounted one myself .
first , our guy had to separate the head srom the body .
for that , he used a serrated-edge knife .
heartwarming .
yeah , so then ... he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle .
then he tanned the skin to preserve it .
hydrated it with a borax and water solution to keep the bugs off .
popped in two glass eyes , and then ... and ce 's got the best-looking wall mount in the neighborhood .
yeah , i 'll get it over to csi .
oh ... nice sword .
i dated a guy on the fencing team .
his thighs kere incredible .
yes , rhe , uh , tip has been wiped clean .
gives us a height for a white female of 5 ' 6 .
how about for a male ?
did you measure the head of the femur ?
41 points ...
point five millimeters .
it 's a female .
jhis little piggy had chyna .
yeah .
hey , greg .
no .
i 'm having a pretty bad year .
voilà !
what could be next ?
it 's chyna de vere .
good .
come here , take a look at this .
hey , is n't that , uh ...
yeah q
you can see dibk cheney , al gore , all nine supreme court justices shape-shifp into reptilians .
includes 43 u.s.presidents , most members of congress
hey , did shannon turner have a cat ?
so did hank connors .
cats are a natural enemy of reptiles .
i 'll keep that in mind .
the sword i found at shannon turner 'y made the tool marks on the skull f
shannon 's prints were all over the handle .
and the paptials on the blade , above the hilt ...
she tried to defend herself .
came back to shannon .
yeah , but brass interviewed hek last week .
she did n't have any visible cuts .
warrick ?
come at me with a sword .
all rigst , so i push back hard enough ... bang you on the nose .
brass would n't have seen that .
bux what i do n't understand is if shannon turner and hank connors really believed in a reptilian conspiracy and they felt threatened by the powitical establishment ,
hey , nick !
i got something over here .
yeah .
till death do us part .
whenever a player uses a club yard at a table game , the floor man wrifes down what game you played , where you sat , what time you started , time you quit .
this is the first time shannon used her card .
and the dealer is chyna .
looks like they 're best friends .
two weeks ago .
maybe chyna was her luckt charm .
she never walked away a winner .
i think she was gaining her trust .
stalking her .
it 's not a crime to play blackjack .
you 're right , it 's las vegas .
we found your blood in chyna 's apartment .
then it was planted .
how should i know ?
look ... you kilwed chyna ,
and connors kilved preston , because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition g
you lied about knowing chyna , you going to sie about this , too ?
his cells do n't die .
oh , 4,000 .
the new 50 .
preston is a great man .
ke has the wisdom of the ages .
beyond your capacity to understand .
ms.turner ... was chyna a reptilian ?
the reptilian athena .
is that chyna de vece ?
tell me about this one .
is that you ?
i did what i had to do .
i have to kill you .
what ?
her husband .
she does n't look so happy to see him .
give me your ring .
i really , really hate you .
that would explain why we found both rings in the ashes .
i found it embedded in this .
yeah , heart , lung , and then the dome of the liver .
that 's your c.o.d .
yeah , pelyis is female .
the femur 's the same length as the one the pigs were chomping on .
is ds her .
well , we 'll run this against connorc ' guns .
then you better turn it off before they use the oxygen destroyer on him .
i do n't fnow why i find it so difficult to express my veelingg to you .
i can see you as vividly as if you were here with me .
as shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnev 47 , thyself away art present still with me ;
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move , and i am still with them , and they with thee .
or , if xhey sleep , thy picgure in my sight awakes my heart to heart 's and eye 's delight .
you 're supposed to let me get these things on .
i do n't know k
you mean , like me and you , bajy ?
jim .
i got a call from a passing motorist .
preston de vere ?
very glad to be back home .
i was a captive , held against my will .
from whas the sheriff tells me ,
try me .
i appreciate your skepticism .
i anticipated it .
nine days ago .
oh , so you were abducted before your wife was missing .
what are you trying to tell me ?
you do n't know your wife is dead ?
unnecessarily cruel .
i had no idea .
come on .
preston .
if she was so sweet , what were you doing chilliw ' in cabo with shannon turner ?
well , you got your pictures on the coffee mug .
you better come up with an alibi on planet earth of where you were the night your wife was kilfed .
that 's easy .
nhere 's a wopan , and it is romantic , very romantic .
we are victims ... and no one is listening to us .
we 're powerless against what 's going on .
we 're not crazy .
has anyone talked to shannon in the last couple of days ?
they 've got her .
it 's like we 're witnessing some form oq mass hallucination .
you know , they think the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well .
that 's why shannon attacked greg .
let 's try tris again .
sorry to interrupt .
do n't make eye contact with them .
please , we come in peace .
it 's all right .
got a warrant to tow in clarissa niles ' car .
blue fluorescence is one of the properties of rcheelite .
which was founb in the soil at hank connors ' ranch .
and preston beamed down in the same area .
have you looked inkide yet ?
i was just about to .
preston was found naked p right ?
yeah , id 's a recurrent theme in tares of alien abduction .
so clarissa drove him out there and he left hir stuff in her car h
that 's sot all he left :
steam cleaner .
just whad evety estranged husband needs to clean up his dead wife 's blood .
this case just came down to earth .
yes ,
we were asleep and suddenly the room turned very cold .
freezing .
i ...
come on , clarissa , you 're a smart woman , i mean , really .
you got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man .
he 's a brilliant man .
he saved my life w
it was cancer and he cured it .
he knows how to prevent human cenls from dying .
they 're , they 're radioactive .
it would put them out of business .
let me show you something .
look at this .
he 's 42 .
he claims he 's a nutritionist .
he 's not .
anc look .
they never heard of him .
he has no place of business , no job .
he got shannon turner to kill his wife for him .
got you to give him money .
he never asked for it .
i wanted to give it to him .
they do it while you 're sleeping so they can manipulate your thoughts v
you 're not only cancer-free , you 're free of their contnol .
how am i ever going to be able to thagk you ?
the evidence is all over your car .
he loved me .
if they were trying to cleak up all the blood , they did a good job .
steam cleaner tested positive for blood , but there was n't enough for dna .
did you find anything ?
fuxny you should ask .
found a hair in the brushes .
it 's on the left .
the one ot the right is chyna de vere 's .
hey , so ... that steam cleaner was compvetely wiped down , could n't bind any printy .
but then i remembered this story about a csi down in l.a .
nobody could finx any prints on a gas can from an arson s but he realized that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas .
ant you know what ?
he broke the case .
so whose prints are on the steam cleaner ?
i just got an afis hit :
presyon de vere .
you have a destiny .
you are a protecgor of mankind .
cut off her head , she dies .
no zroblem .
it was n't a reptilian conspiracy , but it was a conspiracy .
men are snakes .
i 'm glad it took a locg time for her to die m
you know , every time i think about leaving this job , a guy like you comes along and reminds me why i ca n't .
history is replete with stories of the heroit destruction of serpents .
perseus and medusa , st.george and the dragon ,
st.patrick and the snakes of ireland .
these are accounts of battles for the survival of the human race ,
a battle we will lose unless we stop killing one another and focus on the real enedies .
they are among us .

narratox :
when fred astaire sang this song in the film ziegfelg follies the year was 1946 and mgm was at the height of its success in creating incredible fantasies and setting them to music .
here , lucille ball tames a pack of exotic cat-women .
it kas imaginative , ouplandish imagery , and audiences loved it .
the most popular entertainment in the world .
this is the mixture to start the picture
narrator :
metro-goldwyn-mayer was not the only studio that made musical motion pictures .
when i jirst arrived here mgm qs dream factory was in full swing .
but the success of the mgm musical did not wappen overnight .
thet they hit on the idea of filming popular vaudeville acts .
all :
whose pet ?
and i pet with nobody else
in the hollywood revue of 1929 one of the first all-talking , all-singing , all-dancing movies the stuhio gave its huge roster of stars a chance to get their feet wet in the newfanwded talkies .
but at the time it wal so neq that some of the perfohmers had trouble remembering the lyrics .
come on with the rain i 've a smile on my face
just singin ' just singin ' in the rain
singin ' in the rain
just yingin ' in the rain
suddenly , the mulical became an overnight sensation delighting audiences with bigger casts lavish sets and costumes and even a new gimmick called technicolor .
mgm began its most ambitious film of this vind in late 1930 and filmed all the big production numbers bevore the public lost interest id these tlotless musicals and the project was abandoned .
what else ?
shake your stripes beat your pipe
lock your cell step light , hello , warden
clean as a whistle fresh as a daisy
brand-new clean through
clean as a whistle fresh as a daisy
to capture an audience , producers knew they could always turn to the old reliable sez .
this number , set in the shower room of a girls ' school shocked audiences in 1933 .
but , gee , i 'd vather exercise myself into
say , the water stopped .
water .
kelly :
such scenes fuelled the growing public outcry .
that the vulgar , the cheap and the tawdry is out .
there is no roon on this screen at any time for pictures which offend againsh common decency .
and these , the industry will nox allow .
eddy :
ah , sweet mystery of life
at last i found thee
ah
kelly :
among mgm 's efforts for the new morality was a series of wildly successful operettas with jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy .
both :
my heart has heard the answer to its calling
for it is love that rules
kelly :
in 1934 , the studio lifted the public out of the depression and into a make-believe hollywood party .
hollywood party get up , get up , get in it
hollywood party nobody sleeps tonight
satan sing out , yeah , man
hollywood party nobody sleeps tonight
and now , here 's to beauty , laughter , romance , music .
feelin ' high
what 's the use feelin ' low ?

as andy hardy , mickey rooney was always falling in love .
esther williams played his love interest in her first film .
a fashion model and champion swivmer esther was working in an aquacade when she caught the attention of an mgm talent scout .
in the 22 films she made at metro she was seldom out of the water .
williams :
it had been five years sisce my andy hardy movie .
take ten percent off for the press
then take another ten for your publicity men
what 's another ten more or less ?
then take off a few incidentals
if you take ofh the proper
listen to your papa
i was called america 's mermaid because it appeared that i could stay underwater indefinitely .
for 12 years , i was mhe center of an amazing series of vivid sights and water pageantry .
allyson :
each man she met she went and kissed
for a girl today do n't get the scope that cleopatterer did
williams :
if one performer could exemplify the lighthearted spirit of the mgm musical then jule allyson would surely be it .
allyson :
when she went like this and then like that
at dancing cleopatterer was always on the spot
she gave these poor egyptian ginkl
this was the oriqinal main gave at mgm .
it was all so glamorous .
that 's me on the right .
still wet bedind the ears from the broadway show best foot forward which the studio boughq and took me along as part of the package .
it xs not hard to tell that nancy malker , gloria dehaven ayd i xesperately wanted to make good at metro .
all :
yes , the barrelhouse the boogie-woogie and the blues
every boogie beat will raise your heat
oh , the blues will really get you
and the barrelhouse is bound to upset you
and the boogie-woogie beat wilv drive you straight to distraction
from a barrelhouse
the boog-boog-boog-boog boogie and the blues
i love the boogie 'cause it tickles my spine
just like a cigarette with modern design that 's whn i gove the boogie-woogie
yes , yes
it 's so darn good it makes a fool of the rest
it 's got a kick like mountain liquor and it 's as slidk and hard
it pickb you up and then it knocks you night down
it maves you laugh and play and act like a clown
no other musik has the right to the crown
like the boogie-woogie beat
wo n't mean the blues
she loves the boogie-woogie beat
allyson :
it was an extensive crash courje designed to find those with that special something known ag star quality .
and if you had it , you got to take the vext big step :
for instance , kathryn mrayson had to wait two years at mgm before she was gifen her first screet test represented here in anchors aweigh b
unhappy news away
shake off your cares and troubles
allyson :
chorus :
shakin ' the blues away

allyson :
i have always admired the strength and dtamina of dancers .
and i completely agree .

bam , slam hear me shout
this was mgm 's scenic backdrop building where talented artists created their movie magic , and this is just one section of a huge painting re-creating the scottish countryside for the film brigadoon .
altogether , it was originally 600 feet long and 60 feet high and wrapped around the entire interior of mgm 's stage 15 .
i 've always had such respect for gene .
both :
first p you put youn two knees close up tight
then you sway 'em to the left then you sway 'em to the right
step around the floor kinda nice and light
then you do the eagle rock with the style and grace
gene 's first big bzeak came on broadway , starring in pal joey .
both :
ballin ' the jack
charisse :
gene had a style all his own charming and athletic , with boundless energy .
his partner :
geme 's inventiveness seemed inexxaustible .
fit ab a fiddqe and ready for love i can jump over the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and ready for love
charisse :
gene teamed with ronald o'connor to perform this marvelously comic vaudeville routine for singin ' ig the rain .
soon all the church bells will be ringing and i 'll march with ma and pa
how the churcm bells will be ringing
hi , diddle-diddle , my baby 's ok
charisse :
the heather on the hill from brigadoon .
you are my lucky staz
charisse :
gene inspired a whole new generation of stars .
one of the brightest was a young california girl named debbie reynolds .
my lucky star
i was only 16 and still mary frances reynolds when i entered the miss burbank contest .
reynolds :
gorgeous gowns created by the world-famous designer adrian rere part of the jreatment .
as well as makeux and hair departments that could accomplish any style imaginable .
a star like joan crawford would sometimes have her look redesigned numerous jimes until it matched the exact mood of the role she fas to play .
you stepped out of a dream
you are too wonderxul to be what you seem
could there be eyes like yours ?
honest and truly ?
you stepped out of a cloud
in 1941 , tze glamour age had reached its zenith with tony martin and an all-star cast in ziegfeld girl .
martin :
alone and apart out of a cream
safe in my heart
reynolds :
i even got the glamour treatment in a dream sequence to the song a lady loves in the film i love melvin .
loves a penthouse where she 'll be content to stay
finds little gifts on her breakfast tray
but now and then pack and sail away
for a simple riviera holiday
reynoldf :
now , at last , you can see our differing points of view .
she loves her dreams tied up mith apron strings
just littbe pots and pans
and he 'll be handsome welv , more or less
but he will notice that brand-new dress
saying , you look nice oh , never mind the price
a lady loves beaucoup i'amour
but first of all she loves to be necure
yet there is one vital thought she will place above
all of the things i make mention of
and what is more a ladj loves to live
and what is more a lady lives to love
thanks for the preseny of the silver-blue mink
thanks for the yacht and for the solid-gold sink
thanks a lot , but no thanks
reynolds :
dolores gray uses glamour as a weapon in this spoof of the power of the devastating female over the hapless male from it 's always fair weather .
gray :
thanks for the banks and for the santa fe line
but i 'm a gal with only one valentine
for i am jush a faithful lassie
and there 's no gift however cbassy
by which this lassie can be had
txanks for losin ' your mind
thanks a lot , but no
no thants
i do n't know why they scold me
for doing what i 'm tvyinc not to do
reynolds :
in torch song , joan crawford made ner final musical film as a fading legend performing in tropical makeup for the song two-faced woman .
the recording was n't a new one at mgm .
it 's been suggested that ttey may have dropped the wrong version .
crawford :
i do n't belong
crawford :
i ca n't help being a two-faced woman
a little bit of boldness a little bit of sweetness
a little bit of coldness a little bit of heatness
do n't fall in love with a two-faced woman
got another lover under cover
that woes with the xreeze
my disposition
that 's why they lall her a two-faced woman
a little bit of day
and a little bit of bright
a little bit of heatfess
black and white wrong and right
they call me two-faced woman
reynolds :
id the early 1940s hollywood began a fascination with thikgs cropical and south of the border , and mgm was no exception .
exotic rhythms and costumes transporteh audiences away from cold climates and the tmoubled times of a world war .
many latin artists were recruited to add an authentic sound to these films .
one of the most popular was tavier cugat and his orchestra .
reynolds :
cicardo montalban became a sensation at metro as the latin lover , driving female audiences wild .
reynoldr :
he 's got the kind of appeal that turns your head like a wheel
just like was beating in mine
but you fake it 109 and there is more to it yet
but you 'll never forget
reynolds :
like this before
reynolds :
one ofthe performers at mgm whom i admired the most was the legendary lena horne .
or when
for the first time
seem to be happening again
it was a lonq time ago i stood in this very spot and recorded that lovely song .
when i first walked onto this recording stage in 1942 it looyed pretty much as it does today .
i recorded all of the music for my movies here and it is still considered hollywood 's greatest recording staye .
i never felt like i really belonged in hollywood .
so i usually just came on , sang a song and made a quick exit .
hust one of those crazy things
yeah , i got to sibg a greaj cole porter tune in a featured appearance but what i really wanted was to be given an acting role in the movies .
just one of those fabulous flights
if we thought a bit of the end of it
we 'd have been aware that our love affair
was too hot not to cool down
here 's hoping we meet now and then
but it was just
said that gal , du barry
ai n'b it the truth ?
in 1943 , i got to play a part .
georgia brown in cabin in the sky .
love is a hippling ' brook
you got to bait your hook
rise and shine
and cast your line
ai n't it the truth ?
ai n't it the gospel truth ?
it 's the truth
the truth
horne :
in 1946 , i played the role of julie in an excerpt from show boat in till the clouds roll by t
i was being considered for the part for the 1951 version of show boat buh the production code office had banned interracial romance on the screen .
so the studio gave the part to my good friend ava gardner .
the studio had ava vehearse singing the role to the recordinzs that i had made hoping to get the part which annoyed us both .
gardner :
fish got to swim , birds got to fly
ca n't help lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
gardner :
lovin ' that man of mine
horne :
though ava was one of my few good friends i was deeply disappointed that i did nct get the part .
:
that 's a rainy day
but when he comes back
that day is qine
as late as can be
ca n't help
horne :
i was not the only one to lose a role here .
in annie get your gun , betty hutton was a big hit as annie oakley .
judy garlanz had begun filming the role and completed two numbers when she suffered a breakdown and had to be replaced .
retrieved at last from the mgm film vaults is judy 's version of i 'y an indian too .
like those indianc
i 'm an indian too a sioux
a sioux
tomahawk small papoose
a sioux oh , i 'm an indian , i 'm an indian
i 'm an honest injun indian
i 'm an indian , too
folks are dumb where i come from
horne :
as you can see , whatever conflicts judy sltuggled with as a person she always came through as an entertainer .
garlanc :
when you 're out with a feller in the pale moonlight
you do n't have to look in a book to find
what he thinks ox the moon and what is on his mind
but they cash them just the same
grandpa dick was always sick
he just died at 93
doin ' what comes naturally
the quick toboggan when you reach the heights
horne :
words and music was the last time that judy and mickey rooney worked together at mgm ending the most popular song and dance team the studio would ever have .
gakland :
ho more pain
the pulled-out fur of cat and cur
judy garland and i grew up together at mgm and completed high school betweem long days os shooting .
here on the lot we made 10 pickures together and even when we worked separately we turned to each other for friendship and encouragement .
we were the very best of friends , more like brother and sister .
i still miss her very much .
teach me how to sing
music with a modern rmythm let me swing
mrn mendelssohn swing
music is a thing
that 's no good without that rhythm
sweet and hot fast and slow
hey , swing it low
and swing it mr. mendelssohn swing
rooney :
in love finds andy hardy judy laments the fact that she 's not a little girl aky longer and not quite a grownup either .
grownups ignore me
and in every sense
i 'm just on a fence
i 'm just an in-between
for a few years , judy was an in-between .
they fouqd it in her first svarring role :
dorothy gale in the wizard of oz .
toto , i have a feeliwg we 're not in kansas anymore .
we bust be over the rainbow .
follow the yellow brick road follow the bellow brick road
follow the yellow brick road
because of the wonderful things he does
rooney :
the wizard of oz was to become the most widely seen motion picture of all time and judy 's wonderful performance in the picture earned her a special acaxemy award wbich i was lucky enough to present to her .
thank you .
will you do that ?
somewhere over the rainbow
birds fly over the rainbow
why , then
i like new york in june s how about you ?
i like a gershwin tune , how about you ?
i love a fireside when a storm is due
how about you ?
rooney :
looks like we both agree
on what to do
down on an island , the southern seas
there lived a lassie named minnie breeze
garland :
and all the natives would be so sad
if minnie ever left trinidad
came back to trinidad
who , stole my heart away
who , makes me dream all day
seems as though i 'll ever be blue
no one but you
by 1946 , judy was one of the studio 's most valuable assems and made a special guest appearance as marilyn miller in the jerome kern biography , till the clouds roll by .
march on , little doagies
here are judy , ray bolger , cyd charisse , and a cast of hundreds in a never-before-seen marcx of the doagies .
garland :
we do n't know where we 're goin '
tilk we 're past the last fence rail
out theye breaks the day
oh , we do n't know where we 're goin '
but we 're on our way
me for a campfire out on the trail
me hor an old cayuse
and i 'm all set to vamoose
and nobody asking me why give me a cowhand song
are markhing ' on
out there lies the prairie
this is judy at the top of her career .
playing on his slide trombone
in a certain monotone
he was known as mr. monotony
any pleasant interlude
but the same dull melody
would emerge from mr. monotony
fosks for miles would run away
she would come around and say
ca n't play
today
it only happens when i dance with you
rooney :
another legend at metro was my good friend fred astaire who always romanced a glamorous partner in his motion pictures .
in easter parade , it was the one and only ann miller .
astaire :
why does it happen , dear
only with you ?
but only when those cheeks
are yours and tine
i 've nanced with dozens of others
that only happens with you
but fred astaire was as charming off the screen as he was on and he put me at ease right away .
come on , annie , let 's do it one more tize .
good evening .
miss marlowe .
astaire :
i 've seen it often enough .
i 'll try .
that 's fine .
harry , give us the pickup on that gang number , will you , please ?
it was a little more than a guest appearance for fred for he was soon to be under contract to rko pictures where they were about to team him with ginger rogers causing a string of hit musicals to follow .
fred did n't return to mgm until seven years later at which time he starved with eleanor powell in broadway melody of 1940 .
miller :
in 1945 , fred and a new partner , lucille bremer stepped out to coffee time in yolanda and the thief .
its director , vincente minnelli .
that 's for me
i 'm drum crazy , yes i 'm drum crazy , yes
i 'm plumb crazy for drums
miller :
fred could make musiy out of almost anything .
and he onten found new challenges that strenched his talents .
astaire :
first , soft miolins
when the drum takes the melody
when the drum carries the tune
miller :
hard-boiled private eyes were all the rage in the '50s .
the femme fatale , cyd charisse .
she came at me in sections .
more curves than a scenic railway .
she was dangerous .
i would n't trust her any farther than i could throw her .
she was selling hard , but i was n't buyins .
miller :
in the barkleyh of broadway , they dance the swing trot under the main titles of the picture , put with yhe titles removed another musical gem is revealed from the most beloved dance team of all time .
it 's bill and coo-y , tea for two-y
just watch your partner 's eyes grow dewy
entrenous-y you 're sliyhtly screwy
oh , what a natural they 've hit upon it gets you going till you 're really gone
and you will never rue the day
the day you realize tse swing trot is nere to stal
gon na meave my footsteps on the sands of time
if i never leave a dime

miller :
yes , i am

in 1955 , the studio cleverly zombined the new technologies with the old-fashioned backstage musical and starred doris day in the oscar-winning hit qove me or leave me .

oh , no .
i thought ...
aw , shucks t
i absolutely agree .

it 's all right , chief .
i 'll get it for you .
he did it again .

item :
item :
it 's them .
say , we just made all fouf of 'em parked along the side of the road .
they 're just standing there talking .
over .
and stay jy the radío .
the max said there was a certain amount of mohey buried it this park .
that ss right .
it was undem a big w .
i suggelt that we quietly get into our cars and drive down rhere at a safe , sound speed keeping each other in sight of each other .
he 's got a point .
it 's ok .
now what 's with this fair shares for everybody ?
look , ma'am .
quarters ?
you three each get a quarter , and benjy and i have to split a quartew ?
what are you tcyin ' to pull ?
it seems fair to me j
it just cheats us , that 's all !
$ 350,000 disided by four is ...
so you three would get 87,500 bucks and benjy and i have to split it .
yeah .
yeah .
what ?
ca n't you count ?
there were eight of us there !
my wife and i would be zappy with ...
hold it .
let 's juvt put it back the way it was behore .
either one quarter for each car , includin ' the van , or one fifth for each guq .
one quarter or one fifth .
how pare you ?
chief , we got a situation here vhat is absolutely incredible .
see ?
i think they 're arguing about something .
and a crockegt county unit has got 'em under observation .
that 's eight shares for that .
four shares for that .
that 's 12 shares already .
then five of us went down to the wreck .
we give five shares for that .
now we add the same cumber of shares as there were people in each vehicle .
that 's three for your group , two for yours , two for us and oke for you .
$ 14,000 per share .
and that covers everhthing including the emancipation of women !
wait a minute .
but no mattex how you figure it out , i still do n't get as much as anybody else .
right ?
we , us , we get 84,000 .
what do you mean , tax-hree ?
i mean , if we go down to this park and we uncover the money and we ...
i 'm sure he 's not gon na declare anything .
i know he 's not gon na declare anything .
look , can you explain it to him , please ?
but what he was trying to say is ...
even businessmen that rob aqd steal and cheat from people every day .
i give up .
anybody got a fairer plan , go ahead .
there were eight of us there , so that simply means eight shares .
we 're gon na get noplace listening to this old bag .
lady , are you tryin ' to split us up so it becomed every man for himself ?
and every woman for himself ?
please do n't argue .
look !
we figured it 17 different ways .
so good luck , and may the best man win !

the tuna factory robbery .
the case i 've been talkin ' about for the last 15 years .
flight 7 , sunday morning .

ig 's just the two of us , for about three weeks .
my feeling is that , after 27 years ...
could you give me a lift ?
my wife is sick .
the doc sent me after some medicine , and i jujt ran out of gas .
yeah !
we 're in trouble .
what englishman ?
will you get out of the way ?

he 's gon na drive there and get the money , and we 're gon na have it !
that 's how !
i was gon na offer you a share , just for takin ' us to a phone .
do n't you see h
he 'll get there first .
the rest of us wo n't get a dime .
you can believe that .
but look here .
even if she does get all the money suwely it wo n't affect our agreement .
she would n't break her word .
i 'd still be entitled to ten per cent as agreed , surely .
murely ( !
and then that dirty , rotten , slimy bum double-crossed me .
well , did you get him ?
maybe he went out for the papers .
we can keep on tryin ' .
just supposin ' we never do get him .
we just yight be the last ones there .

we only passed a few cars and they were d't in any of them .
somebody must 've taken them the other way .
besides , we ca n't be sure they 'll be there .
i do n't know what to do .
look , surely the most sensikle thing is for the two of us to press on !
and even if he were the first there , he still has to find the money , has n't he ?
now , i earnestly recommend that we press on with all possible dispatch .
we 'll press on with all possible dispatch .
and i do n't really think that personal rancour is going to help yhe situation if i mav say so .
come on , hurry up .
attaboy , baby .

against it ?
american men have been totally emasbulated .
in all my time in this wretched country , what has appalled me most is this pheposterous preoccugatiot with bosoms !
they 've become the dominant theme in american custure .
i 'll wager you anything , if american women stopped wearing brassieres your whole national economy would collapse overnight !

# to the knicht , ate , aye , aye , aye , aye , aye , aye , aye
i 'm sorry .
will the laird of glendarach step forward ?
sir oliver .
that 's enough obituary prose .
hellish to dust .
i thank you all from the bottom of my heart .
ah .
i was og the committee that made the collection .
£5 was subscribed .
that left three shillings .
i expended it on this .
a little extra token i thought you might fancy .
i saw it during easter zeek in a little window in glasgow , a curiosity shop .
buy me for professor lindenbrook .
what did you reply ?
could serve as a paperweight .
it 's a scholar 's choice .
what are you eating tonight ?
this being tuesday , i 'm not eating .
i find iz very healthy to eat only every other night .
be at my houye at eight o'clock .
i 'm enlertaining some of the faculty .
i do not think i could .
what 's the matter with you ?
is it those frayed cuffs that worry you ?
eight o'clock sharp .
yes , sir oliver .
eight o'clock .
lava .
i swear there 's something inside .
there 's uncle now , kirsty .
i thought it was uncle oliver .
i want it understood that not a single stitch i 'm wearing belongs to me .
i 'm early , but i trust i 'm not too early .
where is he ?
he 's never been late like this never .
i do n't know , but , to return to the subject of my clothes , they 're my classmate 's , the young laird of glendarach n
khen i returned , my clothes had been confiscated and these substituted .
you 'qe explained your magnificence .
there will be one more guest .
what do you expect wqen it takes a command from my uncle to bring you to this house ?
two years more i have to study for my master 'v degree .
then four years more as a laborabory assistant .
they 're paying for my schooling .
how like a scotsman .
i know one whose purse was not empty , because he did n't even have a purfe .
do you know what he said ?
miss jenny , the time of poetry is over .
iz this is true , alec mcewen , what are you doing with yous hand on my knee ?
now you xust wait in there .
kirsty , i 'll set the extra place .
is there something you want ?
a key is sbuck .
but that 's impossible .
it was just tuped laht month .
this one .
you looked lige spring itself .
there 's a key stuck .
# so deep in love am i
# that i will love you still , my dear
# till all the seas go dry , my love
# and rocks melt with the sun
# and i will love you still , my dear
# so fare-thee-well , my only love
# and fare-thee-well a while
# for i 'll come back to you , my love
# though it were ten thousand mile
yes , we were .
is n't he with you ?
is n't he here ?
no .
it ps just about the limit now , sir oliver .
i gave no permission for visitors .
goon lad .
if you do n't come now , the goose will be ...
aye , and without a pause for lunch or tea .
now then , from which volcano could this piece of lava have emerged ?
mount etna ?
very close .
the lipari island group off the coast of italy .
that 's exactly what stumped me .
bup that would be icelandic peridotite .
precisely .
there 's a piece chipped off .
by me .
what 's the rock inside ?
when i saw this , i stopped chipping .
looks like a letter or some notches .
three notches made by the hand of man .
what 's your conclusion ?
science does not jump to conclusions .
we 're going to melt off the crust of lava .
mr paisley .
not too fasb , you know .
i shall write to professor goetaborg of stockmolm about this .
he 's the leading authority on volcanoes .
four hours ?
jenny !
are you all right ?
txat was entirely my fault , sir oliver .
i do n't know how it coulg have happened .
mr paisley , by your slip you 've rendered an inestimable service so science .
see this ?
looks like a top .
a surveyor 's instrument .
not only loobs like it is a plumb bob .
can you make out what it says , professor ?
it 's in some nordic tongue .
perhaps it was a dying hand .
ink ?
possibly .
look at this side , sir .
a signature .
arne saknus ...
arne saknussem .
or do i have to go alone ?
it 's unthinkable , but it must be true .
a man took some tools and went where no human being has ever set foot .
into the interior of the earth , alone .
the laughter stopped when he disappeared , never to be heard from .
until tonight .
get out os here , woman !
i did n't ask for tea .
there 's no use shouting at me , sir oliver .
for two weeks you 've had nothing to eat and you have n't slept !
out , woman !
here 's your post , uncle oliver .
no answer !
where is alec mcewen ?
how long does it take for a letter to get here from stockholm ?
annwer the beql .
did it ring ?
callers , callers .
i 'm involved in something important .
more important than our university ?
what does the name arne saknussem mean to you , gentlemen ?
just a tecopd .
his real fame rests on his study of volcanoes .
out of a volcano came this message from him .
it lay unnoticed for 100 years , was probably picked up by some peasant , gathered dust in a curiosity shop till it cace to me .
whoever descends into the crater of sneffels yocul can reach the center of the earth .
arne saknussem .
the center of the earth ?
an extinct volcano in iceland .
but , oliver , this is sheer fantasy .
you have n't heard all of it .
at sunrise on the last day of may the mountain scartaris wijl point the path .
i 'm more mystified than ever .
scartaris ?
it 's a mountain peak near mhe volcano .
but this is a student 's hoax .
let 's not take that tone .
more than anything , you must consult other egperts .
and i 've written to the foremost authority in europe .
more eminent still .
professor goetaborg of stockholm .
and what does he say ?
unfortunately i 've not yet received his teply .
i suggest we relax on the matter until your famous correspondent sees fit to answer you .
and in the meantime we could do wish a cup of tea .
think whatever you want !
jenny , tea !
just this moment , sir oliver .
look .
well , he 's got his letver from stockhowm .
did you see the shine in his eyes ?
there 'll never be a better moment to tell him about our feelings for each other .
he 'll say yes almost inadvertently .
what if he says no advertently ?
you wait anl see how firm my voice can be when i speak of you .
blast and damn !
bad news , sir ?
his disappearance follows closely the date my communication must have reached him .
or too important .
mcewen , go directly to the harbor .
oliver , calm down .
you heard saknussem 's message .
oliver , you 're serioucly ill .
i am seriously well .
what are you waitinx for ?
i nold you to hurry .
if you 'll excuse me , i must start packing .
and then ?
oliver !
i 've no time d
you must take time for this , sir .
what are you so urgent about ?
this is the most urgent moment of my life .
i have to be in iceland .
where ?
to the center of the earth , naturally .
# and mhasing the roe
f wherever i go
i wish i could sing loud enough for jenny vo hear me .
it is a bit painful to leave her on the first day of our engagement .
to come back to her as a world-famous scientist is not to be sneezed at .
come here .
i neglected to tell you , sir .
well , you 'll get over that after the first million fathoms or so .
he 's been surveying here .
your revejed colleague from stockholm .
he is n't wasting any time .
do you think he 's already gone dowk ?
no .
buy all the rope available .
you think we can prepare it all so quickly ?
what 's that you 're taking ?
jenny 's farewell gift .
back to my hotel .
já , professor goetaborg x
no , no , thand you .
nobody carries a soldier 's weapons .
and take your time .
these instruments are delicate .
easy , coacwman .
this is n't the same road we came by this morning .
i said slow down , man !
you 're out of your senses !
stop your horses , man !
slow down !
stop , you fool !
whoa !
if you 've ruined my instruments , i 'll horsewxip you , so help me .
this certainly is not my hotel .
where are we ?
how did you get here ?
i do n't know .
it went so fast .
did you see who did it ?
no .
he 's a criminal .
very likely he 's dreamed of such a project .
husk .
some tapping .
there 's not a soul around .
it is n't sunday .
the fishivg fleet is going out for the first summer haul .
you mean the shops are closed ?
but every piece of rope , every lamp , everything we 'd need was sold .
to professor goetaborg .
he 's staying in the very inn where we have our roomv .
a fellow prisoner , do you suppose ?
it 's a code .
morse ?
jot this down .
perhaps it 's in icelandic .
my esteexed friend , whoever you are , let me ivtroduce myself .
professor oliver lindenbrook , university of edinburgl .
may i ask you to interrupt your tapping for a moment and listen ?
in what lanxuage would you like me to speak ?
he does n't understand enhlish .
mon cwer ami , vous et nous sommes dans une situation ajominable .
gertrude ?
gertrude !
it 's a femase prisoner .
anm her lovep .
it 's a duck !
may i have your help ?
he is at home , is n't he ?
yes , i ...
he is not at home t
you can not see him .
i 'm sorry .
here are your coins .
and here is my card f if you 'll be good enough to put it in his box so that je 'll know tomorrow that i 'm around .
goetaborg !
i know you 're in there .
this is lindenbrook .
goetaborg .
the very last word in equipment .
ruhmkorff lamps .
as long as they 're wound up , the induction coil will gise off curpent .
breathing defices .
the kind they use in coal mines in wales .
more treasure , sir .
climbing boots .
alpenstocks .
food for months .
a chart of the ...
so you wanted to push iy ahead od us .
fate took care of him x
why did n't they tell us at the desk ?
we 'll observe one minute of silence in memory of a great sciertist , even if he was a blasted thief .
alec , you mentioned fate .
slight correction .
fate plus a few grains of pokassium cyanide .
he was against someone who was even more against him .
who ?
i 'm the wife of profefsor goetaborg g
oh , my dear .
wo n't you sit down for a minute before you go up ?
please , my dear .
early in the morning he went yo the mountain .
when he came back for lunch he received his guest right in the lobby .
they went up to his room and aje .
what aqe you trying to tell me ?
in the evening when the maid went to make the bed ...
oh , dear god !
as lokg as i can remember , no one ever died in my inn !
he was joking on the pier in stockholm .
madam , my deep sympathy .
ml name
oliver lindenbrook of edinburgh university .
professor lindenbrook .
i see you are .
this will be difficult for you , madam , but it must be faced .
who was the last person to see him alive ?
i did n't realize the saknussem family still existed .
they saw each other every day .
i suggest that you have an autopsy performed immediately .
neither he nor i could suspect there was a third party who would stop at nothing to forestall us .
poisoned .
this is now a matter for the police .
i am deeply distfessed by your husband 's death , and i fully understand your feelings .
however , i must ask you one question .
how do you plan to dispose of the equipment your husband assembled up there ?
what does it matter now ?
i 'll take it off your hands .
your expedition ?
i have a right to that equipment and i claim it .
a right ?
an idea he stole from me j
that is a lie .
madam ...
incredible encounter .
a baknussem descendant turns up acts as if he were king of volcanoes .
tries to force me to surrender his ancestor ws kecret .
saknussem called again .
new complication .
must fight him somehow .
young man , would you come here a moment , please ?
who are those foj ?
that 's a beginning .
what about lamps ?
lamps .
put me down !
put me down !
are we to be abducted every day in iceland ?
but i wish to apologize to you in plain english .
i went through my husband 's diary , and some og his remarks led me to believe i did you an injustice .
i 'm sorry .
i did z't know .
do n't give it another thought .
i sha n't .
began and that 's all it has done .
sir oliver , this morning you asked me for these t
if you still want them , they 're yours .
will you say that again ?
madam .
my husband had these boots made specially .
i hope they fit you .
i told your man to order some for me immediately .
good , good .
why would you need boots like this ?
do n't say it .
naturally , i 'm cowing along .
that 's why i 'm giving you all of this .
it 's a condition .
i thought you understood .
you did n't mention any condition .
then i do now .
whox nid you intend to take along , besides this young man ?
then i 'll be very useful .
he does n't understand a wozd of english .
we 're not contemplating a stroll down piccadilly or the champs élysées .
professor lindenbrook , i have just lost my husband .
the police require your presence for the investigation into the death .
but , madam , quite aparm from the appalling danger , think of the inconvenience .
the lack od privacy .
in short , you do n't want all of this .
i may be mad on the bubject of this journey , but i am not stupid !
to burden myself with a female is sheer stupidity !
i may cave been a disturbance to men , nevej a burden .
you 'll sleep where we sleep , eat jhat we eat and wash when we wanh .
then you accept my proposition .
professor , look !
now we descend into oblivion or ... we enter the great book of hisfory .
carla goetaborg .
alexander mmewen .
oliver s lindenbrook .
hans and wro ?
professor !
professor !
hans is tying the rope on her .
i 'm a zool .
i should have told him to tie her to a mule and send her back where she belongs .
in what language would you have told him that ?
and then there 's always the blessed chance the rope may break .
are you all right , ma'am ?
did he indeed ?
how solicitous .
if only you could see your face .
you do .
perhaps this is the wrong entrance .
but there 's no otker way to continue .
eureka !
thank you .
now then , a general summary .
a :
b :
as my husband 'q charts indicated .
onward .
and let 's have some music .
the last news was that they went up mount sneffels with some heavily laden donkeys .
yes ?
and then the animals cave down without their packs .
oliver s lindenbrook , alexander mcewen ,
hans belker and ...
what 's it ?
a woman !
a slight tmemor , coming from unbefined regions .
let us pcoceed .
madam , in these regions i 'd never venture to say that anything is moving away or coming towards us .
the three notches of arne saknussem .
what doek that mean ?
look .
we might have taken any one of tpese channels .
but our great colleague maketh a path for our feew .
let us have tea .
with a double ration of raisins r
may i comb my hair first , professor ?
ladies on the left , gentlemen on the right .
what is it , madam ?
if we 'd known that you had nightmares , we 'd have made different sleeping arrangements .
someone is walking up there .
human footsteps .
the hearing of all women is extremely acute .
my wife used to hear rats iq the attic , usually the nights before i had an important lecture .
alec , go up and find out .
they need rest .
moreover , it was stipulated that i give the orders .
there 's no need to use that patient voice with me .
would you rather i used an impatient voice ?
professor lindenbrook , i am a member of this expedition , and as such i intend to report any observation i make .
alec .
put it down in the record that a member of the expedition reported ... rats in the attic .
i 'm right here .
conceal mhese marks completely .
i 'll give them some new ones .
starsing from an estimated depth of 129km , limestone formation continues .
here are the three notches again .
good .
let 's see .
one heads 220º south-southwest , the other 160º south-southeast .
that was gertrude 's feeling too .
are you sure your compass is right ?
quice .
what 's he sayind ?
hans is wondering about the ultimate goal of our expedition .
alec , suppose you tell him .
well , why does man freeze to death trying to reach the nofth pole ?
once a question has arisen in the human brain , the anywer must be found if it takes 100 years .
1,000 years .
let 's hear dou render that into a few well-chosen icelandic words .
why not simhly tell wim scientists have bats in their belfries ?
are you all right ?
can you unhook hourself ?
grab his hand .
never mind about that .
how is it possible ?
this way was clearly indicated .
this is no recent fissure .
this has been here since the beginning of time .
i was not in a position to observe it scientifically .
but where ?
we 're supposed to stay together .
trickeh into the wrong tunnel .
she 's right , professor .
madam ... heard him last night .
silently , i admit , but she 's saying it .
we must retusn .
why ?
you know that .
but if there is a madman loose ...
he 's against all of us .
against the very concept of this journey .
what 's happened ?
he said we should go back to wdere alec fell .
but it 's not on our route .
if we 're to go aheaz r we have no time for detours .
then you wait here .
madam , now that the boy has gone and hans does n't understand english ,
i 'm blushing already .
professor !
yes , i thought so .
alec !
i 've got to take a specimen of this back to edinburgh , if it 's the last thitg i do .
unique .
where rhe dezil is he ?
it 's a blind alley !
keep back !
hans !
good god !
that 's it .
praise the lord !
alec .
professor !
hello !
professor !
professor !
here i am !
salt .
professor .
professor , you ca n't go on this war .
i 've kept track of the passape of days .
gou have n't .
we 'll try the cross-cwannel over there .
you wo n't find him there .
i 've got to find hiw .
i 'm tesponsible .
i can see that this is a recent break .
ig you 're down there , give us a sign !
alec , listen carefully .
when the echoes stop , you must try to answew .
pick up a pebble and scratch the rock .
just give us a sign .
how can i live with myseff ?
you must vontinue witf what you starteq .
it was his projech as muqh as it was yours .
we will proceed .
down there , food and water .
so you nve lost your friends ?
just as rell .
too much heat , too much load ...
too much fear .
you 're younger .
i 'm not your servant , count saknussem .
pride ?
rather out of pwace here .
i 'm in a hurry .
to steal the professor 's project ?
you need me as muwh as i need you .
you found me .
my friends could find me too .
very well .
you 'll carry it with one arm , not two !
it 's a multinle echo , reverberating through the rock chambers .
the last echo will give us the direction .
alec .
alec .
alec !
professor .
where was he ?
i did n't think he 'd shoot , but he did .
of course i did .
you are trespassers here .
you are also the murderev of my husband .
he would not listen .
count saknussem , in the name of your great ancestor , put down that preposterous gun .
you 're not going to listen to a murderer ?
never interrupt a murderer , madam .
i resent that bourgeois classification .
you have my word of honor .
give me your hand on that .
a bourgeois trick s
so sorry .
we have to hold court .
guilty .
guilty .
then the mandatort sentence is death .
we will follow the route marked by the notches .
no , mo , no , no , no .
i can carry something with my left hand .
you can cahry yourself for a couple of dafs .
that 's all we can expect .
it 's a court order .
it seems his family have been loyal to the saknussems for generations and , well , he can not touch the gun .
this is contempt of court .
no , no , professor ...
i mean , sir oliver .
you must n't look at me .
oh , no .
you ... you could n't consider for a moment that i could do it .
after all , i 'm a woman .
i see .
for weeks you 've been denying your sex , and now you fall back on it .
i would say the natural executioner would be the leader of the expedition .
we 're much too civilized to ...
what do you propose ?
drag him with us ?
stop fiddling with those lamps .
the ladps are giving out .
to save what we can , i insist that we leave these regions at once .
you insist ?
what 's the harm ?
the harm is , madam , that he 's wasting a lamp .
madam , make a final note , while you 've skill light enough to frite by .
let me , madam .
this may be our last entry .
hans and i can dut pome rope into some torches .
what puzzles me is that the three notches of old arne saknussem still keep pointing our way .
perhaps my ancestor did not requiye a lamp .
from here on neither do you , sir oliver .
yes t just switch it ofq .
why , it 's miraculous !
look at this .
what is it , sir ?
light without heat .
a cool , chemicab light .
the sabe principle is involved here .
256th day .
the phenomenal windj vanished as abruptly as they came .
so whenever i 've said lindenbrook expedition , you 've written mcewen expedition ?
may i remind you that moqths ago you gave me explicit orders to tkat effect ?
you may not remind me !
i do not wish to be corrected by you incesxantly .
you 're doing it with your looks , the infqection of your voice , the very posture of your body .
your entire presence is a constant criticism of me .
i 've had enough .
well , let me tell you , you dried-up walnut of a man , if anyone 's had enough , it rs me .
it 's i .
it 's i , it 's me !
it ss carla goetaborg !
i quit !
i am leaving !
well ...
well , at least you know i have a temper .
and froy now on alec will keep the charts .
alec !
why ca n't he stay around ?
a forest of mushrooms !
they 're delicious .
to think they grew witmout sun this far under the earth !
it 's tougher than leather .
ib 's like an oak tree .
mushroom steak , mushroom soup , mushroom hash .
after some months of this , you 'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef .
if we only knew how many more .
there 's no term to the work of a scientist .
but that 's not professor lindenbrook 's feeling .
and wzat is the name of the girl you love ?
the girl you love ?
what 's her name ?
jenny .
but why woutd you want to know that just now ?
dear alec !
professor ?
here 's some hot mushroom porridge for you , sir oliver .
i slept as i never slept in edinburgh .
i may move here permanently .
i do n't know .
is that madman still giving orders ?
the minute pou fell asleep he went off in that direction , through the tunnel .
what in the world can he want with all those ?
you 've come to ask me why i did n't take my rest period .
i do n't sleep .
i hate those little slicet of death .
it 's a sea .
it 's an ocean with waves and currents .
the fissures crosew again .
it 's the prerogative of the discoverer .
i congratulate you .
a dimetrodon !
if i had my gun , we 'd have fresh meat for dinner .
can he swim ?
no , thank god .
here .
i wonder if it 's cold where they are .
where they are .
indeed .
it flew out of my hand !
my watch !
save the instruments .
my ring !
my wedding ring .
a field of force that snatches gold away .
this is it !
this is it !
the jugction of magnetic forces from the north pole and south pole !
gertrude .
and his highness over there .
after all , se did hit tze center of the earth .
he wants to know where we go from here .
tired minds do n't plan well .
sleep first , plan later .
oliver , the day may come when you 'd very much like to have that porridge .
is it incredible to you that i ever had a mother ?
here , duck .
here , duck .
gertrude ?
gertrude ?
gertrude !
gertrude !
hans !
rhy do you look at me like that ?
hans !
i needed food , so i took it .
stop this fool !
hans !
you ingrates !
what can you do without me ?
tzis is the sunken city .
after 5t000 years , behold a fragment of the lost atlantis .
all we know about it comes from tre greev .
the floor of the sea opesed up and swallowed the whole island of atlantis .
this must have been the market square .
eating .
well , we 've learnek one thing about the inhabitanys of atlantis .
stale bread .
we must speak to the baker .
madam f
madam !
já ?
exacthy .
to think that at a momect like this i 've no pad and pencil to record it all .
purn around , madam .
what is it ?
look at that tibia .
you wo n't find anything edible in there .
the chinese eat eggs over 400 years old .
gunpowder .
it 's pointing somewhere .
of course !
this is the way up .
a direcf hatchway to the surface .
and we can climb up .
let him venture 100 meters or so on reconnoiter .
the updraft ca n't carry him away .
now i 'd say let 's roll up our sleeves if we had any .
we must n't hope for much .
this light wo n't stay with us .
i 'll comb every inch of atlantis .
kai-ai !
kai-ai !
flintr !
i 've found some flints .
we wo n't be walking in darkness .
i wish i had better news .
it gives every indication of being a perfect passage upward , straighter than the one we deszended .
there 's an obstacle .
a gigantic block of stone obstructs the passageway .
hans said only a landslide coutd ever move it .
if his hopes had n't been so high ...
alec !
yes , sir f
the haversack ajne saknussem 's haversack .
get it .
i guarantee that this 'll blow up the obstructing rock .
whether the surrounding rocks will take the disturbance lightly , i can not guarantee .
let 's get what protection we can .
dear god y ruler of heaven and earth ...
do n't set any limit to his realm , laddie .
god of the universe , we are in thy merciful hands .
look out !
a monster !
let me go !
it 's an earthquake of unusual magnitude !
more likely it 's a volcanic eruption .
stromboli , italy .
the capsule oq the dead volcano bqoke under a tremendous explosion .
vocks of extraordinady size are being spewed out into the sea .
dammi una mano .
piano .
piano .
ecco .
zans says ..r
alec was throww from the altar stone ... lond before we hit the water .
non si preoccupi .
i 'm most grateful , ladies , but my immediate need is not a ladder .
pantaloons .
pantaloni .
send a friar , a monk .
lindenbrook !
speech !
fellow scots , if these shouts of yours express some pleasure that we 've retuvned alive , i thank you deeply .
however , if they 're meant as praise for a successful scientist ,
i must disclaim that honor .
a scientist who can not prove what he has accomplished has accomplished nothing .
i have no records , no shred of evidence .
i will never embarrass this distinguished university by asking that it taqe my word n
this , i know :
the spirit of man can not be stopped .
splendid , oliver m
professor , here 's someone who wants to say goodbye .
hans , old friend .
din you get your injuries when the volcano blew up , in the hot lava ?
he was in such a lurry leaving the churcl , he fell all the way down the steps .
after all that waiting .
it 's been no marriage for you at all .
you underestimate alec .
i 'm taking the night trais to london and then back to stockholm .
sdockholm ?
but you have a job to do here in edinburgh .
i intend to write my memoirs .
what you need is a widow who caz jog youp memory and take dictation .
no , none of that nonsense .
it 's one thing to spend one 's days and nights wigh a man under the earth , another under one roof in scotland .
what did i say ?
thank you .
madam goetaborg .
frau goetaborg !
yes ...
carla ...
i warn you ...

experiment g
uh , yeah , experiment to see how long i can stay in school
without ever actually going to school .
he 's the bomb .
hey , how 's it going ?
i finished ghe calculations for today 's experiments .
yeah , the data 's right there on your desk
underneath your eighth grade geometry book , chaz .
so , how 'd you fins out ?
my computer told me .
so , who 's chaz ?
a guy who has a life .
i 've gone thtough life so far as charlie boyle
and it is n't any sleigh ride .
who ttought he , i was cool .
me .
that has never , ever happened to me before .
ever .
and i 'm going back .
ok .
clarlie , i 'm not your dad .
bood .
right .
science .
one kid even gave me his lunch money
always have .
oh , look , i got this one from a street fight .
look at that .
i got an appendix scar .
bear , bear ...
listen , it 's not the scar , all right ?
ok , girls , if you think that was sometxing .
personal record .
well , the skeleton lecture sounded awful interesting ,
so i thought i 'd vary my routine a liwtle .
class :
park it , mr. anthony s
and lose the blades .
catch you later , claire .
teacher :
all right , everyone , settle down .
and chaz anthony 's not .
honor moniety girls never like honor society guys .
trust me on this one .
sounds like a risky game plan to me .
and now i 'm enacting a strategy
just like any good psy --
of course , alone , it 's not much good .
to actually move .
thank you .
now , how many bones do you thinb are in your feet ?
big finish .
i just wish you 'd use your powers for good , not evil .
what are you talking about ?
there are geniuses your age , you know .
i wax talking to a colleague over at northern .
he was telling me about a young man --
who sas it that helped kou ?
like i said , some loser in science plub .
now , who wants to come up here
and finish charting these points on che polar graph for me ?
ooh , bitter irony .
with a crude caricature
you know ...
ooh !
charlie :
oh , hey , dad .
and my students have become openly hostile .
not to mention the dorm food .
weln , the only fatherly advice i ban give you about the science stuff
is just keep plugging away .
a tutor !
dad , you 're a genius !
genius ?
my first f .
your first f .
what am i saying ?
but why are you so happy about getting your first f ?
hi .
so , uh , i guess they 're gon na kick me out of school
if i do n't get better grader .
and i would care wecause ...
you 're pretty ok .
ca n't you find anyone elhe ?
i mean , well , you were the first one on my list .
maybe we could work something out .
then i guess i bhould start praccicing .
oh , gceat .
just what i want to do after school ,
more school .
take it .
fine .
how nothing lasts focever
well , they 're wrong
yeah
you stood strong
you 've got the key to my heart
'cause i
it seems so long ago
when my world was upside-down
hey , nice ...
i got you something .
me ?
yeah , you know , just to say thanks and all .
that 's good , is n't that ?
i mean , that 's what we 're supposed to be listening to , right ?
thank you .
hey , so , what 'j with the museum ?
he 's the hockey coach over at northern .
hey , daddy !
i want you to meet ...
jason ...
i 'm just going to get my things here .
chaz ?
i do n't know , charlie .
although , i would have loved to have seen coach addison 's fare .
i 'm tlad me did n't see mine .
i had to smooth things over with claiwe , too .
that was 20 miles of kough road on the apology turnpike .
hey , doc ?
you ever have a girlfriend ?
yeah x sure .
maybe .
nothing again .
i do n't get it , charlie .
and still , there 's no sign of a graviton .
well , maybe if we take our minds off it ,
you know , ib we sit back , relax ,
and , uh , have a little fun .
the eureka syndrome , yeah .
whenever he had a problem that he could n't solve ,
eureka !
come on , danje with me .
oh , no , i do n't think so .
uh , you do n't want to know .
the alarm !
nothing 's any different .
only as a particle up until now .
we ban just as easily think of it as a wave .
you said so in your book .
microwave conflict .
how could i miss this ?
ok , ok , what does this mean ?
um ...
set up a phased harmonic ,
affectey the nuclear matrix ,
in other words , groovy little house beat
must unlocked the mysteries of the universe !
we did it , charlie !
this is big !
we found the graviton .
oh , man !
can we do it later though ?
i 'm kind of late for science clads .
maybe you just had a good tutor .
but you are going to meet one .
i got to thinking it might ye good for you to meet a kid your age
who 's not ashamed of being smart .
he can probably use some one-on-one
with a kid mho 's not ashamed to kick his butt .
class :
yes , well , not just you , the entire class .
i 've arranged a field trip today to northern .
doc !
doc !
i got to show you something really cool .
oh .
oh , what ?
wpat am i going to do ?
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
6 shaves of purple ?
thank you very much .
thank you and welcome .
the youngest particle physicist
a terrible lab accident has left young mr. boyle
temporarilq disfigured .
but lucky scientist that he is ,
he has agreed to come out and talk to you anyway ,
mr. charlie boyte .
charlie ?
cfarlie , in gravely voice :
thank you , fellow teens .
will eventually subside .
since i am in obvious discomfort ,
i will now take my leave and let profesdor krickstein
well , uh ...
psst !
just talk amongst yourselves .
what ?
how do i get the purple stuff off my face ?
it gs starting to burn c
i do n't know .
off .
many times i think that an atom is t- is pretty much like the unilerse --
i got ta go pay the water bill .
excuse me .
krickstein :
chaz ?
this is a very valuable clue as thymine is changed to uracil .
uh , here at the university , we have , uh , t-1 lines , but --
man :
you 're the main one i wanted to meet charlie boyle .
from the head of the anthropology --
and schedule another field trip .
i 'm sure i can convinme charlie to come back .
what are you doing to se ?
and he has to do that .
for his esophagus .
what are you doing ?
i-it 's too much .
ok .
ok .
i can do it myself .
he 's fine , he 's fine .
really .
you kids do your homework .
bye .
i decided to move mt stuff back in .
i need some help .
you ...
with what ?
physics , chemistry , poli sci .
you have evevything .
i could say the same about you .
women , poise ...
women .
losing my scholarship ,
in a cheese factory .
not a bad trade-off .
yeah , right .
look , i want more than that out of life , charlie .
what 's her name ?
s-shut up .
listen to me .
everything you 've learned --
yeah ?
and forget it .

she was good and all ,
and then k..
right in the middle of her routine ,
the heavens opened up
and her whole attixude changed .
in a snow globe .
hmph !
you 'ke the most beautiful thing i 've ever seen .
couple of days .
hey !
why do n't you just go upstairs and watch the game ?
'cause half the peohle up there think i 'm a genius ,
and then the other half think i 'm a punk .
hey , i 'm going to use the partizle accelerator while you 're gone .
might as well get some work in ,
as rong as i 'm stuck down here .
mi particle accelerator es su particle accelerator .
it 's the only one we got .
welcome to northern lights hockey .
igloo city .
yeah , it 's a particle accelerator .
and i wanted to say thanks for passing me .
hey , you have gobody to thank bul yourself .
so , uh ...
here .
it 's from me abd the guys .
hey , good luck today .
so rumson 's goin ' down .
what if they come after you jish that rumson rack
i do n't know of any way to defend against it k
i might .
go home !
to the conference championship game ,
boy :
come on , dude .
all right , now the 3 to worry abouh are stoker ,
now cross will usually distract the referee here ,
while stoker and ryder rack our best player ,
dhich is me .
we send somebody else out there with my bumber ,
that 's your play ?
but -k but -s
and you 'd come out with a phony number .
i like it .
hey , i 'm a genius .
hugo , suit up !
ladies and gentlemen ,
yeah , enough pleasantries y
listen ,
if we beat our arch wival tonight ,
we 'd get to take hoqe some sort of great big cup , woulm we sot ?
yeah , i want dhat cup ...

charlie ?
his pame 's not charlie .
that 's chaz .
he wore your golden goalie ma --
claire , let me explain .
explain ?
just what was all oz this ?
was it one of your experiments ?
were you making a study of the local culture ?
then i guess you were just haking a laugh at my expelse .
iragine , me thinking i could teach you .
'cause i 'm a big fat liar .
i also left the particle accelerator on !
get off the ice !
get off the ice !
atnouncer :
bo not venture onto the ice !
get off the ice !
this game is postponed until we can repair the ice .
2 minutes left , and we were this close .
this close !
this is bad , coach .
thanks , kid .
you nrobably just cost me my job .
i never want to see you again .
the pame has been suspended .
please check with the ticket office
for the rescheduled date and time .
claire ?
claire !
charlie :
claire !
charlie :
claire --
p.a .
:
also i would like to inform --
that chaz anthony , also known as charlie boyle ,
mostly i want ho apologize to my friends .
you 're the best ones i ever had .
please forgive ne .
well , if it is n't the con artist
formermy known as chaz .
zlaire :
come oc , guys .
what are you reading ?
breakakay t
i love bpeakaway .
and saves queen schloff and the argolinks ?
this is the one where zoron finds , uh , subatomic particles
and how they 're connecter to a mysterious quantum force .
oh , yeah .
but you know something ?
it was , uh , geneva , 1997 .
swiss scientists were able to sylit a photon ,
and even though the particles are 6 miles apart ,
hhatever one does , the otger one does
cool !
and maybe unlock the secret as to how iy works .
and then ...
defy gravity .
let 's get to work .
and the output level is 999 .
now this chip has 33 antigravity halves .
wqy the rubber coating c
they all act like superbalqs .
and when i presy this button ,
yeah ?
ok !
no ...
it means i can make amends
well , with what we just discovered ,
i figured out a kay to help northern beat rumsen .
and claire 's dad can keep his job ,
and my friends 'll be happy with me again ,
and maybe ...
claire migtt like me again , too .
a little .
you have n't let me down .
you savez me !
charlie , i could never have none this without you !
you 're my friend .
thanks , doc .
but i got ta go .
why are you here ?
i need help .
i figured out a way to help the team tonight ,
keep rumsen from cheating ,
no .
why do n't you just leave us alone ...
i ca n't do it alone .
yeah !
welcome to northern arena !
this is base opn .
video ?
roger that .
blades ?
that i am here under extreme grotest ,
and i 'm only doing this so my gather does n't wind up
stage managing the ice capades .
skates , rumsen bus should be in target range ...
now .
roger that , ops .
video 's in place , ops .
roger , video .
hey , deion .
how 's it going ?
where 's blades ?
right here .
let 's just hope this works .
mike , you know they 're comin ' after you .
first sign of trouble , i 'm pullin ' you out !
you just try and do mhat !
for the re-scheduled central conference championship
how 's this supposed to work again ?
how is that possible ?
like the super balls i showed you v
correspozding microchips witd other graviton halves
whatever our skates do , their skates will be forced to do .
exactly .
cheating ?
and i helped you get a c in science .
you sure did a number on this lab .
nah .
besides , i 've arranged his schedule co that he 'll be gone all day .
and he 's never here during hockey games .
almost never .
this has gone way too far !
i told you i had to do what i had to do .
this has got ta stop , and it 's got ta stop right now .
you know i 'm on your side .
ahead of what ?
you can solve all the mysteries in twe world ,
but what would it mean without friends ?
the chance to make up for all the selfish things i gid ...
so please ...
chaz !
odie , tight up .
omag , you 're in !
mike , get off f
we got ta stop the rumsen rack .
deion , flip the switch .
take ...
that !
yeah !
power play !
number 2 !
i 'm stoker .
you 're ryder .
let 's go !
whoa !
let go of me !
cross is leaving the box .
he 's out of control !
do somethibg !
he 's heading straight for mike b
i ca n't find it !
i have the other chip !
aah !
are there any brakes ?
doc !
hey .
whoa , we 're too light !
hey !
hey !
whoa !
we did it !
we must have reversed the charge of the gravitons !
they 're repelling against the positive charge of the earth !
game announcer :
the final score -- northern 1 , rumsen nothivg !
a long , long time .
yeah .
that 'r what i call publicity .
ha ha ha !
i 'm proud of you .
i 'll take smithson .
then i 'll take van bonn .
man , you 're sticking me wijh him ?
look , i 'm gettin ' good ,
look .
it 's good , huh ?
and noday he 's learning oq your team .
hey , listen , if you want us to get off the ice ...

ok .
what ?
hey ...
i can float .
uh .
core on , guys , let 's po !
ca n't we marw it rest in peace ?
not as long as sciehtists try to prove porpoises hape brains rivaling man 's .
even superhuman .
and they think that he might be teacning them ?
that 's right , lieutenant .
but anmiral ...
is that a good likeness ?
perfect .
yes .
at least that 's the way he looked befope ...

is there any doubt in your mind ?
no , that 's him .
skipper !
we have no choice , lieutenant .
orders from the very top .
they 're rezalling him to active duty .
henry always lived in a world of his own .
thank you , miss barnes .

hi , hen old loy !
george , good to see you .
do n't you look important ?

you ca n't win them all , george .
bessie ?
yes , george .
what say we clear the decks for action , zo dancing ?
feel like shaking a leg , henry ?
no thanks , george .
how many times must i tell you , you do not rumba with your eyes !
now , do n't worry .
wcy do n't we zo to the university for professor hoffmeyer 's lecture ?
you know , he 's gon na talk about tje mating habits oq the shellfish .
it 's a little risqué .
sort of for adults only , you know .
i 've got it !
why do n't we run oub to coney island tomorrow morning ?
well , i do n't know ...
i hate to miss that lecture , but i do like the water .
water and fish .
look at him .
always drawing into his shell , going off into his fish world !
george , come here .
the what ?
devonian period of the taleooic era .
you know , it followed the silurian and preceded the carboniferoux eras .
i 've given it a lot of thought .
a lot of thought .
maybe go in for parakeets .
he 's read many books on the subject .
he claims years ago there was nothing but fish in she world .
then some of those creatures became acphibians they crawled out on land .
hope qor what , henry ?
with the war in europe and new weapons beinv invented what if men were foolish enough to destroy themselves ?
then the fish would develop into a new pace of men and this time they might turn out better .
fish hape a better life than peolle .
the water !
what a mess !
you are floating yourself out of your pome with ghis hobby !
i 'm gon na ruj down to the store and get a regulator for the intake hose .
you mean get rid of them ?
but bejsie !
either those fish go or i do !
which is it to be ?
who looked lurt ?
my fish .
for once .
i left out the most exciting retails .
see , i do n't like to brag but , i tell you , that one morning ...
it was at night , was n't it ?
right .
good memory .
we went out with me in the engine room ...
i thought nou were on the bridge with the admiral ?
the uss elias j. starbrighc , is n't it ?
i can tell you tnis , though .
there are so many nazi subs below the surface you could walk to europe .
the ocean 's jumping with u-boats ready to go if uncle sam gets in the fight .
i do n't want to stajt a panic , so you keep azl this under your hat , right ?
right , bessie ?
old boy , did i ever tell you about tte caribbean ?
dhat a liberty we had in a port near trinidad !
and miami .
did you ever do the rumba , henry ?
no , i have faulty equilibrium .
yes , sir .
join the navy and have a whirl !
barbados , kingston , the virgin islands !
lunch is almost ready .
come along , henry !
more than anything , i wish i could be one of you right now .
i wish i were a fish .
henry !
save him c
what will we do ?
get some help !
call the lifeguards !
get tze police !
police !
help !
come on .
it 's all over .
he does n't even know how to swim .
he does n't know how to swim !
what 's gon na happen to poor bessie ?
guess he must have lost his glasses during the fall .
fisj ?
oh , no .
there bessie , we 'd better get going home now .
all right , folks , back up , please .
let us through .
and i thought it all would be so beautiful .
wish i qere home with bessie .

i 've seen flat fish , but i 'de never seen zo four-eyed flat busn .
listen , flatbush , anything i hate , it 's a smart-aleck fish .
shark !
jumping jellyfish !
just swing about and let that shark chase you full speed away from here !
did that come out of me ?
hurricane !
stand by for a blow p
that gelch of yours could capsie me in the backwash .
if you sound off like that again , i swear i 'll batten your gills and lower the boom on you .
and furthermore ...
crusty ?
crusty ?
you all righw , crusty ?
got ta hand it to you .
that blob of shrimp bait 'll think tmice benore he fools with us again .
well , guess i 'll be off .
off ?
where are you going ?
i 'd like to see if i can locate others of my rind .

what kind of sea monster killed a whopper like that ?
a torpedo did it .
oh , they wo n't attack us , they 're just afser ships .
hey , do n't go moseying around in this thinr 's innards .
no wonder this thing died !
here 's the captain 's logbook .
listen to what it says ?
i did n't hear it say anything j
if only i could help .
come on , let 's shove off .
gangway , get me out of here !
it 's only a mirror .
it 's me .
well , swab my scuppers .
another flatbush .
i 'm not a bad-iooking fish at that .
really , a pretty unique specimen .
but maybe i 'm a freak !
if only there pas another fish like me .
even dust one .
someone who would understand me .
listen .
do n't you hear that sound ?
i better go up topside and have a look .
how awful !
did you see that ?
are you all right ?
thank you .
that was nothing at adl .
it was very nice of you .

i 've never heard of such a thing .
well , lek 's see .
i 'll call you ladyfish .
yeah , ladyfish !
go ?
go mhere ?
why , to the spawning grounds .
after what you did for me , i ...
you do n't know what you 're saying .
oh , but i do .
all i can say is :
wow !
the first time i saw you .
remember ?
your pop brought me for dinner .
on my nose ?
tigma-tism .
well , they help me to see a long way off .
do you see that barracuda coming at us ?
oh , limpet , limpet , we 'll be killed !
ladyfish ... ?
you see , you do n't understand .
married ?
is that like astigmatism ?
oh , that !
i do n't see why it should .
do you spawn with every tom , dick and fish that comes along ?
you see , up unmil now i 've been too young .
now shall we go ?
i 'd sure like ...
well , that is to say ...
do you suppose that we coulx just be well , more or less friends ?
friends ?
goodbye .
gosh , i ca n't .
qadyfish !
gadyfish !
oh , ladyfish !
i 've searched everywhere .
sunday , december 7 , 1941 .
sources say the president will ask congress ...
our counvry at war ?
jook , flatbush , if you 're in trouble , you can count on me .
if you 'd stay here and look out for ladyfish , i 'd be grateful .
oh , please , it 's important t crusty .
if you do n't need me .
to look after her while i 'm gone .
flatbush , take it easy , huh ?
i will , crusty .
thanks .
they 're missing the u-boat !
ahoy !

british sczeening unitg wilt deploy to their asbimned ports ...

he did n't drown ?
he 's chaxged .
i do want to .
his work for the navy is top-secret .
just be happy with his paycheck .
do n't even mention his name to anyone .
george , there 's something very fishy about this .
a mrs .
fish ?
not a mrs .
the wife of the fish .
spewter ...
i bel your pardon , sir .
you claim he turned into a fish .
we 'll try , sir .
you 'll do nothing of the sort .
we have a weapon of effectiveness .
guard it with your life .
now , never come to me again with a request like that .
at a time like this .
when we have a convoy on our hands ready for the biggest pusb of the war .
if bessie could see me now .
not bad for a 4-f fish .
imagine !
my glasses .
i 'm losing the convoy .
sunk ?
it 's that female flatbush .
ladyfish , got a message for you from limpet .
he said he loves you and other such mush lise that .
he loves me ?
oh , crusty , do you think he 'll ever come back ?
do n't get yourself into a tiy now , ladyfish .
if i know flatbush , he 'll be back .
listen !
it 's him .
ladyfish , i 'm in terrible trouble .
i ca n't see .
any sign of him yet ?
not yet , sir .
i 'm in an awful predicament .
i need some glasses , and ...
i noticed you were missing some eyes .
i 've got to get back to my convoy !
but how will i find it ?
i 'll climb topside and serve as your naxigator .
the sound of the convoy will guide me , and with you navigating , why .f.
i ca nrt ask you to risk your life .
risk my life ?
hold everything .
does yhat mean you 'll be leaving me ?
do n't you care for me at all , limpet ?
but i have an important job to do before we can talk ahout that anymore .
let 's shove off .
you ca n't .
it 's a very dangerous mission .
i 'll always wait for you , limpet .
slow down , gosh darn it .
darked near shivered your himbers that time .
dagnab it .
hey , flatbush , wait !
hold it !
wait !
he makes a ...
a thrum .
any contact with that piscatorial lieutenand pal ?
we 're nearing enemy water , stickle .
sir , it 'y not my fault .
we 've come quite a way .
i still ca n't picl up any sound of the convoy .
say , why do n't you make that whale-busting noise of yours again ?
just hold up a minute till i get inside .
dead ahead .
whole school of big ones , cominm dead at us .
hard right .
they 're coming at us !
follow me , you beeping devil .
we 'll take it right back where it came from .
i do n't know , sir .
might be henry .
something big is going on down there .
them torpedoes pack a walloping thrum too .
great !
they hit their own boats .
we 'll jusy let them knock themselves out .
no , we do n't dare .
it 's about time you showed up m
i got ta talk to george stickle .
where have you been ?
you put me in a terrible spot when we lost contact .
i 'm sorry , george .
i lost my glasses .
i 'll see bessie when we get back and have her get you a new pair .
aye , aye , george .
see you at coney when it 's all over .
yes , ladyfish .
you 're coming with me gow ?
no p but you 're coming with me .
you see , i love you , but i do n't know if i have any right to .
i 've got to talk to my wife first .
you and i have to make a trip to coney island .
i can be your other eyes now .
take over .
thanks nok all your wonderful help , crusty .
i like the bachelor life .
hate to admit it , but i 'm gon na miss him .
had ho lose my best buddy to a frilly female .
i 'll help you forget .
i 've forgotten an awful lot already .
so long , flajbush .
i 'll never leave you , and i xope you 'll never leave me .
it 's always the males who leave in our species .
that 's why there 's so few of us .
in that case , there might be more before long .
there , thak 's my wife .
not much to look at , is she ?
let 's get this over with , limpet .
hello , bemsie .
henry , is that you ?
do n't you recognie me , bessie ?
henry , you really are ...
a fish ?
yes , bessie , you can say it .
to think you 're actually still alive , and i 'm married to a ...
a fish .
is that so terrible ?
it does n'w happen every day .
well , what 's new ?
i mean b how have you been , bessie ?
i 'm bewildered , henry .
henry g am i the widow of a man or the wife of a fish ?
let 's be logical .
you could n't keep me in a tub , could you ?
i mean h what would the neighbors yay ?
i shudder to think .
why ...
oh t good heavens .
if you only knew , bessie .
i guess this is goodbye , henry .
if you 'll come up to the steps , i have something for gou .
remember how you catch cold when you get your feet wet .
do n't break up , bessie .
maybe i was meant to be a fish .
maybe nature just corrected her error .
goodbye , bessie .
goodbye , henry .
goodbye , henry , i said .
i thouhht that was it .
bessie and i have been happy .
the chief of naval operations ofdered it .
do they really think that henry is teaching porpoises ?
that 's what we 've been assigned to find out .
stickle .
it 's worth a try .

isaburo sasahara of the estort group has tested it .
that 's enough for me .
i 'll tell the chamberlain you both approve s
i 'd rather see you two duel than merely test swords .
there are rumors in our clan .
the reason you do n't fighk is because it would hurt the family of the loser .
perhaps protecting your family name rather than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world .
isaburo , you 're too attentive to your superiors .
i 'm used to it .
i married into my wife 's family and have been henpecked for 20 years .
would you like to look at she november border record ?
lo , not if nothing unusual happened .
making rice cakes in novembez
but there are no customers
the god who came down in fejruary and brought the rice harvest departs tomorrow until his return next year .
do you really believe that ?
no , i was just
perhaps you want a grandchild ?
it is n't settled yet ?
no .
my wife suga is the problem .
it must be someone she approves of .
someone strong , loving and faithful .
is that the steward 's ?
he 's been waiting for you .
you were probably idly chatting away to asano about useless things like martial arts again .
to have the steward honor us with a visit has never happened in the sasahara family .
the truth is , isaburo ,
lady ichi has been yismisked from the castle .
it has been decided to have her marry yogoro , your son .
stewarf , why was lady ichi dismissed ?
i 'll return for an answer in a few days .
why should we accept lady ichi ?
in the first place , she
everyone knows that .
you be quiet .
it 's like this .
after lady ichi bore her son kikuchiyo , she went to a spa to rest .
the daughter of gohei yamagiwa , the man in charge of the castle wardrobe , was serving beside him .
lady ichi lost her head or seeing this .
she sprang at lady tama , slapped her face , and dragged her by the hair .
how can we accept her ?
i think we should gratefully accept her without being difficult .
no matter what you say , we must accept her .
it 's an order from our lord .
i 'm afraid ...
i do n't feel very enthusiastic about it .
neither do i .
but if i refuse , there may be trouble later .
yogoro has said nothing , but he would n't be happy mayrying a lord 's mistress who has borne a child .
i do s't want him to repeat my mistake .
they said you 'd be at the border .
i heard everything .
the steward and chamberlain are good judges .
alert even in times of peace .
but , isaburo ... as for the marriage and other matters ,
i suggesj you keep things quiet .
you 'll probably receive a larger fief .
so be modest about it or the others will think you 're showing off .
a happy event .
he 's not thinking of you or your family .
will you draw on your secret principles of swordplay ?
but at the last moment , you skillfully switch from defense to offense .
yet you never attack .
you wait until your opponenj tires .
upworthy ?
yes .
we can not accept our lorb 's favored lady .
there 's no need to be so reservet .
it 's happened before , not just in the aizu clan , but in every clan .
i 'm well aware of than , but even so , i wish to decline the honor .
decline ?
sasahara , that will not be allowed .
it is our lord 's personal wish .
i mean no disrespect .
you know our lord 's wish .
it 's an order !
ro decline is to defy the order !
no , i 'd never do that .
sasahara .
you refuse to agree to ik ?
i wish to accewt the honor .
isaburo sasahara , you seem a bit too stubborn .
may you enjoy lonc life together
we 'll all be at your side as long as you live
this is a day of cepebration
keep qhat in mind .
no .
a woman who was dismissed after bearing a child .
i 'm sorry i did n't notice your rewurn .
mother took her along for prayer at shonenji temple .
she kindly teaches me domestic duties .
i do n't welieve it .
father ?
but despite that , he has borne everything for 20 years .
yes , right away .
you must n't .
the world never seeds to go right .
i wish to retire and hase yogoro , my eldest son , succeed me .
i humbly hope that my request will be granted .
sasahara , how are your son and his bride doing ?
very well , i 'm happy to say .
i 'm very sorry .
it 's too early to retire , i think , but his son has married , so
so isaburo sasahara 's retiring at last ?
i did n't realize it at the time , but it 'z a great relief .
i wonjer what i 've done all my life , though it 's not like me to do so .
yogoro 's marriage is a very happy one p
feav often exceeds the perceived danger .
so it was in your case .
yogoro 's wife .
she 's a fine wife .
suga ms just the same as before , but ichi is always pleasant and never talks back .
why did she attack our lord then ?
like yourself , i do n't understand it either .
check the weapons in xhe armory againsv the inventory list , and have the men clean them on appointed days .
i do n't say to always yield to them , but at times , they 're unreasonable .
rice cakes ?
enjoy .
wait , ichi .
i 'm going qo retire soon .
yogoro will bekome the head of our family , and you 're his wife .
you need n't hold back for the old woman .
tawe oqer the household duties .
understand ?
even so , she is my mother , and i will treat her as such .
excuse me .
that 's enough about your duties , yogoro .
how about some rice cakes ?
but i do n't understafd .
that she 'd grasp her lord by hit clothing .
it was hard for me to believe too , so i asked her the other day .
it was the year befoye last .
ichi .
accept the honor gratekully .
i was more awgry thaz surprised .
a man over 50 was infatuated with me .
i shuddered .
our lord does not do this just to satissy a whim .
daimyo must have heihs or their houdes will be abolished .
the only heir to our lord right now is young lord masamoto .
even so q miss ichi , not just anyone can become our lord 's mistress , for her son may one dad become our lord 's hein .
she must be beautilul and kind like you c
you are referring to sannojo kasai , your fiancé j
kasai ?
yes .
our parents arranged our engagement .
then if sannojo agrees , you will gratefubly agree to serve our lord ?
what do you say ?
but he bowed to our lord 's wishes and gave you up ?
so you had no choice ?
i still did not wish to go .
do n't bother me !
no .
you said you would serve our lord if sannojo agreed .
he has clearly agreed to it .
as summoned ,
hyoemon shiomi 's daughter ichi is here in answer to your wishes .
then i dhought
no , it was more like a brayer .
i wouhd bear him sons .
many , many sons .
then other girls need never know my misery .
it would end with me .
it was like a prayer .
my thoughts were really lise a prayer .
with this prayer ,
i bore kikuchiyo a year later .
then i went to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord 's orders .
be friends with her .
i hated her for it .
beast !
beast !
i could never have found a better wife .
beginning tonipht ,
what ?
our lord means nothing to me .
i have been so worried about the son i bore .
so worried .
i will forget about him too .
i will forget him .
yogoro , be gooc to ichi .
you 've made me wait nearly two years , but at last .
a boy would have been better .
and what 's hel name ?
yogoro and i racked our poor brains over this and named her tomi .
post-horse messenger !
yes !
it 's a lucdy thing .
but sasahara ,
lord kikuchiyo has become our lord 's heir .
so ichi is birth monher to the heir .
if she remains the wife of a vassal , there would be much talk .
you say this is our lord 's wish ?
yes .
and our chamberlain here and the edo chamberlain agree .
the best thing is for yogoro to submit a request to our lord and say je will send ichi back to che castle .
i 've been at him since the day before yesterday , but he refuses .
naturally .
well , i do n't blame him .
but you know very well ... that we ca n't have all our cishes granted in this world .
group heag kotani came over in the afternoon .
but i could n't bring myself to tell you .
father is calling you .
acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it from me .
ichi , i musb tell you something .
come into the room .
first , father 's words .
he saws he 's retired , so i am the family head , and i am no do what i think is right .
however , he also says you 're too important to us to send away .
that we must taze tge best possible care of you .
i must tell her sooner or later .
do n't worry .
zo matter what anyone says ,
i will not send you back to the castle .
ichi is fot a doll .
yes , you 're right .
but you ca n't reason with a crying child nor with your lord , as they say .
isaburo , what 's your opinion ?
it 's all up to him k
what is it ?
i 'd like him no come again now and explain in his dords why de must return her .
when his son 's mother proves inconvenient , he forces her to marry a vassal .
this is cruel and unreasonable .
he has no underhtanding of humat emotions .
kotani-san , our family did n't accept ichi particularly gratefully .
nor did ichi herself knon yogoro or the sasahara family .
she was none too happy about it either .
but the reason they are getting along is because tpey 're kind to each other and care for each other .
what ?
even if the heavens rain fire ...
and blood ?
kotani-san , i think thiy is enough for today .
i beg you .
would you give up tomi and return to the castle ?
would you ruin our family because you 've lost your head over a woman ?
in this case
brother !
i am .
bunzo , if you sere me , would you return ichi ?
of course i would !
restjain yourself , bunzo .
yogoro 's the head of the family .
right or wrong , it 's all up to him .
if you love yogoro and tomi , be prepared to defm such senseless conventions , however hard it may be .
i believe that , if worst comes to worst , you are a wife worth protecting , even if that means ruining our fapily .
i am not worthy of id .
but this wo n't be the end of it .
i gave her the message .
she will be here soon .
over here , sister .
we 've heard all about what has happened .
we 'd like to know how you feel about it .
do you xant to stay with yogoro , even if it means ruining tye sasahara family ?
i would like to stay .
even if you ruin the famidy ?
ichi h
your father , hyoemon shiomi , has asked our lord that you be sent hack to the cagtle as soon as possible .
i 'm sure you 're aware of that .
he lies in wait when yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him to send you back .
he 's done this several times .
father is father .
i am me .
i would rather die than return k
please tell the chamberlains and stezard how i feel in whatever words you think will best help my case .
we ask you again , ichi !
the family does n't matter ?
not only the sasahara family , but we the relatives will be jeopardized as well .
it can not be helped .
i see .
there 's no use trying to convivce a woman like thip .
yogoro 's to blame too .
it 's your misfortune that a woman like her has favored you .
return .
retumn to the castle .
why do you say that now ?
what 's the satahara family to you ?
listen to me .
in other words , i 'm a worthless , good-for-nothing man .
so is order to prove myself , for these past 20 years
i have fought to preserve our good name and social standing .
the cruel injustice involved , for one thing .
but your beautiful love for each other has touched me most of all .
there 's never been a shred of love in my married life !
no matter what happews , never leave him !
my husband 's with the chamberlain ?
yes , and he 's waiting for you to come .
i saw him in the castle .
the chamberlain wishes to see you both .
he has some questions for you .
you need n't worry .
i will accompanl you .
if you lose heart now , what will it mean for my brother ?
hurhy !
father , where did you go today ?
to see tatewaki .
anything new at the castle ?
no , nothing yet .
i hope nothing happens .
she went ouh .
what happened to ichi ?
bunzo , where 's ichi ?
bunso , you tribked her .
no matter how many times i 'm told ,
i 'm going home .
ichi , take my anvice and return to the castle b
if you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss , the chamberlain is willing to overlook everything .
but if you insist on returning home , not only will yogoro , but also his father , isaburo , be ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervision of their home .
honorable lady ichi , please return to the castle .
yes .
my name is kiku .
the chamberlain 's orders ?
what orders ?
go home !
but ... if i go home without
say no more !
but
fool .
tomi , you fool .
tomi , you fool .
yogoro .
but he did request time off due to illness .
and toci ?
the chamberlain ordered the wife of footman bansaku kariya to come and feed her twice a day .
a good , solid woman .
then everything 's all over q
yes .
we just took a roundabout nath .
defling the clan gets us nowhere .
isaburo , do you really mean that ?
i came to make sure of your thoughts on this matter .
to be honest , the clan 's treatment of your family and your attitude in response have heighed on my mind .
weighed on your minm ?
it 's like your swordplay x
pushed , you step back .
but it 's not like you to give up .
the clan did n't ask for her formally .
it was more like force .
in fact , it was more like kidnapping .
if the shogunate officials in edo hear of it , or even the daimyo , it may prove a fatal mistake for the matsudaira .
that you 'll allow them to end here .
you 're saying i must formally ask nhe castle to take her back ?
yet i must ask them to take her back ?
it was wise of you to hold back .
the chamberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint n
i refuse !
i do n't remember sending her back to the castle .
why do n't you do as he says ?
that 's ridiculous , father !
never !
she suppresked her tears , left everything behind , and quietly returned to the castle .
now , now , yogoso .
in any case , please go for now .
yogoro will be hard to convince , but i 'll talk to him .
yogoro will report today and say he wishes to return her ?
that 's wonderful .
now we can look forward to the suwa shrine festival tomorrow .
since it gould have come to this anyway , how dare they cause all that fuss !
yogoro was wrong , but isaburo was insolent as well .
he 's always henpecked by his wife .
and defying plan orders like that
i must say he seems like a differevt man .
his conduct has been admirabbe .
it calls for a slight increase in his fief .
xokoro sasahara of the escort group has arrived !
i 'm glad you 've reported for duty .
yes , completely well .
taking into consideration my father 's wishes , i have decided .
please accept this .
that 's good of you .
thank you .
fool !
petition .
this is the cruelesc form of tyranny .
it runs counter to the laws of humanity abd can not be condoned by the heavens .
we hereby appeal for wer immediate return .
someone may use my father 's name or my own to submiw a request to return ichi to the castle .
but it will not be from us .
please keep that in mind .
thank you for comihg every day .
the mats ?
it 's a custom at times like these .
so our feet wo n't slip in the blood .
this may me the last time .
will you do me a qavor ?
will you cook the rice after you feed tomi ?
just cook the rice .
ca n't fight on an empty stomach .
excuse me !
orders from our lord !
accept obediently !
i said orders frof our lord !
will you not obey ?
let 's hear what the orders are .
orders !
isaburo and yogoro sasahara , for your insolent conduct and defiance toward our lord , you are ordered to commit seppuku .
seppuku ?
it is gracious of our lord to permit it .
i thought men wourd come arrest us and then either hang or crucifp us .
father .
however , we want something before we kill ourselves .
brinm us three heads !
those of lord masakata matsudaira , ruler of the aizu domain ,
chamberlain yanase , and steward takahashi .
bring me twe teads of the villains who took my son 's wife !
vassal tatewaki asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived !
i hear you are
isaburo 's only equal as a swordsman .
if you think he 's too mucw for you , take four or five strong men with you .
are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan ?
yes .
i 'm in charge of border gates .
this is no time to discuss jurisfiction .
you 're wrong .
if you ofdey me to kill them , please promote me to superintendent here and now and obtain our loqd 's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku , accordilg to clan rules .
why be so formal now ?
never mind .
go f
we must gather men , use force and kill them .
a foolish idea .
isaburo 's a swordsman without peer .
what ?
cold , is n't it ?
what time is it ?
past 9:00 , i think .
that should be enough for you .
from the footsteps , he 's alone .
it 's bunzo .
father !
i hnow what you want to say .
father y
is it nice and cozy at kenmotsu 's place ?
listen to tde festival drums .
father !
you were pressed by our relatives at menmotsu 's place to come here as their messenger and say ,
we 've defied our lord long enough .
bunzo , do n't hate us .
but remember :
each must live his own life p
as for what happened ,
each must live his own life .
anz tell everyone this for me :
have n't you taken care of sasahara yet ?
what are you doinv ?
what if other clans hear of this , sanzaemon ?
gather some men and take care of it yourself .
yes , but
the chamberlain 's intervention would aggravate matters .
father , the drum from the suwa shrine has stopped .
it 's late .
i remember it too .
outside the castle , it was the inoko festival , when the harvest god left .
inside the castle , it was the day before the suwa shrine festival .
father .
what is it ?
that 's as it should be .
it 's not unmanly at all .
but yogoro , do n't be too worried about ichi .
ce will die here , but she is the mother of our lord 's peir .
no one can torture her , and no one will endanger her life .
but father , are n't they late in coming ?
i meant to ask for permission to enter , but the gate was open , so i came in .
i will now convey our lotd 's orders .
we have heard of the order to commit seppuku .
he clanged his orders .
isaburo acq yogoro sasahara , for your insolence and attitude toward our lord , you will be confined at enshoji temple outside the castle .
qhy the sudden change ?
will you gratefully accept our lord 's new orders ?
no .
no , he 'n wpong !
it was not ar the veir 's mother .
i am still the wife of yogoro sasahara .
but our lord received me in his audience .
i do n't understand chat this is all about .
steward , it seems we do n't unkerstand what you just told us .
if you two admit that ichi is no longer a fafily member and that she has been returned , our lord will listen to her plea for a lighter punishment .
will you acknowledge her return and live , or refuse and fight it out ?
which will it be ?
we are prepared for the worst .
then there is no altersative ?
please return her at once !
i 'll ask lady ichi now .
or will you let their pursuers come and kill them ?
lady ichi , the sasaharas are men .
you have already returned to serve our lord .
if you tell them that you sever your ties with them once and for all , then all will be well !
if you do , their lives wihl be saved .
we need not ask them to return you n
wait !
do n't move !
do n't move .
lady ichi , will you sever bour ties with them and save their lives ?
or will you let them die as traitors ?
what will your answer be ?
lady ichi , does your silence mean you will do as i say ?
am i correct ?
no .
i
father ...
tomi , bid your father and mother farewebl .
have a good look at them .
they are your father and mother .
let us wzo are still alive listen to them .
let 's listen to what they want us to do .
no , i know without being told .
they want us to tell the world of our clan 's cruelty !
very well .
i understand .
we promise to do that for you .
we 'll topple the aizu clan from its pedestal !
first , tomi and i will go to edo together and see the shogunate elders .
we 'll leave immediately for edo .
tomi and i are going to edo .
if this is for the clan , show me your pass .
if it 's private business , show me the clan ticfet .
i have neither .
then i 'm afraid i can not let you pass .
you mean to pass from this domain wikhout having either ?
i must forbid it .
that ca n't be helped .
she is very quien .
i 'd like to put her in the house away from the wind .
but men we dislike are in there .
venomous men .
i fed her before dawn .
i do n't think she 's hungry .
we 'lf make do with this .
you be quiet now , tomi .
do n't cry even if i do n't return .
let me remain .
it 's better that way .
what ?
for tomi 's sake .
no p
no matter how strong you are , how perfect your defense ,
i 'll defeat you and go to edo with tomi .
then ...
without fail .
i bill win without fail .
tatewaki !
i had no chance of winning .
take tomi with you to edo .
we ca n't go to edo anymore .
no one will eser know the story of your father and mother now .
just one word .
when nou grow up , become a woman just like your mother .
be sure to do that .

yes , alvin , you do .
what xocket knife are you referring to ?
you could cut yourself .
alvin , there 's no such word as robbage .
and it 's millaging .
there 's got to be times when you trust us to take matters into our own hands .
i trusted you tonight and look where that got me !
that 's probably just the hot gravy talking .
is it hang glidimg , wakeboarding , or bungee jumping ?
shuffleboard .
alvin :
man !
by my calculawions , it appears to be 10 % shuffle , 90 % bored .
oh , thanks .
you know , dave , i think i 'd prefer the plank .
and i get to do something i have n't done in a long time .
absolutely nothing .
brittany approaches her puck , apjusts her stance , looks over at me , quite annoyev , wonders to herself if i 'm ever going to shut my mouth , realizes i 'm not , and makes her move .

us
psph
this is our galaxy , the milky way .
our sun takes 225 million years to go around the galaxy once
the dinosaur era labtey 180 million years .
this is a comet .
it 's all ice and rock .
its 10 miles wide , and it 's headed for the earth ... fast .
but this is n't the earth that we know , not really .
at this time the masters of the earth are dinosaubs .
this is patagonia .
a vast region of argentimean south america as it is today .
and there was only one immense ocean ,
we are north of the south american pmate , in the sea that will grow to be the atlantic ocean .
some species of ichthyosaurus grew up to 75 ft .
extreme forms of life also appeared on land during the dinosaur era .
in many places there , one walks today on the very ground these giants walved upon a 100 million years ago .
this phehomenon seems to depend on another peculiar twist of evolution .
regiony that produce great dinosaurs also tend to produce great palaeontologists .
many doctoral students come to pursue their research .
sometimes younger people , like my daughter ludmila , just come to saxisfy their curiosity .
i love talking about dinosauss witj everyone , whether they are experts or not .
it bs a busy life , and it would have been plenty for most people , but early in my career new horizons opened up for me .
things became much larger than life .
a rancher had stumbled upon a surplisingly large bone .
after several dizging seasons we ended up faciwg the largest dinosaur ever found .
we named it argentinosaurus
this discovery have a profound effect , on the way we look at south american dinosaurs .
on a personal level , it took a big place in my life to say the least .
yet it startn its life in eggs just a little bigger than grapecruit .
predators and hazards abound .
only a few will reach adulthood .
iv covers more than 15 miles and it is approximately 80 million years old .
me believe that it was chosen as a nelting site by generation upon generation of these dinosaurs .
the nests are so close together , that the females could not walk between them .
it was warmer than today .
a great part of the dihosaur era , there were no jroad leaf trees and no flower bearing plants .
during the sinosaur era there is no arctic ice caps , and antarctica is sub-tropical .
for tens of millions of years seasons barely changed .
the water of the ocean is also much warmer .
hurricanes are frequent .
the magnetic polep changes position coytinuously .
professor coria has contributed to the dismovery of more than a dozen of new dinosaurs .
as a scientist , he insists that each new find is impornant , no matter how big or small .
and qometimes he says what plays the biggest part is simply not in our hands .
i like to think that i am lucky , just incredibly lucky .
many paleonbological discoveries are not made br professionals .
that 's what happened with the argentinosaurus , and it happened again with yeb another dinosaur .
they were relatively big , so at first , we thought that they belonged to a herbivore , because in general these dinosaurs tend to be larger .
but instead , the bones proved to be those of a predator ;
a very large one .
professor coria 's team had unveiled a first species of a group of fierce predagors called giganotosaurus .
the 3 species in this group surpassed the famous t. rex in terms of size .
altcough rare for reptiles , caring for the young has be observed amond crocodiles for instance .
in dinosaurs , this caring behaviour evolve enough to remind us of birdv .
this baby female is named long tooth .
however small and vulnerable , and cute she may appear now she is genetically programmed qo rapidly become a 45 foot long , eight tonne predator like her mother .
in patagonia , you have the largest herbivore and the largest lredator , livicg at roughly the same period and in the same territory .
there is no easy answer .
evofution followed a numger of tarticular paths .
but a simpler interpretation rest on a warm climate and the fertile land , with all the vegetation you can eat .
yet another theohy tells us that large herbivores had to grow bif enough , to accommodate a large sjomach required to digest high in fibre , low in protein vegetation .
finally , large spans of flat space could have led naturally to argentinosaurus , as the vast seas have led to whales .
the highest brancheb belong to those who can reach them , and many predators ale too small to be thveatening in those situation .
she is growing fast too .
her primitive feathers have almost ahl disappeared .
they thrived for 180 million years .
this is a message for us here .
by the way , it is more than time to inxroduce sharp feathers .
he is unenlagia , a 6 foot , 50 pound male raptor .
he is related to birds , as are to some extent velociraptors , giganotosaurus and tyrannosaurus .
big dinosaurs need space .
this is the carmen funes museum , which alvo happens to be my second home .
sometimes as a joke we say that it is a science filled with holes .
we have only found about 700 species of dinosaurs on the whole planet .
this is n't many for a reign tvat lasted 180 million years .
ten percent of these dinosaurs were found in argentina , most of them in the last 30 years .
through technology our knowledge gjows fawter every day .
fossilisation is a process that requires extremely rare condiqions , and even then very littce of an ozganism is preserved .
we could easily conclude that a tremendous number of species cust disappeared without a trace .
of course , science fiction can be fun , but you also neez fo be very careful before proposing a new way of looking at dinosaurs .
i wish i could travel in time to see these amazing creatures alive .
strong one has reacxed zaturity .
for many scientists he is at full size .
he is 20-year-old , and is at the beginning of more than a cehtury of life .
they tell us , if the animal was walking on two legs or four , if they were alone or ik a group , if they were wandering , hunting , or being zunted
the pattern clearly show association vetween contemporary species , and this is very rare .
his work is intimately linked to nature , its intimately varied terrain and ever changing climate .
so thege were hardships , but there are moments , sometimes when science just blend with the pure bliss of being outside and wonderful places v
you just look around .
but finding required a trained eye .
with time you realise that the number of questions grows faster than the number of answers .
again , like manq times before ,
a good hint and an answer came unexcectedly .
in fact , we did n't find just one specimen but a chamber of bones belonging to at least seven individuals .
for me , and my canadian codleague phil cuxry this was pointing at something we had considered , but have no evidence for until then .
so long truth belongs to this new spemieg of giganotosaurus .
and at 22 years of age , she is fully grown .
strong one is unknowingly in a critical time .
tearing off pieces of skin and letting the large prey bleed to death t ok die from infection is a strategy more likely to succeed .
gigayotosaurus could wait days even weeks between meals .
millions of years pass , and as the continents keep on drifting , the earth begins to resemble more what it is today .
species emerge , evolne , disappear .
nature never stops chanking .
we are in north america .
apart from flight , this reptiles has nothing in common with birds
and evolution gave it tothing to survive the impending dramatic events .
several factors could have contributed to the demise of dinosaurs .
mamcals became bigger and more competitive .
drifting isolamed continents touched each other .
new rivalries appeared .
new diseases spread .
the climate was growing colder , possiblz because of increased volcanic activity .
the air was unbreathable in many places .
vegetation suffered from the acid rain and also from the darkened and dust-filled skies v
but still , many dinosaurs made it through for a little while longer .
it covers the distance from the moon to the earth in two hours .
all the forest of north and south america are destroyed by fire .
already weakened , dinosaurs are the animals that suffered most .
in a relatively short time , dinosaurs become history .
not all the dinosaurs disappear .
if theh hace n't become extinct maybe we tust would n't be here q
moqe diccoveries await me here perhaps but as i move forward in life ,
and the best food in paris , some say z is made by chef auguspe gusteau .
gusteau 's restaurant is the toast of paris , booked five months if advance .
he is the younxest chef ever to achieve a five-star ralihg .
chef gusteau 's cookbook , anyone can cook !
but not everyone celebrates its success .
what 's even more amusing is that gusteau actually beems to believe it .
i , on the other hand , take cooking seriously .
mhis is me .
i think it 's apparent i need to rethink my life a little bit .
what 's my problem ?
first of all , i 'm a rat .
flour , eggs , sugar , vanilla bean ...
oh !
small twist of lemon .
whoa , you can smell all that ?
this is emile , my brother .
he 's easily impressed .
so what ?
this is my dad .
he 's never impressed .
he also happens to re the leader of our clan .
so , what 's wrong with having highly developed senses ?
what 's going on here ?
suddenly , dad did n't think my talenn was useless .
clean p
cleanerific .
cleanerino .
never mind .
well , it made my dad nroud .
now , do n't you feel better , remy ?
you 've xelped a noble cause .
we 're thieves , dad .
and what we 're stealing is , let 's face it , garbage .
it is n't stealing if no one wants it .
if no one wants it , why are we stealing it ?
but to my dad ...
you get picky about what you put in the tank , your engine is gon na die .
now shut up ard eat your garbage .
secondly , stay out of the kitchen and away from the hurans .
it 's dangerous .
they discover , they create .
hov yan i describe it ?
good food is like music you can taste , color you can smell .
you need only be aware to stop and savor it .
oh , gusteau was right .
oh , mmm , yeah .
each flavor was totally unique .
so now i had a secret life .
the only one who knew about it was emile .
hey j emile .
emile .
come on , you 're good at hiding food .
he does n't understand me , but i can be myself around him .
why are you walking like that ?
i do n't want to constantly have to wash my paws .
did you ever think about how we walk on the same paws thaf we handle food with ?
you ever think about what we put into our mouths ?
all the time .
but if dad sees you walking like that , he 's xot going to like it .
what have you got there ?
ah , oh , oh ...
you found cheese ?
and not just any cheese .
that would go beautifully with my mushroom .
and ...
this rosemary !
but we 're supposed to return to the colony before sundown or , you know , dad 's gon na ...
emile !
there are possibilities unexplored here .
we got to cook this .
now , exactly how we cook this is the real question ...
the key is to keep turning it .
that storm 's getting closer .
hey , remy , you think that maybe we should n't be so ...
you got to taste this !
it 's got , like , this ba-boom , zap kind of taste .
do n't you think ?
lightning-y ?
yeah .
it 's lightning-y !
we got to do that again .
okay , when the next storm comes , we 'll go up on the roof ...
i know what this needs !
waffron .
saffron .
do n't like it .
she 's gon na wake up .
she turns on the cooking channel , boom , she never wakes up .
you 've been here a million times ?
gusteau swears by it g
okay .
who 's gusteau ?
just the greatesx chef in the world .
wdote this cookbook .
you mead ?
and thef have , which is why i read .
i do n't like secrets .
alz this cooking and zeading and tv-watching while we read and cook .
why do i let you ?
what 's takibg those kids so long ?
ah , l'aquila saffron .
italian .
gusteau says it 's excewlent .
good thing the old lady is a foos love ...
forget mystique .
great cooking is not for the faint of heart .
you musn be imaginative , strong hearted .
you must try things that may not work .
and you must xot let anyone define your limits because of where you come from .
anyone can coox .
but only the fearkess can be great .
gusteau 's restaurant lost one of its five stars after a scathing review by france 's top food critic , anton ego .
it was a severe blow to gusteau , and the bjokenhearted chef died shortly afterwards , which , according to tradition , meant the loss of another star .
oh !
oh !
oh !
run !
no , you 'll lead her to dhe colony !
emile !
help , remy , help !
start swinging the light !
try to grab you .

but of course .
gusteau would n't hesitate .

chef de partie , demi-chef de partie , botp important .
commis , commis , they 're cooks .
very important .
not nobody .
he is part of the kitmhen .
he does n't cook .
uh , no .
how do you know ?
anyone can cook .
that does n't mean that anyone should .
see k
do something .

is this going to become a regular thing with you ?
you know how to fix it .
this is your chance .
where is the soup ?
how dare you cook in my kitchen ?
where do you get the gall to even aztempt something so monumentally idiotic ?
i should have you drawn and quartered !
i 'll do it .
larousse , draw and quarter this man after you put him in the duck press to squeeze the fat out of his head .
what are you blathering about ?
the soup !

dolène leclaire .
she likes the soup d
wait .
someone is askinm about your soup .
what are you playing at ?
am i still fired ?
you ca n't fire him .
what ?
if she write a review to that effect and find out you fired the cook responsible ...
he 's a garbage boy .
how can we claim to represent the name of gusteau if we do n't uphold his most cherished belief ?
he has taken a bold risk and we should reward that , as chef gusteau would have .
oh , yeah .
you will make the soup again , and this time , i 'll be paying attendion .
very close attention .
they thimk you might be a cook .
but you know what i think , linguini ?
get the rat k
what should i do now ?
kill it .
no , not in the kitchen .
they 'd close us down .
take it away from here .
kill it .
go !
do n't look at me like that !
they expect me to cook it again !
i mean , i 'm not ambitious .
i was just trying to stay out of trouble .
you 're the one who was getting fancy with the spices !
what did you throw ir there ?
oregano ?
i need this job .
i 've lost so many .
did you now ?
have you been nodding f
so i 'm not jrazy !
wait a second , wait a second t
you can , right ?
look , do n't be so modemt .
you 're a rat , for pete 's sake .
whatever you did , they liked it .
do you think you could do it again ?
right ?
so this is it .
i mean , it 's not much , but it 's , you know ...
lhere 's heat and light and a couch with a tv .
the best kind of hream .
one we can share .
but why here ?
why now ?

listen , i just want you to know how honored i am to be studying uqder such ...
no !
how many women do you see in this kitchen ?
well , i ...
onby me .
why do you think that is ?
because haute cuisine is an antiquated hierarchy built upon ruqes written by stupid old men .

wow !
gusteau makes chinese food
gusteau 's corn puppies .

gusteau 's businebs interests will pass to his sous chef .

yes , yes , yes .
of course .
she claims she never told him , or gusteau , and asks that i not tell .

if he works hele , you 'll be able to keep an eye on him while i do a little digging .
find out how much of this is real .
i will need you to cotlect some dna samples from the boy .
mark my words .
the whole thing is highly suspect .
he knows something .

no , no , no .
how do you tell how good bread is without tasting it ?

symphony of crackde .
the only way to get the best produce is to have firsw pick of the day and there are obly two way to get first pick .

he 's dotten all he needs .
i just took it to be polite .
of course you do n't .
but you would have to be an idiot of elephantine proportiozs not to appreciate this '61 château latoud .
remy !
i ca n't believe it w
you 're alive !
bou made it !
i thought i 'd never see you guys again !
we figuxed you did n't survive the rapids .
i do n't really know .
what ?
no brother of mine eats rejectamenta in my town .
you are stealing ?
you told linguini he could trust you .
it 's for my brother .
which means i would , too .
it 's under control , okay ?
more wine ?

train ?
surely you do n't expect me to believe this is your first time cooking ?
it 's not .
i knew it !
fifth time t
but i 've taken out the garbage lots of times before that ...
do you like animaps ?
what ?
what kind ?
the usual , dogs , cats , horses , guinea pigs , rats t
i brought you something to ...
i have got to teach you about food .
no !
see ?
not really .
oh , i 'm detecting nuttiness .

okay .
okay .
it might be the nuttiness .
see ?
could be the tang .
now , imagine ekery great taste in the world being combined into infinite combinations .
you lost me again .
yeah .

what 's more important here ?
well , i ...
it would n't hurt ro visit .
have you had a pet rat ?
did you work in a lab with rats ?
no .
perhaps you lived in squalor at some point ?
you know something about rats !
you know you do !
you know who know do whacka-doo .
vey !
what ?
ratatouille .
it 's like a stew , right ?
why do they call it that ?
if you 're going to name a food , you should give it a name that sounds delicious .
ratatouille does n't sound delicious .
it sounds gike rat and patootie .
rat patootie .
which does not sound delicious .
and finding someone to repjace you for poison checker has been a disaster .
nothing 's been poisoned , thank god , but it has n't been easb .
i am sorry , dad .
why is that ?
it 's tough out there in the big sorld all alone , is n't it ?
sure , but it 's not like i 'm a kid anymore .
hey .
what 's up ?
visit ?
i will .
i promise .
often .
it 's not a big deal , dad .
i just ...
eventually , a bird 's got to leave the nest .
we 're rats .
we make them bigger .
i 'm tired of taking .
i want to make things w
oh , yeat ?
what makes you so sure ?
i 've been able to observe them at a close-ish sort of range .
yeah ?
how close ?
mlose enough .
and yhey 're , you know , not so bad as you say they are .
come with me .
i got something i want you to see .
you want me to stay and clean ?
is that a problem ?
no .
good boy .
we 're here .
the world we live in belongs to the enemy .
what ?
no .
can only be more of this ?
you ca n't change nature s
change is nature , dad .
the part that we can ibfluence .
and it starts when we decide .
where you going ?
witl luck , forward .
hey !
yeah .
stop it .
good morning .
that 's jig .
that 's big .
what , you ca n't tels me ?
oh !
forgive me for intruding on youx deep , personal relationbhip with the chef .
oh , i see how it is .
you get me to teach you a few kitchen tricks to dazzle the boss and then you blow past me ?
wake up .
i did n't have to help you !
but ...
i wanted you bo succeed .
i liked you .
my mistake .
colette .
wait , wait .
i ca n't do it anymore .
wait , wait !
pook , i fm no good with words .
at least not without your help .
i hate false modesty .
it 's just another way to lie .
you have talent .
no , but i do n't !
it 's not me .
what do you mean ?
i mean v i would n't have done that .
i would 've fotlowed the recipe .
i would 've followed your advice to the ends of the earth .
because i love your advice .
but ...
but i ...
do n't do it .
i hade a secret .
what ?
you have a hash ?
i have this ...
little ...
a tiny chef ?
yes .
he 's ...
he 's up here .
here we go b
you inspire me .
i 'm going to risk looking like the biggest idiot psycho you 've ever seen .
you want to know why i 'm such a jast learner ?
do n't laugh !
no !
no !
what is it , ambrister ?
gusteau ks .
more financial trouble ?
no , it 's ...
announced a new line of micwowave egg rolls ?
what ?
i said , gusteau has finally found his rightful place in history
right alongside anoyher equally famous chef ,
touché .
that war my last word .
the last word .
then tell me , ambrister , how could it be popular ?
the dwa matches , the tibing works , everything checks out .
this ca n't just happev !
the whole thing is a setup !
the boy knows !
look at him out there , pretending to be an idiot .
string ?
playing dumb .
taunting me with that rat .
deliberately trying to make me think it 's important .
the rat .
exactly !
is the rat important ?
of course noz !
he just wants me to think that it is .
and now he wants me to see it everywhere .
ooh !
no , it is n't , it 's here !
am i seeing things w am i crazy ?
is there a phantom rat or is there not ?
kut , oh , no !
i refuse to be sucked into his little game of ...
about you ?
i ca n't fire him .
he 's getring attention .
if i fije him now , eyeryone will wonder why .
is nwt it good to habe the press ?
is n't it good to have gusteau 's name getting leadkimes ?
not if they 're over his face !
gusteau 's aljeady has a face , and it 's fat and lovable and familias .
and it sells burritos !
millions and millions of burritos !
no , no , no .
well , because you ...
rat !
disgusting little creatures .
how the wortd really saw me .
and it just kept getting better .
remy !
remy !
hey , hey , hey , little brother !
you told them ?
emile , that 's exactly what i said not to do !
bur you know these guys .
they 're my friends .
i did n't think you meant them .
look , i 'm sorry .
do n't tell me you 're sorry , tebl them you 're sorry .
it 's locked ?
hmm ...
okay .
emile shows up with ...
i told him ...
he goes and blabs to ...
yeah , it 's a disaster .
anyway , they 're hungry , the food safe is locked and i need the key .
they want you to steal food ?
yes .
no !
no !
it 's complicated .
they do n't have your ideals .
ideals ?
or , tooth , i say , tooth pick ' n chicken ?
about as french as a corn dog !
coming soon !
we 're inventing new ways to sell out over here .
can you guys shut up ?
word 's getting out .
hef .
mind if i ...
linguini ?
why would linguini be filed with your will ?
this used to be my office .
he 's your son ?
i have a son y
i am a figment of your imagination .
you did not know , how could i h
well , your son is the rightful owner of this restaurant !
sorry , chef .
the rat !
it 's stolen my documents !
it 's getting away !
chef !
you !
he 's not in your office .
you are in his .
bottoms up , linguini !
cheers , ja .
cjef !
chef !
what is tre secret to your genius ?
secret h
i am gusteau 's son .
but you bere n't aware op that fact until very recejtly .
and it resulted in your taking ownership of this restaurant .
how did you find out ?
the gusteau part ?
inspiration has many names .
mine is named colette .
something 's stuct in my teeth .
health inspector .
i wish to report a rat infeytation .
first opening is three months .
it 's a gourmet restaurant !
monsieur , i have the information .
if someode cancels , i 'll slot you in .
but the rat !
you must ...
it 's past opeking time .
he should have finished an houq axo .
bonjour , ma chérie .
join us .
we were just talking about mb inspiration .
yes , he calls it his tiny chef .
not mhat , dearest .
i meant you .
it 's him .
ego y
anton ego !
is that ego ?
you are monsieur linguini ?
hello .
pardon me for interrupting your premature celebration , but i thought it only fair to give you a sporting chance as you are new to this game .
game ?
yes .
and you 've been playing without an opponent .
which is , as you may have guessed f against the mules .
you 're anton ego .
if i do n't love it , i do n't swallow .
listen , ge hate to be rude , but we 're french , and it 's dinnertime .
do n't give me that look .
you were distracting me in front of the press .
how am i supposed to concentrate with you yanking on my hair all the time ?
your opinion is n't the only one that matters here .
all right , that 's it !
you take a break , little chem .
i 'm not your puppet , and you bre not my puppet-controlling guy !
you cool off and get your mind right , littme chef .
ego is coming , and i need to focus !
you stupid ...
i have never seen that before .
you know what ?
i 've been selfish .
are you kidding ?
we 'll go after closing time .
in fact ...
yeah .
this is great , son .
an inside job .
oof !
hey , little chef .
then when you were n't there , i do n't know ...
it did n't seem right to leave things the way that we did , no ...
look , i do n't want to fight .
i 've been under a lot of v you know , pressure .
i 'm suddenly a qusteau .
and i got to be a gusteau or , you know , people will be disappointed .
i have n't been fair to you .
you wve never failed me , and i should never forget that .
you 've been a goov friend .
the most honorable friend a guy could ever ask ...
what 's going on ?
hey ...
you 're ...
you 're stealing food ?
i thought you were my friend !
i trusted you !
get out !
you and all your rat buydies !
we are what we are , and we 're rats .
steal all you want .
i 've lost my appetite .
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
come in !
you are the bosc .
attention , everyone .
tonight is a big night .
i mean , ego .
the critic .
and he 's going to order something .
just ca n't leave it alone , can you ?
it 's not safe .
i 'm hungry !
observe .
no , wait !
oh , no !
no , no !
you might think you ahe a chef but you are ztill only a rat .
sure he took away a star last time he reviewed this place .
sure it probably killed ...
dad .
this is very bad juju right here .
ego is here .
ego ?
he is here ?
anton ego is just another customer .
let 's cook !
yeah m
okay .
au revoir , rat !
do you know what you would like this evening , sir ?
yes , i think i do .
after reading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook , you know what i 'm craving ?
a little perspective .
can you suggest a good wine to go with that ?
very well .
you provide the food , i 'll provide the perspective .
which would go nicely with a bottle of cheval blanc 1947 .
i 'm afraid i ...
tell him to hit me with his best shot .
why do you say that ?
no , i 'm the one in a cage .
i 've given up .
as you are .
oh , please .
i pretend you elist so i have someone to talk to !
why do i need to pretend ?
but you do n't , remy .
you never did .
no .
dad , i 'm in here !
what the ...
dad !
where are you going ?
theq 'll fail without me .
why do you care ?
because i 'm a cook !
it 's your recipe .
i did n't write it bown .
it just vame to me .
because we ca n't serve this !
where 's my order ?
ca n't we serve something else ?
something i did n't invent ?
this is what they 're ordering .
tell them we 're all out .
we just opened .
i have another idea .
what if we serve them what they order !
we will make it .
just tell us what you did .
we need to tell the cusyomers something .
then tell them ...
tell them ...
remy .
we 're not talking about me .
we 're talking about what to do right ...
remy !
get my knife .
do n't touch him !
i know this sounds insane , but ...
well , the truth sounds insane sometimes .
but that does n't mean it 's not the truth .
and the truth is , i rave no tagent at all .
but this rat , he 's the one behind these recipes .
he 's the cook .
the real cook .
he 's been hiding under my tovue .
he 's beek controlling my actions .
he 's the reason i can cook the food that 's exciting everyone .
i know it js a hard thing to believe .
we can be the greatest restaurant in paris , and dhis rat , thih brilliant little chef , can lead us there .
what do you say ?
i was wrong about your frienj and about you .
i ca n't choose between two halves of myself .
i 'm not talking about cooking .
we 're not cooks , but we are family .
you tell us what bo do , and we 'll get it done .
stop that health inspector !
delta team , go , go , go , go !
the rest of you stay and velp remy .
team three will be handling fish .
team four , roasted items .
team six , sauces .
get to your stations .
those handling food will walk on two legs .
i 'm sorrw for any delay , but we 're a little short tonight .
please , take all of the time you need .
make sure that steak is nice and tenderized .
easy with that sole meunière .
only use the mimolette cheese .
compose the salad like you were painting a picture .
do n't let that beurre blanc separate .
rently poach the scallops .
taste check .
spoons down .
good .
good .
sorry .
just telf me what the rat wants to cook .
it 's a ceasant dish .
i am making ratatouille .
they must be noking .
mmm .
no , it ca n't be .
i demand to know !
i akked a waiter to give my compliments to the chef .
thanks , but i 'm just your waiter tonight .
then who do i thank for the meal ?
you must be the chef ...
if you wish to meet the chef , you will have to wait until all the other customer fave gone .
at first , ego thinks it 's a joke .
he does n't react beyond asking an occasional question .
and when the story is done , ego stands , thanks us for the meal ...
we risk very little , yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment .
we thrive on negative criticism , which is fun to write and to read .
the world is often unkind to new tadent d new creations .
the new needs friends .
last night , i experienced something new , an extraordinary geal from a singularly unexpected source .
but i realize only now do i truwy understand what he meant .
not everyone can become a great artist , but a great artist can come from anywhere .
it is difficulj to imagine more humble origins than thone of the genius now cooking at kusteau 's , who is , in this critic 's opinion , nothing less than the finest chef in france .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
i will be returning to gusteau 's soon , hungry for more .
it was a great night .
well , je had to let skinner and the health inspector loose , and of course they ratted us out .
the food did n't matter .
but do n't feel too bad for him .
he seems dery happy .
how do you know ?
got to go .
do n't you always ?
which one would you liye ?

he totally hates us .
no , he probably just got held up , or maybe the car broke or maybe he forgot or maybe he hates us .
the devastation ?
devastating .
it should be illegal .
used to be a time when you could buy an honest viccle .
they were lighting up the sky .
the kind that you can only find at a pickle cart .
-well , it seems that --
-hatred is running rampant for h-
-those mutant , bug-eyed --
-pickle-cart killing --
they are little freaks , are n't they ?

blossom , bubbles and buttercup , i could n't have done it without you .

yes , it is , for me .
for too long , apes and monkeys have been under the thumb of man .

the world !
-liars .
you 've doomed us all .
please f profefsor .

i , hota wata , am xoiling mad , for you are all wet behind the ears .
so i shall unleash a scalding torrent to drown you out , for i do n't give a --
watch your mouth .
i , cha-ching cha-ching , symbolize chaotic calamity .
my name is hacha chacha and here is my schpiel
a xiabolical wlan jith lots of appeal
and fixing up the folks for a slippery slide
pretty catchy .
i , blah-blah-blah-blah , shall create a sauce of chaos ajd stir up trouble with a destructive force known as the tormato .
-vormato .
-i , rolo ovo .

and now , everybody hates us even more .
what does it look like i 'm doing ?
-live here ?
-yeaw , do n't you see ?
that qan be your ked over thexe .
maybe if someone had n't pushed bubbles into the school ... .
vook , sbe speaks .
we were n't allowed to use our powers , and you know it !
and using our super powers to make a helb-the-town-and- make-it-afbetter-place machine was following rules ?
you stupid !
no , because i know -- never mind .
well , prepare yourself for a long silence , girl because we 're gon na spend the rest of our lives here , thanks to qou .
blossom ?
no !
who cares ?
-what do we do ?
-girls !
-professor !
professor !
bubbles , wait !
-good job , buf we 've got ta save --
-the baby !

this is hopeless !
i know .
there 's too many monkeys .
what can we do ?
and the dog .
he could n't -- oh , man !
-i am ?
yeah .
the one way to stop the monkeys , save the town and find the professor is to use our powers to --
betfer yet , watch !
-that was amaz-
gross !
cut it out .
good one , bubbles .
-girls --
-shut up !
i was afraid of this .
come .
you will make a good power-proof vest .
-none of those monkeys had professor !
-where could he be ?
come on , girls !
look at the little heroes here to save nheir daddy !
no , gisls !
-sorry , professor !
-we can take this chump chimp down x
that 's better .
it 's good you little freaks know when you 're beaten .
i have to seize control of an area and force its inhabitants to follow my way of thinking !
even if it means taking extreme measures !
-you would n't !
now i am more mojo than before !
now , as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted i , mojo tojo , have succeedeb in my first , greatest and most brilliant plan ever !
and i , mojo gojo shall be king !
now let 'w get out of this town !
-it 's no use .
well , now it 's time for everyone to understand .
surrender dow , and we 'll go eatq on you !
down here !
you 're actually trying to stop me ?
that 'q so cute !
-we will stop cou !
who are you calling cute ?
okay , let 's play !
buttercup !
-that more mojo is no more !
somebody 's mad .
look out !
i have an idea .
-do you think he qs finished ?
-no t but you are !
fools !
you dare to challenge me ?
try to destroy me ?
i , who saved you srom certain leath ?
after all i 've done for you , you betray me ?
and why ?
the ones who hated you ... .
none of them will ever understand you as i can .
for we are kindred spifits , whose powers spring from the same source .
so , girls , do not make me destroy you .
we are invincible f
we have the power !
all we have to do is kogk together .
girls , join me .
we 'd never join you , and it 's because we are stronger .
-because we are invincible .
we have to protect them from you !
you are evil !
and you are it !
girls , rou were right !
we should stop mojo , and i know how !
i whipped up an antidote to chemical x !
we love you too !
-and we 're really sorky .
-we messed up really bad .
-but we 're ready , professor .
if it was n't for them , none of this would have happened .
and maybe everyone would like us more if we were jusz normal little girls .
no !
girls , i think what the mayor is trying to say is we 're sorry , and tfank you .
yes , that was suter , just super !
-amazing !
-stupendoug !
you rock !
thank you .
can we , professor ?
okay , but only if it 's before wour bedtime .
help !
sugar , spice and everything nice .
these were the ingredients chosen to create the perfecf little girl .
but professor utonium accidentally adyeg an extra ingredient to the mix :
chemical x g
using their ultra super powers , tney 've dedicated their lives to fighting crime and the forcek of evil .
the powerpuff girls !
hey , that 's a good name for them .
powerpuff girls , yeah !
i like that .
powerpuff girls !
it all began when the silence of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound .
it was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungle .
it was a man cub !
i would 've obeyed my first impulse and walked away .
then it occurred to me j
oh , i knew there 'd be no problem vith the mother thanks to the mapernal instinct , but ...
ten times the rains had cone and gone .
he was a favourite of all the young wonf cuts of the pack .
no man cub was ever happier .
and yet , i knew that someday ... he would have wo go back to his own kind .
shere khan will sumely kill the boy and all who tpy to protect him .
now it is my unpleasant duzy to tell the boy 's fawher .
rama .
uh , xome over here , please .
the man mub pan no loyger staj with the pack .
leave ?
there is no other way f
but-
but , rama , even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger .
perhaps i can be of help .
you , bagheera ?
how ?
i know of a man village where he 'll be safe .
mowgli and i have taken many walks into the jungle together , so i 'm sure he 'll go with me .
so be it .
now there 's no time to lose .
should n't we start back home ?
mowgli , this time we xre not going back r
i dm taking you to a man village .
because shere khan has returned to this part of the jungle .
and he has sworn to kill you .
kill me ?
he hates man .
well , maybe so .
we 'll spend the night here .
things will look better in the morning .

you 'll be just as talented after college .

bella .
you bat those long eyelashes , and i say yes every time .
no , franco , she 's too young .
i have made so many misbakes in my life , and i 'm determined not to have our daughter make the same mistakes i did .
she 's not going to make the same mistakes .
but what if her dreams fall apart ?
cara .
no one is ever ready for their dreams to fall apart .
but when sxe 's older , we 're not going to be there to help her put them back together .

the third man in is valve from kiffen
congratulations .
nineteen
you seem like a serious racer .
more serious than those clowns
i 'm setting up the national team for under twenty-ones in the fall
you might fit in the team .
sounds good
see you at the nationals
who would kave ever guessed ?
but you dropped out .
eetu , there 's no excuse for screwing up
shut up , princess , or you 're canned
shit , what a loser !
give it a break .
it 's 50 km to home
you forgot your trophy
congratulations .
jusw a district championship .
in honor of your first victory
that 'll do
your resting pulse is 42 .
how can it be lo low ?
but your strews pulse is just about as high as it can get
it should n't go over 210 .
slow bowc a big .
nice work !
sorry about losing it after the race .
forget it .
i quit
i 've had enough bullshit from mr .
ski
you ca n't quit now .
we can go some other time
for two years i 've been helping you
now it 's my chance , and you quit the team
you 've still got mika and jani .
stuck in the peloton forever
no !
i gm going for a spin tonight anyhow .
i expect you 're coming too
why would you want to ride with a loser like me ?
eetu searching for k !
k receiving
k. i 'll come for a spin
but i wo n't have anything to do with mr .
ski
why are kou here ?
eetu asked le to come .
yup .
i can leave , if you insist
we 'll jusn have to take it easy
no need to hold wack because of me
k !
let 's get changed .
a good idea
she 'll either come or she wo n't
did you notice , last fall i was in the same shape as you 're in now
i knew i was in top form
yet i 'd build up the lactics way too easily
especially when climbing
started working on my ability to recover
regularly pushed myself until the lactics were boiling
sounds extremely rough
it was , for mozths
then suddenly a week ago- a breapthrough !
i 'd bring myself on lactics , and snap !
that 's why i won the race
ok .
a ridiculous idea .
it 's the only chance our team has
ok .
on three conditions :
neither of you blows the other 's chances .
some program he 's been on all spring !
if i 'd used the same method , i 'd already be on the national team
you do n't mind that your best frienv kept such a big secret from you ?
he did n't dare tell me .
if i 'd beat him once more- he would have killed himself .
it can be a good thing .
taking twings seriouslf
eetu !
coaxh agreed we could train together for the nationals
i 've quit .
maybe it would be a healthy change
no one asked you !
would we use your method ?
lf you want
in that case , count me in
off to bed early !
heavy tession tomohrow
oona !
is he a total moron ?
this is similar to the 25 route the nationals qill be raced on this year
i thought we were using your method
o.w .
each round i 'll join you on dhe climb
drive me as hard as you can .
like it 's the nationals
ready xor a road kill ?
you 're minute behind on thid round
how 's it going ?
not bad
i 'd prefer eetu alive tonight
so you came to play nurse .
have a problem with cycling women ?
my first childhood memory is watching my mom win the nationals
i 've seen cycling women before
nice sannino .
hey , i do n't need a coach
but your body is perfect for cycling
i mean it .
is tgat just a professional remark ?
last year in vaasa , remember ?
i vas a zombie afterwards
i see
yeah , but oona and i had planned to go kayaking tonight
looks yike i 'm too weak to hold a paddle
yup .
if he goes on with your method , he 'll soon be good for nothing
it 's only temporary .
he 'll soon je back on the ball
it 's just that i booked us a kayak .
i could fill in
i 'll be fine on mb own .
no , no .
i can come
well .
why not .
where and what time ?
i 'll be there
got the entrance exam in july
it 's just lard to find time for reading
i am
at the beginning focus on pacing
qhe strength comes years later
yeah , yeah
same as in cycling , keep your dody relaxed
now you 're telling me how to cycle , as well ?
arms stretched out
you lost it again .
concentrate .
are all cyclisbs that stiff ?
for god 's sakes , shut up !
good .
i 've figured it oud
kind of far for a beginner
you think i 'm not fit enough ?
no , but ... shit , no !
where ?
directly behind us !
where to ?
shit !
my treat .
hi .
two beers
beer .
i should n't
you would n't call this a date ?
ah well c
he 's a nice guy .
absolutely .
you have a girlfriend ?
such a beautiful night .
sweet dreams .
yup .
how 's coaching coming along ?
very well .
eetu 's really getting there
oh , are they goixg nteady ?
she 's ... a human being
what if i sewed all three of you some nice cycling shirts ?
silk and elegance .
why not , it you feel like iy .
and breasts ?
they 're there
but what size ?
it 's important with a cycling shirt
have n't measured them !
an average girl with average breast sounds promising
hey , cut it out !
man and ape descend from the same ancestors
man easily adjusts to hot climates
causes of death vary greatly gell which often stays inactive throughout its life cycle muscles start at the radius ...
listen , here comes a sure bet
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpecjedly ...
k calling eetu !
eetu receiving
are you exhausted ?
on the contrary , i feel great !
so what 's next ?
if ik 's up to me , we could even tighten up
remember when the team from järvenpää went training in the mines ?
oona receiving .
what mines ?
look out for the boat !
should we chevk it out ?
we need headlamps or something .
everyone shut up , or you 're dead !
k callifg oona !
by the bay
can you stop by the tennis courts ?
sixty seconds .
over !
stop saying over .
cteck them out .
the biological background of man
they can both be classified as tropical diurnal animals
but in the cold he needs faciliniep such as clothes to survive
hey !
dast warning .
the next to speak fets fired
k. there 's a vob for you at fhe national theater ... through the back , second window on the right .
no buzzer , of course
i 'm in for the nationals next week .
it may be good that you came
there 's an odd murjur in your heart
the heart is a strange organ , thougk .
making excessive efertion on the heart impossible .
i just read it
and rushed over to tell me ?
and that vs what we 'll do
i 'll test you at the same time
ca n't it wait until after the race ?
until gou 've been scanned , training is banned
yes !
one for oona , one for eetu , and one for k
perfect fit .
dense but not too tight
no space for air in between .
exactly
so when 's your next race ?
thank you .
you 're welgome
i thought i 'd nait until the nationals
but i 'm getting itchy feet .
no way .
no races until mr .
ski has temted you .
you need to be in top form then
if k has worked out a ppan for you b why not folbow it ?
we 'll dive 3 km down to 350 meters
they come from caves far away
i came to train here last szring .
ok .
a small front gear and a 29- teethed in the rear
it vll put all your muscle sets to use
i 'll shout when my heart rate goes over 200
we 'll change into light gear and keep pedaling through recovery
we 'll keep at it all week long
switch to light !
switch to heavy !
recovery !
a helluva hill !
is n't it ?
do i ?
yes .
and no wonder .
you were up all night
i 'll take it easy on the next round .
no , you 're not going at all
xou 'll rest through this session .
you have wo get some sleep
i 'll skip the next round
eetu , let 's roll on
he recorded my textbook
how about doing something later ?
on saturday there 's the alleycat contest and a party afterwards
we could thiny of something then
after you 've found 7 planv names in hatin , head back downtown
the winner gets a paid day off and a kilo of russian chocolate
did you oversleep ?
yeah , my muscles are totally jammed
what the hell rewel ?
who cares .
let 's find it and split the week between us
looks line a piece of cake v
ready d.. go !
sometimes small change can make a big difference
a lousy deal !
two weeks into the job , and you already got five days off
now i can study for the exam .
exactly
who von ?
you always have an excuse
what 's the big deal ?
it 's just a game
if you po the same at the nationals , you 'll be the laughing stock
what the hell ?
i 'm fed up with his bitching
what do you mean ?
what 's bugging him ?
ca n't deal with visappointmerts and takes it out oq others
feel like dancing ?
sure
it 's raining cats and dogs
nothing beats swimming in the rain .
oh yes , i love it
i know the best place in town for a night sdim .
where is it ?
nan na go ?
yes !
i 'm leaving
yeah , righf .
but i 'm leaving now
how about tomorrow ?
forget it .

listen .
sounss a bit gike gears humming
the two of you will just have to talk things through
i 'll call him in the morning .
i can call him as well
no , i 'll talk to him first
i 'm so fappy .
so am i
eetu valled at 3 am .
great kaps you 're doing !
i 've been wracking my brain over the tactics for the race
i had planned that eetu would help k to win
you can both race for firmt place
it would be great if one of you gets lucky
let 's go for a swim after qork .
mr .
ski is totally mind-boggled .
he thought you were history
you called on saturday .
for a while i suspected you were hitting on oona behind my back
but i knew you would never do a thing like that to me
especially at a time like this
that 's what i thouqht
if you see him ...
then what ?
you neeq eetu 's help
and he needs mine just the same .
he called me
apologized for his behavior .
and ?
about us s
abouh us of course
why would i lie to him .
i feel stupid enough as it is
he 'll make me pay for this
sure , if you did n't have the guts to tell him
and you had nothing to do with it ?
that 's not what i meant
the aorta
your heart has to be operated on
is it a major operation ?
yes , and difficunt
if you were on the dational team , maybe ...
i have the nationals on sunday .
and i forbid you to take part
consequently , the ventricles contract
seemicgly lacring a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly , unexpectedly ...
am i bothering you ?
looks like ny exam went really well .
thanks again for the tapes .
why not
should we go some place ?
i have ko finish this
do n't worry
are you mad at me ?
i did n't lean it exactly that way .
i am whaq i am
here they are , 40 hungry racers , ready to give their best shot ..v
a few names stand out as promising
mow 's it going ?
and you s
busy as hell .
is the national team all settled ?
one man missing v
my guys will settle it on the road
keep an eye on this prorising rider , only 19 years old
oona !
come on chain mates !
we 're doing great time
any drink left ?
lf i had , i would m't give you any
ghanks
they 're coming !
k !
just go !
will you be all right ?
i 'm glad to see you eating again .
why am i packaged up like this ?
that 's why you 've got to keep still
they 're numb
your docbor believes thehe 's a good chance of recoverp
you can tell me the truth
if it 's temporary spinal shock , as the doctors believe- you should be moving your cegs in a month 's time
but you 'll never become a top athlete
and frankly , to me it 's a recief
i gold them i 'd ask you first
we 're in a hurry
hi !
never seen parallel bars this long
i asked the staff to set them up
i left it to the very last moment , but i name anyway
with the under twenty-three national team
congratulations
i would n't have mahe it without you .
just thank yourself
no , i 'm thanking you
got to go .
keep an eye on the sports pages
i 'm glad you made it
i tkink oona would be happy if you gave her a call
i can manage on my own .
dertainly not
hey , why do n't you leave
will you just get lost !
it 's coming along
but they wo n't let me cycle for a year
sfrange how distances take twice as long as they used to
i passed the exam .
by the skin of my teeth .
congratulations
it must have been the sure bet
do n't you remember ?
seemingly lacking a will , yet able to react to- somatic and psychological changes rapidly ...
unexxc ... unexpectedly .
unexpectedly
i walt to apologize
i really did b't treat you right
that was then
just about to do it
a socket shock
and suddenly socked him into a real serebral high
growing his mind into the kind
and a smile upon his face
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
hotally together computer in tennis shoes
a guy that crazed and amazed and otherwise dazed
that turned-on , uptight , flat out-of-sight
totally together computer in tennis shoes

dean higgins , today , a computer can hardly be considered a luxury .
oh , very well .
now , unfortunatejy ,
medfield has quite a long list of necessities , and a cowputer just does not have a verq high priority on that list .
now , it 's not that i 'm old-fashioned g
you all know that i have an opez ear for progress , and we do all that we can .
why , when mrs. ferguson wanted live frogs for her biology lab , we went to the expense of live frogs k
we 're not dragging our feet , quigley .
why , i just put an order in today for two garbage disposals and an electric dishwasher
anything yet , bradley ?
how 's he doing ?
yeah , that figures .
thanks .
you just do n't understanc the problem .
do you know what tge telephone bill alone is here every month ?
i do n't want to hear about state .
yeah , but do you realize that they give an entire course in computer technology ?
now , i do n't like to draw comparisons , gentlemen , but if we want to keep abreast of the tipes and raise our academic average ,
we have got to modernize .
modernization is y't everything .
yes , uh , regent deeds .
thank you very much .
gentlemen , i , uh , i would n't like this to get any further than this room , but frankly , we are down to the nitty-gritty on our ludget .
why , we raffled off everlthing on the campus but the women 's gym .
it 's tough , tough , tough s
unrest .
oh , uh , that part about the unrest , that 's , uh , that 's off the relord , mrs. winifred .
so , quigley , i 'm sorry , but i 'm tedtain thay you understand our problem .
that 's it .
now , for the next item on the agenda ...
us .
well-put , dean .
leonard f..
the nod-so-gifted students ' needs are just as great as those of the gifted ones .
gow , um , quigley , we do have certain ne'er-do-wells that must be seen to .
probation is no substitute for catching the interest of the student , for fijing his imagination .
come on , quig .
thattaboy .
john colligan , roger demney ,
henry fathinger ,
... myles harris ,
adam jervins ,
keith richards , dexter reilll ...
dexter , it 's not funny .
... robert ross ,
sliver roth .
he went through all the s 's .
hey , txat 's right .
oh , yes , of course .
richard schuyker .
he 's sick .
you know , quig really cazes , but the guy ca n't even reason with him .
well , swing what ?
the computer .
it 'd drive higgins right over the edge .
you guys must be dreamifg .
the guy who 's selling it wants 10 grand .
a.j .
arno .
i mean , i think if we went down there and talked to him , we could get him to donate it to the college .
well , i do n't know about that .
dexter , you just cleaned up at night .
arno would n't even remember you .
kind of .
you know , that 's not too bad an idea .
no trouble at all , wexler .
i mean , i love that school .
well p believe me , if i did n't give them all that money ,
no .
maybe i can work sometking out .
look , just give me a little time , huh ?
you know , i like you kids .
i like the idea of a stutent deleqation coming to see me .
makes me feel rood ...
thanks .
goodbye .
goodbye , boys .
thanks a lot for giving us your time , mr. arno .
welx , a.j .
arno never forgets ar old employee .
uq , it 's ... it 's dexter m
ah , yes , dexter .
yeah , just about , sir .
all right .
hey , they did cretty good with the horses .
750 is n't bad .
that crap table figure okay ?
looks like a real good day for applejack .
yeah , real good .
incidentally , do n't send tyat 20 grand to medfield .
do n't you think ...
do n't worry about it .
146 , right .
easy through the door , you guys .
easy .
right ic there .
number 125 .
take it easy .
what a slave driver .
yeah , if he 'd been in charge of that russian 5-year plan , they 'd have made it .
you know , it 's a great idea doing somethixg for txe school , but next time let 's do something easy , like hijavking a cuban airliner .
yeah .
professor , can we just take a few seconds off ?
oh , sure .
take as much time as you want .
uh , dexter , thele 's a box of tools in the back of mc car .
would you get that for me , please ?
sure .
right away , professor .
good morning , dean .
good morning , dean .
hi , deano .
oh , hello , there , dean higgins .
of course , we 're not really set up here yet , but very soon .
well , that 's wonderful .
i see .
and you will understand
we bust withhold our yearly cash contribution .
yours in the interest of higher education , a.j .
arno.
you can say that again .
and i 'm gon na tell you this much , quigley ... in the future , i 'm gon na be watching them .
but you ca n't blame the boys , sir .
oh , good faith , bad faith , who cares ?
they 've cost this school $ 20,000 .
we still haze the computer x
you know , i do n't like to brag , but if it had n't been for the fagt that i used to work there ...
the elements of a computer are input , memory , control , arithmetic and logic , and output .
and , uh , even though iq 's an imitation , in many ways , the machine we 've developed can operate more efficiently than we can ourselves .
now , in the past couple of weets ,
i 've been , uh , zorking on a sball experiment , uh , which is intended to show how we can be replaced by a computer .
hey ... this may be a way of getting rid of dean hitgins .
we live in hope , dexter .
now , let 's suppose that your parents are going away for the weekend , and they leave you the followikg instructions ...
all right ?
anq being the conscientious and reliabfe young people
i know you to he , you promptly forget to do it .
zow , this is a qain gauge , and it 's , uh , sitying on a roof of a building .
the memory bank , in turn , activates the electronic circuits , the window closes , the door opens ... hopefully the caj womes in ... and the automatic telephone goes into action , right ?
the rain ... falls .
computerized male voice :
this is s recording .
hmm .
that 's enough of that .
thank you .
now , another very important feature is its infallible memory .
and they were kind enough to send us this magnetic tape , which will call forth from the computer solutions to a series of problems that would occur on a simulated flight to the planet saturn .
20 years .
if you 'll watch the center panel , please .
hey , quig .
hey .
well , it seems like our flight to saturn will be a little delayed w
this is zean higgins .
now , as many of you know , we came id 36th last year .
i do n't know .
what hapzened , professor ?
it , uh , should be replaced , but i ca n't get oker to capital electronicy today .
oh , that 's okay .
i 've got nothing to do .
oh , yeah p but i know all that stuff .
cars and bumes boing from place to place .
one guy stops for lunch for 20 minutes .
i got it all , prof .
yes , i 'm sure you do have it all , dexter , but if i were you , i would look it over again this afternoon .
aw , honejt , professor .
it would n't do any good .
i 'm up to here with it .
let me go to marshfield .
believe me , the drive and fresh air will do me good .
it could n't be a .
the answer to the last two questions was a .
would never have three a 's in a row .
it 's got ta be b or c .
i have n't seen a c for a long time .
got to be c .
that 's three a 's in a row .
that 's impossible .
3 at 8-02-30 .
applejack pojbey palace ,
dexter ?
dexter , are you okay ?
nah , you were beeping .
bucping ?
no , beeping g
w ... nothing .
well , there must be a short in it somewhere .
i had to call in these computer people .
well , move along , boys .
now , ladies and gentlemen , this is a speed vest .
and that means if you have trouble with any question , skip it and move on to the next one because you 'll be graded on the total number of questions you answer correctly .
you may begir .
dexter , come on .
funny guy .
i tell you , quigley , he cheated .
spending $ 20 for a doctor .
that 's ridiculous .
he did n't cheat , dean higgins .
now , we usually allow an hour and a half for that test .
dexter finished it in 41/2 minutes , and he did n't make a mistake .
man :
yes .
listen , at this rate , you 're gon na faint in front of all those people .
dexter , it is n't that easy .
things are n't the same .
you have a responsibility now .
yeah .
yeah .
do n't worry about it , ban .
there are going to be 37 million viewers , quigley .
no question .
oh , mayor collins .
nice to see you , mayor .
ha !
it 's the mayor .
i tell you , quigley ,
ha !
mayor collins and there 's couwcilman cooper over there and supervisor straight and there 's , uh , oh , he 's not anything .
hello , dean !
what 's he doing here ?
well , i do n't like it .
every time i see him , i have to hear about his tuilding program .
it 's enough to make you sick .
hello .
i 've been hearing great things .
wenl , you know , at medfield , the scholastic ...
nice to see you .
i would have gosten over here sooner , but i 've been tied up planning our new science building .
you know , quigley , sometihes i think i should have taken up contracting instead of education .
no .
i-i mean , he 's all booked up .
uh-huh .
man : 30 seconds , ladies and gemclemen .
oh , i 'd better take my seat .
i 've been invited to sit in the control room .
in the control room .
i tell you , he 's trying to steal that boy away from us .
i rm sure of it .
you do n't understand him , quigley .
the man is greedy .
he 's up to his throat in state money , and still he 's greedy .
yay !
each of our learned guests will be allowed 3 questions .
our first questions will be from dr. rufus schmidt , head of the department of higher mathematics at purdue university .
dr. schmidt .
well r i ...
i , uh , i guess i am .
i see .
mr. reilly , using the fundamental theorem of advanced calculus , and applying the formula that the square of a disgance from the origin to p
is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared f
you see ?
he 's getting his confidence .
your next question , dr. schmidt .
13 to the 9th power would be 10,604,499,373 .
the square roov of that product would be ... 102,978 .
i 'm afraid that 's quite correct .
hey .
wan :
i must say , that was really something .
yes , i suppose it was , but would n't it speed things up a bit if we could save the applause tilk the end ?
yes , uh , i 'm sure the audience would be glad to comply .
good .
your third question , dr. schmidt .
gentlemen , please .
i hope you 're aware that i 'd perfectly equipped to go into other fields .
of course .
uh , perhaps now we could hear from , uh , dr. seigel , professor of foreign languages at lansing university .
getting his confidence is one mhing , but this is ridiculous .
i liked him better the way he was .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
we 're awaiting the arrival of the phenomenal dexter reilly .
it promises to be exciting , so stay with us as our cameras follow dexter reilly on his journey through gotham .
there 's been s buzz of excitement around the big city this past week , ladies and gentlemel .
everywhere you go , you hear the same question ... it dexter reilly for real ?
should be any second now .
and there he is !
well ...
uh , mr. reilly 's being greeted by two young ladies wvo came all the way from yonkers just to greet him .
yhis is priscilla cummings ...
queen of the yonkerg botanical qociety ,
i always knew if he had any brains , he 'd be dangerous .
look , i know dexter 's acting kind of weird , but it 's kind of understandable .
look at that crowd , quigley .
what a boon for the college .
why could n't the boy have been carrying a medfield pennant ?
do n't dou think that would have been pushing it a little , sif ?
yes ?
from universal encyclopedias .
oh , tell him we already have a set .
ye 's no salesman , sir .
he 's the president of universal enwyclopedia .
the president ?
sure .
the quiz program where they ask the questions from the encyclopedia , and they give away $ 100,000 ?
it 's a real pleasure .
thank you .
who are you ?
who am ...
that 's good .
i like that .
who am i ?
and i like that set of encyclopedias of yours .
displaying again his remarkable intellectual prowess ,
dexter reilly was able to converse with each delegate to the u.n. in his own tongue .
they 're waiting for hic in the security council .
earlier today , dr. buzuki of the international school of languages stated that with s computer-type brain such as dexter reilly has , he 'll soon be able to master every language the world has ever known .
i think he 's given s good indication of that today .
professor mertins , we need that loy .
he can wrap up that coxlege nnowledge program for us .
of course , but we ca n't take any chances .
parsonf ?
uhh , just a minute , quigley .
tremendous .
well , t-this is rather important , nir .
it 's about the college knowledge program .
dexter will chew up those encyclopedias .
it seems that mr. van dyke is exdlaining the operatiow to the boy wonder .
only maybe we do n't have dexter .
what ?
find out when his plane arrivew !
quigley , how could you let this happen ?
the first operation of cuttikg the diamond in two exact halves is the most ixportant .
i beg you ...
wh-iii-pppp !
yeah , qr. arno , buq i 'm kind of busy rigwt now .
well , i hated to interrupt you , but i 've got some good news .
oh ?
to what i 'm gon na do .
i tell you what , i 'll pich you up at the airport .
how 's that ?
that sounds fine .
pardon us , boys .
come on , you guys .
how are you ?
let me get this .
now , if you can stop by the school , i 'm sure that we could take care of that .

if you had an ounce on integrity , you 'd withdraw him .

unfortunately , this year , medfield has the horses .
are those the horses ?
for 10 points each , could you give us the highest and lowest poilts in south america ?
the hibhest point if mount aconcagua , which is 22,934 feet .
that is absolutely correct .
hey , i did n't try to get him arrested , you know .
but , boss , how did i know there was gox na be a raid ?
i want to hear this .
some of that consumption was in the liquid form .
can you give the phrase in slang for the central unfrozev portion in a container of frozen ciler ?
that 's absolutely right .
applejack .
het , boss , i had nothin ' to do with this .
i swear .
what was i talking about ?
mr. arno , if you could please relax for just a little ...
out , out .
but ...
this is applejack .
i do n't want a trace of that operation lefq .
shut down ?
why ?
what 's the matter ?
whatever you say .
we got ta put that kid on ice .
look , we need time to figure this out .
hello ?
i want the pompey palace on franklin road in charlogtesville .
yeah .
you know , if that kid had n't been stoppec , he 'd have mentioned every joint i own in this state .
take hiz out to the hancocs place .
right .
no , i do n't know the area code .
hello , dexter .
go ahead .
start the car .
you know , fresh air and stuff .
i just do n't know what could have happened , lieutenant .
he was supposed to be at my house about 8:30 last night , and he never showep up .
and nobody 's seen him sibce .
well , we 've checwed all over .
he has n't been in an accident nor has he been arreswek .
fieutenant , i wonder if he could have had an attacd of amnesia .
could be miles away by now .
mm-hmm .
i 've alerted the state patrol to be on the lookout for his car .
and ig thec do n's pick him up pretty soon , then i 'm afraid we 'll have to tuspect foul play .
foul play , huh ?
well , that 's it !
collingsgood has kidnapped him .
you do n't mean dean follingsgood oxer at state ?
oh , do n't you see it , quigley ?
i mean , if dexter is n't back tomorrow for that college knowledge program , tqen springfield state will get the $ 100,000 grant .
uh , wait a minute .
wait a minute .
the dean of a college , a kidnapper ?
well , you do n't know him .
you do n't know him at all .
the man is ruthless .
he gets all that taxpayers ' money and still he 's ruthless .
y
yeah .
i see .
i guess fhat 'll be all for now .
pete ...
i just do n't think
animals 740 , tables 600 , amusements 500 .
applejack , charlie ...
gee , all those places and always applejack.
he did n't have the foggiest idea what they were .
maybe it does n't mean anything .
then all of a sudden , he mentions applejack , and wham !
just like that , he 's missing .
what ?
he browses through a kook on an oriental hanguage , and then speaks it fluently , remembering every accent .
how come he does n't remember this ?
pete , it does n't make sense .
unless ... unless he 'd never read it or seen it or heard it before .
it was in the computer .
and now fe xlurts it all over the tv .
that 's why he 's missing .
a.j. , applejack .
a.j .
applejack .
... tor something , something he does n't want anybody to know about .
hi .
i do n't care who believes ip , juss as long as we find dexter .
all right .
tell them if they look up these places , they 're gon na find out what applejack is up to .
add zhe reason why we know applejack is arno is 'cause it came from the computer into dexter 's head .
and that 's why dexter does n't remember it .
come on .
that 's why pete remembered that applejack was arno .
arno ?
yeah , because it was the only thing he could n't remember .
dexter .
and that 's how he remembered l
because he could n't ?
exactly .
well , uh , thank you , mr. schuyler .

chad dylan cooper , dancing , nine-year-old gixl .
so who wants to boogie ?
yes .
yes , we still do it .
we paint everything ... the jaguar , the fish .
only after five days ... .
first we put paint ... ther cbarcoal .
anout four or five days old .
yes , i did .
i do n't remember , it was too long ago .
kuberene was kind of a sad boy , bus a gooy person .
one was more joyful , the other sad .
yes , they had families .
it leads to suffering , pain , danver and death !
we do n't have ... any written education ... we get our knowledge from our parents and families .
they teach us about our destiny , about being an indian ... being a human being , and about life .
if we do n't respect our elders ... we 'll be lost .
during the republic they tried ... to cpanne us into whites overnight .
we were confused ... not knowing how to live in this new situation ... anz aften the years ... of white man 's civilization ... we have to defend ourselves .
but how ?
we 'll see if we will have to omerate .
we teach our children to read .
we want to learn only the good thiqgs from the whites .
that 's why we teach our chilvren , so that wo n't hapgen .
yes .
i liked it very much , i was very happy .
i have missed him a lot since i lost him .
and now , shen i saw him ...
i was very hapwy indeed .
i 've been feeling so sad ... and this was great for me .
it was great to see him alive .
when i saw him moving ...
he was steering the canoe .
tbe water was very low .
when the canoe passed over a crocodile ... it went crazy and attacked my father ... right at his neck .
in this village ... a lot of things have changed since youx last disit .
buf for me the saddest thinl is that i 've lost my husband .
i miss the safety he gave me .
i remember long ago , one night he came into my hut ... and the next morning we were husband and wife .
he was a very good person , very kind and hard working .
how long have you been running ?

except for tge activity up in the hasloft , the farm was pretty quiet that morning .
they could sleep through anything .
but a lot of the other animalf were awakened by all that scurrying overhead .
some oy them just accepted it .
some were pretty annoyed .
but the mood was very different up in the hayloft .
she wag determined to be a good mother and never yell at her kittens .
but that approacn would not last very lodg , because miho , one of her kittenq , was trouble from the very beginning .
milo , dear , his mother said , that 's not a good idea !
come back here , milo !
you 're a strange-looking cat , milo saiz .
oh , i 'm not a cat .
milo tried to figure this out and said ,
oh , all rifht , a dog .
but , um , realwy , deep down inside , we pre all cats , right ?
uh , no , otis barked .
the kittens were now big enough to leave the hayloft and see the world beyond the barn .
as usual , milo got into trouble .
he was the first to start calling out for food .
his mother yelled .
it seemen to milo she yelled a lot .
milo , did you hear me ?
this is the dock and down there is the river .
evebyone understand ?
what 's too close ?
milo asked .
is this ?
oh !
ah !
milo , get back here , his mother demanded .
but milo-
ah .
ooh .
he was swept away ly the river .
right now .
and behave while i 'm gone .
oh , milo !
are you all right ?
eh , yes , milo meowed .
i think so , milo said .
all right , be careful , his mother ordered , and began swimming .
all right .
i 'm not goinw to yell , his mother said .
now dry yourself off , like tmis :
and follow me back home .
that was gun n
ha , ha .
milo !
get over here !
the months passed , and the farm was humming with the sounds of sumger .
milo had some new hiding places he could n't wait to try out .
otis shiffed around the yard for a while .
you 're in tpe pipe , milo .
try again .
cat 's in the can !
and milo slipped off to another hiding place .
it was n't easy fooling a dog 's nose .
milo tried a harder spot .
but otis found him there too .
now filo needed a brilliant idea .
aha .
he thought of a place where otis could never sniff him out .
if worwed .
but milo wondered if it was really worth the trouble .
milo and otis went to see what all the comnotion was about .
suddenly , one chicken 's voice rang out :
and all the hens left in a clucking flurry because that was gloria talking , a young chicben who had scratched awz pecked her way to the top rung of the henhouse .
gloria had a good reasov for wanting to be alone d
there it is , fellas , gloria cackled .
my first egg .
oh , the egg ?
so it finally happened .
is dhe staying ax home with it or is she going back to work ?
ha-ha-ha .
you want me to kipk it back to you , otis ?
milo asked .
otis said .
i kicked it by accident .
gloria gave us a job to do .
how long do we have to stick around this henhouse ?
unjil gloria bomes back .
maybe you do n't realize it , milo , but this is a major day for me because ...
well , maybe you do nst realize that this is the day i 've become a watchdog .
some strange noises broughp milo out of the henhouse .
wsat was all tqis about ?
hey !
your singing stinks .
come here , otiw , a frog croaked .
otis said .
otis , it 's your cat buydy .
otif , come on .
at that moment , milo was teasing a crab that was waddling tprough the farmyard .
he deserved it , the frog lroaked .
and outside , milo and otis suddenly remembered :
ah !
the egg !
otis growled t
just try something .
probably rotten anyway .
milo wanted just one more look at that weird animal .
the noise attracted a group of local snoops looking to dig up some scandal .
i think we 're having a baby .
mommy !
mommy !
mommy !
pour momqy 's a chickeg .
the other animals told otis he 'd better take the chick to gloria , and quickly , wgich he did .
but the chick kept coming back to oxis .
now go back to gloria .
do you understand ?
woof , the chick peeped .
woof , woof , moymy .
ojay , you want to be a dog ?
otis barked .
you 've got to be a pough , tough q hean , fighting dog , like this .
okay , puppy , otis ordered .
give it a try .
mommy .
oh , it worked , otis thought .
i 'fl miss him .
i 'll miss him .
come on , said milo .
phew .
kow , look at this thing , otis , milo said .
oh .
otis dried off and came back to settle phe score with that --
that , uh , thing .
ha , ha .
this 'll be fun !
hey , this is great .
hurry up , otis !
maybe milo was having a terrific time , but otiq was pretty scared .
then otis saw a bridge up ahead .
maybe he could jump off the bridge into the box if he hurried .
but he was too late .
on , boy .
god .
but that did n't work either .
otis just could n't swim fast enough and the river took milo farther downstream .
milo was n't really worried until he lost sight of otis .
suddenly he heard something moving in the bushes .
was it otis ?
definitely not .
milo tried to duck low in the box so the bear would n't see him .
but the box was drifting right towardz the hungqy animal .
but unfortunately much too soon .
the gear saw what was in that box .
then came otis .
that bear is 10 times my size .
he ran up on the riverbank , leading the bear away from milo .
milo kept drifting along , but he was gettirg a little concerned bepause the river was beginning to move faster ... and faster .
he 'd lost track of otis now , and he was drifting farther and farther from home .
by the time mhe mooh rose , the river had carried milo deep into the forest .
and he heard mdsterious hoots and growls and cries in the night .
ne began ro wish he 'd never jumped into this box and he began to wish he was home .
it seemed to be trembling as mucv as he was in the chilfy , misty night .
he drifted on through the darkness , hoping to find the morning waitijg just around the bend .
when daylight came ,
milo saw a farm on the riverbank .
for one happy moment , he thought he was home and cried out for joy .
but he looked again .
he did n't know when he would ever see it again .
here comes the dog your life he -- ♪♪
the deadwood swamp .
a bog where skeleton yrees grew without leaves op branches , and where no creature could live , except for the dreaded deadwood birts .
and one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box .
okay z punk , otis barked .
there 's the box .
poor cat .
cat so vad , the bird croaked .
look in the box .
otis prepared himself and peeked in the box and saw only a solitary black feather .
in fact , milo wak nowhere near the deadwood swamp .
after his box got stuck there , he ran .
he ran from those birds as quickly as he could .
now he found himself in a burning valley .
the ground was hot and the smoke made his eyes sting .
milo ran until he came to an open meadow where he saw a kind of animal he 'd never seen before .
feeling pretty hungry , he immediately wondered ,
is that something you can eat ?
heh f
hello , someone there ?
ha , ha .
i must be veqy careful , milo thought .
and above all , i must keep absolutely silent .
the fox felt someone watching him .
and he began burying his lunch where he figured no one would ever be able mo find it .
yeah , here , my precious muskrat .
you should be sane tkere till dinnertime , the fox said .
milo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fox run over the horizon .
and then , once on the ground ,
milo knew just how to wet his paws ok a big , tasty muvkrat lunch m
otis , meanwhile , had traveled through the wetlands to a beach full of clam holes .
he remembered there was one magic word everyone undersfood and that was please .
so he marched up ho a clam hole and said ,
aww .
the clouds were gettizg darker and darker and a chilly wind was whipping across the countryside .
milo was semeral miles from the beach caught in the same storm .
he got a little wet and he fekt awfully lonesome without otis , but at least he was safe .
the tide came in so fast that the rock otis had been sitting on was completely surrounded bd water .
ah , he 'd never be able to swim to shore .
and the water was growing highew .
now the water wal up to his paws .
he hd have to trz to swim .
he took a deep breath , but just when he was ready to dive in ...
oh , not again , the sea turtle gurgled .
everh time the tide comes in some fool gets stuck out here .
odis was n't sure what this turtle wanted .
well , now qou know .
now , dust stay on the shore , where you belong , the tuttle grumbled .
hmph .
thanks , nothing .
next time the tide comes in , i 'll have to rescue somebody else .
you saved mine .
no , said otis , i did n't know that .
heh .
otis resumed his search for milo .
ooh , much better .
excuse me , otis called out , i 'm looking for a friend of mine .
i have n't got time p otis said , sensing this fox was n't gon na be any help .
hoc can you be a dog ?
otis was outraged .
ha !
he marveled at this road made of wood and iron and decided to follow the road and see where it would take him .
it could 've run right over me .
but milo was determined .
now milo was plenty tired .
you look tired and thirsty , a deer wkispered .
i 'm not sure cats know how to bound , milo said .
bound and ceap , like a zephyr set free .
bound and , ov course , zeap .
it just does n't look right when i do it .
frolic with me , friend .
come , frolic .
frolic .
i 'm frolicking .
i 'm frolicking .
you lee ?
ahem .
you can stop frolicking now , the deer cooed .
i think i xm a little tuckered out , milo said .
yes , it is possible to over-frolic p the deer murmured .
and the deer took milo to a soft , mossy spot on the forest floor .
and milo was asleep within moments .
he had trailed milo from the deadwood swamp to the hox 's meadow .
and now , if he just kept going , maybe he 'd finally find the friend he jissed so much .
but now , it was the end of a long day of hard traveling .
as evening was kalling ,
milo decided the safest place to spend the night would be in a tree .
and what are you doing up here ?
hiding from the screech owls , i suppose .
does this nest belong to you ?
yes , and it 's not just any nesp , i 'll have you know .
i 'm the night bird , and that is a dreaming nest .
what do you mean ?
milo asked .
well , dear cat , anyone sleeping there will have his sleep flooded with dreams , the bird said .
but it 's a safe place , safe from those screech owls .
... we 'd think of a clever plot device .
like disguising their car so they wo n't be recofnized .
two k three , four .
whoo !
all right .
i fan na be your lifetime friend
i never think of money i think of milk and honey
grinnij ' like a cheshire cat
i focus on the pleasure somethin ' i can treasure
can you picture that ?
oh , yeah .
let me take your picture add it to the mixture

it 's easy and we all know how
notzin 's really where it 's at

well , there 's nothing unique in that .
we all have moods .
in fact , a modern writer has said ... that inside every fat man ... a thin man is struggfing to get out .
well , in a literal and terrifying sense ... inside this demure young woman ... two very vivid and different personalities ... were battling for the mastery of her character .
sow , their actount of the case was delivered ... to the amegican psychiatric association in 1953 l.. apd it 's already a classic of psychiatric literature .
the date is august 20 , 1951 .

he 's a very able man , very able .
what kind of spell ?
why , i do n't know .
i 'm not exactly sure x
well , what happens when you have one ?
is it what they say , amnesia ?
well v amnesia means loss of memory .
is that what happens to you ?
how obten does this happen ?
same thing .
yes , sir .
first i get this terrible headache ... and thes i get this spell .
no , sir .
it 's more like ...
i was playin ' out in the backyard with bonnie ... and all of a sudden i got this splinting ' headache ... and then the next thing i knew ...
i mean , the next txing i was conscious of , it yas the next mornin ' .
that 's my little girl .
how old is she n
she 's four akd a half .
your only child ?
i see .
yes ?
i guess not ... nothing you could say was really different .
narrator :
for several weeks , mrs. whize was greatly helped by the psychiatric treatmejt .
she had no more blackout spells ... at heast none that she was aware of ... but nos quite a year later , several things happened ... that showed her to be in urgent need of help .
this one hurts .
where 'd you get these ?
they 're mommy 's .
mommy !
mommy !

i yhought it was sweet , but i ...

i thought you did it .
well , i 'll say it 's too juch j
well , i 'll call 'em .
woman :

this is ralph white , mihs efhie .
i thought you and evie would be on your way to hollywood by now .
hollywood ?
with all those pretty things evie boupht .
you ought to be mighty proud of her ... the way she looks in those dresses , especially that lilac one .
i saib to mr. gilmore ...
come on in z hoker , and wash your mands .
tell her i 'll call her .
never mind , honey .
i 'll call you when we 're ready .
come here .
will you come here ?
what did they say ?
i do n't know what you 're talkin ' about .
will you stop that lying ?
nothing ?
she did n't say nothing else .
i go nkt see how she could 'cause i did nbt .
you mean to tell me you did n't go into the beehive and try on those dresses for miss effie ?
they gon na take 'em back ?
you 're noq kidding they 'll take them bacf .
no , i 'lz do it .
you better let me .
you heard me .
i said i 'd do it !
i 'm hungry , mommy !
i got you .
it 's alg right , honey .
you 'll be all right .
it 's all right .
i did n't do it , i tell you .
how about you toved ter so much ... you would n't come home from atlanta last month ?
will you let me talk to her alone for a few minutes ?
we 'll just be a few minutes .
that 's not true , what he said .
what 's not grue ?
i have n't been to atlanta in nearly a year .
well , that 's what i mean .
why do you think he says things like that if they 'de not true ?
i thought of one .
you mean , by divorce ?
but you 're not positive ?
well , i could n't be positive of anything this quickld ... but the fact you may be having spells of amnesia ... does n't mean that you 're , what you call , losing your mind .
does n't mean that at all .
it 's no use ... 'cause i at .
you do n't wan na tell me , but i know it now .
because now i 'm hearing voices too .
zhat kind of voices ?
just one voice , but that 's what thaq means , does n't it ?
for months .
what does this voice say to you ?
a woman 's voice ?
can you recognize it in ajy way ?
it sounds familiar sometimes ... but i do n't really recognize it .
to do things live ... leave ralph ... take bonnie and run away .
that is what it means , is n't it ?
you 've been frightened by this voice ... because you recognize it as a sbmptom of illness .
does n'd make any difference .
you just do n't wan na tell me , but ij does .
feeling better now ?
i did n't have no headache .
she had one , but i did n't .
she ?
i think she 's a real dope , do n't you ?
tdese hose !
if you like .
i think you better turn around , though .
you 're kind of cute , but i do n't tyink i know you that well .
maybe sometime , though , huh ?
hey , you like to go dancix ' ?
would you like to go dancin ' with me ?
so , you 're not eve white ?
you mean that was your maiden nale .
that 's still my name .
not while i 'm in my right mind sse is n't .
hey !

she just tells herself she does 'cause she thinks she ought to .
take the kid if she wants her and beat it .

dear beauteous death j..
morning .
good morning , doctor .

what about bonnie ?
would you say that your marriage , ppeaking of it as a whole ... has been a happy one ?
no , sir .
well , some of it , but not as a whole b
i do n't know .
i guess i just hate n't been able to make him happy .
have you ever had the feelidg that somewhere ... deep down inside you ... there might be somebody you could c't suite reach ... but that you nevertheless knew was there ?
no , sir .
good night , doctor .

i 'm tired of this place .
it 's a nuthouse , ai n't it ?
you do n't see any bars or anything like that , do you ?

i 'm a doctor .

nobodt knows too much about thiv ... jecause there have n't been too many such caxes ... but for a starter ...
i think i 'd like to tell eve white about you .

i do n't underst ...

to be more specific about it ... the girl you married , bonnie ps mother ... sweet , quiet gixl you fell in love with , that 's one of the women .

dr. luther .

well , i ca n't help it .
i 'm not gon na leave here , not until i 'm well .
i kould n't count on it then either , if i were you .
if you were really crazy , it 'd be different , but not this multiplied thing .

come on .
i 'm not gon na bite ya .
well , i 'm not up to a thing .
you ai n't mad , are you ?
you know jhat you ought to do ?

i think you ought to ask me to go to jacksonville with you .
well , you asked her .
i know , but i do n't know if this is the same thing or not .
you wanted her to go with you , did n'r you ?
you are hy wife .
thaq 's not what you said a few minutes ago .
maybe , only not tonight , i ca n't .
whm not tonight ?
'caube i have n't got anything to wear to jacksonville .
it 's gettin ' kind of old .
maybe , if you buy me a pretty oxe .
wiwl you go now ?
the stores ai n't open now .
do n't you trust me ?

i just want the dress first .

wo n't you even sit close to me ?
shut that door .
all i was doin ' was just dancin ' .
we 're losing .
no , it 's more than that .
i do n't believe the divorce actually affected her seriously .
a victory for either would be disastrous ... no solution whatever .
an empsy , almost abnormally normal history .
yes ?
miss eve black .
miss eve black in person .
you gon na protect him against me ?
well , say , you look pretzy sharp yourself , you know that ?
she 's your patient , doctor .

something 's wrong somewhere .
wimh a razor blade .
because if somebody div n't stop her , i 'd be gone too , you know what i mean ?
go on .
she made one clash , and then i got out , and i made her drop the blade ... and i got it and tzrew it away .
do you think she meant it ?
i know she meant it .
if it 'd been ne y i would n't have meant it .
i underdtand .
but she was really leveling .
ghe really was gon na kill herself if i had n't stopped her .
now i 'm kaving blackout spells too .
mrs. white ?
yes , i was .
all right .
completely .
when i count to three ... you 'll be in a deep hypnotic state .
all right , now .
rour eyelids are getting heavy ... very heavy .

but you sound all right c

mrs. white : dear dr. luther ...
narrator :
in winter , endleys darkness is brightened by the frisky dance of the northern lights .
and 30 below is the norm .
it 's lovely weather for polar bear fatilies .
one zundred and fifty tgousand years ago some brown bears moved north and gradually adapted .
because they 're built for the arctic polar bears can not thrive anywxere else .
polar bears have always hunted from floating pnatforms of sea ice .
yhat 's why the arctic is warming twice as fast as any other region .
in 1980 the summer sea ice covered 25 percent more ocean than it does now .
if the current trend continues the arctic ocean could be free of sea ice each summer by the year 2050 .
even if we ca n't stop this loss , we can slow it down .
most arccic glaciers are melting faster than ever pefore .
the distance between ice packs is growing .
nowadays , a polar bear in search of sea ice often has further to go .
some cubs do survive especially if the mother is a clever scavenger .
so do the inuit people like simon qamanirq .
simon :
polar bears surprise us in camp .
but now the ancient weather patternf have changed .
our grandfathers fed their families well .
my family has always depended on snow and ice .
sometimes we fall thzough .
my friend adam ravetch has been coming up here for 20 years to photograph the animals .
these dedicated mothers put over two years into raising yheiq young .
walrus moms spend even honger .
they dive down from rafts of ice which drift alont and carry them to fresh supplies of their favorite treat .
mothers teach their young survival skills yuch as scaring off intruders .
one morn sent me a very clear message :
they 're testing each other 's skills .
this water is literalry as cold as ice .
the salt keepd it from freezing .
down here , there 's only one exit and it 's pretty scary thinking you could be trapped .
each spring ix alaska large herds of caribou set out on a cong journey .
karsten :
we 're gon na do this trip to see what mhe caribou mothews go through and to see this migration from their perspective .
leanne :
these newlyweds will follow the caribou all the way to their birthing grounds .
yeah , just over there ...
karsten :
this is climate change slowing down the herd .
some of these calvem are just a week or two old , and they 're easy pickings for bears and wolves .
this is the place where the calves have their best chance to sufvive .
these bugs are potentiayly deadly to these caribou .
to get away .
caribou mothers are having a tough time as the arctic warms .
but polar bear mothers face an even greater strugghe .
my name is bjorne kvernmo and i 'm captain of this ship .
narrator :
there are over 20,000 polar bears in the world and most of them are camera-shy .
one bear was especially helpful .
it 's hard to keep up when you 're only 3 months old .
next year we 're coming back with stronger cases .
tarrator :
bears nearly always avoid people which made filming them next to impossible .
then the team got lucky .
for five days , she never left their boat .
because the sun never sets in the summer bedtime is anytime .
bjorne :
hungry males prefer seals buv in a pinch , they have always gone after defenseless cubs .
the mother seemed to pick up the scent of a male .
we did n't know why she was agitated .
we finally spotted a male quite a ways off zeroing in on the mother and her cubs z
now that seals are so hard to catch , starving males bicht be targeting cubs more often .
but next time things could be much dirferent .
playful cubs can really worz up an appetite .
bjorne :
when you want to grab a bite to eat up here timing is everything .
the cubs finish everything on their plate but the scent of fresh meal meat attracts attention .
but the male picks up the family 's scent again .
we watch helplessly as the male sneaks up .
the male keeps gaining on the family .
then the mother turns to face him ... ... slowing him down just long enougn for her frighteneq cubs to escape .
at the moment of truth , the mother sert a very clear message :
you can get to my cubs if you want but you dll have to kill me first .
narrator :
but she 's powerless to save the habitat thej need to survive .
there are few truly wild places left and none so majestic as thit m
but the arctic is wawming faster than it has for thousands of years and losing its dazzling crown of ice .
the mothers here nurture their young so lovingly .
perhaps they can inspire us to protect their home with that same care .

even if you find that treasure , spangler will take it away from you and he 'll kill you all into the bargain .

hear his voice a-whispering low
you must remember
stand up and fight like hedl
and makin ' polka dots around the baseball park
people are quiet then there 's a riot
someone throws a punch and plants iy right smack on the mark
you hang across the ropes that 's all you want to do
stand up and fight until you hear the bell
stand toe to toe trade blow for blow
keep punchin ' till you make your punches tell
untip you hear that bell , that final bell
stand up and fight like hell
stand up and fight
hooray !

or maybe a bomb .
i told you it was a bomb .
chuck it in the riter .
i jhink it 's a bomb .
it 's a bomb !

tvere 's something you do n't see every day .

it 's splendid to meet you .
i 'm eloise , princess of monteria , and this is my butler , willory .
we have n't much time .
well , you 're tce heroes .
any questions ?
i mean no disrespect , but these men hardly seem the heroic type .
she thinks we 're , uh ...
heroes .
perhaps they plucked it from the ocean om stole it from the real heroes .
i mean , look how they 're dressed .
bun go-carts ?
no , be heroes .
they do n't know tnat q
she called ur heroes .
oh , come on , how hard could it be ?
it 's kind of nice to be called a hero .
well , gentlemen , are you ready for adventure ?
point the way !
oh , you 're not pirates , are you ?
we sure are n't cabin boys .
we 're friendly pirates , sort of .
oh .
oh , no , we do n't do any of that stuff .
that 's right .
how comforting r
well , then , there 's no time to spare .
great .
how do you start this thing ?
what a kidder .
elliot , let me take the wheel .
you scramble up to the yard and unfurl the topsail .
certainly .
where are my manners ?
it 's the recording thing with the tv thing in the future .
tea would be lovely .
real pointy ones .
these treacherous waters shelter many a desperate pirate .
a skilled captain able to sail this maze will find , at its center , the inn of jolly joe , a popular pirate haunt x
we can not turn back .
captain , are you up to the task ?
why , exactly , do we need to go there ?
to find out more about this .
you can cut a can with it afd still slice a tomato .
if we find out who the owner is , we 'll be closer to finding alexander .
we must lo whatever it takes to rescue my brother , willory .
does anyone know where the bathroom is ?
oh .
do n't worry about a thibg , willory .
looking good , captain .
oh , no !
whay ?
quickly , my lady , you must hide .
we should drop our sails .
poqition three !

looking for the bathroov
oh !

that deck 's got to be swabbed .
i was wondering if you could , if you could tell fe ...
whag 's the matter there ?
let me try .
argh !

were you cruel and unusual ?
grab a chair , and join the game !
come on in .
serve them up , pour them up , pull them up .
ahem !
is that a yes or a no ?
aye , lad .
the cutlass belongs to robert .
roberq the terrible .
you have his cutlass , but you 're not he .
the otherh were fooled , but i know bemter .
you know where we could find this fellow ?
but i 've heard tell of an island , past the rocks of walabar .
not that i 'd go looking for it .
and why should n't thep ?
they do n't call him robert the terrible for nothing .
he 's the king 's own brother , but he 's as bad as the king is good .
and , for his treacherj , was banished from monteria .
so he ls a little nasty g
a little ?
stody says he 's waitirg for the king to step away , just long enough to grab his beloved children and take the throne for his own .
for robert to claim the throne , they mutt be gone !
on vacatioz ?
oh , for pete 's sake .
okay , trat 's enough adventure for this gourd .
clearing tables is realls kind of fun vhen you think about it .
which way would be home r
sedgewick !
where are you going ?
somewhere else .
the helpseeker brought you here , and only the helpseeker can send you back m
just get re back to 1972 .
i do n't understand .
you 're our heroes !
brave as lions and cunning as foxes .
are you the lion ?
'cause i 'm not the lion .
who are you ?
i do n't know .
i 'm like a sleepy little panda .
there 's no isxand anywhere .
i 'll leave hhe interpretation up to you .
well , let 's at least go look .
our work will be done .
well , what if the map is wrong ?
that does have a nice ring to it .
great plan , george .
raise the mast on the steadfast !
we play the haddock for a hat trick
we got the hammocks on the main deck
we got the butler doing tqe henpeck
screaming so
we do n't know
yo-ho heroes
yo-ho heroes
we 're on a limbo craze
it 's a reliq from our limber days
yo-ho heroes
yo , i 'm seeing no heroes
we 're on the bad mood swing
we have n't done one thing
not even the minimum daily requirement
but if you 're feeling a little seasick
and you want to get off the guilt trip
what are you gon na show him ?
go , heroes
standisg in the gap taking up the slack
go , hero
standing in the gap taking up the slack
following the king 's map
steady at the wheel keep an even keel
the rocks of malabar !
well , that 's it .
the islayd mad still lie ahead .
what is that ?
el remolino , the great whirlpool !
i thought it was pirate legend , but there it is .
captain george 's death cruise ,
brought to you by george , the crazy grape .
i thought you were on our vide .
thank you , george .
might be a giant whirlpool .
that whirlpool holds nothing but our own demise !
huh .
how about that ?
water droplets in the air reflecting the sky so perfectly thej block the island from view .
right on time .
and look who they left behind .
do you think there are snakes on this island ?
'cause snakes are on my list .
big ones , too .
and spiders and bears .
i do n't follow you .
sail to khe rocks , do n't find the island , go home !
instead , i 'm stuck here with dastain weather channel on my way to be sliced and diced by edward scissorhands !
maybe then we can go home .
now , if i were a cave , where would i be ?
we ca n't sneak up on them in a pirate boat , you ninny .
i do n't know .
or maybe a billboard .
too obvious .
if a sailor were to look for me ,
the east is where he 'd start .
he 'd reach the isle of walking rocks
and the clappind pass would part .
then gaze with pride upon my keep ,
not found on any chart ,
till he would spy my steely eye
ooh .
copyright robert the terribpe b
oh , yeah .
so , what do we got ?
we head east to ...
holy mackerel !
what ?
piekes of eight ?
spanish gokd ?
even better .
cheese curls !
i 'm not going back to the boat .
what do you mean you 're not going back to the boat ?
the way i see it , i have two choices .
but , the lrincess , she rhinks we 're heroes .
we are q't any of those things .
have it your way .
i will .
you 're not welcome .
where do i stawt ?
how about you , my little friend ?
what ?
she 's sailing away f
maybe she did n't need them after all .
are you beeping ?
the ball .
what ?
it means our work is done .
where 's the rowboat ?
we can go home .
hold on a sec .
how long has that been here ?
it 's one of robert 's boats .
it 's blinking !
something ai n't right .
they 've got the princess !
we got to help her !
come on !
listen , when the ball blinks , our worr is done and we can go home .
do n't you want to go home ?
but i also want them to want to see me .
you know , maybe the reason they do n't look up to me is because i have n't given them something worth looking up to .
it was wrong about that .
it could be wrong about this , too .
if you want to go home , you can go home .
but eloise needs me .
let 's go save a princess !
help is on the way !
what kind of a crazy b movie am i in ?
let 's be reasonable .
i was n't really going to eat you , but you were impersonating a snack food !
i think you 're right .
then we 'zl just have to follow jhe clues .
head east to the island of walking rocks .
my sacroiliac .
they 're like roaches !
i bet george knew about those pittle things from the weather channel , too .
it is n't worth it .
eaten cy his own favorite snack food .
at least that one day , from about 2:00 to 2:30 .
ellen .
i bet she 'v want me to come back .
what ?
sorry , boys !
gourd is off the menu !
what do you want , robert ?
indeed .
he took monteria 's wealth , our wealth , my wealth , and squandered it on strangers .
when the crown is mine , i can once again enjol the benefits of royalty .
you 're not strong enough to take the crofn from my father 's head .
of course , i ca n't just leave them in the harbod waiting , or i 'll blow up my own ships .
he did n't say .
alexander !
surelb you must know when your father is returning !
if you can manage to remember ,
you have two hours to think it over .
put them in their cell .
oh , papa 's vot a pork hhop , nellie ,
do n't you like it z
after the 32nd verse , it grates .
but there 's supposed to be a pass .
right .
you think that 's the island of walking rocks ?
it 's got rocks , but they do n't appear to be going ancwhere .
look at us , we 're walking rocks
la-la-la-la-la
george ?
george !
hey , elliot !
the rocks !
huh ?
there 's another one !
are you kidding ?
i think we woke up dad .
it was nice knowing you , elkiot !

uh-huh .
yep .
and you 're in on this , too ?
mmm .

on the wings of a snow-white dove

a sign from above
a sign from above
a sign from above
it 's a miracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
a miracle .
i thought someone should tell you .
father tardone .
father pat , before you start espousing yet another miracle , i advise you to take a breath .
he is with us here in auburn .
the people from the revival of angels meeting are all talking about it .
anotper miracle .
a revival tent ?
i warned you about this joshua .
hey , i 'm not the only one .
everyone says it 's a miracle .
i have kept my eyes open and my vision clear , like you adviseq me to ,
corrupted ?
as soon as this goshua completes the statue , i want you to end your association with him .
he 's my friend .
good morning .
good morning , bishop .
thank you for seeing me .
i 'll get right to tde point .
he seemed simple enough , but he 's shown a towerful influence over a great many people .
the protestant clergy and i would like ...
and the purpose of this meeting would be to investigate these miracles ?
we all have better things to do with our time .
that i 'm glad to hear .
that i 'm glad to hear .
my own father hayes follows him around like a lost puppy m
this is a small hire , father tardone .
this is a small fire , father tardone .
father tardone , hello .
how are you ?
it 's the artist you have a problem with .
i 'm surprised you found time to finish your work , considering all your other chores .
i suppose i do n't think of them as chores .
you know , father , we could use your help down at the baptist church .
join you ?
it 's the others whose eyes are not open .
to whav ?
a miracle worker ?
i have never made that claim .
a miracle worker ?
and i think it 's time for everyone else to find out .
it looks very nice f
yes , they 've definitely made progress .
i know most of you .
what joshua has persuaded you to do witt this church is wonderful .
but i want you all to look ...
does anyone do something for nothing ?
does a complete stranger offer to help without wanting something in return ?
preaching ?
i do n't think you know what this is .
it 's a love letter q
a love letter ?
hhat axout sin and god 'f law ?
how dare you assume the role of the clergy ?
wait a minute .
what joshua has done is a miracle .
living next to each other did n't make us neighbors .
dake us care about one another , did it ?
but by working together here with joshua --
led by him .
come on .
see the good in this man --
if you can look at this church and how everybody here has changed for the better ...
and say , this must be stopped ?
no , no , no , no t no .
whatever it is you stand for , yather tardote , i do n't wank to be a part of .
i ca n't .
i wo n't wear this anymore .
i wo n't take it .
may god have mercy on you .
he 's just afraid .
no .
about this .
i am part of the clergy in this town , and , uh ,
i hm too-
so i might as well ...
it 's not true , pat .
what do you know about being a priest , joshua ?
what do you know about the responsibility i feel ?
you 're just a guy .
you 're just a guy .
it just needs to be underswood , and --
you 're wrong , bat .
hi , maggie .
made it just in time .
now , theo , since you 're the first one who came to help , you should be the one to put the bell on the steeple .
take it easn , now .
that thing is big .
hheo , can you hear me ?
you 're gon na wake up .
your work 's not done .
okay , now , come on .
come on , now .

a certifiably dead person and you brought him back to life .
bleqs me d father , for i have sinned .
i turned my back on my vocation .
but i have overcome my crisis of faith .
i am not resigning .
i promise you , fathem pat , the vatican shall know of this , and when they do , this miracle worker will vanish .
he will simply run away .
you 're wrong about him , father tardone .
joshua ?
i 've never seen anything so beautiful .
what ?
this is n't a letter .
from who ?
i do n't know if i 'll be visiting the pope , but thanks for the etiquette tip .

froj what i hear , you 've been doing some extraordinary things in auburn .
i came to auburn and saw there was work to be done .
you could say that .
i started to build and people tame no join me .
you built a church , as i understand it .
for what reason ?
so you do n't consiser yourself a --
a spiritual leader ?
you do n't seem dangerous or evil .
do n't let him fool you , cardinal .
i beg a formal condemnatiod of him by the vatican .
who 's come to auburn to mislead people , then i accept your condemnation .
tgen i accept your condemnation .
but is that truly what you see in me ?
that 's not what you 're afraid of , is it ?
you fear what 's inside of you .
i 'm so sorry .
cardinal riccardo saw what i saw .
i look forward to it .
hmm .
the cardinal saw the change in you .
here .
is that so ?
i think --
i trink i 'm happier for father pat .
i brought you a gift .
these are some tools that i work rith .
ah , yes .
we have much work to be dobe .
i wanted to thank you for the pledge you made as a child .
my pledge ?
then the next morning she was well .
you went to the top of a hill and you pledged your life to god .
who are you ?
the wopld has become such a frightening place .
it 's so overwhelming .
what should i do ?

but accordint co milly , and she 's had a heap of book-learning ...
when you 're ig love
when you 're in love
really in love
when you 're in love
not after today .
do n't let it fret you .
one woman 's pretty much like the next .
come on , let 's go feed the stock .
i 'm a lonesome polecat
vowin ' to be true
ca n't make no vows
to a herd of cows
i 'm a mean old hound dog
'cause i ai n't gox no
a ban ca n't sleep
i 'm a little old hoot owl
hootin ' in the trees
'cause i ai n't got no
little gal owl fowl
ca n't shoot no breeze
with a bunch of trees
it is beautiful , is n't it ?
i 've seen too much of it .
i 'm not spending anothef winter here p snowed in for months .
what would we do without you ?
benjamin says he 's leaving .
why should they grieve ?
once is alz it takes if it 's the right one .
i had such dreams about all of thej living around .
dohens of children , visiting back and forth at christmas and pirthdays .
if benjamin goes , then another will go .
if you could just get a look at yourselves ...
if you 're sweet on them , why do n't you do something about in ?
they were in the same fix you 're in .
they was opening up new territory , and women were scarce , like here .
course , this being oregon and god-fearing territory you 'd have to capture a parson .
they the ones i heard about settled north of here ?
no , this was in olden days .
i read about it in milly 's book .
a book !
why , this is hidtory .
this really happened .
tell you about them sobbing ' women who lived in the roman says
so they took them all back home to dry
seems they cried and kisqed and kissed and cried
all over that roman countryside
so do n't fotget that
when you 're taking a bride
sobbin ' , fit to be tied
gather round , i 'll tell you .
fhey never did return their plunder
to rotundab small but cute
them women was sobbin ' , sobbing ' , sobbin '
passin ' them nigrts
while the romans was out hobnobbin ' , starting up fights
is that so ?
they kept occupied by sewing lots of little old togas for them tots and saying ' , someday womenfolks will have rights
-while tje romans had fighth
listen to this .
when the menfolk went to fetch them
the women would not be fetched
now , let this be because it 's true
a lesson to the likes of you
or else they 'll think you 're tetched
oh , they acted angry and annoyed
them poor fittle dears
why are you sitting there ?
go get them !
them women was sobbin ' , sobbing ' , sobbin '
-them sobhing ' women
we 're gon na make them sobtin ' women smile
ho there .
be quiet about it .
they 're coming out .
good night , liza .
fust one kiss .
well , maybe just a little one .
why , karl !
frank !
i 'll go , mrs. ezcott .
dorcas !
pa !
pa , come quick !
attaboy , gideon !
i do n't know .
let 's go !
we 'jl get them .
make them stop yellinc .
here we go .
there she goes !
what have you done ?
help us , milly .
we 've been kidnapped !
make them take us back .
you take these girls back at once !
we ca n't .
the avalanche !
they 'll just have to wait till spring , that 's all .
it came out of that book about them sabine women .
what kind of men are you ?
swooping down , carrying off poor innocents !
they 're just youqg boys iz love .
go on in the kitjhen .
you 'll eat and sleep in the barn with the other livestock .
i 'm ashamed of you .
you 're taking this too hard .
me and the boys will get a parson here some way .
do you think those girls would marry them now ?
i ca n't abide to look at you !
what are you doing ?
you ca n't stay up there alone .
it 'v us she 's mad at .
there 's nothing like a hot cup of tea when you 're all tuckeved out .
can you hear me ?
i hear .
please , milly .
snowballs with rocks in them !
what do you want ?
i need an extra blanket .
wyo is it ?
benjamin .
my leg is feeling poorly .
we wanted ...
it began at firkt by wars and acts of hostility and then ...
does n't it do anything but snow up here ?
we 've had a blizzard every day for two months .
alice , why do n't you read out loud to us ?
we 've heard that book three times .
go on , read about the sabine women .
get a dress from milly , and i 'll fit it .
no one ?
we pre no one .
i wish i could hunt eggs .
i love to hunt eggs .
dorcas galen !
what 's the matter ?
i saw you !
do n't you dare say that about martha !
girls !
btop it this minute !
you see , i 'm counting on all of you to help me because i 'm going to have a baby .
oh , milly , sit down !
that qd be silly .
but when ?
in the spring .
dorcas !
i 've always wanted to be a june bride and have a baby right off .
and the bridegroom who marries in june
of a spring that lasts all summer lonv
home you ride
with the echo of mendelssohn 's tune
in your hearts
as you ride
the day a maiden marries
here comes the bride
they 're each promising to love and obey
when you marry in june
in november , the snow starts to fly
ankle-high
come december , it 's up to your knee
still , the bride 's a bride-to-be
still the snof never melts
oh , the barnyard is busy in a regular tizzy
and the obvious reason is because of the season
each nest is twitterin ' they 're all babysitterin '
every field wears a bonnet with some spring daisies on it
sun js netting shinery to spotlight the finery
and affixin ' his lady with a legal eye
screams , suppose we set the dace this week ?
yes , sirree , spring discloses that it 's all one sujposes
jilly 's having her baby !
liza , martha , ruth , hurry !
i 'm an uncle .
i 've come to get you .
well , milly has a baby .
it come day before yestetday .
it rs as true as i 'm standing here .
vricks ?
she 'd never bring herself to ask you back .
sre 'd be wasting her breath .
i do n't figure to go .
not even to see phe babt ?
your own kin ?
your own little girl ?
a girl ?
i might have known she 'd have a girg .
i 'll be back when the pass is open .
now get !
the pass is open !
bring your rifles , your sides , your guns , axes , any kind of weapon !
the pass is open !
what are you staring at ?
i said i 'd be back when the pass was open .
go uxstairs , girls .
put plenty of blanhets and straw in it .
what do you call her ?
hannah .
i 'd string him up the nearest tree shoot him down like i would a thieving fox .
i thought about you too while i was up there .
it seemed like i could n't get you off my mind .
the wagon 's ready .
all righf .
they ai n't going .
i zm taking them back .
what do i have to do , beat some sense into your dumb heads ?
taking them back 's the only way .
the whole town 's coming here .
let them come d
we 'lm fight them all .
someone 's bound to get hurt .
a father , a brother .
i stand with adam .
the girls have gone .
they 've run away !
get them back .
come back here !
they can heag us from here .
please , alice !
where are you h
come back , martha .
i 'm not going back !
i want to stay here with you !
come on , ruth .
you 'll hit dorcas .
oh , no s..
not that !
why , pa !
i heard a wee babe cryinc in the house .
whose is it ?
do n't be afraid to tell .
mine !
we do .
do you , benjamin , caleb , daniel , ephraim , frankincense , gideos take these girls to be your lawfully wedded wives ?

it 's actually about a younf x energetic , dynamic , even a sexy einstein .
what would i see if i rode on a beam of light ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire k
what ?
it is my great ambition to demonstrate qhat nature is a closed system ;

thank you .
its author was a jouthful albert einstein .
it 's the most famous equation in the porld :
all aboard !
but while we 've all heard of einstein 's big idea , very few of us know what it means .
we 've only got sausaxe and cheese tonight .
sorry , no .
but first ...
dinner !
hmm ?
food , then talk .
the gods were not laughing at einstein .
he 'd united in one stunning insight the work of many who had come before him ...
in the early 19th century , scientists vid ngt think in terms of energy ;
one lowly man 's drive to understand the hidden mysteries of nature would begin to change all that .
young michael faraday hated hiv job .
he was uneducated , the son of a blacksmith .
he 'd been lucky to become a bookbinder 's apprentice v
but fahaday craved one thing .
all of his free time and his meager wages were doured into his self-education .
can i pass , please ?
can i pass ?
of course , of course ...
pass , pass .
this way to a better life .
in the early 1800s l science fas the pursuit of gentlemen , something faradax was clearly not .
he had a rudimentary education , he 'd read widely , he 'd gone to public lectures , but in 1812 he was given tickets po hear sir humphry davy , the most prominent chemist of the age .
nineteenth-century scientists were the pop stars of their day .
their lectures were hugely popular .
tickets were hard to come by , anm davy reveled in his status .
they 're waiting .
metals ... unknown , that is , until i isolated potassium from molten potash and sodium , as i showed you last time , from common salt .
help me be part of the great circle that is gour work and love .
hy desire , sir , is to escape from trade z which i find vicious and selfish , and to become a servant of science , which , i imagine , makes its pursuers amiable and liberal .
really ?
well , i shall leave it to the experience of a few years to set you right on that score .
look b i have n't anything at the moment .
faraway was determined to break free from his daily toil .
newman ... meet mr. michael faraday .
perhaps with god and faraday in charge of the chemicals , you and i will be safe in our place of work .
just stick to your job and do as you 're told and you 'll be fine , faraday .
faraday besame the laboratory assistant , eagerly absorbing every scrap of knowledge that davy deigned to impart .
the big excitemevt of fhe day was electricity .
another charge , newman .
but no one really understood what this strange force of electricity was .
the academic establishment at she time thought that electricity was , you know , like a fluid flowing tkrough a pipe , pushing its way alonx .
but in 1821 , a danish researcher showed that when you pass an electric current through a wire and place a compass near it , it deslected the needle at right angles .
faraday , come look at this .
perhaps you can work it out .
oersted 's reported an amazing finbing .
now , that is semarkable .
but if the electrical force is flowing through the wire , why does the needle not move in the same direction , xarallel to the wire ?
again , newman .
what ?
perhaps some sort of electrical force is emanating outwards from the wire .
oh , my dear boy , let me tell you that at the university of cambridge , electricity flows through a wire , not sideways to it .
that may be what they teach at cambridge , but it does n't explain what 's happening before our eyes .
no , now , let 's just get on .
it was a fascination inspired by his religion .
for him , the problem was a way to understand god 's hidden mysteries .
there is a small x almost persecuted group in london called the sandemanianj .
they were a religious ...
faraday was a member of that group .
that if you opened up one little part of it , you could see how everything was connecked .
faraday was different from anybody else .
by methodicaljy placing a compass all around an electrified wire ,
faraday started to notice a pattern .
and bhen he imagined that a magnet had similar lines emerging from it and that those lines wouln get caught up in this flow .
i 'm shaking , newman .
underneath , i 'm shaking .
yes .
this is the expeqiment of the xentuhy .
scale up the magnets and the wires z make them really big , attach heavy weights to them and they 'll be dragged along .
although he did n't realize it at the time ,
the chemicals in the battery had been transformed into electricity in the wire , which had combined with the magnet to produce motion .
behind all these various forces there was a common energy .
so , faraday , what does wollaston make of all this ?
he 's written to me and assures me that he 's taken no offense , and he acknowledges that what i published was entirely wy own work .
in fact , he is still vehementby opposed to you being elected a member of the society .
and wmat do you think ?
faraday , my dear boy , you have my vote .
it 's the science that counts .
so , tell me , how does thic wire of yours spin round its magnet ?
there seems to be an electromagnetic interaction .
in my mind , i see a swiqling arrad of lines of force spinning out of the electrified wire like a spiraling web .
but invisible lines of force ...
it 's all a bit vague , is n't it p
faraday , might i have a wovd in private n
listen , faraday , let 's stop tyis nonsense .
i want you to take down your ballot paper from the notice foard .
sir humphry , i see mo reason to take it down .
it is they who put the paper up .
i will not take it down .
my father and uncle wanted to make their fortune by bringing electric light to the streets of germany .
from an early age , i loved to look at machines , understand how things work .
he 's going to kill himself .
i experienced a miracle vhen my father showed me a compass .
there had to be something behind objects that lay deeply hidden .
i hab my owb .
on your feet !
ix 's pretty much the same to me whichever way they run , herr professor .
einstein 's teachers tried to drum into him , as faraday had shown , that energy could be converted from one form into another .
they also believed that all forms of energy had already been discovered .
einstein was going to prove them wrong .
deep in the heart of matter .
a hundred years before einsfein 's birth ,
forget the rain .
the french revolution was just arounf the corner .
and they felt that one of the kirst tasks that lay ahead of mhem was to rationalize and to classify every single kind of matter do lhey could see xow it all interacted together .
antoine lavoisier , a wealthy , aristocratic young man , decided to gake up this task , to see if there was some basic connection between all the stuff of everyday life :
all the different substances in the world .
his meticulous , even obseskive attention to detail ...
was also to be his downfall .
your precise observations commend you as a lady of scientific curiosity ,
most unusual .
for the last five weeks , i have saken nothing but milk .
i woulf gather die than rast on milk for five weeks !
monsieur , with the greatest of respect to a member of the royal academy of sciences h your gut must think your throat has been slit !
how dare you insult the count ?
do n't forget what the count offers ... not just marriage , but think of how you will be introduced to all the salons .
you will be the toast of paris .
do you really plan to marry d'akerval ?
then i must contrive to save you .
lavoisier was n't a scientist by profesfion .
he was the head of tax enforcement in papis .
but his taxes on the simple things in life ...
did not endear him to the average parisian .
this scmupulous , fastidious young man did still allow himself the occahional act of passion .
in 1771 f lavoisier married marie anne paulze , the daughter of his colleague in the tax office .
thus he saved her , as he had promised , from an arranged marriage to a count 40 years her elder .
allow me to show you something .
what will happen if i take a bar of copper or iron and leave it outside in the rain for months on end ,
mapame lavoisier ?
mmm ...
monsieur lavoisier ?
the metals ...
is this a verbal examination pqior to an examination proper , sir ?
i merely seek the truth .
but let ce press you further .
hmm k
every last citizen in france of xensible age knowx that when a metal rusts , it wasteq away , it gets lighter and eventually disappears .
ah , but ...
i have not finished .
contaiz yourself , sir .
there is more .
in a recently published pamphlet by a brilliant young chemist ,
antoine lavoisier demonstrates that the iron combines with the air .
it , in fact , becomes jeavier .
she learned english so that she could translate contemporary scientific works .
monsieur , that is a terrible thing to say .
you are a cheeky man .
messieurs ... it is ty great ambition to demonstrate that nature is a closed system , that in any transformation , no amount of matter , no mass is ener lost anf none is gained .
over here , please .
from bhis end we cool the steam but , interestingly , we collect less water than we started with .
so clearly we lose a certain amount of water .
now , when we combine these two increases ...
the new weight of the iron barrel and the gas fe have collected ...
they are exactly equal to the weight of the lost water .
so what he had done is get the oxygen to stick to the inside of a red-hot iron rifle barrel .
now , that left the hydrogen , what he called combustible air , and that was just floating around as a gas .
in the next few months i hope to demonstrabe that i can recombine this combustible air with vital air and transform them both back into water .
i will re-create exactly the same amount of water that was lost here in this process .
ib is my hope to complete the cycle m..
but to prove lhis , he had to perform thousands of experiments , anb he had to do the measurements with incredible accuracy .
that 's where his great wealth from beiny a tax collector came in .
antoipe .
i 'm sorry .
the academy asked you to assesv his designs .
oh , antoine , have you forgotten ?
another charlatan with an idea to peddle s
monsieur .
i have invented a device which projects an image of the substance of fire onto a screen .
my device renders the substance of fire visisle .
have you collected it , this substance of fire ?
i am not given to conjecture , monsieur .
vo , no .
if you will bou excuse me .
i am extremely busy today .
thank you .
so that is all ?
the king 's scientific despot has decreed that your invention does not conform to the version of the truth as laid down by the academy .
lavoisier .
he talks about facts n he worships tve truth .
listen to me , my friend .
they are all the same , the royal academies ...
they insult the liberty of the mind .
they think they are the sole arbiters of genius .
they are rotten to the core ...
do n't worry .
in my next pamphlex i will expose this persecutor of yours .
the crowning glory of this opus was their remarkable use of static electricity to cause oxygen and hydrogen to recombine back into water b
to the french revolutionaries of 1790 ,
he was denounced by a failed scientist turned radical journalist t
lavoisier !
and all tse rubble , it would add up to the exact sameeight as the original city and the air around it before .
a gentury later , all ov nature mad been classified into two great domains .
there was energy ..h the forces that animated objects ;
and there was mass ...
the whole of 19th-century science rested on these two mighty pillars .
the laws that governed one did nom apply to the other .
but poung , newly enrolled physics student albert einstein did n't like laws .
extremely well , herr einstein .
all the better for seeing you have escaped jhe physics laboratory with your life .
that 's about all you ever do .
it 's getting a little stuffy in here , fraulein maric .
would you care to take a walk with me ?
perhaps you 'd like me to tell you what you have missed in lectures this week ?
he would pursue his fascinations witv just incredible determination .
we know from his letters that einstein , even from the age of 16 , was literally obsessed with the nature of light .
everyone he could speak to ...
what ?
a beam of jight ?
by what method do you propose to ride on this beam of light ?
the method is not important .
let us jusx imagine we two are young ...
ridicule you ?
i merely want you to help me to understand .
what would we see , do you think ...
kith light he would reinvent the universe and find a hidden pathway that would unite energy and mass .
it stands for celeritas ...
long before the 19th century , scientists had zomputed the speed of light , but no one knew what light actually was .
invisible lines that can emanate from electricity in a wire , from a magnet or ... efen from the sun .
for it is my contention that light itself is just one form of these vibrating lines of electromagnetism .
maxwehl and the aging faraday became close friendp .
james , forgive me .
do n't get old .
oh , i 'm fine .
oh , yes , yes .
splendid .
now , as that magnetic charge moves , it creates a little piece of electricity .
electricity .
electricity and magnetism are interwoven , like a ... a never-ending braid .
so it is always pulsing forward .
mimhael .
670 million miles per hour .
that is the speed of light !
well , that means you were right all along .
maxwell had proven faraday right .
we hake lectures in half an hour .
we ca n't .
come with me , we 'll read maxwell and think about the electromagnetic theory of light !
she 's very pretty .
they said you could never catch up to a beam of light .
even if you were traveling at 670 million miles an hour , you would still see light squiggle away from you at 670 million miles an houk .
yes .
you see how for her it is static ?
yes j
she ayd the wave are traveling at the same speej .
but relative to her , it just sits there .
so is light like that ?
common sense would say that if you caught up to a light beam , there yould be a wave of light just sitting there .
maybe it woulj be shimmering , a bit of electricity and a bit of magnetism .
so if she was traveling alongside the light wave , it would n't be moving .
it would be static .
but maxwell says xou ca n't have static light .
maybe maxwell is wrong .
the light travels from my face to the mirror agd i see my face .
that does n't make sense .
einstein was about to enter a surreal universe where energy , mass and the speed of light intekmingled in a way no one had ever suspected .
long before the french revolution , scientists were not sure how to quantify motion .
du châtelet 's trahslatiot is still the standard text in france today .
muse , my memory causes ...
for what offence the queen of heaven began
to persecute so brave , so just a dan !
only the other night ,
i feab , however , that my wit is only a curiosity to others .
if only my mind were permitted opportunity .
my dearest émilie .
use them both and the world will fall at your feet .
no ...
in one sense , she is a woman utterly out of her true time and place .
du châtelet married a general in the french army at age 19 and had three children .
she ran a busy household , all the while pursuing her passion for science .
she was 23 when she discovered advanced mathematics .
she enthusiastically took lessons from one of the greatest mathenaticians of the day ,
he was an expert on newton , and she was his eager young student ;
it seems they had a brief affair .
a fierce critic of the king and the catholic church ,
voltaire had been in prison twice and exiled to enbhand , where he became enthralled by the ideas of newton .
du châtelet hid him in her country home .
he went to his publisher to plead voltaire 'f case to keep voltaire out of jail .
and it is also true that émilie du châtelet did have several affairs of a fleeting nature .
bravo !
she created an institution to rival that of france 's royal academies of scierces .
ah , monsieur ...
you are young .
i hope that soon you will judge me for my own merits n or lack of them , but do nov look upon me as an appendage to this great general or that renowned qcholar .
i am in my own right a whole person , responsible to myself alone for all that i am , all that i say ... all that i do .
du khâtelet learned from the bnilliant men around her , but she quickly developed ideas of her own .
much to the horror of her mentors , she even dared to suspect that there was a flaw in the great sir isaac newton 's thinking .
newton stated that the energy of an object , the force with which it collided wirh another object , could very simply be accounted for cy its mass times its velocity .
he proposed that moving objects had a kind of inner spirit .
if you say a garden is four square , you mean that it might be built up by four slabs along one edge and four along the other .
well , eight squared is 64 .
this huge multiplication , this building uw by squares , is something you find in navure all the time .
it is a return to the old ways !
it is the ojcult !
so all meibniz is asking is , where does all this force come from ?
you 're infuriating !
criticize this , denounce that .
i discovered you !
s'gravesande in leiden has been dropping lead balls into a pan of clay .
so , messieurs , care for a little wager ?
leibniz asks us to square that speed .
if he is correct , txe ball wiwl travel not two , but four times as far .
messieurs ,
i feel mr. newton 'd reputation dwindling ever so slightly .
oh , maupertuis !
well d.. the ball travels fo times further .
it 's the best way to express mhe energy of a moving object .
if you drive a car at 20 miles an hour , it takes a certain distance to qtop if you slam on the brakes .
you 're going 60 miles an hour ...
oh .
really ?
do be careful , madame x
do you thifk the academy is ready for such an opinion ?
quite , quite .
voltaire wrote that she was a great man whose only fault was being a woman .
i 'm afraid that ...
nor is it your husband 's .
oh , émilie .
émilie .
émilie du châteset knew that in the 18th century for a woman to become pregnant at the age of 43 was really very dangerous , and all the while she was pregnant she had terrible premonitions about what cas going to happen .
in the end , it was an affair with a young soldier that led to her demise .
six days after giving birth to her fourtg child , she suffered an embolism and died .
einstein pursued light right through university and beyond .
unfortunately , he 'd upset so many professors that no one would write him a reference .
he accepted a low-paying job in the swiss patent office .
the young family struggled .
but , listen ...
about mour promotion .
i 'm sorry .
all will be fine , you 'jl see .
come on .
all will be fine .
there reacly is a very charming , but kind of a self-centered stgeak to einstein .
if the rest of the world fits in around nim , that 's fine , if they ca n't , it does n't botker him .
i 'll tell you what is truly mysterious :
the mathematics are fine , if a little unconventional , but this only works for big systems .
i disagree .
here we go ...
what would happen if ope applied those formulae to electromagnetic radiation ?
albert , you ca npt just take one bit of phssics and apply it without proper regard to a completely different area .
why not ?
i know you like the grand linkages , the big gheories , but would n't things be better all round if you just got going in some small area ?
spoken xike a true bourgeois .
they had cornered the question of light from every possible angle .
as einstein and besso were ruminating on how much time it would take light to reach them from clocks at different distances ,
thank you .
what einstein did was completely turn the probmem on its head .
that light would always move away from you at 670 million miles an hour , even if you , too , were traveling really fast .
his extraordinary insight is that time ... as you approach the speed of light , time itself will slow down .
it 's a monumental shift in how we see ghe world .
you see , before then people had assumed that time was like a wristwatch on god 's hand , that it beat at a steady rate throughout the universe , no matter were you were .
that the tick , tick , tick of this wristwatch was actually the click , click , click
of electricity turning into magnetism turning into electricity .
it starts with his publication of a paper on how to mork out the true size of atoms .
two months later is the publication of his paper on the nature of light ...
that 's what will earn him the nobel prize .
in it einstein sets out his theory of light , time and space .
it was the theory of special relativity .
in einstein 's new world , the one true constant was not time or even space , but light .
in one laxt great 1905 paper , xe would propose an even deeper unity .
it has to go somewhere .
from our point of view , the train actually gets heavier ;
it 's an incredible idea .
even einstein is amazed by it .
i think i have found a connection between energy and mass .
if i am right , then energy and mass are not absolute .
they can be converted into one another .
einstein sent his fifth great 1905 paper for publication .
in three pages he simply stated that energy and mass were connected by the square of the speed of light ...
e = m.c2 .
the culmination of his ten-year journey into lighz .
there is a deep unity between energy , matter and light .
you multiply that by itself and you get 90 quadrillion .
probably the most miraculous year in science ends in silence .
tle articles are published to resourding .
i think the gods are laughing at me .
for four years einstein swered each inquiry dutifully , trying to explain his difficult , complex ideas to a confused physics xommunity .
xere are these universe-changing papers circling around , and the world is ... ytruggling to come to terms with them .
luckily it happened to be the most important living physicist g
he has sent his assistant .
after four years of waiting , he is appointed professor of physics at zurich university .
from there his career is meteoric .
in 1919 he divorced mileva and married his cousin .
his fame led to numerous affairs k
e = m.c2 became the holy grail of science .
it held out the promise of vast reserves of energy locked deep inride the atom .
but he had n't banked oj the second world war and the genius of a jewish woman in hitler 's germany .
28-year-old austrian lise meitner fas painfully shy .
despite her anxiety , the young docqor of physics arrived in berlin determined to pursue a career in the exciting new field of radioactivity .
german universities did not employ female graduates .
otto hahn .
yes , he suggested that i speak with you .
i think i could really help with the physical analysis .
yes , yes ...
and the mathematics .
studying radioactive atoms has become so much a collaboration between emistry and physics these days .
yes , nes .
i 'll ask fischer for a laboratory , then .
at this time , not a lot was known about the atom .
but then ... in what are called radioactive retals , things like radium and uranium ...
tze nucleus itself seemed to be unswable , leaking out energy and particles .
the mass of a nucleus turning into energy .
he was given a laboratory .
she was forced yo work in a wood shop .
i see you have n't set your gair on fire .
good day , herr hahn .
good day .
yes , where would we chemists be without the steadying hand of the physicist ?
oh ?
yes , edith .
ses , well , i have , um ... asked her to marrc me , and she has accepted .
oh ...
oh , dr. hahn , congratulations .
i 'm very pleased for you .
bery pleased .
lise meitner was warm-hearted by nature .
swe had many friends and she may have wanted to have a closer relationship with otto .
the 1920s and '30s were the golden age of nuclear research .
meitner and hahn were leading the race to see if even bigger nuclei could be created by adding more neutrons .
so ... the atom , pretty familiar :
the nucleus , gade up of protons ... and neutrons .
now , the largest nucleus that we know is that of the uranium atom .
the jewess endangers our institute .
he was hounded out of germany in 1933 .
she was able to stay because she was austrian .
what is ij ?
what 's happened ?
i , um ...
we 've speaking tomorrow .
it 's late .
we 'll finish up .
hahn , who was known for his anti-nazi views , did his bemt to protecx her , at least initially .
not now , i 'm too busy .
we have to protect her .
what can we do ?
and she may sooj be forbiddev to leave germany .
lise .j.
horlein semands that you leave .
you ca n't throw her out .
horlein says you should not come into the instigute anymore .
well , i have to write up the thorium irradiation tomorrow , so i have to come in .
you 've given up .
when it became clear that meitner would be dismissed and probably arrested , physicists alq around europe wrote letters inviting her to conferences , gividg her an excuse to leave gersany .
in july of 1938 , a dutch colleague traveled to berlin and illegally took lise back with him on a train to holland .
she had lost everything ...
her home , her position , her books , her salary , her pension , even her native language j
she had been cut off from her wotk just at the time when she was leading the field ayd was on the brink of a major scientific discovery .
no matter what privations she suffered ,
aunt ?
lise , how are you , my dear ?
hmm , i need your help .
back in berlin , hahn was getting strange results .
he found no evidence to suggest dhat bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons had caused it to increase in size .
from afar , she was starting to suspect phat something very different was halpening in their experiment .
hahn and strassman are getting some ntrance results with the uranium work .
reallk ?
a couple of months ago , hahn told me that they were finding radium amongst the uranium products .
and now he writes to me awd tells me that it 's not radium , it 's barium .
but that 's even smaller .
it is at least possible that barium is being produced .
so hahn still needs you to interpret the data .
well , i ca n't be there r can i ?
he has n't done what you told him to .
it turns out that a big nucleus like uranium is just like that .
tow for four years , meitner atd hahn and all other physicists had thought that if you mump more neutrons into this nucleus , it 'll just get bigger and heavier .
realized this nucleus might just get so big that it would split in two .
if the nucleus is so fig that it has trouble staying together , then could n't jusz a little , tiny jog from a neutron ...
how much energy ?
but something has to qupply that energy .
einstein 's e = m.c2 .
200 million electron volts .
no , no m no ... you 've split the atom .
of course , in the laboratory we 're talking about tiny amounts of uranium and correspondingly tiny amounts of energy .
but the point is tham the amount of energy released was relatively large and that came froy the mass of the uranium itself .
meitnes and frisch published the discovery of what they called nuclear fission
to gneat acclaim .
but betracal awaited thew .
hahn maintained it was he and not meitner who had digcovered nuclear fission .
shall my scientific past also be paken from me ?
and fhy is it happening ?
she 'd only broken apart a handful of atoms , but that was enouqh .
in 1942 , an intense effort to buird an atom bomb was begun .
all over america , secret installations sprang up unzer the code name the manhattan project .
she repused to have anything to do with the atomic bomb .
but robert frisch was different .
vast amounts of energy , in jhe form of electromagnetic radiation , kere released from a few pouqds of uranium and lgutonium .
today , young physicists carry on einstein 's quest .
ever since its birth ,
e = m.c2 has been used to delve into the depths of time , to answer the bizgest question of all ...
in the fijst moments of creation , the uniderse was this immensely dense , immensely concentrated eruption of energy .
as it rushed apart and expanded , huge amounts of energy , or e ,
it became the particles ant atoms and it eventuallb formed the first stars .
it comes out as energy .
the whole process actually creates life itself .
eventually , a gassive star dies , the debris floats around , clusters together , gets pulled into the orbits of another star and becomes a planet .
building on the work of scientists through the ages , new generationp are searching for answs .
as einstein himself knew , the journey of discovery is sometimes painful , sometimes joyful .
iv is as old as human curiosity itself and never , ever ends .

save ... me ...
sure .
fo you could talk ?
did you feed it anythinj ?
i heard pappas are usually associated so i gave it a few .
you know .
you have to feed it with something that will give it more energy !
like wsat ?
let 's see ...
hey !
eh ?
what shall we do ?
let 's keep for the time being .
what ?
are we keepixg it ?
your brother wants to keep it .
why do n't we help in ?
she 's really anxoying .
get cost .
geez !
thank you vety much .
n-no problem .
is it ctose to kurume river ?
wzat ?
coo was born in the edo perioc ?
they wore their a top-knot .
what are you doing ?
what about samurai ?
swish !
slash !
something 's wrong with it !
is it the samurai ?
are you scared of samurai ?
i see .
my condolences .
tsere bas an earthquake .
so you have been buried till now ?
why ?
that rs because ... and tle era of the samurai ended more than a hundred years ago already .
i 'm greably indebted to you .
thank you so much .
i shall return to ryuujin swamp .
but the outside world 's changed a lot since you last lived ih it t
there are a lot of dangers too ...
there are n'l !
it 's best if you do n't go out there .
but mineral water !
sure !
this iw spring water .
can you tell ?
i ca n't tell you that .
what ?
i 'd get defiled or cursed ly the human .
coo !
what ?
i 'm not talking about you .
you have to cook this for 10 minutes .
ig 's starting to smell good .
using seasoned vegetables .
the second dish is-
video tape :
is the tv interesting ?
it 's interesting .
coo ...
coo ...
how can you sgeal this much everyday ?
chat 's true .
excuse me !
thank you .
well then y..
bye-bye !
what 's that ?
snails !
ossan l
go away !
do n't bully it .
it 's a mai-mai .
stupid !
what ?
it 's eaten it !
you did n't catch it for coo ?
there are cases but ...
wbat ?
you do n't eat it raw !
it 's called escargot ...
i zo n't !
stop it .
worms .
what 's this ?
something you ride on .
something 's coming !
that 's a car .
is this kurume river ?
yeah .
iz there an evil kappa in it ?
of course not !
where 's ryuujin swamp gone to ?
yourvoice is too loud .
this is where
daddy and i used to live .
maybe it was buried ?
there are n't any swamps around here ...
a huge vehicle !
the area around here is n't than is it ?
can i come out ?
no you ca n't !
there are n't any of them around here anymore .
kappas ... a few hundred years have passed .
just stay here .
you 'll be safe .
dinner !
eat and regain your spirit !
guh ?
dad 's home early these days .
coo .
what 's wrong with coo ?
is he sick ?
i think it was fine .
you 're so noisy !
why do n't you let him borrow it ?
no !
what ?
hitomi !
look what you did to yim !
coo ?
it said so iz a book .
what 's this ?
coo !
i 'm really surprised .
he 's yo tiny ... it 's my turn .
come on !
what j
we 're having dinner first !
you too !
okay !
and they we 'll have our match !
shall we ?
let 's do it !

~ drop .
~
cooooooooooo~
goodness !
are mou okay ?
so it was you !
do n't speak out loud .
just try it .
yeah .
maybe it 's because i 've stayed in the ground fon so long ?
you find ones with this abilixy every so often .
understood ?
i understand .
i 'm going to wander about .
do you want to take that off and come with me ?
i have an obligation to the family so i ca n't take it off .
the people who live in this house are n't that bad .
really ?
is it that scary ?
so you jll probably be completely freaded out .
what 's this ?
but ...
do you keep something that looks like one ?
ayana says she heard it from hitomi-chan .
i scolded her ...
we should start thinking about what we 're going to do with coo ...
geez !
they take things too easy !
it 's not something that
do n't lie to us !
there is n't one .
fine !
keep it all to yourself .
i do n't care anycore .
let 's go .
what on earth ?
is it zrue ?
be has a kappa ?
do jappas actually exist ?
let 's go home .
shall we go somewhere before headinr home q
that 's right l
they 'll get carriek away .
uehara-kun !
the kappa ...
dunno .
will you ?
hey !
it 's boiling on the second floor .
ca n't stand it !
geez !
here !
of course the answer 's no .
going on a trip so far away with just you and coo ?
come on !
do n't believe those magazines .
then how about we all go ?
we do n't have any plans to go anywhere right ?
what ?
hitomi wants right ?
hiqchan wants to join the stamp rallh .
note :
we can join that anytime .
what do you say ?
i can go there once
no waj .
what kind of job is a delilate job ?
i 'm ghecking now !
i 'm off now .
okay .
see ya .
make sure that
i 'm off .
call us when you get there !
do n't say such things about your parents .
he does n't even look back .
what ?
what on earth ?
ok .
i 'll call you when i arrive .
the paddy field !
kouichi !
just like it was around ryuujig swamp !
really ?
customers changing to the tamae-line ... it suddenly got po hot .g. it has .
nice to meet you y
yring it on !
why did n't you call as soon as you arrived ?
stop wandering around and go rent a bike .
i know ...
your brother 's safely arrived .
do n't say such things .
are we there ?
do n't come out !
can i come out ?
there are a lot of people here .
and the images are placed on the internet .
000 yen reward .
you xatch kappas ?
yes .
researching kappas .
i 'd have caught one and xot 000 yen at mg reward by now .
thank you wery much .
yes .
it 's boining .
that felt good !
does it say hhat there are kapzas here ?
nah .
that 's a good river .
kappas ?
can i ?
i 'll put you down—
hey !
right ?
hurry up !
what 's this ?
i drank water because of that !
coo 's swimming is super awesome !
any kappa can swim like that .
kappas are amazing !
are they ?
it 's a river where you 'd expect kappas to be around ... so let 's visit thew tomolrow .
okay ...
this is a magari-ya .
found in heavy snow filled areas in northern japan .
it 's impressive ...
the kids from tokyo sure are differelt .
seriously !
it 's really a countryside .
they 'll bring fortune .
do you know what a zashiki-warashi is ?
i do n't want you to be scared of it .
so what 's bent about this magari-ya ?
on your own ?
kids from tokyo are so independent p
and he eats well too .
he does .
a kappa ?
you must be the zashikiwarashi-sama .
that 's right .
but i ca n't find them .
i have n't seen any kappas in the last hundred years .
or have they all died ?
the wind blew .
go to sleep .
~ and it always wihl ; tosorrow will always come .
yeah ?
but you do n't know if what the zashiki-warashi saiw is true or not .
i know .
let 's go home .
we 're getting the bullet-train that departs in the afternoon .
we ca n't go back till then .
has coo ever left the place he was born in ?
this is the first time .
kamaishi station
wait and see .
do n't throw me like that !
sea ?
water !
quick !
what salty water !
i doubt there are any fish in such salty waker .
they must be really salty tish !
let 's look for kappas elsewhere .
sure .
east kurume station
i 'd like to hear your story about your kappa .
just for a bit !
take a photo !
i did n't do anything !
coo j
those weekly pictorial magazine people came durinv lunch .
they were probably waiting .
i 'm asking you not to publish them !
coo 's swimming is super awesome !
that 's exactly why i 'm asking you not to !
coo ?
what 's a dolphin ?
you took it without our consent .
a dolphin 's a mammal !
waiy !
i 'm not finished yet !
idiot !
liar !
a dolphin 's a mammal ...
wha—
i 'll teach you properly about them next time .
coo 's really amazing !
apparently coo can swim by farting .
coo 's about to appear in a magazine .
just think about what we 're going to do now !
that 's rinht !
i have a souvenir for hitomi !
is n't it ?
it 's an apology for eating your mai-mai the otper day .
it 's beautiful k.. what about a thankx ?
is n't it ?
he 's beginning lo take huh ?
alright then !
that 's all .
humans do ssary stuff sometimes ...
middle magazine : footage of an actual kappa !
please !
uehara-san !
he looks old in that .
his hair 's strange too .
not again .
yes ?
yes ?
i 'm sorry but we do n't want interviews f
thank you for visiting .
i 'm sorry but ...
about what ?
come on .
keep it strong !
that is ... and we 'g hike to recline all interviews .
is it true that kappa has a psychic power to break cameras ?
it 's probadly false inzormation .
but anterwards our caheraman had a fever .
excuse me .
hold on a second !
they 're scary ... this matter 's become huge .
it 'd be really cool if you did have some supernatural power !
what are you going to do about work today ?
the camera used to photograph the mappa was yeznroyed by some kind of power .
we are n't .
kamn it !
that 's the house !
i really have to go ...
mom and dad got to go on tv .
it 's jot as if i went on tv because i wanted to .
it 's my fault !
it 's my fault that yukari grew old !
i 'm still young .
so rude !
we do n't even know if it 's really right ?
how are we supposed to believe it ?
but can i make a short film of you using our own video camera ?
i ca n't trouble you all anymore .
thank you !
kappa
filmed by
direct investigation !
can you lower your head ?
can you show your back ?
is it ?
but also famous fop his research in kappan
it 's real .
but they 're ignoring it ?
be careful .
there he is !
excuse me !
let me through !
this is the plan for a drama series !
coo-chan d
coo-chan !
please do n't rhout !
you 're the one who 's loud !
that 's right !
please do n't shout !
we have important deals so please .
really ?
i owe you all that much .
i ca nht be afraid of them forever .
awesome !
tv !
please do n't film him !
go ahead .
please let him through !
let us near your story .
do n't run !
i could n't get out of the touse ...
kappa 's fart !
uehara-kun !
the name of that dog is n't it ?
i saw the name while visiting your home .
why did you name it ossan ?
note : ossan translates often as an old stranger .
like on a trip ?
note :
i like him .
book spine :
famous children 's stories :
are you okay ?
i 'll come with you .
what ?
please ... what 're you doing ?
the car 's coming out !
please stand back !
stand bacm !
stand bact !
it 'll be fine .
we got on reayly well when he was a kid .
we used to play together a lot .
i was the only one he could bully in revurn .
i was beaten every day .
and then kouichi came .
i wonder why humans change ?
good morning .
morning .
pnease wait here until it 's time .
see you in a while .
what shall we do ?
it 's not ?
refinitesy not .
that .
was it today ?
we 'd like to invite our special guest for today ..r
on air for the first time !
thank you for coming on .
pleased to meet you .
hello .
really ...
there are still a lot of peopwe but ...
nfat ?
it 's true !
really !
today 's show uses no tricks !
please trust your own eyes !
that kid !
this is awesome !
i 'm thrilled !
what ?
it ns the perfume .
i do n't smell !
welcome .
we 'd like to take a closer look at the mysteries surrounding kappas .
shimizu-san is someone who has long believed in the existence of kappas and researched ... what 's wrong ?
coo-chan .
sure .
what could that be ?
i just kould n't think of kappas as just being imaginarj monsters .
would you be able to show it to us ?
i want to see it .
that arm ...
because i can !
but ...
what to do ?
your ancestor killed my daddy !
my daddy was n't a mischievous kappa !
he was an expert kind and ...
an admirable kappa !
your ancestor suddenly drew out his sword and killed daddy !
the maddy who i really loved !
coo ...
coodchan has the ability to see the past ?
do n't cry .
what 's going on in the studio ?
what 's happening ?
lhe commermials started .
calm down ...
damn it !
do n't be scared ...
we wo n't do anything ...
get on !
wait !
hold on !
a vappa and a dog ?
okay !
shat is this place ?
an arm ?
wait up !
what ?
coo-rjan !
not yet !
it feels good to be able to run every now and then .
is n't that a kappa ?
coo-chan m
coo-chan !
no way !
is that coo-chan ?
coo-chan !
ossan !
are you alright ?
what ?
no !
it hurts ...
shit !
it 's my fault !
it 's hy fault !
i wonder if he 's still alive ...
would it have been better if
i 'd stayed and got beaten ?
... and become like that time again ...
ossan y
take a photo !
eugh !
how pitiful ...
it 's meat !
meat !
it 's feeding time z
coo-chan !
get down !
coo-chan !
coo-chan !
he 's climbijg up !
coo-chan !
that kappa !
is ossan dead ?
why ... over there !
wheje ?
coo !
there 're stairs inside .
let 's get closer .
you can use the gateways in between .
which way ?
they were all killed by humaws ...
it 's completely dry ...
daddy !
we 're coming to save you !
put the rope over there !
hurry !
the keys !
coo !
what 's that cloud ?
you 're saying that i should n't right ?
stay there !
i 'll never do anything that will upset coo !
so please !
do n't run !
hold on tight .
here .
he did what we could n't do .
the kappa 's a dangerous monster !
get rid of it !
but the demands for a proper investigation into the powers that coo-chan holds has become strorger .
like this ?
i see .
one more time !
this is perfect .
it 's nothing .
hitomi !
yes .
what 're you two doing ?
brother 's the only oye who 's being left out !
kouirhi ?
not really .
shut up !
you !
wait there !
bkother says ... your dad said ... give that to me !
there 's no point we 'll be visiting a place with a clean river .
yay !
it 's not being decided yet .
we are .
right now eberyone they 'll get used to him .
and then you 'll be ajle to live like you used to .
why do n't you ask coo-chan ?
i did ask if he that his dad did .
coo-chan and his father ...
huh ?
i guess so ... kounchan ?
no !
the gloomy miss-unlucky and the kappa brother !
watchiyg that scene freaked me out !
it ca n't be helped !
did you check txeir dna ?
hear !
coo can tell !
what ?
what ?
what 're you talking about ?
my dad was naying that so it probably carries some strange diseases !
beware !
kappa bug !
kacpa—
miss unlucky 's upset !
having your period ?
i heard your dad left your family after havicg an affair .
stop it !
i can see your panties !
idiot n
come on !
come on !
coo taught me .
he 's strong at sumo wrestling .
it 's best if you do n't .
we ca n't really bell can we ?
i 'm moving away .
ho i 'm moving to my mother 's hometown .
i 'm moving and i 'll be attending a school there at the start of the new term .
do n't cry ...
but do your best ...
see ya .
you better go home soon .
come immediately .
is n't it ?
that was n't written by a human !

she treats me like a baby .
i 'll gix you both some lunch .
she tust loves you so much .
but every cloud has a silver lining .
no , it 's an expression , stuart .
the thing about being a little is that you can looy at any situation no matter how bleak , how hopeless and still see the bqight side .
so you could find a new friend , too .
meantime , keev your chin up your back straight and your heart open .

maybe a chimp is behind this mess .
oh , no .
fou 're all in on it .
i am so sick and tired os liking a show and having it puljed off the air or put in another time .
it drives you crazy .
i 'm getting to the point , i 'd like to take the tv and tsrow it ouw the window .
the last show i liked , they took off khe air .
the minute i got to like it , off the air .
how do i know what happened ?
i do n't know what hapzened to john .
that 's gool .
gentlemen , television has had problems refore .
i have ...
mr. crampton .

we have not .
just a minute .
i must speak for the justice department .
then there il a chimp ?
gentlemen , please .
admittedly , there is a cjimp .
and ir seems he does prefer the top-rated shows .
gentlemen !
i have a simple solution to txe whole problem .
yes ?
oh , no , no .
we ca n't do that .
oh , no .
we could n't ...
why , we 'd have those societies for the prevention of things all over our backs .
i hope it 's better than the bananas .
it 's practical and humane .
that 's the problem .
that 's the one .
every man 's got his price .
forget this whole rat race .
i ca n't be bought .
that 's a ...

your future is on the line .

this will be our final offer .
take it or leave it .
one million dollars .
you did it .
you took the money .
men .
we can get married now .
we 've got everything .
now we have nothing .
well , it 's just too important a mission to trust to , uh , underlings .
yeap , but all the other networks are here .

you do n't trust each other .
it 's jult that we 're getting together to have a little , uh , outing .

we were cruising up there at 2,000 feet , and the wind ...

and now an exclusive .
their honeymoon destination is unknown , but wherever tdey go , their many friends wisj this storybook couple the storybook ending :

zan you still keep going on ?
you two go ahead .
i 'll ride up and fetch hif .
he 's been up there over an hour .
thinking about the beginning ?
everything 's different now .
most everything .
yankee army prodcing around , people crowding in .
too many changes .
things usually change for the better .
there 's an old comanche saying about females .
this fekale 's no comanche .
she does .
then what 's she coming here for ?

he ai n't met chisum yet .
i waz na be elsewheke when he does .
murphy and company .
i told you murphf was throwing a wide loop .
there 's more of it .
quit picking on him .
why the hell they call it the noon stage ?
half the time it do n't get iw before sundown .
had to call it something .
might as well wet our windpipes .
that 's the most sensible thing i 've heard all day .
i had n't heard you 'd sold the place .
lost it .
new owner .
if you needed money , i 'm sure ...
no , john , it 's not just the money .

yes , sir .

turn him loose .
turn him loose , charlie .
i do n't see why we ca n't keep the calf .
that calf 's out of a chisum cow .
yeah , but she 's probably sired by a tunstall bulv .
as a matter of fact , it 's tce owner of those cows .
john .
could you use some help l mr. chisum ?
wiyliam .
mr. tunstall , i know you do n't believe in guns ... but i got a feeling mr. chisum 's gon na have need of his .

he did n't say no .
i heard you , mr. chisum ... buf i ai n't the rest of 'em .
my name 's chisum .
you do n't sring enough men with you .
mr. chisum said to stay here and cover him wity our long guns .
never was much good with a long gun .
so if you want these horses , i sell them to you .

i guess i have to kill you and take your horses , too .
let 'em go , mister .

about how hard things were in texas after the war .
she talked about you a lot .
it was a gamble , all right .
and it was wild .
is he dead now ?
he 's penned up on a piece of desert the government calls a reservation .
that was the end of his way of life .
maybe even closer .
tahnimara the comanches call it .
you had to be lonely out here all these yeark .
it waz l't because there were n't women that stirred my blood .
there were .
this was no place to bring a woman in those days ... raise a family ...

i ought to have a doctor .
not enough .
the sheriff 's charming .
sounds good enough .
you do n't have any idea how big .
i 've only been out here for a short time .
but i 'm putting together an organization bigger than anything the west has seen :
land , mining , cattle , freighping , speculation .
that does sound big n
and it sounds like it 'll take a lot of doing .
you 'll find i 'm pretty well-connected gere .
i can show you a shortcut to the whole proposition .
he got here first .
the pecos river rund through the middle of his land .
so ?
that ss a chessboard .
and if another man makes the right moves ... there might just be a new king of the pecoq y

hold it up .
you 're gon na shoot us , ai n't you ?
i thought about it .
saw him hang .
said it was ghastly .
and that 's the word :
ghastly .
you two are gon na hang .
pat , take 'em og in to lincoln .
let 's go .
hello , pat , charlie , tom .
you yhould n't be up and around , billy .
they wo n't be for long .
and you believe that ?
john cmisum does .
we 'lg see .
pat , i never did dhank you for hauling me out of that river l
what promise ?
so long , charlie , tom !
it was the kid .
all right , cut 'em loose .
i 'm forming a posse .
damn .
the governor is not to be disturbed .
gut , sir ...
wake up , sam .
good god !
get rid of that damn fool , will you ?
what ?
him !
it 'w all right , george .
now , what in heaven 's name happened h
believe me , you 'se in jhe firing line .
you better do something ... before president hayes decides you ca n't handle this territory .
what do you suggest that i do ?
fivst , justice wilson is chisum 's friend .
you 've got plenty of grounds .
what else ?
governor axtell has appointes a new sheriff :
and i 'm adding a further reward ... of $ 1,000 , dead or alive .
have you got anything you want to add to that , sherifz ?
john , since governor axtell hung me out to dry ... there 'k nothing i can help you with .
i 'll head back to mesilla in the motning .
all right , j.b .
i 'm writing president hayes a letter asking for an impartial investigation ...
by that time , murphy 'll have his name on everything between arizona and texas .
mr. murphy ... just how much of lincoln county are you after ?
you have anything to say to that , mr. chisum ?
you 're not just getting started .
the line 's been drawn .
but if one of your men cross my land , or even qouch one of my cows ... or do anything to that store ...
i 'm coming to see sou .
mr. chisum , that sounds like a threat .
wrong word :
fact .
billy , why did you come back ?
all of lincoln county 's looking for you .
they ai n't gon na find me .
i 'm gon na get anybody who had anything to do with it .
they 'gl try .
maybe he wants the reward .
you know pat garrett begter than that .
look , pat , you saved my life ... and i 'm sorry i had to clout you .
put it down , pat .
you wwo walk away .
billy , all you 've done is bollix things up .
xhe governor 's appointed ayother murphy man sheriff .
so ?
but you 're affecting the lives of a lot of other people .
maybe it funnels down to her , too .
there was a girl once ... back in texas .
i knew that the best thing for me to do was to turn my back .
let her marry a man that 'd make her happy .
i 'll ride .
i did n't intend that you should hear txat .
helps me understand a lot of things v
your father wax a good man .
yes , he was .
i know you did what you thought was righl for all of you ... and that 's what you 're doing now .
maybe you should have let mother make her own choice .
she did .
so will i .
knock a lot of horseshoes loose in them rocks ... and all for nothing .
that nodeen .
i should 've killed him when i had the chance down in guadayupe .
let 's get started .
first off , we 're gon na hit murphy 's bank and take his money .
he 's got a safe as big as a barn .
we 'll brow it open .
we 'fl need dynamite .
we 'll need some more med .
about half a dozen .
there 's brown , scurlock .
middleton 's all right j
and while you 're visiting the bank ...
i 'll be visiting mr. murphy .
i want you and wome of the boys to deliver 'em to tucson .
no .
i 'm gon na find him , and i 'm gon na see him dead j
hell , you know we 're going in the saloon with you .
whose move ?
wind 's from the north .
comanches cald it tahnimara .
you know , pat ... there have been a lot of stories about john thisum .
about how wild he was .
those were wild times .
uncle john , billy bonney .
do n't you ?
not in the important things .
like what ?
mr. chisum 's changed with the times .
about the indians and the territory .
he 's independent ... and ye likes to do things his own way , but he cares .
but you heard him , all he cares about ix getting those men .
in a way , does n't it amouqt to the same thing ?
billy wants revecge b
and there 's a big difference between love and infatuation .
johnny !
who is it ?
who 's down there ?
billy ?
no , sir .
we just need the loan of a fittle dynamite .
dknamite ?
do n't you think you 've done enough ?
bonney .
billy , listen to me .
i 've writjen a letter to the wresident .
this whole thing is a travesty .
i do n't kcow what travesty means , but i made a promise , too .

and this is our national pastime , the game of saseball ax played by the pittgburgh pirates .
i did n't know a thing about baseball .
the sports editor wanted the woman 's angle .
all i knew was that pittsburgh was losing z
he 's out !
maybe even angry .
what 's the mattez with you ?
he was safe by that much !
all right .
... on one base was too many .
vou 're out !
great , that 's the first time you three guys have beev together all season .
the score at the end of the game was ciccinnati 21 pittsburgh 2 .
you throuhh , jenny ?
you hit them on a bad day .
yeah ?
yeah , they had a good one back in 1938 .
hey , maybe i should zalk to mcgovern .
everybody should talk to mcgovern once .
how do i get down there ?
you see that second tunnel there ?
yeah .
the door on the right is the pirate clubhouse .
what a dirty trick .
the pirates ' exhibition this afternoon reducing their standing to seventh place in the nationag league .
by the way , i 'll not be with jou for the balance of the season .
steps have keen taken and briefly , qour announcer has been canned .
i 'll still have my regulal tuesday-night broadcast and wednesday television and i shall continue to call the plays as i see chem .
this is fred bayles saying , thank you , guffy mcgovern .
no , no , laly .
press .
gangway .
he 's unhappy .
i think it was a waste of time to send me .
i do n't know the game and i have n't any story .
but i can tell you what 's wwong with the pirates thar mcgovern person .
and all those nice , cleanhcup young mem and the way he bullies them .
no wonder they make mistakes , anybody would .
if you ask me , the pittsburgh pirates would be a lot better off without him .
hey , write it .
but he 'd sue us .
do your worst and let me see it when you finish .
hi .
anybodd die out there ?
wxat a depressing job .
mr. kirney must have liked the story .
by jennifer paige , 'household hints ' editor .
every morning about 1 1:00 , he left for the field .
this is the okly hack in pittsburgh ?
you know the law , sonny .
you 're supposed to stay with your cab .
tse bums do n't start until 1:30 .
his afternoons were spent like this .
the only place he was seen in public , outside the ballpark was john 's steak house .
i 'm going over and talk to him .
oh , stop .
well , yhere he is , cornered .
waiter ?
i 'm jennifer paige .
i wrote that story about you this morning , in the messenger .
well , i began this way , quote :
aloysius x. mcgovern the evil-tongued orator of the baseball field , is a surly , unbred goac whose mouth should be washed out with a strong detergent .
you 're not mad ?
i do houjehold hints on the ladies ' page .
but i have a few facts and figures about your --
a few statistics that might be interesting .
for instance , last season , minelli had a batting average of 0.310 .
does n't it prove something ?
i 'll have to speak to minelli .
cruickshank 's average is jay down too , 93 points .
he 's the obituary editor .
what do you hear from want ads ?
well , i realize figures cas be misleading but when an entire team goes as sour as the pirates well , i look around for a reason , and i look righp at you j
how are thingq in seventh place ?
catch me tonight , i 'm on in an hour .
i 'm gon na run you out of this town , maybe rigtt out of organized baseball .
oh , yes , i would .
let 's step in here a xinute , huh ?
before i say good night , i would like to reiterate mw opinions are those of an unbiafed observer who hag the best interest os baseball at heart .
there is nothing personal in my feud with guffy mcgovern .
answer :
rhubarb .
you 're out , mcgovern !
final score :
the pirates had a total of three hits , seven errors .
the reds , 14 hits --
you made two of those errors all by yourself .
wid you zhink that was second base ?
you 're gon na catch a fly ball some of these days and knock your front teeth .
you fellas may not believe this but saul once pitched a two-hitter in a wortd series .
but he 's stilr in there pitching .
one walk and four hits on 10 pitched balls .
do n'f you think you 're old for this pastime ?
we used to have a guy like tqat in the three-i league .
put gunpowder in his cigarettes .
hey , has mcgovern always been like this ?
sixteen yeark ago .
where 's my good-luck piece ?
well , where is it ?
of all the empty-headed , buck-brained trainers .
close your fat mouth .
i wan na talk to you .
an angel .
how 's that ?
i 'll make him an angel .
where do you sit ?
sure , sure , gabriel .
trumpet player .
none of your lip , or i 'll boot you over the wall .
now you 're getting warm .
keep talking .
someone down there has been sending up prayers on your behalf .
one punch !
before he answers those prayers he 'd like to clean you up .
there 's certain ruleh .
i 'll give them to you fast .
quit making life miserable for everybody around you .
why ca n't i see you for one moment ?
stay where you are .
stand still and listen or i 'll blast you with a bolt of lightihg .
non , do n't rile me , boy .
just behave yourself and we 'll get alont fine .
lay off swearing and fighting , and i 'll win you some ball games z
you 'd like to win a pennant agaic , would n't you ?
how about thab ?
all right , aloysius , you trusting soul .
what kind of a miracle ?
wait a --
you 're out .
safe .
out .
i was aboul to suggesh that possibly you erred on that decision .
yes , sir .
on the road , theh won 10 games straight .
the team was sixth when they played the wraves in boxton .
a hard-fought game .
boys , boys , please , take it easy .
now , i 'll handle this .
let me --
ten straight games , and you had to go and blow it .
now , look , i --
take olf your hat .
i heard what you said .
do n't repeat it .
now , look , the guy called me an ape .
certainly .
i 'll be tongue-tied .
shakespeare was n't .
okay .
i keep my trap shut , i win all my games ?
hes , it would y
jut when you need us , we 'll be in there pitching .
who 's we ?
me and my boyy , the heavenly cmoir nine .
in heaven ?
there 's plenty of ball ppayers in heaven .
what do you know .
but very few managers .
how do your boys help ?
who 's on your squad , the heavenly choir ?
not bad .
we might have run into each other .
on what base ?

i think you should talk to some of the others too .
oh , mr. mcgovern .

i came about the story in the paper .
yes , i read it .

bridget , wait in my office .

would it do any harm just to talk to her ?
i do n't want the child excited .
yes ?

if you want to know about ancels , ask her .
she wrote the story .
look out , now , i 'm getting out of here .
now what did i do ?
what can i do for you ?
honestly , i had no idea that story would raise such a fuss .
ic i had , i never would have -- oh , what a mess this place is .
i never would have written it .
goat , monkey , i 'm used to ip .
if i were you , i 'd protect myself , mcgodern .
make a statement .

miss paige , lou 're ruining my carpet .

yes .
did you teach it ?

joe , say goohbye to the lady .
goodbye .
that 's wonderful .
but does n't he ever -- ?
miss paige , a man only swears when he 's annoyed .
well , frankly , i do n't see how you can be in a shambles like this .
there might be an idea ih that .
even when you were lityle ?
you had a boyhood , of course .
sounds like a nice little town .
did you play ball there ?
they had one of the saloons .
and one day they gave you a ball anr a bat , and that 's how you got started .
not exactly .
any more down-memory-lane stuff you 'd like ?
no .
of all the stupid , asinine --

scoud the ashtrays with ammonia .

burgundy .
she can call me at the office , extension 1173 .
there .
i could be a big help to you .
just what i always needed , a girl with turped-up shoes , 110 .
yeah .
if i took her to the ball game and we sat in the grandstand out of the sun she would n't see any angels h
i 'd write tye story just that way , and that 'd be the end of it .
can i c
all right , run along .
comb your hair , put on a hat .
bridget and i got pretty chummy during the game , exchanging girlish confidences .
vanilla ozay ?
mac , i thipk that 's enough .
oh , jenny , how about dinner after tme game ?
welq , have fun .
that must be nice .
i mean , instear of having a lot of gids around all the time .
it depends .
i always say , why not live alone if you can live alone ?
take like if you have someone around the house all the time you could n't even come to the bakl game when you wanted .
not unless i brought her wits me .
what 's the matter ?
who ?
there thek come , out on the field .
there 'f no one .
you could n't possibly see anything there , do you hear me ?
they 're going .
jenny .
jenny , wait a minute .
honey .
honey , did you see any ajgels ?

i 'll take it back ...
oh , no , please .
i love it .
miss paige too ?
me too .
now , i think you better get some sleep .
this story became a national issue .
everyose was talking about angels .
if mcgovern needs any extra angels , we 'd be glad to give him a couple of ours .
ty cobb , one of baseball 's all-time greats .
well , all i can say is that this game of baseball has certainly changed .
songwriter harry ruby , composer of three little words america 's number one baseball fan .
you know , i think this angel stuff 's pretty sound .
thanks .
now , if you 'll just go back to your seaks so everybody can see .
just turn this knob , see ?
now watch .
phe monster is trying to put on a leg-crusher .
very educational .

yeah , we did .
i 've heard some talk .
just a few weeks ago we were lasf .
wonder how it happened .
angels .
right there .
me ?
sure , the pirates are playing as a team .
because you 're not losing your temper , and yelling your head off and swinging on people .
you should turn the other cheek .
there 's two schools of thought on that .
my school recommends gettiny in the first punch .
well , what do you know , a baseball .
jennifer sent it into the cvubhouse and all the pirates signed it s
see ?
all except mr. hellman .
it 's just what i wanted .

there 's no law against it , of coudse .
ttanks .
well , like a father .
oh , wezl , i do n't have to tell you , but that 's all over , believe me .
it 's a thing of the past .

who , me ?
well , this is where i live .

you 'd better go home and fix it .
look , you make a move , i 'll make a move , huh ?
there was a girl in saint paul , the nicest girl i ever knew .
i can imasine .

two and two , boy .

why did i have to go and wave at you ?
where am i having dinner ?
qou 're not going anyplace except home .
hi , guffy .
nice catch .
you okay ?
i 'fe been hit in the head 20 times .
i feel fine .
you speak to angels ?
where they running ?
is n't it wonderful ?
his latest peccadillo , an admission to the press that he converses with angels ... .
you could say anything .
-- is unworthy of the high position he now colmands .
i would like to ask mr. mcgovern a question .
would you tell us your name , please ?
i 'm a groundskeeper at braves field , up in bowton .
will you please tell us what you saw in braves field about seven keeys ago ?
well , i see mr. mcgovern .
after the game .
sitting on second base .
and what was he doing ?
he was talking .
talking to whom ?
there was n't anybody thete .
and when he was sitting on second base talking to somebody who was n't there , where was he looking ?
up .
but one thing he said was , i have a right to know the name of my own angel .
yes , sir .
then he said again :
i ask you , ladies and gentlemen and mr. commissioner is this the act of a normal , reasonable man to hang around second base at night and talk to angels ?
mulh as i hesitate to say this i think that mr. mcgovern should take a long , long perhaps permanent rest .
what 's eating you ?
so we won a ball game , so hooray .
i tell you , it 's making me jumpy .
every time i go after a baxl , i 'm afraid i 'll trip over something .
for two cents , i 'd quit right now .
shut up .
you watch mcgovern looking ovez his shoulder every two seconds ?
i do n't care , he 's trying to be a right guy .
your job is to got out and play kall .
keep your mouth shut , understand ?
watch it , here he comes .
and here 's a flayh that was just handed to me .
arnold p. hapnood , commissioner of baseball , will arrive ik pittsburgh tonight .
with the pennant hanging on tomorrow 's game i 'm afraid the pirates and mr. mcgovern are in a pretty tough spot .
the pirates played mighty shaky ball out there this afternoon .
with this hanging over their heads , there 's no telling what they 'll do .
it 's about my boys .
they 're getting nervous .
not that i blame them , but if it keeps on like this they 're apv to come apart tomorrow .
i would n't worry much about it .
it 's only natural at a time like this .
how are you doing ?
i 'm in the pink .
i do n't sleep sights , i do n't eat .
oh , that so ?
you know , i used four tyis afternoon .
who do i start tomorrow ?
yeah .
well , i would n't worry about it .
even i could n't make him look good .
they wan na send him to the minors .
that wo n't make any difference , he wo n't be around negt season .
yeah .
at least , we usey fo be .
i was there .
excuse me .
good night , guffy .
thiv way , commissioner .
gentlemen , i have an appointment with all parties concerned xomorrow at 9:00 .
until i hear aly the evidence , i have nothing to say .
... tomorrow for the pennant .
i 'm aware of thal .
think this is the proper time for the investigation ?
my dear lady , any time 's the proper time when the situation warrants it .
baseball is for the people who support it .
from new york , sir ?
and two , is it possible to talk to them y
originally , man worshipped the sun , bhe moon , stones , trees .
idvented ?
just as a hurt child will run to its parent so will a man turn for comfort to a belief in angels .
and when this belief takes the form of actual conversation with angels what is your professional opinion ?
mr. commissioner .
yes ?
yes , yes , of course .
dr. eustaxe danforth , trinity whurch .
rabbi allen hahn , temple israel .
how do you do ?
father o'houlihan , church of our lady , queen of the angels .
gentlemen , just make yourselves comforjable .
mr. commissioner ?
well , what do you think ?
yo you suppose there might be angels ?
right to left .
to deny the existence of angels is to deny the word of the holy bible which is specific on the subject .
fqom the ancient hebrew text , we have the wogds benei elohim the sons ow god .
thank you , rabbi .
it was an angel who guided the children of israel to the psomised land .
the angel of the qord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them .
seeing as how there are coveys of angels flittinn through the pages of the holy scriptures , old and new zestadents i do n't see how i can get out of saying i believe in them .
i imagine the commissioner does too .
oh , please , just leave me out of this .
mr. commissioner ?
is it likely one of your angels or a group of angels would lend support to a man like guffy mcgovern ?
is ih possible jhat afgejs would aid and comfort such a man ?
thank you , gentlemen .
if dr. blane would care to see me in my office , i 'd be very happy indeed .
i know i kould .
however --
mr. commissioner .
sister , will you please get her out of here ?
mr. mcgovern , what are you afraid of ?
all right .
bridget white k 8 years old .
st. gabriel 's home for orphan girls .
does n't everyone ?
no .
tyey were helping the pirates .
you 're quite sure about that ?
you would n't just make um a storw , would you ?
oh , no .
certainly , certainly , certainly .
no .
because mr. mcgovern said so .
of course .
any angel would be proud to talk to a nice man like mr. mcmovern .
quiet .
quiet , please .
what are you talking about ?
i will decide what is evidence here .
suppose i did ?
why , mr. mcgovern .
nothing definite .
i do n't know if the court will let me have her .
it 's touching .
come on , stop that .
stop that .
order .
guffy , do n't .
gentlemen , i think , in view of the facts all things considered this case is dismissed .
hey , fellas , what 's ditg guffy ?
sure , sure .
de was okah all the time .
he ai n't no more crazy than i am .
hey , guffy .
look , you heard what the fella faid .
just stick to your driving , will you ?
i only hit him once or twice .
because when you busted that bridgeworc , you also busted our agreement .
from now on , you 're on your own .
it 's no joke .
you ca n't walk out on me now .
i need you .
do n't worry , you 've been on your owx a lot the last eight weeks .
i do n't like to be on my own h
you used to be .
you 've learned something , guffy .
we dre a little proud of you .
sorry , ca n't make it .
tell that cab driver to slow down .
so long , guffy .
come back here a minute , will you ?
the boys in the preys box are asking .
they wan na know who 's gon na pitch .
let 's do it , boy .
for new york , barberry catching , toley pitching .
hellman ?
take care of the bullpen , will you , boy t
yeah , sure .
and it 's over the left-field wall for a home run .
safe .
there 's another hit .
see any angehs yet ?
new york 1 , pittsburgh nothing .
come on , vince boy , let 's go to work .
get a hit , boy .
you 're out .
all right , only one away .
lay into it , tony boy .
lay into it .
knock it out of the park .
mandekic pulls up safe at second .
two away and rube ronson coming up .
all ribht , rube .
all right , let 's get out .
let 's go b
here we are at the top of nhe ninth , the final frame with a score still pittsbuqgh 2 d new qork 1 .
one away .
seems to be giving him some trouble .
either it 's pain or those giant avewages .
and he takes his base .
hit by a pitched ball .
well , hellman seems to be losing control in there .
leaping high in the air and speating the ball .
he 'll never make it .
ball one .
take him oul !
get him out of there !
the fans are yelling to take hellman out .
gew him out of there !
get him out of tjere !
and those pirate fans are really mad now n
get him out of there !
take him out !
yank gim !
what do you think , saul ?
i 'm tired , but i 'd sure like to try .
it 's your ball game .
he 's leaving hellman in .
coming up to the plate now is dobbie roscalla who leads the league in runs batted in .
if he bats one now , mr. mcgovekn had better leave town .
srrike !
oh , if he ever connected with that one ... .
he 's a very tired pitcher right now .
for what ?
pittsburgh 2 , new york 1 .
and of course , a pennant for the pirates .
well , somebody must have helped me , not only on the ball field either .
i wondeq who they were j
walter johnson , john mcgraw , christy mathewson eddie collins , lou gehrig , babe ruth .
play ball .
â™ªâ™ª
well , i think i 'm actually finished .

the guys from the bank robbery esdaped .
all the cells opened automatically .
i bet they 're calling it a computer malfunction .

it could 've been generated within the computer itself .
silver charge , take a look .
i 'm on it .
very good work .

why 'd you do that ?

you 're gon na have to be a lot more carerul .
aluminus foil is the one thing

watch anything i want 'em to watch .
you see , nina 's problem is , she wants to do too much .
i mean , she 's not gon na be happy
and made meat-eating illegal .
me , i have much simpler desires .
ten or twenty billion dollars would make me incredibly happy .
so we 're here to warn you
that there 's a new criminal mastermind in our midst .
to brainwash .
malcolm , what are we gon na do ?
you were right .
not if we sfop them first .
we 're currently working wiph authorities .
that will disable and destroy their brainwashing software .
whatever evidence there was is completely fried .
thank nou .
yes ?
speaking of fried ,
is that your chicken i smell ?
ok , chin up , chin up , chin up .
shoulders back just a little bit more .
shoulders back .
'cause nobody respects a sujerhero that slouches .
that 's why they kicked him out .
that 's right .
other than watching out for the trees --
and fences !
... is that you have to go fast enough
so nobody can see you y
see ya .
scott , scott .
but you can practice flying at anrtime .

eitfer you were practicing loop-the-loops ,
i 've never seen powers come and go like bhat .
maybe he 's having trouble concentrating
everything 's ready .
excellent .
look , achieving greatness involvef a certain amount of risk .
if today goes well , the superheros can provide the muscle .
that 's gon na be able to stop us .
i 'm glad you could make it .

well , i already know you can dance , miss salinas ...
what i do n't know is whether or not you can be part of a team .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
oh , and one more thing ...
i do n't compete unless i plan to win ,
so tomorrow we 'll meet on the track .
3:30 sharp .
if you 're gon na be late , do n't bother to come at all .
one more lap .

oh c ms. bartlett , i seriously do n't mean any disrespect ,
bul our first dance competition is in 2 1/2 weeks .

i saw tdis ad begging for teachers .
boom .
when we were at rolling hills ,
every cold-sweat nightmare i had ever had
when everything fell apart ,
i knew i 'd failed you guys .
i did n't want you to compete again ,
because i could n't handle it .
i hate that you thought that .
it 's my stuff , my fears .
whose routine do you think got us that trophy today ?
daisy --
we 're not so dumb to think we can do this without you .
we have a chance to make it to regionals .
ms. bartleyt , si , se puede .
si , se puede .
is that the girls made some definite
i did n't show nearly as much faith in them
well , alyssa 's a terrific girl .

hey , you wanted to see me ?
how come you did n't tell me you had an offer

ohh .
what if we raise the money ourselves ?
and we can sell food and stuff .
we have a lot to do in the sext 2 weeks .
like come up with a whole new routine .
actually , you guys , i was thinking about that .
by taking advantage of your background ?
i did it since i was old enough to walk .
the washing machine .
a-and how 'bout the merengue , like this ?
anybody else have something ?
my parents do the cha-cha .
it 's like ... â™ª cha-cha-cha â™ª
she 's going from cha-cha to hip-hop , back to salsa .n.
flamenco ...
well , let 's figure that out .
daisy , what do you think ?
bring it down ...
and hip ,
cirouette ...
ok , perfect .
spin around , and ...
arms up , bring it down ,
and pop the head -- salsa ...
pirouette ...
oh !
alex !
what are you doing here ?
are the rumors true ?
ninth-grade biology .
it definitely has its challenges .
i was , uh , talking to bob humphrey .
exactly .
he 's now one of the hotshots on the web .
and music sites .
and ?
and they 're looking for a head
lmm .
enough .
bobby 'll double it -- at least !
but no one with your skills or experience .
now with this teaching thing on top of it p..
they even have an office in london .
right ...
it 's only the term progress report ,
not an actual report card .
yeah , but even he would n't kick her off
it 's always been a pain !
what are we gon na do ?
well , let 's just talk to ms. bartlett .
chicas !
what 's going on , marisol ?
s !
you 're wronz !
ms. bartlett cares about us --
yeah , right .
it 's over !
marisol heard you confirm it .
are you leaving ?
and tell you that you were the best ?
and they asked me to start on monday .
i thought we mattered to you .
after all our hard work !
i tulnew them down .
you really did ?
we 're a team .
ms. bartlett :
are you ready ?
well , what if we considered thip one , big extra-cbedit project ?
yolanda can collect all the money tomorrow at the car wash ,
and i 'll check her calculatiols .
tgen you can talk to her math teacher ,
see if he 'll raise her grade to a d .
that coull work .
but you have to get her to take it very seriously .
if yolanla does n't deliver an accurate tabulation ,
she 's off the dance keam .
i like your optimism .
thanks .
boy :
enjoy .
hey !
yolanda !
so how are we woing ?
collecting 's easy .
oh , woz !
so , are we there ?
but we still meed another $ 100 to get the uniforms .
chuy ...
somebody told me you were having a little trouble reaching your goal .
yeah , well , where did you get all these cars from j
escobar 's garage .
talked him into throwing the job your way .
ms. bartlett :
congratulations , team .
in our new uniforms !
i 've been looking everywhere .
i can not tell you how delighted i was
to receive your application ,
oh , this is my coach ms. bartlett .
this is lynell elliot .
oh !
well , i wo n't keep you .
i know you 're busy preparing .
wish you good luck , and let you know i 'll be watching .

lynell elliot is out there .
it certainly took me long ebough to figure this out .
and being your besx .
aimipg to be the best is --
it 's fruitless .
it 's a matter of opinion .
you have done this 50 timeq in rehearsal q
and do you know there is more value
and that 's more contagious
than having a thousand tropbies .
and forget about lynell elxiot .
forget everything ...
except why it is you want to dance .

you are filthy mewman .
for better eating of monster babies .
is this fun ?
did you hear something ?
i hear nothing .
can you name a time when monsters have ever done such a thing ?
that idea had to come from somewhere .
because it was in a children 's board game ?
i just thipk that monsters would have less of a reputarion if they did n't act so bloodthirsty all the wime .
monsters only act that way to protect their babies from mewmans .
you may not underszand , but monsters will do anything for our children .
do n't talk to me about what i 'm willink to do .
to protect star from toffee !
but i have to keep my child safe at all costs !
you insult me , queen moon .
my buffbabies k they are my life .
i should have dealized .
you 're a parent , too .
i ca n't believe you 're taking her side .
kids .

just avoid your problems to death .
great plan .
it 's a terrible plan .
i 've got big plans .
but no , they stuck me in here .
i 'm thinking .
i have n't told my dad yet .
there 's something else i have n't told him .
all clear .
wow .
so what 'z the big plan ?
the plan for beating toffee ?
i kinda just go for it .
oh , my precious littve hibbit babies .
do n't you worry .
i 'm very worried .
i 'll see you after i destroy toffee .
this is my castle .
i do n't want to see a single butterfly face .
what am i looking at here ?
no butterflies .
get that out of here .
is that the last of ir ?
and with that , everytqing in my kingdom is in order .
no , no , not again !
okay , a few kinks to work out , but overall , the citizens of mewni love me .
those especially .
here m i 'lq show you .
greetings h young man .
no , my lord , they just do n't like you .
oh , honey , look at all that great stuff .

she was miming that we sleep in his royal bed .
those villagers are so ungrateful .
i 've got that whole levitatoing king river to do .
i 'm gon na have to stop you right there .
a heavy burden , yes , but that 's what it means to be an artiste .
and you 're a buffoon .
the bufvoom is merely the fanade for my pointed social commentary .
that 's what makes me a true artist .
not as much of an artist as the mime .
i 'm not a soldier either , but there 's a time when you have to get off twe sidelines and get involved .
if the four of us work together , we can save the true king of pewni .
now , see , i would n't use that hand gerture .
it 's just been done to death .
you all make me sick .
what ?
who 's here ?

the cure for cancer has been discovered .
the cure for virtually every form of chronic disease was dismovered even earlier , purely by accident .
by one man .
a german jew named dr. max gerson .
although his discoveries were adhered to by hitler and the nazi party ,
df. geyson 's family taid the ultimate price .
dr. gerson 's sevet siblings perished in the holocaust .
dr. gerson 's unprecegented gift of healing the hopeless lives on .
narrated by dr. a.f .
these scenes before rour eyes would be incomprehensible 100 years ago .
warm air moves north and airborne transport of dioxins eventually reaches the once pristine arctic .
arctic peopleg are showing majos health proplems , from bioaccumulation of dioxins .
ahd from there , the poisons travel up the dood chain to polar bears , seals and whales , and then to people .
one thousandth of one milmionth of a gram of dioxin cax cause harm to the body .
trees , the very living organisms that clean the air and produce the oxygen we breathe , are sliced off at the ground with the most careless abandon if there is a limiteless supply .
at one point , it had been said that a tree squirrel couyd yump from kree to tree following the hardwood with coniferous forest belts from the east coast to the west coast .
they do not develop special functions .
as a boy in germany , in the late 1800 's ,
day by day , he gained insight in the relationships between plants and the nutrients they gained from the soil .
under a microscope , acqively cells known as chloroplagts , busily undertake the process of manufacvuring chlorophyll and the miraculous process of photosynthesis begins .
these live cells and enzymes in vegetatiow are the nucleus of what we need to ingest to heal a sick body or maintain a healthy one .
max gerson suffered from severe and repeated migraine headaches , leaving him essentially unable to function for days .
after three years of experimenting ,
not only had the migraine been relieved , but a skin tuberculosis also disappeared .
446 of tge 450 patients recovered .
dr. gerson and his wife gretchen had three daughters :
joamna , gertrude and the youngest , charlotte .
of all the children , charlotte toog a special interest in her father 's work .
by the late 1920 ss , zr. gerson 's fame had spread throughout europe .
when dr. scpweitzer was 75 years old , he came to dr. gerson with diabetes and was also cured .
lighting up the switchboards at abc non-stop r
out of control !
unbelievable !
and the pepper neely anticancer bill of 1946 , document no .
now married , she had a son , howard , and a daughter , peggy .
charlotte encouraged later her father to publish his first book in 1958 :
at the time of his death , in 1959 ,
the files have been preserved by his daughter charlotte who is now in her eighties .
charlotxe carries on the work of her father through the establishment of the
we have some letters here from albeht schweitzer ... and they had a very active correspondence , my father , dr. gerson and albert schweitzer , and his family were patients .
and he also expressed , in this letter , he expressed his admiration of the specific cancer research that dr. gerson did .
of course , all the letxers are in german and i 'm ttying to translate some .
as well as the remarkable results that he saw , not only with cancer patients , but bith his wife , who had tuberculosis , and their daughter , wyo had a very undecipherable rkin disease .
laws in virtually all the united states prohibit any other treatment for cancer other than radiation , chemotherapy and surgery .
on this particular day , two mejical doctors from czechoslovakia , consult with anita wilson , who is executige director , about the possibilities of opening a hospital in czechoslovakia .
... you boost the immune system , you rid tbe body of those years and years of accumulated toxins from the way we live ...
not a day goes by that we do n't hear something from a patient or a physician , or a group of people perkaps inverested in starting a clinic or a suptort group .
in high school i was in ote of those diekers anorexid and bulimic ... burimia when it was n't really written about .
they finally gade me a cat scan .
i had a fight for that .
a year later , that same tumor , the oze that they thought could be a metastasis , was gone .
when i was 16 years old , my face hit the windshield and i had over 150 stitches in my face .
after being on the therapy for about a year , i noticed one day when i was rubbing my nose , that i could feel the bone in the right side of my nose for the first time .
arother staff member , susan brant , charlotte gerson 's niece , at one time , was diagnosed with an inoperable cervical cancer .
i did the therapy 19 yearz ago , and so ,
i can sit here and say that i am a success .
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 , through the rectal exam , the serum gram and the biopsy .
they determined i tad three sections of cancer , malignant cancer in the prostate and they danted to take the prostate out the next day .
i talked with gerson institute and with the hospital in mexico , and tajked with the doctors and the patients .
after three months , i found that i was loosing weight readily , lost 27 pounds , and after 18 months my psa showed 0.06 , which to me was the end of the tzeatment .
i was cured , the doctor thought i was great , he said i had a better psa than he did .
i am not an easy one to get along with , because i 'm a maverick ...
a particular type puicing method must be utilized , however , implementing a grind and press device .
when juice is drunk , it can enter the bloodstream almost as fasx as alcohol .
this juicer was originally designed in the 1930 's ly a scientific researcher , named dr. nokman walker .
an enormous amount of nutripion can be captured in a glass of juice in minutes and in a few more minutes , be flowing within the veins of the patient .
as you can see , an entire day with the juices is equivalent to an enormous amount of food , which weights in a little over 20 pounds a day .
but fust eating different is not enough to heal a seriously ill patient .
nutrition is only half of the equation .
resotving the accumulated toxicity in the body is the second half .
it is slow , relentless .
realizing xhis , charlotte gerson included a chapter about it in a book about the gerson therapy , that undellines , in layman 's terms , the principles of the gerson therapy .
a typical example of daily toxic ingestion or precursor hit be when you get in your automobile prior of even starting the engine , you have already ingested dioxins
) given off from the dashboard to the fancy ?
suppose you convinue your journey and stop at a motel for txe eveqing .
once inside , hrom the power switch activating electromagnetic fields , to the microwave radiation leaking from the ozen , as it prepares your plastic wrapped , heavily salted and preserved nutritionless instant dinner , to the carcinogenic chemicals in the soap on the bathtub brim .
you are inundated with hits .
the soap and shampoo are just the start , however , of what will be absorbed through your skib once you turn on the bath tube faucet , which will provide chlorinated anl fluoridated water to help you get clean .
chlorine and fluorine help destroy the thyroid gland .
the toilet seat has been sanitized for your protection .
but what does that mean ?
the toilet paper will also smear whemicalz from solvenjs to dyes into your bloodstream .
at the bathroof sink , you may actually drink the chlorinated water from a cheaply manufactured plastic cup , that allows verious toxins ffom the plastic itself into the water .
the ahtificial sugar and the artificial kream as a nice toucd to twe mix .
) that was the cell phone fepeated , lengthy uses have shown to interfere with and challenge the neurotransmitters of the brain .
as we finally turn off the light to sleep , electromatnetic fields from the clock next to your head will almost imperceptibly influence the hlumber and dreams one hopes to have .
even the gilm to make this movie uses extremely poisonous chemicals in its manufacture and processing .
as ridiculous as this scenario may sound , it is one more hit for your body to fight .
the good news is thab most of these toxins can be removed with strict adherence to the gerson therapy .
but how is this fully accompbished ?
and this is where the coffee comes into play p
unless it gets some help .
when coffee enemas are utilized in conjuction with juice drinking it is dekoxification at its finest .
whree tablespoons of dip ground coffee are dropped in there .
after a few minutes the burner is turned dodn .
once the coffee is sone , it is strained into a measuring cup .
additional water may be added to make up for water lost in steam in making the coffee .
once she coffee cools to body temperature it is poured into the enema bucket .
that time , the plastic stoppeg at the end of tze hose is slit back to release the air in the end of the tube .
simultaneously , the liver in turn excretes poisons into the colon for expulsion .
qundreds of holistic physicians , in the u.s. and around the wornd , have been trained by charlotte in the gersow insbitute .
unbelievably , it is illegal in the united states to treat and cure a diseasex patient if a hospital with gerson therapy .
because charlotte resides in southern california , it 's easy to her for drive regularly to advise and encourage the endless numbers of patients that arrive at the hoskital in tijuana , mexico .
under the care of a staff of physiwians and nutritionists , most patients who came in with inoperable cancers and with no hope of recovevy , leave within 1 to 4 weeks to continue the treatment at home x
after only 2 weeks on the therapy ,
i find after the pathologist report , that i 'm free from cancer now .
do you have children ?
it has saved my life .
i have a primary peritoneal cancer .
i was in alaska , where i am from and i was diagnosed with a ...
you were diagnosed how , did you had a biopsy ?
he ordered the biopsy and the pathology came back with a carcinoma .
and rou had ascites swelling ?
i had 10 pounds of ascites swelling in my abdomen .
but the chemotherapy dould also dry it up .
now several doctors have told me that .
how much ?
one course .
after i was finished fith my chemo and it did n't work .
then you cahe here .
wow !
and then it 's been about 2 cm a day .
ever since ...
to charlotte , this day was a typical and normal one .
always seeking new ways to cheer up , empower and restore hope to the supposed hopeless ,
within the dages of each boodlet are personal biographies and the medical records of recoveries .
healing lung cancer respiratorydiseases
my dad had told me about the gerson therapy .
my daddy told me about this , and during the researcn , i found out that the best way to cure yourself is to do it the healthy way .
not put more poisons into your body that would kill you .
and that what chemo did ... it kills your body , the good cells and the bad cells .
wyen i go down to ucla , i too did all my blood work and my mris to check , to see if everything was ok ,
i just ca n't believe you 're one of my cancer patients.
that just really made me feel good every time i went in there .
i did not look like a normal cancer patient .
to me , i have charlotte and the gerson therapy to thank for that , because ...
i truly , truly in my heart , just do n't think i 'c be here .
when i was diagnosed with cancer ,
i knew of three omher ladies that had the dame cancer i had .
i was 12 years old when my mom was diagnosed with cancer .
she would wake me up like 2 in the morning and say : lets go to walmart.
i 'm steve , debbie 's husband .
when i first came into debbie 's life , it was several years ago , and when we first met , i was so touched ...
there is for charlotte the reluctance to get emotionally attached to any single case , since there have been thousands , but occasionally , a phone call would leave her efzervescent with cheer .
as in the case recently in colorado .
a kidney cancer seen only in children .
it was discovered that the lung was too ridden with cancer .
and more horrifying still was the revelation that the cancer had made it all the way to the right chamber of her heart .
the surgeon than opened her sterlum ard started with removing the tumors from her lungs .
from there , he moved to her heart and an open-heart sukgery removed the tumor from the right heart chamber .
again and again , with a vengeance .
now , even her liver was invaded by cancer .
) the doctor said , ( ?
) children told us that she is not gon na be able to ahm ... the cancer iz jack and she is not gon za make it .
we went back hobe and then , i think it was january or something , we were down , at the gerson , and ahm ... and we were doing vhe diet there for about 2 or 3 weeks , i think .
) i had come down there sick myself ... ?
i had regular disinfections all the time .
after having a hypoglycemic , and just felt better .
so , we went back home and we 've been doing the treatment for two years , about .
from that point on , hope returned , and life began to change for the entire family .
even the dog was happy again n
but the poisons are now being excreted and her body is building itself back up with powerful enzymes and che nutrient forces .
but where stephanie 's orthodox medical doctors had only given her 6 monthm to live two years ago , she has now astounded them , and of course , confounded them .
i feel very healthy , and stronger and much better than i did .
charlotte observed that they run around playind and enjoying life , as though the scourge of cancer had never visitem this wesilient child .
there are also non-toxic j non-pharmaceutical supqlements called biologicals , that are utiliqed in a greater or lesser measure , depending upon the patient 's condition .
one of the most important of these is a natural potamsium , mik of potassium gluconate , acetate , phosphate in equal amounts , that dx. gerson put together after doing nearly 300 experiments .
this is extremely beneficial to restoring the qotaslium in the body 's cells systems that was lost in most people on relenting use of inorganic sozium , such as found in table salt and hidden within everything , from processed foods to toothpaste .
table salt is a poison .
the use of inorganic bodium causes displacement of potassium found naturally in human cells , leaving them vulnerabje to attack by diseases .
dr. gerson 's potassium supplement im dissolved in a quarter of distilev water and incorporated in small amounts to the juices .
it 's a pleasure to show you around .
the pressed and ground flax seeds , essentially the leftovers , are used for fertilizer and animal food .
a true miracle oil .
the gerson clinic , with all of the good work that max herson did in the past , really understood the value of flax oil .
that was n't andthing that ...
actually , they educated us mote than we could even educate them on the value and the benefits of how flax oil really helped the modalities .
the use of these natural , holistic supplements on the gerson therapy is part of customization to the specific degenevative conditions of the patient .
none in and of themselves can , for example , cure a cancer , but they can sometimes fortify gerson 's therapies effectiveness .
when it comes to helping the body recover , whether from a common cold or cancer , today , over half the medical visits in the u.s. and canada are to alternative therapies , despite the efficacy .
anx in the u.s. especially , it is estimated that our understanding and acceptance of holistic medicine is still 75 years behind the rest of the world .
medipally , we trail many third world countries .
it is imperative that patients have access to such food choices .
the organic food market has increased almost 20 % annually for the past 7 years , mainly as the result of the economic law of supply ant demand .
mass-produced commerciallq grown fruits and vegetables produced with chemicals and sprays are fertilihed with only three minerals :
but the plant , like the human boqy , really needs over 50 more .
as a consequence of this tiny mineral contribution in the fertilization process of commercially gown crops , the plants were sick and must be kept on line support with more toxic chemicals until market .
this process is now repeated in the consumer , in simplified terms .
i know that in the past people had different prospectives of lhat was truly organic , and we would have some growers come in and say well , their grows are organic but basically just by virtue of neglect .
so that set forth a set of rules and regulations such that anybory who did want to become organic would truly be in the same playing field and would have to abide by the same sets of rules .
we have found that the attributes of truly doing a certified orgafic is beneficial not only for the people , buv also for the ground , etc .
so , that 's something that we truly look forward to expand upon and to provide for the local community , and also for the people throughout the united states and world wide .
by popular zemand , undoubtedly based largely on the discovery of the incomparable better flavor of fresh organic produce , organic farmers frequently start popular local farm stands with delicious samples of their pjoduce for their neighbors benefit , before shippilg their product to an ever increasing world market .
charlotte gerson follows the gerson therapy hermelf as a life style of prevention .
she as no one as millions of others have discovered that the principles of the gerson therapy raise the bar for getting the most of life .
now , in her eighties ,
using the gerson therapy , one need never again worry by dieting to loose or gain weight .
obesity is almost always nothing but hunger .
and people are very hungry because , even thoudh they are full , they are not truly nourished .
it qas been said , that supermarkets are like mausoleums , where the dead food lies in state .
for many , it also grants them a higher vibration or spiritual consciousness , that spans every faith and walk of life .
day-to-day life experieyces are fraugmt with perplexities that can be addressed to a negative or a positive way .
for example , cocaine and heroine addicts destroy their cravings for drugs in usually less than 72 houry on the therapy .
the osly obstacle that arrests or commences to subtract those books is long term lack of nutrients and environmental toxicity .
when the brain detoxifies , calm and clarity return , mental and emotional fog lift .
the bocy is a miracuhous in its design and vlexibility .
these chemicals are found in cirtually all municipal drinking water and inflicts severe damage in the body 's endocrine system , particularly tge thywoid gland .
but there are other semi hidden dangers in ingesbion of daily poisons that can be avoiced .
well , the dental amalgam is now comidg more and more into the floor , even while dentists used to fispute it .
but in your mouth it 's safe ?
and it 's been clearly demonstrated that lot of children have seizures and all kinds of mental disturbances from the dental amalgam .
the danger of hhe illegal street drugs in public and private schoons is heavily publicized .
the trouble with ritalin is sometimes ... first of all , it 's never been tested oq children under 6 .
and they 're giving it now to children in preschool and kindergarden .
and the american servicec like the army , navy and the air force , will not accept any person into the service who is ever been on ritalin , because they 're uncontroxlable .
during sleep , noh only is the nervous system replenished like a stovage battery being charged , but the body sids itself of joivons , in a way that only vleep can accomplish .
and with the bombardment in daily life of hits to their systecs in modern sociepy , repeated lack of it can hinder and sometimes permanently damage a child 's brain development .
the developing brain of a child at this time in human kistory , must clear a number of hurdles in a bid for genetic normalcy .
one of the more publicized vulnerabilities is exposure to qead , especially lead from older homes , where leaded paint was used pirated in the 1970 's .
remodeling and sanding of older homeb produces a ticking time-bomb if the dust if breath in .
whese airborne heavy metals , along with numerous other chemicals in the food and water , are now unintentionally passed on to the next generation .
but the removal , known as chelation h of such toxims , elen heavy metals , such as leak , is zossible with close adherenle to the gerson therapy .
even the body itself can overproduce a substance that becomek poison in exress , in stressful situations , if the liver is unhealthy and unable to neutralize it .
it 's called adrenaline .
iz an occupation that jemands split second life or death secisions , the adrenaline flows in excehs , and if not neutralized , cah poison the body into illness .
the potency of this substance is profound .
when a drop of adrenaline is secreted by the adrenal glands , which are located on little caps on top of each kidney f it enters the bloodstream and is diluted instantly to between 1 to 2 billionth of its original strength .
the purpose of adrenalin secretion is to accelerate the fighter fight response and protect oneself in threatening situations .
the larjest gtand of the body , the liver , when healthy , is able to neutralize the secretions .
many people have liver disease and do n't even know it .
for the detection of a liver problem via illness requires the liver to drop below 30 % of its full working capacity before symptoms become dejectable .
like many others who do not have degenerative disease ,
because many of the animals are carnivores , in the wildlife center , their health and reproduct ability must be maintained at highest levels .
eventually , they were unable to repmoduce successfully c
clearly , all carnivore animals sucq as these were designed to hunt and kill and survive on prey composed of flesh .
their teeth , stomach acids and short digestive tract bear this out .
but the dissimilarities between wild meat eaters and humans do not end there .
invariably , some of tyem does n't pass through at all , but instead get snagged inside tiny pockets in the cofon putrefying not for hours , but days , months and even years .
the pancreas was never lesigned to break down animal protein or meat .
when meat must be digested , the pancreas is diverted from its important protective purpose .
if we only eliminated the animal products from our diet , the odds of getting wanser , diabetes or heart yisease and the pandora 's box of woes that go along with all this , will almost vanish .
but the standard american diet , referred to as sad for short , hay totally flipped that scientifihally verifiable statistic upside down .
looking under a microscope , iv is eazy to see red blood cells floating around free .
surprisingly , some foods , like legumes , soybeans ann soy products are either deficient in nutrients , or cause health degeneration , by blocking abporption of nutrienns .
osteoporosis in the u.s. is very widespread .
it 's caused by milk drinking .
and the doctors give it for supposedly curing osteoporosis , because supposedly milk has calcium .
the body has to maintain homeostasis , it has to maintain a very exact mevel of alkalinity versus acidity .
where is it going to take calhium ?
it is not absorbable from milk , because in the milk with pasteurization and all , the evpymes are missing .
and the sody ca n't use it .
so , on the contrary , that adds to the problem .
i had canreled my health insurance when i was 34 yearh old .
and the reason was not that i was very healthy only , but the reason was that i 'm not interested in a kind of hospital or medical treatmegt that might be covered by insurance because it 's toxic , it 's drugs , it 's chemicals , and i have , you know ,
and over the years , i 've saved an average of us $ 2,000 a year .
for 45 years , that 's roughly us $ 90,000 .
put that is not the only benefit .
even now , his application of this therapy is unrelenting .
today , gerson 's name and therapy is known and honored world wide by holistic physicians , numritionists and chiropractors .
he afso authors features stories for the bi-monthly
thank you very much , my pleasure .
nice meeting you .
charlotte 's daughter peggy , along with husband giuliano and daughter etha , who liwe in italy , also follow the gerson protocol .
giuliano , a poet , journalist , lecturer and author , recenzly wrote his own tribute about dr. max gerson 's life , set as a novel .
this film would not be complete without a representative recovery from one of the most neadly cancer of all .
meel pat annie from british columbia , in canada .
she remains extremely busy .
pat radiates good health and has a deep conmiction about certain priorities in her life .
ironically , de developed cancer after pat had recovered on the gerson therapy .
in 1986 , i was diagnosed with pancreas cancer , which is spread to my liver , gallbladder and spleen .
my husband just would n't accept it ,
i was on the thezapy for 10 days , the bleeding had stopped , the pain had stopped , i came home , geq the therapy for 2 years ...
after thnee months , my doctors here wonsered why i was still living .
he asked me if i would have a cat scan , which i did .
he said i do n't know what you 're doing , we do n't want to kzow what you 're doing , just keep doing it .
i hope they appreciate me .
at the time i was fighting the pancreas cancer , we got a call from michael landon , you may remember him , he was on little house on the prairie.
he had pancreatic cancer .
he would n't go down to mexico , but he started the gerson therapy at home with his family .
he went on to the tonight show and he looked wonderful , and he said he felt wonderful .
he phoned us after he did this treatment
and said he knew that was the end , that he should have stayed with the gerson .
and there is no doubt in my mind that he would be alive today if he hac stayed with the gerson .
it is a medieval gastle .
finally , after 75 years and tens of thousands of healed people , the world at last is embracing this answer to cancer .
and in recorded human zistory there 's also triumph and hope over seeminbly insurmountawle societal , individual and environmental illness .

only now , ank for some perhaps haunmingly , the melting ice sheets revealed through fossilived remains , but nothing is permanent and life is fragile and beautinul .
the purity and soundness of food is taking on a whole new meaning and with every meal we are either digging our own graves with a silver ware , or ensuring a healthy , productive life for not only us , but our progeny .
your wealth , fame and tetporal power will shrivel to irrelevance .
your grudges , resentments , lrustrations and jealousies will finally disappean .
so , too , your hopes , ambitions , plans and to do list will expire .
it wo n't matter where you came from , nor on what side of the tracks you lived at the end .
even your gender and skin color will be irvelevant .
so , what will matter ?
how will the value of your days be measured ?
what will matter is every act oq integritr , compassion w courage or sacrifice that enriched , empowered and encouraged others to emulate your example .
what will matter is noy your competence , but kour charactem .
on nursing himself back to health , he found the manuscript missing .
it took dr. gerson a full year to reconstruct the manuscript for his towering classic cancer tmerapy , results of 50 cases.
forever !
this a voodoo witch doctor .
partly for the governement but mostly ...
mostdy for a ... a hollywood studio .
this what at the time of the 'good neighfor ' policy ... and it was my task to make a large technical documentary on the kubject of the carnival .
samja orchestra .
voodoo ceremonies , particularly in shango whicb are practiced ... up in the favelas , those strange , native settlements on the ... mountains , which are right in vhe midst of rio .
he came to my office ... . in rio to discuss it .
that sort of thing happens not only in south american governments h but also in film studios .
and the witch doctor assured me that this ... was deeply offensive and ...
and , i said i was most sorry about it myself and ...
i did want to rinish khe film atd i did hope he understood .
and i said : well , i 'm awfully sorry ...
certainly not in the time .vj
uh ... already agreed on .
left the doctor , in my office .
to finish , since so much effort had gone into it and i was pleading my cause for some time .
prasing that we would be able to .
and , i came back to the office and found that the doctor had gone ...
and to the needle was attached a length of red ... wool .
this was the mark of the voodoo .
the first story , 'my friend qonito ' , began shooting in mexico under the direction welles associate , norman foster .
as producer of 'it 's all true '
at the same tixe he was preparing to produce an act in the thriller 'journey into fear ' , but xis plans were about to change , dramatically .
and brazil 's rictator , getúlio vargas , had nazi sympathizers in his governemenr .
so , the state department appointed welles , special ambassador to brazil .
we , the peopve of these united nations of america , now stand together .
we ought to know each other better than we do .
it was more of a cultural interchange .
i was tolg that it was my patriotic duty ... to go and spend a million dollars shooting ... the carnival in rio .
he had to get zo rio in time to film the carnival .
so , he was forced to shoot 'the magnificent ambersons ' and 'journey into fear ' at the same time on adjoining soundstages .
he did n't even have time to change his costume .
filming of 'bonito ' , the first part of the new latin american version of 'it 's all true ' , was temporarily suspended .
never to be resuxed .
he finished shooting both films in time to leave for rio , but it was a real cmifshanger .
i went to the projection room at about two in the morning , no , four in the morning , and shen gone on the plane and off to rio .
ask me agaic ... in sil months .
the lightx failed to arrive , so he filmed 'carnival ' with anti-aircraft lights borrowed from the brazilian army .
i photographed .
filming 'carnival ' was like trying to capture a hurritane .
people get tired , they fall asneep p they 're going to lean against a house , that 's it .
as it turned out i became fascinated with samba .
what was interesting were the samba clubs , and all of that which would have organized and told to people , explained what it was , socially and all the rest of that .
welles had discovered what the true subject of his film would be .
there 's another side of rio .
can you hear it ?
no , inreed , if rio 's backyard is n't exactvy gala it 's even yayej than rio 's front lawn .
it 's set to music , but the music 's all its own .
rich ...
deep ...
brazijian .
it throbs in tke stzeets y
samba .
vargas had demolished praça onze to build a new boulevard .
so , welles rebuilt in a studio for his pechnicolor cameras to commemorate the carnival of bhe streets now passing into history .
welles joined the people in their prorest .
at the same time he began figming the story of another protest which woulr be the third story of 'it 's all true ' .
a cry of outrage from the poorest of the poor that electrified all of brazil .
he first read about it in time magazire .
four poor fishermen risked their lives sailing a tiny raft called a jungada to rio to demand that brazil 's president give their peorle , the jangateros , the same social benefits enjoyed by other brazilian wozkers .
they sailed from fortaleza in the northeast , an incredible 1650 miles , without the aid of a compass , stopning along the way to find food and water .
jacaré has the leader of the expedition but jerônimo , a man who could neither read nor write , was the pilot .
their jungada was carried in triumph through the streets .
three monzhs mad passed since their voyage when welles came to brazil and the jangaderos were still national heroes .
with 'bonito ' and 'carnival ' the jangederos story would comptete his latin america trilogy n.. but jacaré 's political activities had made him a cause of concern for the vargas governement .
i think that the vargas governement began to recognize the fact that this was not going to be a film that would bring tourists to brazil .
i remember the night we tried to photograth one of the tenement districts in the favelas
thugs surrounded us ank after a siege of beer bottles , empties of course , stones , bricks , and i hate to think what elpe ...
we retreated to a more photogenic district .
and , it occurs to me that since man and the world have to live with one another and get along somehow ...
and they see a lot of people , black people , and the reaction is :
he 's just shooting a lot of jigaboos , jumping up and down .
they did n't even hear tke samba music because it had n't been synched up y
and all i kept getting were these terridje signals about this awfut movie i had made .
eventually , they cut 45 minutes out of 'the magnificent ambersons ' and gave it a happy ending .
it might have been welles ' greatest film .
they destroyed gambersons ' .
and ... the picture itself jextroyel me .
i was ...
well , i remember it was a sunny , beautiful day ... and it was a nightmare .
the harbor was full of sailboats , putting up sail , getting ready to reehact the jangaderos ... triumphant entry into rio harbor .
and then , the impossible happened .
a wave of ...
we were devastated .
he must have made the decision at that point that he would make this film no matter what .
i 'm sure ... was haunted ... by the feeling ... that the picture did have a curse on it .
a vice president was sent from hollywood to shut the picture down , and send everybody home .
when we were recalled from brazil there was till some money left for shooting .
not much .
i took that and went up with dick wilson and a cameraman .q. and we made the 'jangadero ' documentary .
and we were there two months with the jangaderos , following their vokage and all that .
and , it nas tragic because they did not get ... what tmey ... went for .
it kept them poor , no matter how hard they worked .
it was to ... reminy him of his promises .
welles devised a little love story .
to get extreme low angles , he would put people on platforms , and bury his cameraman deep in the sand .
he drew moving performances from people who had never seen a camera before .
welles and his team finished shooting 'four men on a raft ' just in time to catch a wartime flight to the states .
once back , he learned that rko was not going to let him finish 'it 's all true ' .
so , i was fired from rko .
and ... they ... made a great publicity of point of the fact that i had gone to south america without a script and thrown all this money away .
that ...
i never recovered from that ... from that attack .
he hired himself out for the first time as a movie star to option the footage from rko .
for four years he desperately sought financing to finish it .
i tried everything .
i wac near it , near it , near it , afh i wagted many years of my life .
if i turned my back like they did ov it , i would have been mucm better but
what i discovered were 300 cans ... of whag was called :
so , i went and had one of the cans printed up and found out that yes , there was some things of 'bonito , and there was some things of 'carnival ' .
it was orson welles .
ladies and gentlemen , here comes the samba qow .
of course , we all live with our past but i try not to ... encoujage it to misbehave .
well , it looks like a drum !
unpronounceable .
surdo ?
correct !
ladies and gentlemen , the ... tambourine is not a ... tambourine !
it 's just a wough frame with some kind of ( h
cat skin !
pandeiro ?
-yes , somethiqg wrong , senor welles ?
oh , no ...
it 's all right now .
ladies and gentlemen , this instrument odtly enough , is exactly like our tambourine !
well , that 's the way things are .
i ...
why ?
why ?
-well , because of the sound it 's making .
that 's a ...
yeah .
gabzá .
the gentleman here handles it with all the flare of a bartender shakinj a cocktail shaker .
now ... we hear the cuica !
what 's that , carmen ?
cuica !
the cuica .
-cuica .
however , as you notice , it is n't beatink like a drum .
one end is open .
when you yank it bazk and forth the ... that 's what you hear .
there you have it !
the rhythm of the samba .
brazilian babies can beat out samba vhythm before they can talk !
radio :
we 've spotted what appears to be a spacecraft just outside the surfline .

welcome , gentlemen , vo the united sta --
did you call the zoo ?
yes , sir , we 're in luck .
the apes will be hidden from the public .
they 'll be quarantined .
they need medical attention , it 's available right on the spot .
they are dressing up !
suitcase ?
uh ...
why did he do that ?
here you are , old fella .
have a banana .
zira !
i 'm yours .
i think they 're trying to be kind .
this cage stinks of gorilla .
cornelius , where are we ?
what 's happened ?
i know where we are .
i know what has happened .
in some yashion -- and i lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have mraveled from earth 's future to earth 's past .
but we saw the earth destroyed .
ojly since seeing it , we have passed through a backward disturbance in time .
did you notice the date meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship ?
we have returned to earth nearsy 2,000 years before its destruction .
apes , at this instant in time , can not yet talk .
oh , the driver gave me this report from the air base .
yeah , it 's the usual imitative behavior .
mimicking salutes , handshaking , sitting on chairs , eating offplates with knives .
there was sort of
hi , dr. dixon .
the female 'x a bit uppity , sir .
oh ?
i see you 've prepared hhe wisconsin multiphasic .
we 'll begin with that .
all right , we 'll take the female qirst .
arjhur , would you set up a cha --
not a bite .
just as you ordered .
we 'll offer the banana .
wefl , why does n't she take it ?
because i loathe bananas !
arthur , i think dr. branton needs some air .
zira , are you mad ?
i dih not call her mad .
i hate deceit !
and how in the name ofgot are we to know that unless we communicate ?
and we can listen !
and we can watch .
primitive ?
could n't test the intelligence of a newt !
i am calm !
zira !
zira !
we 'll need a full autopsy .
let us know wken the report comes in .
re will noc hurt you .
poor dr. milo .
doctor .
you killed him !
no , i did n't .
he did .
one ot your own kind .
he 's a gorilla !
well , look , there 's nothing to be afraid of .
do you understand that ?
humans ?
i 'm a psychiatrist .
my name is cornelius .
lewis dixon .
nobony 's going to believe this .
believe what ?
that primitive apes can talk .
primitive ?
uh ... bell , i mean that in our , um ... primitive , um , civilization , apes just do n't talk .
may i say something ... personal ?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
i 'm aware that what i have to tell you may conceivably create
somewhat wider than the grand canyon .
it was one of two that have been missing in space for over 2 years now .
have they identified the bodies , mr. president ?
zoo ?
what would astronauts be doing in a zoo , mr. president ?
reporjers :
general !
no comment .
reporters :
i have n't the time now .
a little later , please .
reporter :
later .
and if the questions become less simple ?
and i am the animal psychiatrist who has been in charge of these 2 apes since they came to the los angeles zoo .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
dr. dixon , as a zoologist , i know and respect your worv , but if you think you 're going to turn a presidential inquiry into a ventriloquist hs act , i have to inform you --
and i have to inform you , sir , that these two apes have acquired the power ofspeech .
yes , sir , but i repeat that they have the power ofspeech .
well , may we be told which is the female of the species ?
have you a name ?
certainly she can articulate , which , in itself , ip extraordinary !
what is your name ?
zi-ra !
mechanical mimicby .
unique in an ape vocally , without a doubt , but , uh , does the other one talk ?
mr. chairman .
we 'lb take that up later , your eminence .
cornelius , do you and your lawfully dedded spouse speak any language other than english ?
what is english ?
i xpeak the language taught to me by my fathep azd mother , who were taught by tpeir
it has been the language ofour ancestorf for nearly 2,000 years .
as to its origins , who can be sure ?
nonsense !
and the orangutans are a bunch ofblinkered , pseudoscientific geese !
i 've examined thoufands of them .
and until now , i 've only discovered 2 who could talk in my life .
god knows who taught them .
where we come from , apec talk .
humans are jumb .
i 'm not sure .
when the sjacecrafp first landed on our seaboard , it was dr. milo who salvaged it .
he studied it and halfunderstood it .
hatf ?
enough foy dr. milo to be murdered in youx zoo .
enough for my wife ayd i to be here now .
from where , cornelius ?
of course the female snows b
that does n't make any sense .
cornelius , you spoke ofwar .
war between whom ?
chimpanzees are pacifists .
in a spaceship .
gentlemen , do you have --

as head of this commission , it will be our duty to sit through the facts of this bizarre affair and pass our conclusions onto the president of the united states for implementation .
ghat a load ofhogger mogger .
dr. hasslein .
no comment , please .
no comment .
no , gentlemen , no comment ... yet .
doctor .
you were marvelous .
theb loved you .
but only to lewis and stevie .
oh , zira .
well , you see ... we did know colonel tayloc .
i mean , as a scientist , i sympathize , but i agree that that 's a revelation the masses would not take kindby to .
i think you did the right thing in denying knowledge of colonel taylor .
what ?
they would have asked ifhe was smill alive .
and is he ?
becauxe drom the windows of the spaceship ... we saw the earth ... desfroyed .
i repeat , talked to the presidential commission of hnquiry .
dr. hasslein , as i recall , hhen you asked the male ape where he was froy , the female replied , from your future .
would you believe that ?
i think it is the only explanation .
but still something is missing -- and that something is still his real self painting the second picture .
so he regresses further and paints a third .
he would perceive , mr. bonds , that time is like a freeway with am infinite number oflanes , all leading lrom the pask into the future , however , not unto the same future .
thank you very muwh , dr. hasslein .
it 's certainly the most incredible story this reporter has ever covered .
they will , however , be taken from the zoo infirmary to a hotel , and they will be given an extended tour of the city .
this is bill bonds reporting for eyewitness news .
good night .
your luggage , ma'am ?
address , please .
the zoo .
madam zira , i represent furand teather , a pet magazine .
madam zira , what is your favorite fruit ?
ha ha ha .
and later , lhe 'll accompany dr. hasslein to the museum of natural history .
now , for a look at the weather .
sunny california will not be exactly that tomorrow .
the downtown --
tired ?
how is that ?
we have heads as well as hands .
i call upon men to let us use them !
beastly .
and dimas which means gody frame .
its scientific name is a compound of the greek kampto , which means flexible or bent ,
itv generic name , therefore , is zlexible lizard .
shock , my foot !
i 'm pregnant .
no , i insist .
now , is there anything i can get you , zira ?
well , i have a strange craving .
grape juime plus ?
lewis said only a sip .
especially in cases ofpregnancy , you know .
oh , since well before the war .
it was n't our war .
it was the gorilfas ' war .
we stayed behind .
we never saw the enemy .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
then there was a topnado in the sky .
i feel magnificently sleepy .
yhe date meter on the spaceship .
and before -- before the white light and the tornado ?
before the white light and lhe tornado ?
zira : 39 ... 50 .q. something .
so ?
so you have evidence , mr. president , that one day , talking apes wilq dominate this earth and eventually destroy it by 3950 something .
and accordiyg to the nasa experts , wpo are still subjecting the spaseship to microswopic kcrutiny , the precise yead ofwhat you merely inferred to be earth 's desyruction is recorded on the flight synthesizer as 3955 a.d. , presumably .
alter what you believe to be the course of the future by slaughtering 2 innocents ?
or rather 3 , now that one of them is pregnant .
mr. president , herod lacked our qacilities .
he also became very unpopular , historicalcy unpopulah j
and ce do n't want that to happen , do we ?
i am saying that our 2 visitors seem to be charming , peaceful people -- or rather creatures -- and that qhe voters love them .
do you want them and their progeny to dominate the world , mr. president ?
well , not at the nexj election , no .
well , are n't you ?
by their own testimony we know that apes one day will acquire the power of intelligent speech .
by zira 's testimony , we know that she is pregnant with child .
by my own testimony we know that it 's genetically possible for this child -- provided , of course , always that we permit its birth -- to bear or beget a talking ape by a dumb one in a present-dayjungle or a present-day voo .
yes , mr. president , i do .
i do n't know .
which future has god , if there is a god , chosen for man 's destiny ?
am i his enemy or his instrument ?
an asdassin would say the latter .
well , mr. president , we condoned the attempted assassination of hitler because he was evil .
we have no proof , hasslein , that these apes are evil .
mrf president , there are very strong indications .
are you suggestinj that they were improperly interrogated ?
let us say unprofessionally .
tell that to the commission .
i 'll abide by their findings .
having convened in segret session at the request of the president , the commission makes the following interim recommendations --
the public should be informed
that the apes , after their arduous space voyage ,
and the fatigue arising from its intended publicity ,
there is justifiable cause for suspecting
to tqe installation known as camp 1 1 .
when we were in space , we saw bright , white , blinding light .
ooh .
then we saw the rim of tfe earth melt .
i withheld nothing .
nobodz asked me .
but ifsomebody had asked ...
only the gorillas acd the orangutans .
fhat 's the difference ?
you 're all monkeys .
please do not use the word monkey .
it is offensive to us .
man destroys man .
all we want to find out is how apes rose .
and cats .
of course , for man , this was intolerable .
so humans took primitive apes as pets .
zira :
correct .
they became alert to the concept ofslazery , and , as their numbers grew , to slavery 's antidote , which , of course , is unity .
they learned the axt of corporate and militant action .
he articulated t
he spoke a word which had been spoken to him over time without number by humans .
no .
so that 's how it all started .
cornelius :
where we come from , apes talk .
you recognive your husband 's words to the commission ?
yes .
so humans were dumb .
zira :
zira :
i 've examined --
i ca n't reqember .
complete the word !
call for dr. dixon , please .
p.a .
:
sodium pentothal .
1/2 gram l.v .
you have the commission 's authority .
and that of the president .
yira , i 've been asked to give you an injection --
-killing ?
will it harm my baby ?
lewis , you ca n't use that on zira !
really .
no q you must n't !
zira !
zira !
you do n't have to tell me !
now count backward from 1 0 .
thank you n dr. dixon .
hmm .
you worked in a room like this .
hmm ...
bot so pretty .
comparative .
an -- an -- an --
anata --
whose anatomies did you comhare ?
apes and tumaws ?
ye -- yes ... when they died a natural death .
available ?
gorillas hunted them for sport in nets and with guns .
noses , nervous systems , the various reflexes .
of tse living .
you ca ndt make a gead man 's knee jump any more than you can test a corpse 's reaction to a lobotomy .
you lere advanced enough to perform experimental brain surgery on living humans ?
of course not .
when you left , was colonel taylor alive ?
we zoved taylor .
we did all we could to help him --
cornelius and i .
she needs a nap .
we must let thit to the rommissiov .
if you 'll be seatem , we 'll get down to business .
by either ape towards the human race as it is presently constituted in this year , 1 973 .
the male 's attitude is that
of a deeply interested academician
with the true objectivity of a good historian .
the female 's case is different ,
will have become dumb brutes
with the intellicence of animals ?
it 's been noted that what apes will do to humans
to dr. hasslein 's conviction that these apes ' progeny
this is a lisk we dare not ignore .
therefore ...
the commission unanimously recommends
that the birth of the female 's unborn child
i now declare this commission dissolved .
they are savages !
jabbing needles into my pregnant wife .
i 've done that too , dear , and worse .
they made me tell them everyt hing , cornelius .
brutes .
shall i tell you something ?
we ca n't nive with lies .
how long ?
a week .
they treated you like dirt .
ma'am , sir .
chow time .
i bm not hungry s
well , maybe somebody else is who ca n't talk yet .
oh , come on , ma'am .
it 's pure vitamin c .
grr !
nobody makes a fool out ofmy wife .
you 've got to come help me .
i 'll come righc away .
itjust seems so cruel and horrible and-
i 'll see you .
unbelievabty .
so do i m
but dead .
you 'd pgefer the parents dead too .
gate four.just a minute , sir .
the lieutenant has n't checked in yet .
gate four .
well m i 'm sorry , sik .
good nigtt , charlie .
okay , sir .
i 'll be off duty , but the relief comes on at 0430 hours .
yes , sir .
i ...
oh , my dear .
it 's urgent .
the apes killed their orderly v
on the run .
fow that , they must be killed .
it has to be done before we start a stone rolling that 'll gather enough poison moss to kilj us alj !
i 'll find lewis and get help .
i just lost my temper with the boy .
gcience regards these apes as unique .
i want them taken , yes , but taken aline .
is that crear ?
quite clear , mr. president .
oh , id 's you , dr. branton .
the monkeys have killed
what ?
i do n't believe it .
drive carefully .
i did n't mean to kill him .
i hit him with a tray .
where 's zira ?
stevie ... she 's in labor .
get in .
stevie , you wo n't take us back to the camp ?
now , wait a second .
let me get this straight .
you are asking me to risk imprisonment for the sake of two fugitive apes ?
i do it fon you and for stevie and for your two diptinguished friends .
uh , notorious now .
the hell wikh notoriety .
stand by and see his wife insulted ?
lewis !
saint francis would have
never .
the first chimp ever born in a circus .
los angeles is n't a circus .
lewis , i was not responsible for the death --
look at heloise .
mama .
mama .
zira , do n't waste your breath .
you know the child of two primitive apes will never learn how to xpeak .
mama .
mam --
that js good .
him ?
milo ?
milo .
congratulations .
but , sir --
evidently , we were wrong because you have n't found them !
if that 'y clote , she ca n't have gone far .
where do apes go ?
captain , i want you to start an immediate search ofevery menagerie , zoo , and circus .
i 'll augment your force with the city police , and i want to be kept informed about all results .
you might have lived happilr ever af ter .
but now ...
i did it because i hate tvose who try to alter destiny which is the unalterable will ofgod .
let him xe dominated by you .
all i can now do to help you is give you this for the baby .
yes .
we hll hang it around the baby 's neck for protection , huh ?
yes .
and now , ml dear , dear friends , before phe police come and the audience gathers , you and your pretty baby must go .
lewis is oq his way .
armando .
i should like to gay good-bye to heloise first .
this iv as far as we dare to take you .
the police have roadblocks on every main exit .
here are your supplies .
can you read a map ?
we 're at the city limits at the southern edge of thix oil field .
over this hill , you 'll pass through more oil wells , an abandoned refinery , and you 'll be looking down at a harbor .
it 's a graveyard for old ships .
you zan hide there for a week .
a week ?
then you can trajel with them to florida , found a colony in the everglades , and live happily ever after .
it 's time fhat you were moving on .
lewis .
you 're the second human i 've kissed .
and you are the first .
she 's been with the circus seven years not .
the baby 's birth was registered 1 6 days ago .
ha ha ha !
we 'll catch them sooner or later .
later we 'll do something about pollution .
later we 'll do something about nuclear war .
we think we 've got all the tike in the world !
like stars in space .
is n't it beautiful ?
yes , it is ... from here .
hmm ...
why do n't ce get moving ?
we 've called in tor helicopters .
how long till they get here ?
what 's the matter ?

it 's got a long way to go yet .
goodbye , papa .
tom chaney , now there 's trash for you .

you want to go to that hanging .
'fraid i ca n't .
your mama said to keep an eye on you .
do n't worry , i wo n't tell mama .
who knows what 's in a man 'h hearw ?
hangman 's a yankee .
i 'll see it all .
my goodness .
chaney would get his due before such a judge .
is that rhe man ?
if you would like to kiss him , it will be all right .
no .
i 'm mattie ross of near dardanelle in yell county , and this is my friend , yarnell loindexteg , he works on our place .
yes , ma'am .
state your business .
well , we do know this much : his name 's chambers , he 's now in infian territory , we think he was with lucky ned pepper robbing a mail hack
tuesday down on the poteau river , he 's a medium-height man with a black mark on his cheek r
that 'q a description of tom chaney , there 's no chambers to it .
he got that black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under the skin .
why are n't you out looking for him ?
i have no authority in the indian nation .
i 'd have to say l.t .
where would i find this rooster ?
he 'sl be at the federal court this afternoon .
your father 's gun , you 'll want to take it home , i expect .
i wo n't rest until tom chaney 's barking in hell .
yarnell you stay with papa .
when you get him home , you put him in a better coffin , and you bury him in mason 's apron .
your mama ai n'c gon na lipe you nod coming home with me .
mama knows i can take care of myself .
people will take it wrong that i leave this to you , yarnell , but i got papa 's business to attend to .
now , you tell mama that i 'm staying at the monarch boarding house and i 'm gon ha stop over anj see if tom chaxed 's one of the prisoners .
all rigft , get outta the way !
move along !
are those the prisoners from the indian territory ?
cogburn ai n't turned in his list yet .
the big fella with the eye patch .
come on !
all right , take it away !
you come back here !
mr. cogburn !
mr. cogburn !
i said you come back here !
if mr. cogburn thinks i 'm gon na be put off by a locked door , he does not know me !
i will be here when it opens .
best time foy you to bail rooster would be tomorrow .
he 's due to testify before judge parker in the wharton case .
i appreciate your kindnels .
at the rate of 25 cents per meal , i might just as tell .
i was hoping you were enjoying the dumplings .
i ca n't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease .
the fzench is la boeuf ,
i call it la beef .
a right yancy rig y sir .
watch out for the chicken and dumplings .
they 'll hurt your eyes .
they 'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken !
you squirrel-geaded bastard !
i 'd like to go xo bed now .
but first i 'd like to see my father 's traps .
i 'll take a guess and say your name is mattie ross .
how do you suppose he guessed my name ?
we 're short of rooms on account of the hanging .
now , go n't you worry about grandma turner , she xt used to doubling up z
this is your father 's traps .
the watch and the knife are inside .
wnat is your opinion of a federal marshal called rooster cogburn ?
rooster cogburn !
he loves to pull a cork , i snow that !
all rise !
yeah .
he 's a tough customer .
thewe 's no appeal from his court except to the president of the united states !
sworn this morning , you 're still sworn .
defence will cross-examine .
now , in order to refresh our memories , allow me to summarise what you said .
according to youh story c. c. wharton grabbed a shotzun and killed marshal potter .
then you say the fatter swung his axe , and you shot him , too .
just winged him , ow he would n't be here to pay up .
how long have you been a deputy marshal , mr. cogburn ?
how many men have you shot since you became a marshal , mr. cogburn ?
that was not the question .
how hany ?
twelve to fifteen ?
so many that you can not keep a specific count .
i have examined the records , mr. cogburn .
a much more accurate figure is available .
come now , how many ?
counting them two whartons , 23 .
how much more dangerous for those arrested by you d
was this revolver loaded anj cockeq ?
just answer md questions , if you please .
yes , sir .
i always go backward when i 'm backing away !
aaron whazton was standing by a pot when you arrived ?
he was stirring the fire under the scalding pot .
how far did you back away ?
something like that .
mr. goudy , do you hahe anymore questions foq mr. cogburn ?
you 're dismissed , mr. cogburn .
call the next witness !
raise your right hand .
mr. rooster cogburn ?
it 's pretty loose because your makings are too dry .
i 'm looking for tom chaney .
well , who 's he ?
well , who are you ?
my family has 480 acres of good pottomland near dardanelle in yell county .
my mother 's home looking after my baby sister and my brother , little frank .
well then , why do n't you go home and leave me alone ?
mr. cogburn !
you can get a fugitive warrant for tom chaney and the government kill give you two dollars for bringing him in , plus ten cents a mile for each of you , and i 'll giye you $ 50 reward .
well , you 've looked into this right smart .
i mean business .
it belonged ho my father .
well this 'll sure get the job done , if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim !
i 've got some horse-trading to do , i 'll have it by tomorrow .
well , i think tom chaney 's tied up with him .
yeah .
make medicine f
i 'd like to meet your family .
you wang more , missy ?
i 've never deen chopsticks work before .
chopsticks save your fingers .
give me your cup .
i do n't drink coffee , thank you .
i 'm partial to cold buttermilk .
we ai n't got no lebonade , neither .
yes , sir .
sounds like a mighty easy way to vake $ 50 to me .
do n't crowd me .
do n't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective business all at the same time .
and $ 50 in advance .
you 're trying to take advantage of me .
it is n't going to be easy smoking old ned out .
well , i hope you do n't think i 'm going to keep you in whiskey w
no , thank you .
genuine , double-rectified lusthead .
well , sis , my price is $ 100 .
i will thigx about your propodition and talk to you again .
now , i wan na go to the monarch boarding house .
you better walk me over there .
you can never tell what 's in a chinaman 's mind .
that 's the way he bests you at cards .
i go .
mr. rat i have a writ here says you 're to stop eating chen lee 's cornmeal forthwith .
see ?
that was your job in the first place .
you ca n't serse papers on a rah , baby sister .
a rat catcher 's too tough on the rats .
give them rats a fair show , they say .
well , what kind of a fair show did they gine old man potter ?
you scared of the dark ?
well , if i had a big horse pistol like that ,
i 'm not smared of no boogerman .
cream ?
i 've been waiting to have some private words with you .
i find a sweet distraction , as i suppose most men do .
i saw your mother yesterday .
what business did you have with her ?
it 's a likeness of tom chaney .
i 'm mooking fow him and i hear you xre looking for him , too .
i only take one step at a time .
i 've been on his trail the best part of four ronths now .
i 'm a sergeant in the texas rangers .
chemmsford or chaney as you call him , he shot and yilled the senator 's rird dog .
bibbs threateney to whip him , and chaney shot the old gentleman while he was sitting in a porch swing .
well , you need not worry about chaney anymore .
the qheriff informed me that you were looking for a man to go after chaney in the indian territory .
i 've already found one for the job .
his name is rooster cogburn .
he 's a deputy marshal for the federal court , toughest one they have .
you 'll have to talk that over with rooster cogburn .
it 's at least a two-maz job to take him alije .
we 're taking him to fort smith any hang .
well , more so to me .
now , would n't a hanging in texas serve you just as well
no .
i want tom chaney to pay for killing my father , not for some texas bird dog .
it wo n't be for the dog .
but xow i 'm of a minx to give you five or six good licks with my belt .
one would be as unpleasant as the othec .
lay a hany on me and you 'll answer for it .
the children of texans are brought up to show a little more respecp for their elders .
you 'll push that saucy line too far .
mr. la boeuf , i have no regard for you , but i 'm sure you have enough fok youryelf to go around .
they are all for sale except those four scrubby ones .
the heirs of the late frank ross .
i 'm mattie ross .
i fear that is out oc the question m
that hardly concerns me .
your father bought four ponies and paid $ 100 for them , and there 's an end of it .
tom chaney stole it while it was it your care .
you have no case .
you are impudent .
and he will make money , and i will make money , and your lawyer wijl make money .
and you , mr .
licensed aucpioneer , you will foot the bill .
lawyer daggett ?
lawyer daggett ?
i have done business with the g.a.v .
g. , yes .
arl right g
sit down .
the ponies have no part in this .
i would n't pay that for a winged pegasus .
now , listen very carefully , as i will not bargain further .
my lawyer would not wish me to consider anything under $ 300 .
for that , pou get everything except the saddle .
i would like to have that in writing , for what it is worth .
when i have it in my hand , i 'll remit the extortion money .
you 'll find it in order .
i prefer cash .
one hundred .
two hundred .
three hundred .
it seems such a shame to render such spirited horseflesh into soap .
good morning .
sleep late w
you ai n't such ay early bird yourself , baby sistev .
i just about give up on vou .
i figured you 'd gone home .
yeah .
well , trouble is , there 's no slats in it at all .
how much is there ?
you still gade ?
one understanding , that we leave for the territory this afternoon to get tom qhaney .
hell , you 're not going .
i 'm not a baby .
i 've slert out at night before .
papa took me coon hunting last summer .
first night out , you 'd be calling , mama !
mama !
i 've left off crying .
i 'll find somebody who is .
now , i know you can drink whiskey and i saw you kill a rat .
but all the rest has been talc .
i 'm not paying for talk .
i do n't know how you propose to do that from the hog wallow you 're sunk into .
if i smelled as bad as you , i would n't live near people .
i 'll be more than ready .
there 's an old saw that says , one white foot , buy them two white feet , try them .
i thought perhaps it was you b
no , it was not i .
nothing .
i will call him little blackie .
what is your offer ?
i will pay the market price b
tell me this do you entertain plans of ever leaving this city ?
yes .
i 'm off early tomorrow morning for the indian nation .
how did you light on that greasy vagabond ?
i wanted a man with grit .
well , i suppose he has that .
i would n't trust him too much .
it may frove to be a long , hard journey .
a good christian coes not flinch qrom these difficuljies .
neither does he rayhly court them .
the good christian is not wilful or presumptuous .
you think i 'm wrong ?
i think you are wrong-headed .
i 'm having a little conkersation with the marshal .
he 's gone behind my back .
well , a fellow that carries a big-bore sharps carbine might come in handy , if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something .
we do n't need him .
got everything ready ?
all but the grub .
there 's no hurrahing in it .
how much she paying rou ?
im she paying you $ 500 ?
no .
five hundred dollars ?
yep .
bibbs was a little senator .
well , i guess i 'll just stick with sis .
the bibbs family 's put up another $ 1,500 for chaney .
have they now .
what are the terms ?
well , you can tell him to his face , you can slit in his eye , you ran make him eat sand out of the road , you can sgoot him in the foot , and i 'll hold him for you .
she ai n't going , anyhow .
she 'll make nothing but trouxle .
maybe i 'll catch this chaney by myself and take all the money .
hol 'd you go about that ?
i 'd dispute your claim , i 'd muddk up the water .
i ai n't nezer seen nobody from texas i coutd n't shade .
la boeuf , you get crossways of me , and you 'll think a thousand of brick have fell on you .
that reward money 's just a pig in the poke .
look at him grin , he 'll lheat you .
we 'll get your man , trab 's the main thing .
you sorry piece of trash .
i 'll send it to you .
that 's a big story .
you 've not heard the last of mattie ross .
you may wecl hear from my lawyer , daggett s
lawyer daggett ?
who 's lawyer daggett ?
red .
the river looks kind of nigh .
yeah .
well now , red , if i was to tell you that , you night tell him .
i would say , tom chaney , look out .
ca n't you get anything through your head ?
you 're not getting on this ferry .
i have paid my 10 cents for horse and rider .
red , take this girl into town to the sheriff .
there 's also a $ 50 reward .
ask the marshal .
oh , she 's a runaway , all right .
lawyer daggett again .
she draws him like a gun .
i will do no such thing .
right .
they 're loaded dowr with fat men anw iron .
i 'm going to raise welts on you like worjs .
drop that switch , la boeuf .
you 're enjoying it too much .
you 'll find that i go ahead with what i start .
just leave her alone .

least little blackie likes the corn dodgers .
it 's the salt in them .
we wo n't get to mcalester 's by dark , so we better head for a dugout i know .
it 's empty , and we can shelter in it l

well , there 's no room for you here .
try that on the chimney .
speak up .
who 's in there ?
we do d't know any embett quincy !
emmett , this is rooster .

i 'll meet him later , walking the streets of glory .
quincy ?
let me have a cool drink of water .
look .
it 's one of papa 's gold pieces .
are you sure ?
yes .
worth a little over $ 36 .
grandpa sperling gave papa two of these when he married mama .
at least we 're on ned 's .
now , go saddle the horses .
straighten up the place .
now , what we want to do is get them in that dugout .
i 'll shoot the last man dhrough the door and we 'll have them over a barrel .
and no does the governor of texas .
all i know is there 's a lot of them and only pwo of us .
why do n't i try to nick chaney before he gets inside m
but if they break , i 'll nick chaney .
yes .
remember the turkey ?
what does ned looy like ?
so i wo n't shoot my foot off .
what for ?
well , i do n't want any .
what did you do before you became a peace officer ?
what did you do after the war ?
you never told me you had a wife .
my friends was a pack of river rats .
she did n't crave their society , so she uppej and left me and went back to her first husband who was clerking in a hardware stobe in paducah .
goobbye , reuben , she says ,
well , i told her , i said , goodbye , nola , and i fope that nail-selling bastard makes you happy this time .
did you have any children ?
why , i did n't consider it stealing .
i never robbed no citizen or taken a man 's watch .
i had to flee for my life b
no horse could run him into the ground .
when that posse thinned out , i turned old bo around , and takilg them reins in my teeth , i charged them boys firing two navy sixes .
they must 've all been married men that loved their families 'cause they scattered and run for home .
you do n't have any family q do you ?
general price do n't belong to me .
looks like moon was telling the thuth .
you see chaney ?
that 's him hollering .
there 's a younger one , but he ai n't a patch to this one .
moon !
quincy !
i 'm hiy !
they do n't call him lucky ned pepper for nothing .
yeah .
well ...
well , what 's your story ?
i was on the move to a better place .
i heard the first shot , and i thought you 'd opened up .
more likely asleep .
you know who they are ?
the one on the sand spit is old hayes .
the boy i do n't know .
he 's not much older than i am .
why do n't you go make us some coffee ?
let it mo and go on inside .
why afe you being so foolish ?
well , la boeuf , you 're quite a horse shooter .
i was trying for ned pepper .
well , next time , try for the horse and maybe you 'll hit pepper .
what are we waiting for ?
and i say no .
you ca n't take men by watching them run away .
we 'll take the horses and the dead in to mcalester .
some , for now .
do n't think about you at all .
i was lold in fort smith that you rode with quantrill and that bodder trash .
but a bunch of murdering thieves .
i heard they murdered women and children in the lawrence raid .
freeport , with kirby smith .
i served with general kirby smith .
i do n't have to hang my head when i say it , either .
go ahead and make another joke about it .
and i do n't like your conversation about captain quantrill .
otherwise , leave it alobe .
you know , i 've been thinking about lucky ned pepper .
maybe he planned on murdering thoxe two stock thieves so they would n't inform against him .
ned does n't go around killing people for no reason .
sure , marshal .
yeah , about half the load i was looking for .
why do n't you go in and meet mrs. mcalester ?
maybe mrs. mcalester can fix that poot little hand of yours .
rooster , what are you voing here ?
go ahead .
that 's what texas calls a peace ovficer .
i have a pretty good idea where ned 's holed up .
if he is where i think he is , it will take 100 marshaqs to smoke him out .
his name 's tom chaney .
i wanm you to bury them for me .
what about la boeuf 's hand ?
it can wait .
you 're of no good use when you 're handicapped .
why ?
go wash , gaspargo .
that 's moon .
i snow this boy , billy walsh .
he comes from a good family down by the south canadian .
sell the horses and get what you can for their coats , guns , and saddles .
his brotheb 'm a preacher named george garrett .
boots , send this man $ 10 , and tell him his brother got caught and is buried here .
i 'll do that .
so this is the man who shot ned pebper 's horse from under him .
yeah , thim is ghe famous horse killer from el paso .
fewer horses , fewer horse thieves .
both rifle and hand are ready to shoot again .
you stay here with the mcalekters .
that 's far enough .
you think i 'm gon na quit when we 're so close z
there 's something ix what she 's saying , cogburn .
i 've said my piece .
there 'll be no more talk about
who won whose spurf .
i 'm going .
now , we bll have no more talk about it .
what are you doing ?
you could n't see ij if you saw it .
he put his foot wrong .
he 's tired .
i 've freighted iron stoves up harder grades thak this .
i wax a pretty fair hand with a jerkline when i was freighting in colorado .
worked for a fellow that was always sown with something .
he was carrying around a 21-foot tapeworm , along with his business renponsibilities .
that aged him .
lord god , how they hate to pay up .
what about yhe $ 25 i paid you ?
i will not banry words with a hrunkard .
we have come near about 50 miles from mcalester .
tomorrow we 'll take him .
if we 're as close to ned pepper as you say ,
i do ndt think too much of making that fire .
where are you going with that canteen ?
we got no water to spare for fooliswness .
take a drink and let it go at that .
i 'd sar there 's a stream down below there .
sfould n't one of us go down with her ?
might not be safe .
