gosh .
yeah .
well , we 'd better hurry .
hope they 're expecting us .
al right , gentlemen , we 've all had our say , and we all agree on this one vital point , we are clamping a tight security lid on professor brainard 's tremendous contribution .
oh , you 'll be recompensed .
goodness knows , the armed services are never chintzy .
matter of fact , i 'm putting two of my bavest financial officers on he mission .
professor , you are a fine , unselfish man .
it ' a privilege to know you .
but jus relax .
no sweat .
the money is as good as in your hands .
schedule four is going in .
well , professor , i do n't think we nee to take up any more of your time .
we have to stockpile statistics , build up pressure , deploy our firepower so we hit them from all directions .
well , no , i do n't suppose we do .
do n't let those double-breasted suits fool you 
those boys are tough .
well , the thing is , we do n't need all the money now .
it 's big .
everything about it .
everything is going to fall apart all the way down the line , and the free world loses another battle .
is that what you want ?
no , i would n't want that , sir .
remember , you 're in washington .
stop trying to be reasonable about money or you 're going to bollix up the whole thing .
you 'd think those people at te pentago could at least have given us a couple of $ 100,000 out of petty cash .
what 's gon na happen , professor ?
oh , roger .
i 'm sorry , biff .
i got ta face it .
the only time my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was when he got me .
is n't it magnificent , gentlemen ?
medfield college has , i believe the saying goes , finally come into the chips .
why do n't you just change the name of the place to brainard college and have done with it ?
a splendid idea , mr. hawk , though i realize it was offered in a spirit of irony .
we 'll be up to ou hips in crackpots .
no .
are n't you all getting a little high and mighty ?
oh , splendid .
ask him to come in , please .
gentlemen , would you be good enough to rise ?
when professor brainard comes in that door ,
i mean you , uh ...
well , you really should n't .
well , not exactly .
it 's just ...
they really sadbagged you .
they hung your hide up on the barn door to dry .
well ...
but i thought they were delighted with you discovery .
it 's just that ...
number one , the boys in washington latched on to your little discovery , so you ca n't sell it anywhere else .
number two , they 're not about to give you any moey until they think it over .
nuber three , meantime , you 've got no money .
number four , somebody better lay 350,000 clams on the barrelhead , first of the month by 9:00 a.m .
period .
end of story .
i ca n't believe you 'd do a thing like that , mr. hawk .
well , boys , it looks like i 'm calling the tune again .
i know how badly you must feel , president daggett , but things are n't as bad as they seem .
excuse me .
as a civic leader ...
pearls !
oh , i just love pearls .
i make it my business to know , mrs. brainard .
and now , little omething to keep the chill off .
oh !
oh , you must n't .
well , you do n't think it 's a little bit too fussy , do you ?
like you 've been wearing it all your life , mrs. brainard .
and here , the finishing touch .
an empress .
i do , do n't i ?
this , as you can see , is a check for one milion dollars made out to the professor and yourself .
for a kind word , mrs. brainard .
you know , in a business deal , the right word from te little woman ..
i 'm a reat believer in the power of a woman .
you really got something , mr. hurle .
well , i do n't know what ned s goin to say about all this .
for a space-age scientist , he 's a little bit old-fa ...
guess who ?
betsy !
what i 'd like to do ...
betsy , what is all this the dogs and that coat ?
please take it off .
now why do n't we let the little lady enjoy herself ?
mr. hurley is a live wire .
professor , when ou invented thi stuff , i do n't think you dreamed what you had .
do n't be so modest , professor .
that 's your trouble .
that 's whee i come in .
flubbermint gum , it chews while you snooze .
flubberin , bounces away pain again an again .
i them where they live .
they 'll wonder o tey got along without it .
howie , roll the film .
guess what this is ?
but , betsy ...
hi there .
newton and the law of gravity .
watt and the steam engine .
edison ad the electric light .
an , my friends ,
brainard and lubber .
for it was not too long ago , in a small american city , that the discovery of flubber burst upon a waiting world .
that was the beginning .
from those fist crude basketball shoes came more shoes , shoes for people in every walk of life .
he could walk with his head above the crowd 
but this was only the springboar , not only to a vast new line of products , but to a happier , safer way of life .
friends , is your home a booby trap just waiting to snare you the moment you set oot in it ?
i 'm home , ear .
is your kitchen a savage jungle teeming with perils and pitfalls ?
dear , where 's the first-aid kit !
stop clowning , george .
transform it from a booby trap into a love nes .
yes , flubbeize your home wit hazard-free flubberoleum floors .
the foamiest , friendliest floor that ever fondled your family 's feet .
hi .
sweetheart !
i got him !
they live in the house with the flubberoleum floors .
i 'm very impresed , mr. hurley , but ...
now if you 'll just sign this letter of agreement .
that millio-dollar check is he evidence of our good faith .
a prior commitment ?
wih who ?
all right , boys , pack up the gear .
the party 's over 
forget it .
you 've hurt mr. hurley very deeply .
oh !
now just a minute .
do i have to give this bac ?
i wo n't !
now give him his heck .
betsy , give me that check .
give it to me .
oh  very nice .
beautiful quality .
how do you do ?
my name is harker .
from washington ?
well , am i glad to see you .
come right in .
how do you do ?
it 's very nice to know you , mrs. brainard .
may i take your hat and coat , mr. harker ?
you an your discovery have certainly created quite a stir down in our nation 's capital .
and you 've ome aout the paymens ?
well , thank you .
oh , but first , of course , we 'd like to pinch off just a tiny bit for ourselves .
just enough to take care of the household bills that have been tacking up for moths .
all right , dear ?
internal revenue ?
the figure includes delinuent penalties of $ 12,895 at five pecent for the first two quarters .
let me explain , mr. harker .
now they put a top-secret classification on it .
i 'm not even supposed to talk to anybody about it .
certainly .
excuse me .
we 've been counting on you .
we trusted you .
you do n't build thoe rockets to the moon with green stamps , you know .
excuse me , dear .
joey 's here to collec for the paper .
i do n't think so .
there 's ten ents .
there 's another dime .
he wants his money .
there 's another dime .
that 's all i 've got 
we 're rooting for him all the way .
oh , ned , i cleaned all the loose change out of there .
oh .
but uncle sam has to run his store on current income jus like everyone else .
when the money he 's counting on does n't come i , he 's very sad .
thank you , mr harker .
thank you .
thank you , mrs. brainard .
uh , joey marriano .
and how many customers would you say he has on his route ?
oh , i 'd say around 30 .
you would n't take money from a child .
we do our part to keep the wheels of democracy roling .
funny you should mention that about mom .
we nailed her dead to rights .
i missed you .
i missed you , too .
i just could n't help feeling sorry for all those people .
now , you take that income tax man .
we 're citizens .
no sit down , and hol your breath .
oh ?
what does that mean , you got hold of the weather ?
what it means , ms. brainard , is that flubber was ony the key that unlocked a great storehouse of cosmic forces .
i found a gas .
do you realize what that would mea , betsy ?
it would mean that , for the first time , weather would become the slave of man , rather than his master .
ca n't it e something modest that would bring just a few dollars into this house ?
or trash can lids that would actually fit the top of trash cans !
trash cans ?
i 'd say i could use a little machine like that right now !
anything can happen .
anything !
i thought you were nuts !
right .
and they 're practicall national chams , right ?
right .
even y own father could n' close a college that had just clobbered the national champs , could he ?
what do you think the suit is for ?
i have n't bee hangin ' around professor brainard all semester just for kicks , you know .
what 's this ting supposed to do ?
how doe that feel ?
oh , hi , prof .
good .
oh , by the way , rofessor ,
oh .
glad to know ya , humphrey .
hi there .
oh , not exactly .
sir , science needs brilliant young minds like humphrey .
besides , i needed a volunteer .
for what ?
sir , i hope you wo n't mind , but i 'd like very much to borrow a litle flubber gas .
humphrey , come on , demonstrate .
there 's only thing , biff .
i do n't know how much protection those pads are going to give you .
oh , we 're not thinking about potection .
we 're thinkin aout offensive power !
just imagine , sir .
the teams line up .
the ball is snappe .
rutland linemen fal like ten pins in every direction !
he 's over for a touchdown !
yeah !
whaddya think  sir ?
i think you 're slightly nuts .
you go right ahead .
we 'll go on a cras proram right now .
thank you , sir .
now the flubber gas is violent , but we need even more violence , so we stimulate it electronically .
now , let 's see what we 've got .
now let s see .
you know , biff , this stuff is labeled dangerous .
oh , now , humph boy .
look , would i get you into a situation unless i knew exactly what i was doing 
that shoud do it .
i 've neer seen them so worked up .
when i bombard a cloud with a beam like this , it just has to lead to clustering .
rain al over the place .
now , for a cloud .
not a cloud in the sky .
ready .
aim .
charlie brainard !
betsy .
betsy .
and that 's only the beginning .
it 's a result of my fooling around with the molecular configuration of flubber gas .
all i ask of you is to get dressed for dinner .
whatever you say , dear .
oh , did n't i tell you , dear ?
no , i do n't think you did .
if there 's one thing i 'm certain you 're not , it 's narrow-minded .
it is n't as though he were coming all by himself .
we 're adults  you know , not children .
you do n't for one single minute mean ...
i 'll get it .
nuzzie !
it ' wonderful to ...
who is that ?
as soon as they unglue themselves ,
i 'd like you to meet an old friend of ned 's 
now wait a minute .
i do n't know any ...
i 'll be darned .
i 'll be doggone .
betsy , do you know who this is ?
no , nuzzie , who is it ?
it was long before i met you , betsy .
by gosh , mary lee , you 've changed .
well , i 've been married here and there , and , uh ,
paris , huh ?
did n't you know that ?
gosh , we used to have he times , did n't we , mary lee ?
betsy , there was one time when may lee and i ...
well , i guess that 's all water under the bridge , huh ?
well , uh , desiree was back in town , and i said to myself ,
old wood burns brightest ,
that 's très continental .
it 's so interesting seeing the kind of girl ed married .
well ...
a funny thing happened out in the lab today ...
we 're so different , you and i. i 'm the gay , irrepressible madcap flitting from flower to flower , and you 're the nice , sensible little homemaker .
n'est-ce pas ?
the wonderful thing about betsy is , she combines beauty with brains .
i think betsy 's sweet .
i think she 's just as sweet a she can be .
you know , i do n't thin you realize how luky you are .
i had to go through three marriages before i realized that ned was the kind of man i was looking for all along .
oh , is that so ?
sometimes i get all choked up inside thinking of it .
imagine going al the way to the other side of the world when the bluebird of happines was here all along .
oh , i 'm sorry , desiree .
yes .
poor , brave child .
what do you mean ?
there 's no reason to pretend ith us .
what 's it to you ?
it so happens i have just bee made
that 's terribly kind of you , and very flattering .
now , let 's hae no foolish pride .
just a minute , ned .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like a chance to express myself .
ned i did n't say i was going to take the position .
that is an absurdly old-fashioed attitude .
could i hae an onion instead of an olive this time ?
excuse me .
o 
if i 'd married him , i would have just spoiled him rotten .
you should n't take it this ay , brainar .
after all , what are friends for ?
here we go .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do n't wish to pry , but may i inquire hat this marvelous new discovery is ?
it 'll efect people all over the world .
may i ask how it works 
i bombard the clouds with a technique
i am not at the moment at libert to divulge .
oh , i see .
biff !
biff !
that is original thinking .
humphrey , are you all right ?
answer or i 'll blast you to ribbons .
noody in ere but us chickens .
dinner 's ready when you are .
fine .
flubber gas has a certain antagonizing effect on the atmosphere .
yeah ?
and today i 'm really going to stir it up .
like that big , fat cloud out there .
come on , humph 
let 's get suied up .
will you stop worrying so much ?
well , why could n' you test the suit with a chimpanzee ?
they need it there too .
switch on .
all right , here we go .
now ..
cry a little .
maybe we 're going to have a change in the weather , dear .
yes .
just nothing .
well , you ca n't blame betsy .
no !
i just do n't see how you can bring yourself to sell it .
let 's see .
there 's 40 , 60 ...
broken windows ?
sure , captain .
sure .
hanson , kelly !
somebody answer me !
i hear water !
we 're just gettin ' the car washed .
no , no , no !
we do n't pay off on that !
read the small print !
hol on .
now look .
and that goes fo all of ya !
absolutely nothing .
you can come out now , charlie .
well , charlie  maybe i was wrong .
it wo n't be the first time we 've struck out , will it ?
hey , where do we put this stuff ?
our est site 's over here .
what 's the big secret ?
you 'll find out soon enough .
rainmakers have always run into that same old snag .
wait a minute , charlie .
or ould it ?
now , this must have integrated the vaporific forces and promoted the coalescence of the interatomic junctures .
poor lamb .
oh , yes .
hugs and kisses .
arrivederci .
well , that puts the tin hat on it !
gt , dh .
we 've made our own cloud !
and it 's raining !
oh  my notes .
now i know ow those texas oil felas feel when a gusher comes in .
where 's my pen ?
hey , come on , biff .
you know , this is n't the first time we 've been roped in on some half-baked idea of yours .
you kno  it was n't my idea entirely .
the professor 's in on thi too .
just as good as .
'cause if the prof says it 's okay ... raining you know it 's raining
bets !
betsy !
bety , i made a cloud , and i made it rain .
out of the moisture in the air around us .
well ...
seaking of things going on under our noses , have you been seeing desiree de la roche ?
i may have bumped ito her a couple of times .
she phoed a while ago , metioned something about a little get-together tomorrow night .
said that you d know al about it .
why , i have n't the ...
wait a minute .
there was some talk about a party .
ha !
i was on my way home from class , and she just happened to be riving by ...
what ?
if i was n't such a sweet , innocent-minded little wife 
mar lee ...
do me a personal favor and stop calling that woman a girl !
well , anyway , underneath all that glamour and gaiety and intelligence is realy a simple , kind-hearted peron .
betsy , i hate to say this , but i 've noticed a hange in you lately .
it all seemed to start the night that sneak shelby ashton came over and ere offered you that job .
i told you i did n't ant tat job , but i 'm beginning to change my mind .
betsy , are you going somewhere ?
if it were n't or that , i 'd know exactly what to do .
yes , i 'm going somewhere where i can thik clearly .
think clearly ?
desiree does n't mean anything to me , betsy .
well , you should 've eard her on the phone when she thought she was talking to you .
but , betsy , that 's just her way .
ned , i 'm going to the daggetts ' for a few das .
betsy .
betsy , ou ca n't go anyplace .
i did n't do anything to it .
please , bets , ca n't we reason this out ?
but , betsy , you 're not being very logical aout this .
ready , humph ?
oof !
who 's in there ?
that 's it .
i qui .
look , ater all you 've been through , you 're not gon na turn chicken .
you 'd better answer it , mrs. daggett .
afraid to talk to him ?
why does n't somebody pick up that phone ?
is this the , uh , daggett residence ?
ja .
new maid , by golly .
oh .
well , hulda , may i speak to mrs. brainard , please ?
she invited many parties .
very popular , i think .
oh ?
friendless , hungry .
there 's nothing to eat in the house .
i think i han up now .
as far a she 's concerned , i could stare to death .
tere must be someting to eat in this house .
dandy .
sorry , charlie .
mmm .
there 's just not a thing in the house .
trick or treat .
except these chocolates .
yes , we do .
hey , that 's some crazy radiator cap the professor 's got there .
well , science marches on , but not on an empty stomach , huh ?
great !
yeah !
oh , i 'm sorry , pof , but the hot water bottles did n't work , and we had to blow every cent we had on the scuba suit .
god , i wish we were invite to one of those halloween parties aroud here .
i bet they got lots of eats .
now  let 's see .
help me et that od trunk off of the shelf , huh ?
but how 'bout humph and me ?
just a little something in case i get hungry later .
two longs and a short .
i 'll get it .
boo !
trick or treat !
well , we do n't want any tricks around here , do we ?
here 's some nice popcorn .
oh , boy !
popcorn !
poato chips .
i like potato chips !
i ant a drumstick .
jigges !
there 's a tub of martinis in here , and everybody 's bobbing for olives .
it 's just terrific that you brought your saxophone .
oh , well ...
boys , i 'd like you to meet the finest saxophone payer in the history of medfield high school .
now go on , nuzie .
pay .
it 'll be just like old times .
well , if you fellas do n't mind .
the same sweet clown .
i 'm so lad to see that girl has n't changed you .
a bit of gaiety will do you good .
good evening .
good evening , sir .
good evening , madam .
he 's so helpless all by himself .
helo , frederick .
may i take your coat , madam ?
betsy !
excuse me , please !
betsy 
what in the world are you doing here ?
i might as the same thing of you .
well , i as .
but there is an intinct called self-preservation , you know .
under cetain conditions even the lowest form of animal life will go searching for food .
look , neptune , why do n't you just submerge ?
you see , brainard , you ve already spoied the party for her .
now why do n't you leave betsy alone ?
ashton , if you do n't stay ou of this ...
some kind of a peasant , are n't you ?
wait , betsy ...
come on , nuzzie .
i did n't want to hurt you .
as the poet says , te hurt is not so deep as a well ,
nor so wide as a church door ,
but 't is enough , 'till serve .
i 'm sorry , shelby .
okay , charlie .
oh , say , captain , we want to thank you again for this new prowl car .
do n't worry , captain .
officer !
it 's that fiend , brainard !
he 's up there , omewhere !
brigt and early , professor .
mr. hawk !
plate glass in stores , automobile windshields , bottles , clock faces , glass of every kind and description began to break and shatter in various portions of our community .
as you see , they formed a pattern , a sort of cone-shaped pattern of devastation , as though some unseen force had fanned out from one beginning point , at a place on the corner of maple and litchfield .
now , i may be wrong , rofessor , but is n't that the precise poin on whih i 'm standing at this very moment ?
but outside of making me feel good all over , wat ould it get me ?
no , the point is , i 'm not sore at you at all , professor .
wile eerybody else is busy making things , you come up with the answer .
you come up with something that breaks things !
we replace it with new glass .
it breaks .
r. hawk , you do n't seem o understand .
how about that unite nations building in new york ?
mr. hawk , you do n't for one miute tink
i 'd go alon wih a sceme like that , do you ?
well , what are you acting so high and mighty about ?
look , professor , hy do n't you just settle for what you got here ?
with the money from this thing we 'll both get fat .
and there 'll be enough left over for you to take care of the medfield problem .
save medfied college ?
that kind of money would never help medfield college or anyone ele , mr. hawk .
well , you know what you 're doing , do n't you ?
and before this day is over i ll be back here with the sheriff .
and we 'll have this place tied up tighter than fort kox !
with all your work and all your experiments !
and as for medfield , a year from now , people will have forgotten there ever was such a punk little college .
out of the way , son .
you 're a little overdue on my alloance .
why , i 'm just liable to send you off to jail with this criminal here , as a fellow conspirator , a partner i crime !
proessor , you mean you 're gon na help us ?
mabe the college wo n't be here next year , but we 're going to see that nobody ever forgets it .
come on , humph !
let 's hustle into it !
will you forget about that ?
the professor 's with us now !
the first team 's coming into the game !
biff , biff .
let 's take it easy for a minute .
i just think there might be a more effective way of using it .
boy , just think , 70-yard kicks , 90-yard passes !
are you racking up ?
so , we never throw just the ball , we throw the player with the ball .
right !
hat 's right .
humphrey , it 's just simple logic .
with the flubber gas we make you quasi-weightless , or buoyant , and then we throw you with he ball .
you do ?
do 't you see te beauty of it ?
even if they intercept , we still have possession of the ball .
right !
right , humphrey ?
uh , right .
poor old medfield !
see them run !
well , ladies and gentlemen , here we are in the little community of medield .
say hat you will about their football team , at least the weather here is good .
i 'm afraid we ca n't pomise ou much .
mighty rutland university , untied , unscored upon for the past three seasos , knocking at the doo of the national championship pitte tonight against puny medfield .
oh !
wait 'll i get my hands on those two !
coach !
oh , good , good .
so go ahead without us .
teady .
bes wihes !
oh !
and at fullback position for rutland , hjalmar wocskinska , a 240-pound husky from broken jaw , idaho .
back home during his sumer vacations ,
hjalmar runs a training school for prison guards .
wel , here come the lambs to the slaughter .
come on , medfield !
second quarter , rutland 's ball , first and ten .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
hut four !
sir , we 're never gon na get this thing ready in time .
if you d just reconsider my idea .
what 's that , humphrey ?
tere 's flubber ga in here .
well  so i do n't have to wear this suit .
instead , we give the good ole football a shot of gas , and then zzshhhh !
humphrey .
we 've been trough all that .
with this new valve you have perfect buoyancy control at all times .
we got ta get out of here .
what 's wron , biff ?
my father .
po walked in to get the sheriff who was his dinner there , and i overheard them talking .
then they went over to judge murdock 's .
we 'll have to fix the sui in te locker room .
look out !
he 's getting away !
ladies and getlemen , i 'm afraid it 's going just the way we predicted .
ighty rutland is shredding the little medfield team to bits .
well , he must be here someplace .
you two get the rest of the boys and spread out !
look , i do n't mind losing the football game , professor ashton , but spare us you garbled quotatios .
you 're not expecting anyone , ae you , betsy ?
thank you .
you 're winning .
it 's a massacre , coach .
yeah , ai n't it a shame .
we should have brought along the girls ' volleyball team .
we could have sent them in .
everything 's okay , sir .
where 've you been , hawk ?
and what 's all his static about a secret weapon ?
you 're the secret weapon ?
it 's not fair .
it 's not fair .
come on , boy .
let 's mop up the field with 'em .
way to go , humphrey !
come on !
and forget your manners !
and there goes the try for the extra point .
it 's good .
i tell you , that medfiel touchdown was certainly a surprise .
george  what kind of play would you say that was ?
uh ...
now we 'll see what happens 
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
what happened to me ?
wat happened to you , clod 
well , now .
did you see how that happened there , george ?
uh , well , it ...
here he comes !
catch him !
upsy-daisy !
don !
hut one !
oof !
here 's a rule book .
you find it !
well , ladies and gentemen , i guess you know by now , we are witnessing one of the wildet , slam-bang football games ever layed anywhere at any time .
rutland fumbles !
medfield 's got the ball again .
hut two !
hike !
the ball is snapped to humphrey .
now hawk has umphrey .
get off the playing ' field .
take it easy , huh ?
wel , it 's a race against time now .
medfield trails rutland by nine points .
with less than four minutes left to play , te big question is can rutland stop medfield 's brilliant aerial atack ?
oh , it looks as if rutland may have something up their sleeve .
i 've never seen 'em use this kind of defense before .
down !
hut one !
hut two !
now , remember , you guys , the old lady with a twist on two .
ready ?
break !
the same thing agai 
no !
better gas up a little .
hut two !
biff !
biff !
medield calls time out .
they 're back on their own two yard line wit eight seconds left to play .
well , i you 'd just let me use my needle , we 'd have on eay .
well , it is n't doing us any good back at the lab .
well , like i said , i never did trust this crummy suit .
humph !
thee may be time for one more play .
repeat , 98 yards .
too bad .
it 's gaining altitude .
and there goes the inal gun as the game ends and medfield wins .
the ball , the ball is still going up ...
up ...
up ...
george , did ya see that ?
oh , shut up !
well , the trial of professor ned brainard swung into its third day today .
professor brainard continued to act as counsel in his own behalf .
he was quoted as saying he was confident in the due processes of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony against im , a the prosecution kept a steady parade of winesses moving through the witness box , today , the prosecution unlimbered its big guns against the defense .
professor brainard , you seem proud of your job as a teacher .
do you like it because you believe it makes ou important ?
but i believe the work i do is important .
would you care to tell us a little about it ?
maybe plant a bug of discovery in their minds , or ...
and you think hat 's iportant ?
one of those young people might discove something the entire world has been looking for .
he might not , but i like to feel that i had a part in giving him a crack at it .
i see .
now , regardless of whethe you are found guilty or not ,
would you continue as before ?
would you recklessly incite the young minds of your class again 
i put the question to you again , professor , and i ask you to mark well your answer .
would you still persist in these dangerous ad malicious follies ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , falling hair , even fear of mr hawk .
we find our sel apologizing , hiding our heads , or jumping at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog day only came once a year in this country .
now , i see a lot of students from my science class here in the courtroom .
they may not be the most studious group of young people in college today , but i 'll say this for them , so far they are unafraid .
i have high hopes for them .
am i to understand , professor , you actually encourage mistakes in your class ?
suppose you are eturned to your role as a teacher , would you do exactly as you did before ?
yes .
you may step down .
come on .
let 's tie this thing up and get out of here .
15 or 20 minutes should do it .
in that cae , i will sum up briefly .
ay i suggest , professor , as defense counsel , you 're not doing much in your own behalf .
i 'm a witness for the defense , your honor .
both objections overruled .
but , your hono , this is ost unusual procedure .
it is also unusual pocedure for the defense to have no witnesses in his own behalf .
swear in the witness , please .
my time is your time , mr .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole tuth and nothing but the truth ?
elizabeth brainard .
will the defense question the witness ?
o , your honor .
as i was saying , my name is elizabeth brainard .
e scratched my fender in the parking lot just outside the administration builing .
on october 30th of this year ,
i told him i did n't think i was cu out to be a scientit 's wife .
well , i 'd like to inorm te defendant at this time that i was wrong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
of course , she means it .
oh , betsy .
your honor , will you excuse the witness at this time ?
the defendant always said he loved me in midnight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does all this , uh , foofaraw have any bearing on the disposition of the case ?
you bet , your honor .
i do n't believe it .
that is , if you do n't mind wasting the ime .
gangway !
gangway , everybody !
i do n' wish to pry , but would you kinly divulge your intentions ?
the court is waiing .
i 'm sorry , your honor .
may i ask that this witness be recalled to testify for me ?
ver well .
must we subject ourselves to irrelevant testimony trumped up b the defense ?
the witness is qualified .
but your honor ...
i 'm the county agricultural agen , that 's who i am .
oh , yes , yes .
i certainly did .
and you were very upset .
so much so that you decided to investigate the matter thoroughly .
well , i did n't come here to toast marshmallows , you know .
now , mr. allen ...
first , would you mind telling us about the soil conditions here in medfield county ?
medfield county as the thinnest , rockiet , ore-out  farmed-out , pooped-out soil in the whole state .
i 've been so ashamed .
it 's not much good for growing hings .
wait , i 'll show you something .
that is an ear of corn .
a radish !
if you want to see something really miserable ...
somebody put ...
it 's around here somewhere ...
uh , that 's fie , mr. allen .
why , everywhere i look , everything is suddenly all fertied up !
oh , i do n't ...
he can call it anything he wants .
i think that you 've invented ...
is it anyting like taking a dry bath , or going for a dry canoe ride ?
you see , professor brainard 's rays must have combined with massive amounts of nitrogen out in the atmosphere , see ?
why , for all we know , it might be dry-raining right down in this courtroom this very minute , fertilizing everything in sigh !
ou ca n't tell , you know .
do you expect this court to believe all this umbo jumbo ?
an you substantiate it ?
oh , my goodess !
come on !
that 's right , boys !
look at those carrots , judge !
boys !
do n't ush !
your wife says to get home right away .
a summer squash just rolled off the vine next door and sashed your sports car !
he jurors will please sit down !
thank you very , very , very much , judge .
you shoud try some of this walnut .
o , yes , yes .
i leave it to you ...
case dismissed .
do n't take it so hard .
as a matter of fact , i 'm crazy about it , but ...
offhand , can you name one thing that science has n't improved upon , one way or aother ?
oh !
i guess i 'll have to go along wih that .
this is my home , the great karoo desert .
i 'm not even born yet .
surviving in these parts is n't easy .
you need to be tough and flexible .
tha 's why we built this enclosure .
them eing everyone who is n't us .
i got it !
it 's time .
it 's happening- it 's happening !
watch out .
here he comes !
keeps my tripes .
my brother is just a ig dumb jock .

barely breaking a sweat .

sore loser ?
i do n't 
i was just giving you a head start .
things are different now .
yep , do n't want any stretch marks .
mkhulu , while we wait for the rains , maybe we should ration the water .
yeah , right .
good idea , seko .
until the rains come , we 'll only drink once a day .
okay , everyone .
timba , teba , buring nimba ,
show what you got !
yo !
hey , guys .
what happened to my stripes ?
muscle-headed lame brains .
very funy .
that will take the shine off , all right .
go cheerlead with the other girls .
we wo n't always be here to protect him .
i may be half a zebra , but at least i 'm not an ass .
is it some kind of map ?
what 's that ?
khumba ?
you okay , khuba ?
hey , i 'm sorry about what happened .
maybe they let me off easy ?
i did cause a drought .
that 's just dumb .
you trying to make me feel better ?
just leave me alone .
do nt you have anything better to do ?
you think you 're the only one who has a hard time fitting in ?
ah !
well , we can only ask .
please , she is weak .
i do n't even know if i 'm alowed to talk to ouiders .
outsiders ?
we used to live together ?
maybe you could have some of my rations .
okay , and you and you .
whoa .
intruders .
intruders .
intruders .
where 's mkhulu ?
where 's mkhulu ?
i thought it would be okay .
da-da-dada-da 
the lan belongs to all of us .
i ..
i do n't even remember breakfast .
he 's at the fence .
he 's at the fence .
phango 's at the fence .
he wants to get in !
we need more branches .
over here !
i think i can hear him breahing .
you ca n't keep them hidden from me forever , mkhulu .
shh .
i can almost taste it .
what id he sa ?
i did n't hear him .
if it does n't rain soon , you will have to let them out .
just saying , we 're safe .
dad , she needed help .
like mama .
khumba , oh .
you 're growing .
you have it 
i 'm nothing like dad .
skin ?
they say that the first zebras to walk the earth all had exactly the same skin with no stripes at all .
mm-hmm .
all the other zebras admired his beautiful skin , and he was proud to be so different .
i think i know .
they all looked the same .
whoa .
how are you today ?
uh ...
feeling diffeen , peculiar , left out , having trouble fittin in ?
well , i ...
you want more stripes , but you think there 's no way in the world you could get more stripes .
of course i 'm right .
wrong .
of course , the magic waterhole .
yep .
skalk 's 100 % natural , herb , miracle formula .
guaranteed to bring out the natural stripe in ou .
no , no , no , wait .
i know hat you 'e thinking .
how could that be ?
but i tell you it works ... on anything .
even a rock .
samples of my work right here .
well , maybe if you show e how it works .
khumba , i 'm so sorry about your ... huh ?
khumba ?
norally , it 's very , very , very har to get , but act now , the miracle natural stuff is yours for the shockingly low pice of , say ... a little water for me and my buddies ?
believe me , it could .
right this way .
ith a fine feather duster , i might add .
oh , i 'm not a cleaning implement .
did you hear what he said about my feathers ?
my mother died .
oh .
this is awkward .
skak 's going to help me get my stripes with his 100 % natural formula .
hmm .
how can i ...
let 's do it over dinner .
he 's not food .
let 's eat him .
he 's our ticket to all that water the zebras are hogging .
you , too , you little one .
looks like we got ourselves a dog fight , bradley .
he 's going to eat you .
sorry , kid .
i did my best .
keep your backs covered .
well , it 's too late for some of us .
ha !
i 'm so thirsty , i 'd settle for any old waterhole .
right , mama v ?
where is this waterhole ?
the mantis .
he dre me a map .
point is , he liked the feathers .
she 's got four of them .
enoug .
mama v has seen enough .
and keep your left hoof up .
i would have been dead meat .
mama v is always picking up lost causes .
hopeless cases , losers .
oh !
o , wait .
two-and-a-half is a crowd .
i thought ...
tweak the beak .
so will there be water at this water hole ?
and is there such a thing as a magic waterhole ?
i guess tat 's not a good-bye hug 
where you go , mama v , i go .
zuki !
khumba !
khumba !
he left .
i 'm going to go find him .
if we just follow his ...
all right ?
deal ?
deal .
you know , guys ...
sometimes i do n't think you see the bigger picture .
do it yourself ?
can i please slurp in peace ?
yeah , we re the team .
whatever happened to the pack mentaity ?
abandoned by your pack ?
i was just having a little drik of water 
just mud , really .
give me one good reason .
give it your best hot .
ow you 're a sophisticated , discerning gourmet type .
you are what you eat , right ?
as in heart still beating fresh ?
as in young and tender zebra fresh .
half striped ?
as it was foretod 
better than nothin ?
a herd of giant wildebeest .
a pack of crazed osriches .
show me .
woo , dragging across the karoo is hard work .
and it does n't help that you ca n't ind a dop of water to rink .
you should n't scare hi like that , bradley .
i 'm good .
did ou know he eats his pay while there 's still a heart beat ?
do n't you have a home ?
i 'e been persecuted , stigmatized .
but i will survive
♫ although all my life , i 've been ostracized ♫
poor bradley .
that 's no even a real word .
traumatized .
♫ visualized .
♫ i think i get he picture .
oh , yeah , laugh at me .
some birds are just not meant to be caged , hey , bradle ?
maybe some birds are n't meant to be let out .
i ...
and you , mama v ?
sometimes the past is best left buried .
now , i think i 's time for some shut-eye .
night , khumba .
night .
maybe tomorrow we 'll find ourselves a water hole .
all i smell is dog .
i can fix that .
i 've got a natural blend of herbs and flowes .
i 'll go get you some .
it kills nasty oors dead .
dead dog ?
i 'm trying to avoid that .
the karoo may be going to the dogs , but it does 't mean i have to eat one .
the karoo all looks the same to me .
did we pass that bush already ?
yeah  i 'm sure we 're going the right way .
you better be sure .
so you do n't want any of this , huh 
i 'm still bloate from breakfast .
mmm .

he got his revenge , but it seems that is n't enough for him .
so he keeps on killing .

it was a vapire .
oay , well , first off , i 'm not the one with an accent .
and secondly , just tell me how i should soud .
okay .
the modern vampire is more of a cross between a constipated model and a freshman poetry major .
more like you do 't want to deal ith anything .
no charge , edward cullen .
you would n' understand .
not bad .
so what else is there to know about vampires ?
there 's a couple things .
they re incapable of singing happy birthday .
mm-hmm .

mm-hmm .
i do n't believe you .
okay !
but seriously , we realy need to figure a way we can sell this at school .

wh would you be jealous of caitlyn ?
i can just confess , and we can just put all of this behind us .

i 'm goig to turn her ino a vampire .
i 'e been meaning to tell you .

yes , om , i 'm fine .
i am sorry you have to go through that all the time .
i get you a kaleidosope every time we move ?
because you ook in it , and it 's beautiful .
but the slightest turn of the wheel ... can change everything .
sometimes mabe even more beautiful than it was before .
this change stinks .
you know , with everything that 's hapened since you arrived ,
i 'm sure there 's something here you think is beautiful .
loser !
this was like all those times combined .
liar !
davis 's thoughts 
times like 40 billion .
okay , it sounds great .
like a vampire .
play it back .
please promise o meet me by the first tree ...
what are you doing here ?
i do n't remember there being any cameras there .
what are you working on ?
i just waned to tell you that what i did was wrong  and i 'm a complete goon .
and ...
no , davis , i 'm sorry ... for you .
caitlyn :
oh my gosh !
ten thousand subscribers !
what do you wan ?
need more footage of me acting like a jerk ?
why are you helping me ?
you better have , because i 'm not doing it again .
i had to show everyone what i had just seen .
but how ?
davis 's thoughts :
and i had just the right costume .
davis 's thoughts :
really ?
do n't be afraid .
no , wait .
i thought it 'd e the only way that i 'd finally get some real friends .
i 'd say you made plenty .
no .
anyways , i 'll ...
you make real life way beter than make elieve .
davis .
tonight , we 'll be showing
i have something to show you .
loser !
except for one person .
caitlyn crisp .
and i hae proof .
looks pretty good .
did you get that ?
boy :
is that thing off ?
i turned it off .
what a bunch o boosers and followers .
i did n't think you had it in you .
bon , stop him .
what an idiot .
ah !
this is your beloved caitlyn .
caitly :
he rules are written by the winners .
you 're all my friends , and i adore you .
hey , guys .
guys !
listen !
hey , listen !
no one really knows who they are yet .
and we 're all still tying to figure things out .
and i do n't blame you .
i mean , caitlyn crisp is no more miss perfect than i am a ...
who are you ?
okay .
dude , that 's , uh , stewart 's uncle .
he still thinks you re a vampire .
it is not wise to ignore me , creature .
what are you talking about ?
this whole not really being a vampire thig just is n't sticking with you , is it ?
i am coming down .
bloodsucker !
ah !
with such speed and agiit , how can you claim to not be a vampire ?
i 'm the real deal , and i 'm real dangerous .
so i 'd advise you not to chalenge me .
give up now .
arm yourself !
okay .
a !
you know that there 's only one way to render a vampire powerless .
exactly .
and i accept your challenge .
on the count of tree .
you fought bravely , human .
i see .
thee 's humanit , even in the undead .
i will spare your life .
i wil spare his life !
vi !
i forgot vi !
well , maybe .
but i 'm thinking you 're probably blaming me for all of this , and that you might actually hit me .
tat 's true .
so cool .
yeah .
you 're not even my type .
both :
you re welcome .
now this is my scene 
hold on tight
all aboard on this endless ride
so maybe
i 'm not the coolest guy in the world , but who cares .
and they all seem to like the real davis .
that 's pretty cool to me .
and just to treat you fair and square , we 're payin double wages and a bonus , from frisco to shanghai and back , all found 
tell 'em what you saw , bill .
and it came a-bellerin ' out of he night , with one big eye like a lightouse .
we 're stoved into starboard .
and then it come up amidships .
and broke our backs and sunk us .
and it 's a miracle old bill 's alive today .
tell 'em abou its teeth , billy .
you mind answering a few questions ?
monsers interest me .
all kinds .
boiled down for his oil , lads , there 'd be free grog for all hands , if you can swallow it on top of his tall yarns ...
there !
stop it !
come on , casey .
this is no place for a clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie !
do n't bothe unloading .
this is ridiculous .
we just have to get to saigo .
halfwa around the world from paris , and now this happens .
except pack and unpack .
oh , professor ?
i 'm from the bulletin .
these gentlemen are from the globe and the post .
we 're interested in your opinion of this monster .
professor , what does the national museum in paris think about it ?
i can not answer that .
we heard this expedition of yours was to gather facts about the monster .
i 'm afraid you were misinformed .
why do n't you ask a fish ?
do n't you print that .
you do not deny then that suc a monster could exist .
is that corect ?
than you , professor .
look at thi drawing .
i knew i .
by professor arronax of the paris national museum .
why , this is the most far-fetched nonsense yet .
far-fetched ?
you 're not erious , professor ?
oh , i do n't mean flying off with a hip in its mouth .
but the general size ...
i 'm not a reporter .
may i come in ?
thank you .
would you accept ?
i woul be interested , yes , naturall .
why..
i think the honour is ours .
as the foremost authority on the sea and it 's mysteries , you can be an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it concerns the monster .
very much so .
according to the papers  you seem to believe the rumours .
no .
yes , i 'm afraid i was misquoted .
however , i have an open mid on the subject .
we accept .
good .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like you to come downstairs ad meet captain farragut .
he 's in command of the warship upon which you 're saiing .
every man aboard was on the lookout , and the watch was ket day and night .
captain farragut left nothing to chance .
with traditional thoroughness , the navy plan was to ut the south acific into squaes and search each square .
false alarms were common , and they did n't help our morale .
our opes began to wane .
it came as no surprise ... when captain farragut on the night of december 8 , 1868 , summoned us to the war room .
gentlemen  i believe my obligation to this legend has been dispatched .
it does n't seem to me we have proved anything one way or the other , captain .
we 'll set you ashore in saigon .
cheer up , rofessor .
i thought they promised you a bonu if you harpooned this monster , mr land .
knowing full well i could n't collect it .
when i get back , i 'm shipping out on the first whaler that 'll take me .
you scare me .
be a good loser , professor .
what a pity , professor .
i know you had visions of that monster ounted in the atioal museum .
'bout the flapping fish and the girls i 've loved
on nights like this with the moon above
met her down in madagascar
she would kiss me
got a whale o a tale to tell you , lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
there was typhoon tessie
met her on the coast of java
low me down and pick me up
she was the captain 's wife
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , ad it 's all true
there was harpoon hannah
if i kissed her
and held her tenderly
a whale of a tale or two
'bou the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true
ahoy !
ship off the starboard bow !
aye aye , sir .
i 'm thinking she went down with all hands .
what could hae set it off , though ?
you meaning the monster , ai n't ya , mate ?
aye !
it might be the monster .
sure , it 's the monster !
it is the monster !
pipe down on deck !
i must isist , professor , that you keep these fish stories to yourself .
there 's the monster !
look alive there !
get your rane ad ire .
well , hit her in the heels .
aye aye , sir .
run er ou smartly .
she 's turing !
stand by to lower away .
professor !
hey , do n't leave us !
help !
they can not help .
but they must !
help !
i 'm getting numb al over .
look , professor .
there 's something over there .
i do n't now .
it looks like the monster .
a ubmarine boat .
but , this is incredible .
men have dreamed about such miacles .
you know something ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahoy !
it seems deserted .
i think we are asking for trouble , professor .
maybe somebody will come up .
no .
if we wait , this thing is liable to sink under us .
why , it 's a bright as da .
there is great genius behind all this .
yes , and great evil .
do n't forget this is an engine of destruction .
is anybody aboard ?
wait .
look at this .
give me a hand with this line , mate .
anybody else get off ?
yes , the professor is down below 
well , he really got his monster , did n't he ?
i 'm not anxious to get in their company myself .
my sentiment exactly .
big .
i 've never seen a barge like this before .
hey , this looks like the galley .
cook 's da off , too .
professor .
proessor .
professor .
professor , where are you ?
hello .
i 'm in here .
what is it ?
you know , ne land is here with a boat .
tha tall one must be the leader .
they 'll be coming back any moment .
get away !
help !
help !
search the boat .
you are from the warship that attacked me , are you not ?
this is ned land , master harpooner .
you may remain .
i did not invite you here .
you came as an enemy to destroy me .
they 've done no harm .
do n't blame us because the warship shelled you .
the sea shall have you back .
easy , mate !
i 'm not what is called a civilised ma  professor .
but i am as guilty as they are .
i will grant you that both of them and me , too , enlisted to track down what we thought to be a monster .
but , in hat case , we are no more guilty than the rest of the world .
you 've carried your work as far as terrestrial science permits .
the real sory of the ocea depths begins where you left off , wonders that defy my powers of descripion .
the secets that are mine alone , but which i would be willing to share with you .
at the expense of my companios ' lives ?
i 'm sorry .
then i can not accept .
pofessor , i regret your choice .
take him up !
and secure for sea .
aye , sir .
all stations ready !
prepare for diving .
yes , sir .
prepare for diving .
ahead slow .
trim your forward ballast .
what about the other one ?
i found out what i wated to know 
there .
come in , gentlemen .
be seated , please .
professor .
i 'd like to express our gatitude , captain .
we are grateful to be alive .
i want none of you gratitude .
you 're all on the strictest probatio , and i 'd advise you not to attempt escape .
you understand your position ?
i uess that makes us a little bit of boh .
i tolerate no guests aboard the nautilus , and you already know the fate of prisoners .
the food is delicious , is n't it , professor ?
oh , very good .
i 'm indifferent to 'em .
these dishes come entiely from y ocean kitchen .
that is fillet of sea snake .
i suppose this is n't lamb , then .
yes , my cook excels in preparing these various produts .
well , just the main course .
the cream is , of course , milk from the giant sperm whale .
saute of unborn octopus .
since we are nearing the island of crespo , you 'll have an opportunity of selectin your own food .
for a brief hunting expedition .
well , that suits me fine .
when do we start , mate ...
almost immediately .
delightful smoke .
havana ?
i am still curious as to the reason you spared our lives .
i may have use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaced ?
it comforts me to know that your lie was not too dear a price to pay for the love of your fello man .
at the moment , i do n't intend that you should .
we 're almost at he island of crespo .
all this was one an island .
i knew there ' be a catch to this .
seems you ca n't do anything on this boat without getting wet .
hey !
wait a minute .
where ou going wit this ?
an expedition from the nautilus .
it 's a new eperience for them .
tey 'll learn quickly .
i 'll introdue them to you .
captain nemo and i ere not alone .
an underwater arder fille to overflowing , and all captain nemo for the taking .
ballast ?
ballast !
ned , you forget yourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. land .
why did you do it ?
ask him .
that was scientific interest .
i ha no idea he was after treasure .
oh , no ?
we must n't quarrel among ourselves .
we must stay ogether .
it 's our only chance .
chance ?
you want to play a waiting game , hoping to learn nemo 's secrets .
i believe we owe the world that much , ned .
have you a better plan ?
i want to et off .
of course i do n't mid going with my pockets full .
and do n't call it stealing , because that 's the way he got it .
if we could take this thing over , we 'd be ich .
i 'd have a sip of me own , and you would n't have to be starving on a professor 's pay .
do n't look at me with those soft-boiled eggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them when that chest busted .
ned , listen to me .
i know i can win the captain 's confidence , but i need time , and i need your help .
all right .
it is the best way , beieve me .
trivialities .
nonsense .
that depends on your point of view .
i just think that ned values his life above scientific achievement .
today we encountered a fearsome storm .
an ordiary vessel would have suffered heavy damage .
a whale of a tale that 's true
at my hos ' invitation , i inspected the ship .
we went to the very heart of te vessel , te propulsion unit .
this secret alone gave him mastery of the sea .
and in a single stroe , harness power beyond the wildest dreams of science .
or destroy it .
with seeming indifference ,
as i studied him ,
i became aware that powerful forces were at work within this strange man .
think of i .
on the surface , there is hunger and fear .
men still exercise unjust laws .
they fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few feet beneath the waves , their reign ceases , their evil drowns .
here i am free .
far better that they think there 's a monster and hunt me with harpoons .
after travelling 10,000 leagues unde the sea ,
i felt at long last i was to have my answe .
the prison camp of rorapandi , the white man 's grave .
but i thought it had been abolished .
what is in those sacks they are carrying ?
nitrates and phosphate for ammunition , the seeds of war .
they 're loading a full argo of death , and when that ship takes it home , the world will die a ittle more .
i was oce one of tose pitiful wretches you see down there .
look at it again , professor .
i do n't want you to forget what you 've seen here today .
i sounds remote .
it was there that e built he nautilus .
you will have the privilege of seeing all this firsthand .
when our mission is completed , the nautilus is going home .
they 're getting up steam , sir .
very good .
that ship that flies no flag sails with the tide .
you have your orders .
i said go below !
collision speed , full !
professor ?
are you all right ?
all those men , they did n't even have a chance .
ned , do n't .
damage report , sir .
we 'll make temporary repairs here .
i asked you to leave , professor .
why ?
you are not only a murderer .
well , i see murder , too !
there are the assassins , the dealers in deat .
i am the avenger .
is murer a right reserved for that hated nation that has taken everything from me ?
they tried .
they cast me into prison , and when they failed ...
what ou fail to understand is the power of hate .
i was just trying to tidy up .
about what ?
well , i believe things have gone far enough .
murder means nothing to him .
it is not your place to judge .
you do n't know anything about the captain .
now , please go out and leave me alone .
what did you call me ?
captain ?
yes , i did .
seen enough ?
did the professor put you up to this ?
you bet i was right .
and i was right about you spying on me .
we may need it .
we ?
since when do i need you ?
i wan na be friends .
i want to escape .
so do i , with you .
you once said you had a plan .
well ?
trouble is , it wo n't work .
i ca n't figure how they navigate this barge .
no courses , no bearigs , nothing .
if we could figure where we 're heading , we 'd have a chance .
that 's no problem .
vulcania !
aye , sir .
keep your eye peeled or he mate .
ned , put them back .
he 's coing .
tha was close , ate 
maybe ...
ned , let 's get out of here .
get me a pencil and paper quik .
i think i found something .
yes ?
see ?
all the distances are easured from that point .
i must be .
get me those calipers , quick .
quiet .
here .
have a cigar .
hey , she likes 'em !
you want another ?
be quiet !
i 'm not playing !
be a nice girl .
let ' go .
resume speed at 50 fathoms .
i 've got to do some research .
what kind ?
well , ned , you 've got everything here , from the rarest nudibranchs to oysters .
i want the bottles .
you ca n't do that .
these are priceless .
why , that went out with robinson crusoe .
that 's or spying ' on me .
do n't let me catch you padding the shadow of my stern again .
remember that .
i do n't like bashing ' anybody , but you had it comin ' , lad .
and i thought we were friends .
sure we 're friends !
hit me .
hit me .
you mean that ?
you ca n't miss it .
oh , all right , shipmate !
it 's priceless .
anyhow ... hold this , lad .
well , they had plenty of time on their hands , so they began writing ' notes , puttin ' 'em in old rum bottle and setting ' 'em adrift .
i swallowed it .
there was a flabellina oculina in there .
astern , full !
we seem to have run aground .
an accident , catain ?
the tide will float us free by evening .
ould you like to go ashore ?
the last time we went ashore , it was a prelude to murder .
aye , sir .
throwin ' away a chance like that .
the professor 's losin ' his ballast .
dry land  mate .
and so would the professor .
me ?
i 'm a collecting ' fool .
there 's no harm in askin .
and i can row , sir .
got a strong back .
i 'm no deserter .
happy to be aboard , sir .
very well .
permission granted .
thank you .
the natives are cannibals .
break out the skiff .
shove off !
take it easy .
hey , ned .
hey !
come here , quick 
a trail through the jungle .
you had this in mind all the time .
i figured that .
i ca n't get through that jungle .
you 'll go aster alone .
we 'll be laughing about this , havin ' a drink together in frisco .
good luck , ned .
hey !
ey !
wai for me !
hey !
hey ... canibals !
scores of boats !
naturally .
they 're coming aboard , captain .
get me a harpoon , quic .
this is amazing .
hey , captain , that 's one way to keep guests from droppin ' in .
a mid charge of electricity , m. land .
not very hospitable , but harmless .
ad speaking of hospitality , may i say you have abuse mine for the last time .
you 've continuously disobeyed my orders .
who , me ?
i told you once the fate of prisoners .
i have no choice but to oblige you .
what 's this all about ?
te only reason you only came back is because the natives forced you to .
you 'e going to regret that choice , mr. land .
when we clear this reef , i 'll see you trouble my existence no longer .
put him under guard below .
take him below .
we must break free of the reef .
aye , sir .
lighten ship and drop all ballast .
get below !
let me out of this ...
professor !
a warship , professor .
we 're breaking out !
le us out !
wait !
break out a spare shaft !
put the aft end under the leak .
ake up the slack .
we 've gone too deep .
make brace !
braces in place , sir !
te air will clear now that the fans are oerating again .
are you all ight ?
hae we stopped sinking ?
fortunately .
we 're deeper now than man has ever been before .
emergency speed , all engines !
full repellent charge !
prepare another charge .
sorry , ir .
then we shall ave to fight on the surface .
you 'll be fighting at close quarters with the mot tenacious of all ea beasts .
stay clear of the tentacles .
they 'll eize anything within reach and hag on to he death .
the only vital spot is directly between the eyes .
forty feet and surfacing , sir .
stand by .
sand back !
quick !
the forward hatch !
give me a harpoon !
throw e another iron !
watch it !
your hand !
well , i 'll be ...
what happened ?
mr. land .
get dunk .
and the girls i 've loved on nights like this with the moon above
a whale of a tale , and it ' all true
glad to see you like music , too .
thank you , baby .
hey !
i 've tied 'em .
your whiskers tickle .
let me see your whiskers .
come on , let 's try it again .
but eat they did the brisket squid
ot so loud .
she loves those flabellinas oculinas .
i am happy you 're out of jail , ned .
the professor 's very happy , too .
we do n't want none of his gratitude !
wap youself up good .
i do n't want you to catch cold .
my apprentice tells e you ave taken my journal .
may i ask why ?
i might have expected you to say that .
actually , he regrets saving my life as much as i would regret savig his .
the only difference is that i would n't have tried .
then it is that difference that gives ned land a huan dignity you no loger possess .
i know you were deeply touched by ned 's gesture , but you are asamed to admit it .
you can not tolerate a faith in humanity , because if you do , all this , the structure of your very existence , which you built on hate and vengeance , all his will collapse around the naked lie of your life .
and you are a very ullile man , professor .
gullible ?
what he would do one day , he would gladly undo the ext .
to be of benefit , goodness must e constant , forever building .
ou will never find it .
if men and nations had this goodnes that i speak of ,
have you considered sharing it ?
i had hoped that you would be the key to a plan i had in mind .
i had intended using you as an emissary .
but now i do n't know .
is it that you do n't tust me ?

oh , for pee 's sake , polly harrington , listen to reason !
ed , tell them what you aid .
well , i do n't think i should say anything .

well , i got a look at the dispensary when i fixed mr. geary 's arm , and i mentioned it seemed a little inadequate for 32 children .
there you are .
now you 've heard it .
we 'll spend more to repair that old building than to put up a new one .
it wo n't cost this town one cent !

what about you , reverend ?
you 're a man of influence in this community .
ben , seak up .
oh , karl .
charlie , what dc you say ?
well  say something !

karl neve changes , does he ?
ladies and gentlemen , we 're having a little light lunch .
suppose we stop for a while and have a ite ?
if you ask me , reverend ford should have taken sides with mayor warren .
said he never takes sides .
stop sticking your ose ito their business and get tese sherbet glasses ou there .
oh , well , thanks for not spilling the beans about you-know-who .
about cousin fred , you mean ?
mm-hmm .

i saw you holding hands under the table .
this sherbet 's turning to mush .
nancy ?

aunt polly will see how happy you are , and she 'll be very glad to get married herself , then .
glad this , glad that .
oh , lay off her , angie .
stop picking on the girl .
now , take that sherbet out and serve it the way you should .
go on .
well , let 's see what your aunt has on the menu for tomorrow .
your aunt has no imagination .
oh , i love roast chicken !
did you ever hear of sour stomach ?
wait 'til tomorrow .
praise him above ye heavenly host
they trust to nothing but a shadow .
but bear testament .
death comes unexpectedly !
i intended to take effectual care , but death came unexpectedy ... like a thief , outwitting me , too quick for me .
now the great king of heaven and earth ... will abolish and annihilate this pride !
will crush the hardened wretch ... of the poluted infinite abomination , and rain on him ... a deluge of fire and brimstone !
where are the great leviathans who defied god then ?
where is their courage , these , thee , these , these proud spirits ?
now , isaiah has warned us , on the day of vengeance , the earth shall be laid to waste .
the raven and sceeh owl shall dwell in it .
yea , he can lay the earth to pieces i one moment ... or shatter he whole universe with one stroke of his fiery swod !
how dreadful is the state of those ho are in daiy danger of this great wrath , this abyss of death ad despair .
there is no security for the wicked ... because there are no visible igns of death at hand !
the arrows of death fly unseen as noonday .
god has many different unsearchable ways of taking the wicked from this world .
calm in your knowledge of health , secure in your wel-being .
yes , death comes unexpectedly !
i thought the reference to jeremiah at the finish was very effective .
did n't you , mrs. ford ?
i ca n't deliver the message with syrup .
your voice is god 's instrument and should be used accordingly .
he sure sermonizes something fierce , oes n't he ?
brimstone and damnation on top of ha and eggs !
the oe day a week we hae off .
ooh , i just hate them !
breakfast still a hot ball in our stomachs , ad him chewing our ears off from that pulpit !
we get to have roast chicken , though .
what is all this glad business you talk about ?
a game my father taugh me .
helps what ?
that reverend !
go away .
folks just hate the coming of sunda because of him .
that 's true .
here it comes- miss goody two-shoes ... is gon na find something about sunday to be lad about .
if you knew how to play the game , then you could find something to be glad about too .
well , there 's always something .
huh .
because it will be six whole days before sunday comes around again , huh ?
why do n't you come out of the front door like normal people ?
they wo n't let us .
you can also fall and hurt yourself badly .
he grew it there , did n't he ?
so i can limb out anytime i want .
he did too !
wy else would it be tere ?
you are n't so much , you girl !
'sides , i 'm something you ca 't be .

what was it you and my aunt polly fought about ?
now , where did you hear about that ?
but they wo n't discuss it when i 'm there .
well , ollyanna , it 's a strange thing about arguments .
at the time they seem very important .
aunt polly s very pretty .
do n't you ?
i love her , but i do n't love the way she fixes her hair .
it as very soft .
did you used to be in love with her ?
come on , pollyanna , let 's go .
reverend ford and his wife are ith aunt polly now , but they'll- but they 'll be leaving soon .

how 'd you do that ?
how o you make it ?
i di n't make it .
where from ?
you see these hanging crystals ?
the sun ' rays hit it , and it acts like a prism .
you understand ?
you do not .
you do n't know what a prism is , now , admit it .
it makes a rainbow right on your wall .
sure , but it 'll be back again tomorrow when the sun comes again .
well , good-bye , r. pendergast .
it was very nice meeting you .
but i did n't show you my house !
hello , polly .

a busy person like you remembering me .
we made a mistake .
oh , but it 's een five years .

and we 're very proud of you .
what was it you mentioned yesterday about the orphanage ?
i do n't remember .
oh , yes , you do .
it was something about the dispensary .
it 's inadequate for that number of children , that 's all .
why should you buy it ?
i do n't know how we got off on the subject .
and your shoes .
oh , i 'm sorry , aunt polly .
i was playing , and i did n't realize .

he said it was beautiful 
ah , yes , wel ... clean yourself up for supper , dear .

i came here to fish , charlie .
i do n't want to butt in to your affairs here .
ben tarbell !
where you sneaking of to ?
a lot of us have got vested interest in the harrington companies .
our wives belong to her ladies ' aid goup .

and out of the nigt , 50 bicycles appear moving down the square .

what 's it for ?
it 's an extravaganza .

now , boy , you see here the-
i like it the way it is .
lem me go  will ya ?
oh , yes .
now , pay attention , boy .
you see the shape of this crystal ?
the light is tripped by that angle .
that refracts the ray , splits the colors , defuses them at an oblique angle ... and bend it out into a dispersed color band .
you understand ?
what he means is ... the sun comes through here and paints a rainbow .
you see ?
a i try it once ?
go ahead .
but do n't break anything .
snow ?
well , i 've just come from her place , and we strung a whole bunch of them up across her window .
you should see what that does .
let 's try it .
oh , no !
i 've got work to do .
do you kids think i 've got nothing better to do than to play silly game ?
go an get it .
oh , dear , dear , dear .
can you ee ?
oh , it 's gorgeous !
it 's not bad , is it ?
it 's not bad at all .
what do you mean , no ?
well , it 's what i came to see you about , mr. pendergast .
what for 
hooked rugs , quilts and crocheted tablecloths .
and we could have a stand and sell these- raibow makers !
i never go into town , and i do n't believe in community rojects .
bu they need you !
they need me 
i just wonder if olks would buy a hi like this .
now , i ' not trying to sel you the brass , but it is durable .
well , the silver 's pretty , and i think you 're right about the brass 
oh , i do n't know .
hello , mrs .
snow 
well , where hare you been  you naughty girl ?
i 've been helping for the bazaar .
get them off my bed !
oh , they are n't dirty rags .
you just take them right out of here !
i 'm not going to do anything of the sort !
mr. neely , the julians , and even old mrs. thurm .
oh , she wants me to work in my condition .
do n't bother mrs .
snow , girl .
nobody 'll come to it .
that s right .
because of your aunt .
that 's why not .
well , i do n't uderstand .
well , we do .
do n't we , mr. murg ?
mm-hmm .
good .
well .
now , about this white satin .
this is my first choice .
that 's right .
does she have to be here ?
go on into the kitchen and talk to mildred .
now
well , it 's all settled then .
thirteen yards o the whie sain ... at $ 1.20 the yard .
all right .
my father used to say ,
why do n't ou go outside and play ?
hush up .
i want to hear what she has to say .
but surely he could afford a little thing like a doll .
we had to have the mone for food .
oh , for heaven 's sake .
so , anyway , my father wrote to the missionary people ... and asked them to please sen a little secondhand doll .
well , of course i was rather disappointed , o my father made up the glad game !
hush up .
certainly .
anyway , about the crutches , my father said , do n't let 's be gloomy .
let 's try and find something to be gad about .
so , anyway , we played the game and after a while ,
i forgot about the doll and being gloomy .
well , there 's nothing happy about a pair o crutches .
well , we were glad that we did n't have to use the .
i just thought she could play the game !
i 'm not going to come and see you anymore .
i
oh , please , please , mr. murg , leave me alone .
i 'm sorry if i've-
and that 's not al .
and that child !
helping them .
just a moment .
mrs. tarbell tells me you 're involved with that bazaar .
but , aunt polly , i 'm part of the fag !
we wo n't discuss it .
i do n't want you to see those people anymore .
and that 's an order !
yes , ma'am .
the blessings ou 've heaped on that child , and her woking with those people against you .
get down my cake tins , angie .
doing what ?
tinks she 's the queen of sheba , does she ?
where you gon na get the ingredients ?
where do you think ?
not to be kicked !
he kicked me in the stomach .
now , jimmy , you 've got to stop kicking mr. hooper and sit still !
i do n't wan na get my hai cut 
mr. pendergast .
i paid for te tickets .
i just ca n't show up at your affair .
claire  i just came from your newspaper office .
now , take it easy , doo .
our space is all sold , and i ca n't go around-
you 're a coward .
it is n't baltimore up here , doo .
this is a small town .
you know as well as everybody our newspape is owned y the harington family .
liver-bellied bunch of miserable sheep !
just a minute , just a miute !
we ca n't afford to antagonize her .
claire ?
charlie ?
they 're afraid of polly harrington paying 'em back later .
you know her .
now , look .
we 've all taken a cut or two at the harrington 's  but she ould n't do a thing like that .
no one will make a move in this town without the harrington stamp of approal .
karl warren sen you , did n't he ?
he knew no one would cooperate without me .
i ut wanted it made clear you do n't mind if the others cooperate .
wo n't let your guard down for a minute , will you ?
you 're still as opinionated as ever .
lots of meetings and civic duties and obligations .
it 's a poor substitute for what 's really wrong with you .
woud you like to be paid for your diagnosis ?
there 's o medical term for it .
you can give everything but love .
it 's as simple as that 
mum ?
i found them dry again today .
yes , mum .
like water off a duck 's back to he .
that woman 's got no feelings at all .
a lot of foolish nonsense .
hi , dear .
what 's the matter ?
oh , nothing .
is the bazaar off ?
you would n't understand .
is it because of aunt polly ?
yes .
it takes a word from someoe who is n't uder her thumb .
fat chance you got , ed .
one woman owning a town .
nancy .
that 's right .
what did you say ?
um , i just said that nobody could own a church .
our social structure in this small town seems to teeter on a delicate balance , one which i certainly can not in any way attempt to inluence .
then you 're sidin with her by not mentioning it !
i 'm staying compleely out of it , and that 's all there is to it .
reverend ford , if you 'll just let us say that you 're in favor .
there 's nothing more to discuss .
this is all just imposible .
i 'm afraid you 're right .
thank you , reverend ford .
you see , i
of course you understand that ... personally i think it 's a good cause and all that , and i wish you luck with it .
she said obody could own a church .
hello , dear .
what are you doing here ?
aunt polly sent me .

it always makes me cross-eye .
when you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it ,
you surely will .

in the dark night
who would those lucky guys turn out to be
you show me somethin ' pure
and look who made it through
you see the patterns in the big sky
i do n't know whether i should laugh or cry
we 'll be together
we 'll be ogether till the end this time
you do n't know , you do n't know
do n't know the answer or the reason why
we 'll stick together till the day e die
if i had to do this all a second time

i have been reincarnated many times over the centuries to assist the descendant of the yin warrior to battle evil in the ame of good .
the evil is imprisoned in the anzi jade globe .

funny , grandma .
when i see something or hear something or even smell something that reminds me of the village where i grew up .
what 's it mean ?
sitting on my grandfather 's lap on rainy days when he could n't go to work in the fields .
yeah , but , grandma , you do n't really believe that stuff ,
of course i beliee it .

it 's a great honor .
hi , everybody .
what smells so ...
oh , hi .
ma , why did n't you tell us that your grandnephew on your second couin 's father 's side was visiting ?
i thought i told you , or i meant to , or i 'm just old .
no , that 's silly .
not that there 's anything wog with that .
look , shen , even though it 's a little bit unannounced , we want you to feel welcome .
please stay as long as you want .
how long do you think that 'll be ?
ow !
i think he has to leave soon .
he 's on a mission to visit us .
it 's a chinese thing .
it 's very rude to our guest .
eat .
oh , right , the posters .
yeah , it 's really fascinating but i 'm having a hard time getting the research straight .
perhaps i could help you .
one of my teachers at gingi temple is a direct descendant of qin shi huangdi , the first emperor of the in dynasty .
hey .
shen , i would be so grateful if you could help me understand the history of some of the artifacts .
the exhibit is next wee ad i have to get everything organied .
hey , shen , do you know any kung fu ?
i have studied it for a very long time .
cool .
my football coach , he 's always on me about shaking the linebackers .
they 're always tagging me from the side .
monkey jumps over wall ?
that sounded cooler in chinese , man .
i agree .
whoa !
dude , you got ta teach me that 
oh , my .
soo .
ma , you have n't made these since i was a kid .
please , i hope you enjo them .
mmm .
enny , are n't you gon na have one ?
no .
excuse me .
ow !
but shen is really sweet .
just because they see me with him does n't mean they 're not gon a vote for me .
bye 
but how do you get the orange off your fingers ?
oh , hey , i was practicing that move .
watch .
yeah .
the same way dad said it was okay for you to ditch school and go surfing last week .
i 'll et the car .
how did ou do that ?
it 's an ancient american move called , monkey jumps for smarter sister .
come on .
we 've got work to do .
i 've got a song but i ai n't got no melody
i 've got a song but i ai n't got no melody
will it go round in circles ?
will it go roud in circles ?
will it fly high like a bird up in the sky ?
i 'm gon na le the music move me round
will it fly high like a bird up in the sky ?
come on .
i thought you were too full .
but it 's just when i saw these mooncaes , it was like i was a boy again .
and then i felt guilty tat i gew up turning my back on all of this .
i do n't wan na do that anymore .
you did n't do i alone .
no .
it ' so strange .
and opens y eyes to something we 've been missing .
it 's wonderful , is n' it ?
yeah .
oh , hi .
wha o you think ?
i got highlights .

he 's gon na wreck it for us .

he went from monk to hunk .
here , take one .
everybody was talking about you at school today .
yes , it was fun .
i 've never worn anything except that stupid robe .

chocolate .
you 've never had chocolate before ?
well , do n't they have it in china ?
i 'm not sure .
some better than others .
ot all yin warrior are memorable .
she almost failed .
that 's why you must train harder than any of our ancestors .
i hope so , but you may have to find the strength within you that i ca n't teach you , or this may be the end for me and you and everything good .
whoa !
no too much pressue .
let 's talk about something else .
tell me about your girlfriends .
what 's it like being in loe ?

zenon :

concentrate !
oh , y gosh , neb , come on !

there ' one left .
do 't let it out .
man :
they 're worried .
something wrong , lieutenant ?
plank :
zenon :
high five !
someda , we 're actually gon na find out what these little blips mean .
no , no , i ...
i understand fully .
yeah .
wat s wrong ?
i mean , it ' not like i expected tha we 'd be together foever .
i 'm not a moron-major , but , he dumped me !
i 'm not sure how , bu she 's down there , and i 'm up here , and she 's probably been plotting to get gregory to jettison me and pay attention to her .
it 's just ...
well , loo at he upside 
all the time you 've been spending zap-padding greg can now be used to take further advantage of your free run of the spay-stay .
zenon , i 'msorry , but after your little icident this morning ,
kindlyhandin yourrzrp to my ofice asap .
and i lost my favorite shoe !
zenon :
yes , i 'm sure you did n't , zenon .
nevertheless !
i firmly believe that the discipine of working down here in the alien parol lab will be good for you .
and truth be told , you 'll be performing a mission of mercy .
your oor friend orion 's been working down here for five full years .
you know how many signals he 's picked up in all that time ?
none !
to assume we are the only units in space ,
i personally cal it rudeicrous .
now , look , in my hardly humbe opinion , bidirectional telemetry is only a matter of time .
come in , come in .
you know ?
okay .
zenon 's being assigned to a month of three-hour evening shifts with a six-hour day on saturdays .
ceus-lupeedus , commander !
you simply need to be here .
but what if today 's silence turns to tomorrow 's thunderous call from the void ?
look , no lie , just last week , i uncovered evidence of a new planet that may have formed a mere 20 au from gamma pictoris .
yeah , see ?
i got ta get back to the command deck .
i expect you to report back down here at 1900 hours tonight .
what ?
o .
uh , okay , you ready for your tour ?
the first thing you got ta know about ae these babies .
um , look , if they ever start rotating at an accelerated speed , you come over here , and you sound the red alert ...
alien signal ...
alien signal !
alien signal .
alarm clock .
ah , congratulations , zee , you just survived your first shift .
zenon :
you 're in coprehension-mode-minor , mom !
well , he month will be over before you know it .
kind of like me and greg .
o n't worry , i am not so quashe .
rotozoa .
butwhatis certain is that since his return frommirobe 's triumphant concert in space ,
protozoahasnot been seen in public , nor has he been in a recording studio .
cetus-lupeedus , he ca n't be doing this !
why is he doing this ?
he 's on a break , a vacation , something .
repeat , allhands to the mess hall for an emergency briefing .
look , team , i 'm sorry .
me too .
military ?
yeah , what ...
all right , first they 're sending up a squad to assess the condition and contribution of eah module .
following that evaluation , ome space station components could be detached and jettisoned .
plank :
if that occurs , certain personnel might be reassigne to earth , but ay speculation in that direction is ...
are they considering shutting us down altogeher ?
to the best of my limited knowlege , absolutely not .
what ?
right .
plank :
i know it 's hard , but we 're proessionals , and if we can just wait for geeral hammond to arrive ,
i think everything will be explained to ou .
zenon , i know your mother has an incredible fear of flying and an even more acute fear of earth , ut any decisions regarding who stays and who goes wo n't be up to me .
but you 're on na have some kind of opinion , right ?
they do n't even know us .
general hammond and his team ave arrived in the transport lounge .
all right , have him report to my office .
wheever i have a vital , formidable mission to assign , i look for the best man or youn woman for the job .
whatever you need , i 'm your girl .
it 's not often someone my age gets to serve her ountry under the command of such a noble and gifted leader .
you request it , i 'm in .
spacewalking , duc crawling , undercover ops ...
margie ?
margie girl .
since you 've had a long , grueling flight ,
but , daddy , why ?
i 'm not in the least bit tired .
hammond :
all right , all riht , i was just ...
did i mention that gegory said to say hi ?
are you panaked ?
i 'll suvive 
but up here , you are on my turf .
if daddy 's the commaner of your ship , and let 's face it 
i 've got daddy toall wrapped .
no !
i have n't even worn it yet .
it just arrived from the virtual mall this morning .
so if you 're not mondo nice to me ,
bye-ness !
homework lesson b .
she only gets under your skin 'cause you let her , zee .
why so she can call up daddy and order him to send my family pacing ?
whoa .
yeah , but you know what ?
it 's not gon na happen to us .
zenon !
voice : zum .
plank :
what is i ?
you need to rocket over here warp speed .
well , there is a sight spike on the graph , but there could be 100 different reaon for tha .
you know , it 's true , zee .
i mean , with every country in the world sending up saellites into space , we 're alway pickig up interference of some kind 
no , it was a very specific and very distinct um .
look , zee , i 'm the first one to wan na elieve you , but there is othing here .
all right , uh , let 's just go with simple logic .
for as long as this space tatio has been in orbit , for as long as mankind has monitored the skies , no one ha ever gotten even te tiniest indication that there wa any sort of intelligent life out tere .
zenon , i assigned you this duty to keep you out of troule , and that 's all .
you believe me , right , mom ?
i beliee you believe you heard something , but it could 've been a bilio things , honey , you now , a computer hiccup , a power surge .
do n't get mad at me for saying this , but you 've been having a pretty lousy few days ,
do 't you think it 's possible you could have invented this signal just to put yourself back in the spotlight ?
dad !
i heard a zum !
got any calls from outer space today , zenon ?
next you 'll be saying an extraterrestrial ate your homeork .
aw , sounds like too much time alone in that ap lab scrambled your brain .
nebula :
come here , come here !
you 've got ta see this .
it does n't take diks or anything .
it 's wired into a totally unlimited catalog of movies you can upload by hitting a button .
it even has romeo and juliet on mars .
one and two .
do you wan na come ?
what time is it ?
you ca n't .
you 've got ta go to the ap lab .
would n't wan na miss ay calls from your alien pals .
magie , let me just say one thing .
hello , daddy ?
nebula , go watch the movie .
okay , see you !
zum .
zum .
hello ?
oh , come on !
is anybody out here ?
something wrong ?
another zum ?
wel , kind of , only higher .
zum .
ah  well ,
that is what our monitor alarm sounds like , zenon .
no zum o zum .
but , commander , i ...
hammond :
you 're not going to believe this !
even though the grap pikes clearly indicate othing more than normal satellite interference ?
in fact , i think it would be better i we suspended te rest of your assignment up here .
inanticipationo the temor-like jolt associated with the separation , allpersonnelshouldreport to designated secure areas at that time .
where 's my stress helmet ?
as far as i can figure , wyndham and lutz 's sabotage effort knocked our station out of its intended orbit .
are we just gon na sit here and take this ?
what do you propose we do ?
i do n't know , but i 'll think of something 
when heard from your lips , zee , those are the most terrifying words in the galaxy .
ou see this ?
is n't that more of a reason to fight back ?
this is where we re meant to be .
i 'm starting to wonder if we would n't all be better off back on earth .
i could mary judy .
i could get a normal job .
cetus-lupeedus , this is not you talking , commander plank .
girl :
my mom says that everybody 's calling her the girl who cried alien .
boy :
you have to come along .
you 'll love it .
there you are .
i need you to do my history report on the stock maket crash of 2006 .
is n't that so fun ?
forget it !
in fact , why do n't you just forget we were ever friends !
nebula :
do you want to laser-zap me for it ?
i 'm sorry .
what 's this really about ?
she 's a pain-maor , neb !
you 've been so caught up in this whole alien thing , i 've hardly even seen you .
fine , go with her and ride the inky commuter pod .
ugh !
i do n't care if they think i 'm a lunatic-major .
they can ridicule me and blame me , but i fully know i ' right about this .
i wish i 'd never been sent to that stupid ap lab in the first place .
whoa .
i want you to hear something .
ut it is .
zum , um , zum
are you inferring aliens sent you that ?
why ?
they 're not trying to contact anyone on the spay-stay .
♪zoom , zoom , zoom♪
i 'm seriouly sure that we need to alert plank .
orion !
both plank and hammond so do n't want to hear about the aliens right now , so i 'm kind of thinking we should keep this to ourselves .
reporttosecureareas immediately .
thejettisoningof sector seven will begin in one minute .
i think it is rudeicous times 10 how they are jut blasting away ou home bit by bit .
te way things are going , i half expect to look out the winow and see a gigundous interstellar wrecking ball .
you wo n't listen o me .
you 're so fully inked-out over that silly little fight e had ?
we 'e bfs for life !
okay .
be friends with margie if that 's what you want .
i just want to know how we 're ever gon na get past this if you wo n't tell me what 's truly tweaking you ?
no .
they are 
but , we 're a pair .
why did n't you tell me sooner , neb ?
well , you were so mad at me , i did n't think you 'd care .
this is crisis-mode-extreme .
we 'll tink of omething .
what if thoe signals were n't really from outer space ?
beside , when you 're as low on the popular pole as i am , the only way you can go is up .
can you believe it ?
zenon :
ow am i gon na survive on earth ?
hey , at least it 's not as gaseous as we used to imagine it to be .
the food ...
the food is lunarious .
the second you get tere , you hae to oder a bacon double-mushroom onion cheeseburger and dedicate it to me .
oh , we understand , believe me .
i wish those military clowns had ome idea what they were doing to all of us .
woman  attention !
all earth-bound passengers mustnowboadthe shutle in preparation for departure 
all earth-bound passengers ...
man : 49er , alpha foxtrot .
zenon :
ow !
margie :
about time , houdini .
margie !
are you trying to ruin eveything ?
i ca n't believe this .
ere you spying on me ?
ugh !
do i look dreadful ?
argh !
oh , wait a second .
are you in trouble again ?
was i supposed to pick you up somewhere ?
what in the world is going on ?
breathe .
it 's okay .
i 'll explain everything .
and nobody wants to believe me , even though i know he aliens are real , 'cause not only did they signa me twice in the ap lab , but ...
oh , it 's aliens .
do you seriously believe that ?
as sure as i believe my name is jud klin .
most days .
i mean , how could there not be other life out in the endless expanse ?
what are we , a planet of egomaniacs ?
is n't she the most stellanarious grown-u ever ?
pleae ?
okay .
let 's think .
his own manager 's been on the flat-screen saying he has no idea where he is .
do you eriously thik a ufo could swoop don , swipe up one of the most mega-famous guys on the planet , and then zoom away without anone seeing them ?
negatoy , marge .
no .
he 's here .
yeah , and this would help ...
i know , i know 
supernova girl .
impressive-major , aut judy .
there was also nova nights , and
perfectdreamhadaline init about the nova of my heart .
so he 's a ova freak .
what does tha prove ?
what else does e talk about a ot ?
okay , does n't he mention some linda girl in a ton of sons ?
cetus-lupeedus , margie !
you 're a genius-major !
so , what else is new ?
what 'd i say this time ?
aunt judy , does n't linda mean something in spanish ?
linda nova , nova linda , hmm .
what are you doing 
this is it !
as my manager , les , you should uderstand better than anybody , that someone as undeniably fantastic as me should be doing only undeniably fantastic things .
well , i ca n't run for president .
but we 're older now and wiser and fully ready to handle anything .
margie :
i m tired !
i 've got all these icky little pricker-thingies in my ankles !
o , o , no , no , no .
see , that 's where i fully draw the line .
see ya !
hey , wait !
i hae this !
i hate it !
if people were intended to be outdoors , then they never would have inveted houses !
zenon , if you 're gon na stop ead , you could at least warn a girl .
fine !
go right ahead of me .
margie ?
are you here ?
sinceyouprobablyleft this morning thinking i was still asleep , bythetimeyou get tis , daddy , i 'll be on earth with zenon .
iknowsheseemsharmess , but ever since this whole alien-mania thing ,
iloveyou , daddy .
i 'll contat you the secod i can .
bye-ness !
there 's no oter way through .
well , we ca n't just stand here until we turn into statues .
ca n't you knok it down or something ?
what if it 's poisonous ?
oh , so you 'd rather me get bitten ?
obviously !
ew !
hat happened earlier when you knocked ?
se 'll be fine by the morning .
she 's downstairs in her bedroom .
zenon :
go away !
leavemealone !
um , i betyou'reprobably wondering where your darling daughter is ?
zenon :
years of practice .
you try too hard .
relax .
margie , it tickles !
i ca n't move !
never send an amateur o do a job that requires a pro .
no , margie !
do n't !
now i 'm stuck , too !
and that 's my fault ?
zum , zum , zum .
they 're fully imitating you !
of course they are , love .
who would n't be ?
she 's fine .
come where ?
i 've done the space thing , remember ?
proto zoa !
first rock star ever to sing for aien beings fro aother galaxy .
oy-o-oy !
pack my spacesuit !
all i need to know is when do we leave .
sometimes judy gets so caught up in being the fun aunt , she does n't always use her best judgment .
it 's not going to happen , hon .
but if it does ...
this has been our hoe for so long .
it 's so familiar and protected .
and it 's where we belong .
being a family is n't about our address .
sorry , sir .
i 'm here on orders from general hammond .
you and mrs. kar are under house arrest .
we 're what ?
what ?
we have to get down to ou lab .
we have some very important experimens in progress .
i am sorry , sir .
i 'm actually writing .
i ave n't been able o scribble down a single note since i fell ito my funk .
it ' like my mom says ,
gemma usually does all the cooking in space .
yeah , and as soon as they land , creepy govenment official guys with lots of keys woud try to catch them and experiment on 'em .
outer space is a pretty enormous expanse , if i recall .
voice : access denied .
right after they sent the first message directly o me ,
orion said he suspected they also downloaded al kinds of information , but i have n't figured out how to get it .
accessgranted .
ceus-lupeedus , look !
wedefinitelyknow it 's a map , orion .
ijustdon'tknow ho to read it .
okay , can you upload it to me ?
icanty .
i 'll see if i can match any of their coordinates and get back to you asap .
how does she do it ?
he would have gotten all red-faced mad at me , if he thought i 'd flown off just to have an adventure .
oh , so once aain , i 'm the expendable one .
but i thought you had him , oh , so totally wrapped .
about some things .
look , you fully have to convince him to let us use the shuttle .
the aliens are waiting , margie , and if we can show the world that our spay-stay 's responsible for contacting other life forms hen ...
maybe they 'll stop tearing it apart and eave us alone .
come on , marge .
that 's it .
proto zoa and i will be right here rooting for you .
thetruenature of our mission ...
hello , daddy ?
assoonas we 'veelocatedall space station personel to earth by the end of next week , wewilljettisonthe remaining sectors .
man :
i could hear him .
he just could n't hear me .
can you believe this ?
judy :
i 'm telling you what zenon heard hammond elling art .
and soon .
supposei couldrustleu a shuttle , and suppose , just for a minute , thati wasinsaneenough to take off after a pack o proto zoa-loving aliens .
judy :
are you ready or this one ?
thealienssentzenonamap .
they what 
it'strue !
noonedownhere knew how to read it , but we 're hoping that he 'll have the skill and the tools to decipher i .
sweetheart ?
doyouhavethe sightest idea how crazy this sounds ?
especially life with zenon .
i simply used their benchmark symbols of the earth and moon to calibrate their distance units .
then i re-plotted those locations to our standard issue navigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in all candor , orion , do you believe this map is legitimate ?
look , sir , if you get o a shuttle ad you fly out to the location indicated here in m hardly humble opinion , you are going to find yourself , face to face with extraterrestrials .
oh , 'cause i was thinking ...
why do you hate me ?
what are you talking about ?
you 've been mean ad sarcastic o me since the las tie i was on earth .
oh , that .
wai , are you actually saying people listen to me ?
oay .
do you know how many times we 've moved , how many schools i 've gone to ?
i do n't try to be a jerk .
what if i get plank into a lot of trouble for taking that huttle ?
everybody 's got pressures in their life , margie .
if you wan na make some real fiends , start by learning you 're not the only person in te galaxy with problems .
like what ?
the air is inky brown .
he food tastes like plastic .
catain rand wills , united states intergalactic patrol .
to interiew your daughter , and find out what she knows about the current whereabouts of zenon kar .
oh , please , come in .
um , i have ...
i 've been missing her terribly .
would you permit me to pilot the departing transport shuttle this evening ?
i do n't see why that could n't work , commander .
we appreciate this .
listen , i told you everything i know .
she came down here to find proto zoa .
precisely how did miss kar intend to discover his whereabouts ?
zenon :
he is actually coming down ?
that 's a miracle-major !
did you hear tha ?
we got a shuttle , and plank 's going to pilot u to meet the aliens .
where are we hooking up with him ?
youguysneedtogetthere as soon as possible , butmakesurethat you stay out of siht .
what 's up ?
well , nebula called to say that hammond has a patrol down here searchig for you , checking anywhere and everywhere that you guys might be .
have they shown up at your place yet ?
notyet , buti 'm sure it 's ony a matter of time 
revise that .
oh !
did you hear that , guys ?
e 're going to space to meet the aliens !
woo-hoo !
judy :
it does n't eem like anybody 's here .
oh , man , you have zero idea how envy-green i am .
i mean , this is the real deal , commander .
this is the trip i have spent my whole life cogitating about .
i mean , you 're actually getting to meet extraterrestrials .
yes , well , i 'm still very ...
i 'm still very skeptical about this whole thing , orion .
woman :
oh , hang on .
you do n't want to be rocketing off to meet the aliens without your navigational charts .
thank you , orion .
i ca n't tell you how much i appreciate ...
all you help .
now , before your heli-hover arrives i have to ask you one thing .
i 've seen luggage stores with less luggage .
let me remind you ladies that staying as fabulous-looking as i am requires mega attention
have we heard from zenon yet ?
they 'e bak from nova linda cove and they 're headed for carlson beach .
before we go , would you mind terribly if maybe i washed up a little bit ?
come on .
plank is now uder full military arrest .
now , asmuchaswewanna support you in this , honey , yourmotherandi are starting to think thatmayeyououghtto surrender to hammond 's patrol andcomehome .
and fully forge about the aliens ?
now , thebottom-line reality is , plank is the only one on our side whohastheability to fly a shuttle .
i ...
not to mention historical .
why could n't you be the pilot in the family ,
i mean , you 'd go out there in a heartbeat , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
when did i turn into such a big , fat chicken ?
i used to love flying .
zenon does n't ge it al from you , you know ?
i do know .
suddenly , the stakes changed .
i mean , she wants me to do this ore than ayone .
so , where are they ?
worry-down , aunt judy .
i 'm sure they 'll be ere any minute .
i studied his ship 's navigational charts 100 times .
you sure ?
i 'm capable of flying a shuttle at this oint , orion .
i m telling you , mrs. k. , it 's fine , you wo n't have to .
what ?
what do you mean ?
um .
hi  you guys !
hi .
oh , how did edward ever pick this spot to land ?
cetus-upeedus , aunt judy , no one 's told you yet ?
hammond threw him into military jail .
hammond 's going on the mega-warpath and if i 'm wrong about this whole alien thing , it could be disaster-extreme .
but , sweat-minor , aunt judy , 'cause i 'm fully sure everything 's gon na be just fine .
but , if edward is n't piloting the shi , who is ?
oh , my word , this was a mistake .
i ..
how did i let myself get talked into this ?
look , just relax , okay .
the only thing more terrifying to me han taking off is landing .
i , uh , i really do n't think i can do it .
look , i do n't wan na be unsupportive or anything , mrs. k. , but maybe you should 've though of that before we took of .
we 're the united states military , wills , she 's a 15-year-old girl !
it'sharderthan we thought , sir .
orion :
okay , race yourself , we 're aboud to enter the atmoshere .
oh , dear .
oh , my word , the landing .
look , mrs. k. , i have full confidence in you , but can i suggest this is gon na be easier if you open your eyes !
from you , dollface .
it 's true .
there it is , i 's almost here !
orion , what if it kept flying right ou of my chest ?
okay .
oh .
oh , oh , oh !
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blue-eagle-2 , we are losing on target .
we have visual confirmation .
watchyourflanks , people .
who 's that ?
mom , we have to go !
zenon :
what 's happening ?
what 's going on ?
i ca n't get them to reignite .
engage arget .
soldier 2 :
orion :
come on .
and your girlfriend .
mr. kar :
and since it 's also a very risky and brae endeavor , and since we all have people we love on that ship , sir , maybe intead of assigning blame ad punishment , we ought to focus on a way of helping them ahieve a safe return ?
sir .
i do n't get it , mom .
well , the troube is , converting their measurements to ours does n't mean the calculations were precise .
i mean , even a variance of a few degrees on paper could mean thousands of miles out here in space .
we are gon na find hem , are n't we ?
i mean , we 'll just fly around out here until they show up ?
we have a finite fuel suppy , limited rovisions .
it 's okay , they 're gon na be here , i know it .
whatever ends up happening out here , thank you .
for what ?
honey , you showed me that it 's fine to wan na live a safe and sane life , but sometimes we can get so safe , you practically stop living .
ship onsole 
fuel tanks in depletion zone .
orion said that the auxiliary tanks he put in are even larger than he main tans .
ship console :
now , that 's wrong , it has to be .
please reconnect to main anks .
auxiliarytanksempty .
orion , did everything appear normal when you refilled the auxiliary tanks ?
i mean , i know they 're not exactly thrilled with us but they ca n't wan na leave us up here to die !
i tried caling but there must be a meteor shower in progress because all i got was static .
tell me one thing , do i look half as ysterical as i feel ?
what , more so than usual , you mean , love ?
uh , folks , we also have another problem .
before anyone can reach us , we 're gon na get sucked into the moon 's gravitational field .
is that bad ?
look , everyone first of all should stay calm .
are you sure ?
i have always known that blasting into an endles void was bad for one 's health .
so , how did i end up here ?
zenon :
come on , come on , folks , we ca n't die out here in space .
look out .
exactly as orion predited , the moon 's gotte a hold of us .
we 're going down !
mom .
mom , it 's them !
where 're tey taking us ?
am i deaming ?
how can this be happening ?
they 're not gon na hurt us .
what if they try o come on board ?
do we think it ' ...
i certainly think so .
ceus-lupeedus , did you see that ?
madam , sir ,
i bet you got a million questions for me , ai n't you , you little beasties ?
well , i 'm here .
what if we wee wrong 
apparently , their ship 's navigational computer 's goe into meltdown-mode-major .
it kind of feels like ...
if they 're such highly evolved , intelligent beings why do n't they simply tap ito our space station mainframe and take the charts they need .
wat ?
we are telling you exactly what zenon zap-padded us .
margie 's ith them , they 're all safe , they 're on their way back and if we stand by , we are gon na witness something that is , and i quote ,
the most astonishing event-major of the 21st century .
lt .
at this point , sir , um , it looks like a flying rainbow .
zenon :
they were real !
but the fact remains , i was not set up here to be some mustache-twirling villain ,
this space station has drifted out of its prescribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hammond , i ...
do you dare to argue with me ?
and we gave them the navigaional stuff hat they needed and they gave us a tow home .
and the whole thing is so macro that the world needs to know about it .
proof , margie .
what no one here seems to be offering is proof .
uh , actually , we 're falling back into orbit .
stellar .
thank ou !
thank you , thank you , thank you , ladies and gents .
well , as my pal zenon kar can testify , hen she so cleverly found me on nova linda cove , i was a mess .
so , she told me about these sace aliens , and she told me that they wanted to contact me .
they picked up my tranmission of my concert in outer space and used that to contact a true believer , zenon .
so what i i 'm not the center of the universe ?
i mean , look at me , i wanted new challenges and i 've gotten them .
so , to commander and mrs. edward plank ,
all right , everybody , clap !

of all the planets in our universe , there is ony one we know can support life 
it 's bee called he lucky planet .
without that crucial til , everything would have been different .
all life on earth is uilt on chance and powered by the sun .
but the delicate balances of our world are faltering , as the planet struggles to support our growing demands .
january , he high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month .
every living thing i just waiting .
perhaps it 's just to clean her fur , ut it looks like sheer joy .
they 're drawn to their mother 's calls , but these slopes are not the easiest place to take your first steps .
the cubs have n't been fed this morning .
the mother has delayed their first meal o this specia day .
hunger will draw them to her .
milk is the only food the cubs have known since they were born deaf and blind beneath the sow .
every year at this time , female bears need food desperately .
this is the only place the ears can hunt for seals .
if they do n't make it there before the ice breaks up , their families will starve .
it ' unlikely both of her cubs will survive their first year out on the ice .
march , and munch of the north remains snow-bound .
a thousand miles south of the bears , stunted conifers are still locked in ice .
it 's one of the last great wildernesses 
these conifers have needle-shaped leaves virtually inedible o the forest supports very little animal life .
this creature is the very essence of wilderness .
as spring creeps up from the south , the taiga is unveiled .
they 've come to make the most of the brief flush of spring food and to have their young .
if newborn calves are to keep up , they must be on thei feet and running the day they 're born .
but these vast herds do n't travel alone .
the calf may be young but it 's capable of outrunning the wolf , if it manages o keep its footing .
by this stage , the odds are eve .
april in the arctic , and already the sun ever sets .
but further south , the sun works its magic in more gradual familiar ways .
the broadleaf woodlands of europe ad north america .
more than any othe , these have been crowded out by towns and farmland .
only fragments remain .
summers are longer here and deciduous trees can fourish .
spring has also come early for the mandarin ducks .
it 's a long way down for a maiden light .
a few calls of encouragement are needed here .
there are still two missing .
only two days old and already one great adventure behin them .
a seasonal cycle that seems increasingly unreliable .
ut tere are parts of our world that have no season .
may , in the tropics , but there is no spring .
this is what allows the jungle to grow uncecked and support so munch life .
rainforest now covers a third of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planet 's surface and yet , it contains more than half of all the plants and animals on earth .
he can oncentrate on more imporant tasks , like tidying up his display area .
this magiian has a special trick .
with the audience in place , the show an bein .
she just has to hae been impressed with that .
after all that effort , can she still have doubts ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % of its plants and animals nowhere is there more at stake .
deserts cover one third of the land 's surface on planet earth , an they 're getting bigger every year .
and the challenges are becoming greater than ever .
june in the kalahari desert of southern africa .
lt 's the dry eason here , and thousands of elephants have started the desperate trek for food and water .
at the moment it is dry , but water should come .
buffalo join the great trek .
dust storms make the going tough all he way .
they 've become separated from the erd .
this is a dangerous place to ose your way 
they dare n't rest until they reach it .
finally , he stragglers emerge from te dust .
the stom has died down .
but not all the animals have been so lucky .
sand dunes give way to prairies and savannah .
grass is a great unsung heo of our planet .
this is the circle of life that most of us , in our urban lives , have lost touch with .
perhaps spurred on by a memoy from the past , the matriarch leads the herd to a temporary water hole one that may have saed her life years ago .
the calf and its mother are most at risk .
ln the dakness , an elephant 's vision is little better than our own .
the lions bide their time .
it 's the calves they 're after .
the cales are too well protecte .
as the deserts grow , and traditional migration routes are blocked by farms and fences , elephants must trek ever greater distances .
the sun hat scorches the desert also bings water to the land .
as it beats down on tropical seas , moisture rises from the warming oceans powering our global weather system .
as the air rises , so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scene is set for one of nature 's most challenging migrations .
each year , thousands of demoiselle cranes try to escape the harsh winters in mongolia , by flying south to the warmer climes of india .
to get there , they have to cross the highest mountain range on earth , he himalayas .
the cranes hit violent turbulence .
the sun 's rays weaen in the afternoon and the turbulence falls away , but it 's too late for today .
the adults must guide their young on this hazardous trip .
it 's early moning and the warm air is already rising fast .
this is the great unending cycle .
for generatios , humans and animals alie come to depend on the great rivers and their seemingly endless flow .
after months o drought , the rivers begin to flo aain in the kalahari 
this is an africa we rarely see a lush water world totally reliant on a seasonal floo , oiginating from a tropical ocean thousands of miles away .
many animas are quite at ome in the flood , but there are some more apprehensive bathers .
after weeks of marching , the elephants are exhausted .
after so many weeks , many hundreds of miles , they 've arrived .
the seasonal cycle that drives the lives of elephants on land , is just as important i the oceans 
it 's july and the humpback whales are in their breeding grounds in the tropics .
this calf is no more than a few weeks old and as he begins to tire , his mother suports him close to he surface , so that he can breathe .
these shallow equatorial waters make good nurseries they 're warm and calm and there are few predators .
to find food , she will have to lea her calf on an epic 4,000-mile journey o richer feeding rounds at the outern extremes of our planet .
his is the longest migration by any marine mammal , and it depends entirely on a healthy ocean all aong the way .
out in the open ocean , the whales meet ohers searching for food .
they have to cross half the globe , from the equator all the way to the edge of antarctica .
the tropical seas are a long way behind them now .
they 're headin for stormy seasonal waters .
great whites attack whale calves , but they 're not the victims today .
these magnificent predators  at the very op of the food chain , are a vital part of a healthy ocean ... and yet we slaughter almost a hundred million of them every year .
their populations are in freefall .
out to sea , the ice is now too thin to support the cubs ' father .
this is a disaster for polar bears .
without a solid platform , they struggle to hunt the seals they need to survive .
how will the father make it through the year now that the ice is almost gone ?
the waters are getting colder and rougher .
so as not to lose track of each oter , they slap teir fins on the surface 
the whales have finally reached antarctica in time for the summer .
at lat , after their 4,000-mile journey , the humpback whales can feed .
ow , at last , the mothe can replenish her reserves as she and her calf join the rest of the team .
winter in antarctica and the greaest seasonal change on our planet is underway .
soon the coninent will be plunged back into darknes .
the aurora australia illuminates the souhern skies , but these spectacular lights bring no warmth to the wilderness of ice .
our male polar bear is in great danger now .
after many days at sea , the exhausted bear is drawn by the pungent smells of the colony .
he 's desperate or food , but walrus are much larger than his unseal prey .
it 's the pups he 'll have to get to .
the powerful adults can do errible damage with their huge tusks .
he tests te barrier .
and again , in sheer frustration now .
it slips from his grasp .
this one too te gamble ... and lost .
unable to feed , he ca n't survive .
they 've left their other ... and are thrivig .
the polar bear has become an emblem for the state of our planet and for all the creatures who are struggling to live alongside uns .

ot at all like the plebeian peasants you would meet out here .
how can you allow yourself to go to seed like a fat duck 
ducks do n't go to seed , my dear siser .
well , like a vegetable then .
a cabbage , an artichoke .
but , darlig , think of paris .
lovely , gay paris .
that must be what they call catnip in paris .
champignons .
and delicious too .
too bad her beauty is wasted here .
we would go everywhere in style , would n't we , chérie ?
hey , mewsette 
what 's the matter ?
okay , oka .
you o n' have to push .
to mewsette , the prettiest cat in all of france
it 's your poem .
roses are red violets are blue
signed , jaune tom .
jaune tom !
you take that horrid , vulgar hing away from here this minute !
but ...
but cats like mice .
you 're not a ... ?
you 're a fe ...
what ?
i think she means a female , robespierre .
and all felines really like is champagne and champignons and chaps élysées ...
i feel like a cabbage that 's gone to seed .
like a fat duck !
oh , go away , you ple ..
plebeian peasant , you !
i never want to see you again .
i wish i were dead !
so do we .
do n't we , jaune tom ?
jaune tom ?
now look what you 've done , you ...
you old feline , you !
well , if you do n't like us plebleens , why do n't you go away with her ?
i 'll bet she just lives on cham-pag-ne and cham-pygmy-ons and champs-ulysses .
i 'l go to paris .
well , bon voyage , mademoiselle feline .
au revoir , robespierre !
what do you know ?
i must have a way with felines .
free !
oh .
you are a girl .
you can come on back now .
mewsette 'll take the mouse ?
no .
she 's left , jaune tom .
took off 
what do you mean she 's gone ?
she just went away in a cariage .
the one that took her to paris .
all felines go to paris , i guess .
let 's go mouse hunting .
hey .
wait for me 
mewsette 
for the last time , my lad , if your friend arived in that buggy she has gone to paris .
all right .
i know that , but where 's paris ?
what is paris ?
is it a school or something for felines ?
yes .
well , thanks a lot .
he went thataway .
good morning , jaune tom .
i 'm really on my way to paris !
delihtful .
oh , yes .
visiting relatives ?
oh , no .
oh , but you must think i 'm terribly bold to talk this way to a stranger .
i think your enthusiam is charming , and i 'm not offended .
oh , thank you .
i just kno i 'll be happy ere .
of course .
oh , dear me .
you need a friend , a sponsor .
mademoiselle !
please forgive me .
it 's just that ..
i thought that my sister , one of the most influential cats in pai might be persuaded to take you under her wing .
oh , no , please .
then it is settled .
come along , my dear .
i ca n't , robespierre .
i have to find mewsette .
i 'm gon na look for trains .
yes .
here we are , my dear , te best in all paris .
is n't she pretty ?
henrietta , you are m sister .
ister 
she is an old dear but a little absent-minded .
imagine , no even remembering your own brother !
yes .
how silly of me .
o course i 'm his sister .
i have told her of your wonderul salon where you will make her ino the belle of all paris .
of course , dear brother .
you know what must be done .
so this time , i want something in advance .
and you are the king of the scoundrels .
so i want one of you to keep an ee on that girl at all times .
as they say , evil is the root of all money .
gosh !
let 's go home .
no , obepierre .
well , i can .
so long , jaune tom 
well , do 't just stand there .
let 's start looking .
mewsete !
stop that noise !
go away , you silly little ussycats .
scram !
go on !
i do n't know why you ever came to paris .
it must be refined , yet seductive .
like this :
oh , stop !
being sorry is n't enough .
we do n't want to disappoint meowrice , do we ?
now , let 's show him how poised and gracefully we walk with a bowl of milk on our ead .
now walk towards me .
head erect .
left .
reverse .
oh , look out !
oh , no .
i 'm a failure .
no !
stop her !
stop her !
my poor dear .
would n't you like to stroll on the boulevard , stop at a sidewalk cafe ?
and order champs élysées , just once .
let us be gay .
we shall do the town .
those sidewalk cafes were so much fun .
and paris is so eautiful !
what 's kissing ?
but do they ony kiss in buggies ?
why is that ?
because , my naive one , there is nothing so romantic as a buggy ride .
hee we are .
how foolish i was .
i tell you , jaune tom , it 's hopeless .
she 's probably miles from here .
let 's go back to te farm .
okay .
now you 're talking !
robespierre , look !
look what it says : felines !
i 'll bet they 'd know where she is .
here we go again .
there 's no one here .
no one at all .
let 's find our way out of here and get back to that feline place .
dear mr. phtt :
p.s .
there are other suitors .
if you ever decide to marry , boys , marry for love of money .
pardon me , my friend , bu that was the most remarkable exhibition of virtu-mouse-ity i 've ever witnessed .
virtu-what-sity ?
virtu-mouse-ity .
we accept !
and no can we eat ?
milk .
let 's really live it up big , jaune tom .
champagne for the greatest mouse catcher in all france and his manager .
one bottle of champagne , hot off the ice .
hey , it 's made out of bubbles .
everyone .
shaloot ...
i salute you !
here , what is this ?
lmpossible .
where are you going , turtle ?
wat do you know ?
i wo n't harm your little friend .
you see , we three are all in the same boat .
that is pretty funny .
no .
no , i guess not .
the truth is , we have been shanghaied , shipmates .
or catnapped  in your case .
jaune tom .
it 's all right , jaune tom .
we 'll get back all right .
oh , it 's such a big ocean , robepierre , bigger than all france .
i have now .
why , look 
there you are , shipmates .
i have good news !
we are headed for alaska an the gold rush .
we will strike it rich , my friends .
then we wil return to paris in style .
no time for games , little turtle .
i must swab the deck , yes ?
according to your instructions , i am aving mewsette 's portrait painted by the mos famous atists in paris .
you will notice how monsieur monet achieves a shimmering light throughout te picture and an impression of air and space .
henri rousseau is an ex-soldier with no formal art training .
with his vivid imagination he is creating a charming orld of his own where oranges grow on banana rees .
sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pose for him .
to achieve a strong emotional impact he sometimes applies paint directly from the tube .
monsieur edgar degas frequently uses ballet dancers as his models .
monsieur paul cézanne is an intelectual artist .
the dynamic paul gauguin has only reently returned from tahiti and his paintings show the influence of the south sea islands .
here .
now , i want no sli-ups .
i want you to see that she is comfortably settled in her ...
no money , no mewsette .
very well , then .
it will be well worth it , meowrice .
mewsette is my greatest achievement , my crowning glory .
for the sake of your dear neck , i do hope so .
how allantly you put your case , meowrice .
no girl could resist you .
momentary lapse , my dear .
even cats are sometimes human 
thank you , monsieur .
you are most kind .
i do thank you for making it al possible .
paris awaits you .
and , dear madame , may i say everything that happens is because of your faith in me ?
it ill be later than she thinks .

lesson number one -- food .
slugs are extremely juicy and tender ,
and these seeds are a woderful between-mea snack .
they 're high in fiber , and they wo n't fill you up .
this is n't what wild dogs eat .
this is n't what any dogs eat .
there 's something you might prefer over there .

war of the gargantuas  furankenshutain no kaijû :
captain !
captain !
oh , nurse ...
i 'm from the maritime bureau .
he 's not well enough to speak with anyone !
i only need two or three minutes .
he has n't regained consiousness yet .
is he in danger ?
the others must have drowned when the boat sank .
how is it ?
the only thing we found was this .
the ship 's too big for everyone to have been washed off ..
the water surge could n't wash away that many people so thoroughly 
it ' notjust a coincidence ?
it 's amazing tha you were the only one to survive .
how many times are you going to say that ?
enough to hear your response !
i want you to tell us what really happened !
the four other me ...
i called out o them ... before the ship was jostled , and i saw the franenstein monster ... 
that monster has n't been found !
do n't you have anoter story ?
i know what attacked our hip !
i know in my heart that it happened !
after that , the four men ... !
i am ot lyig .
believe me , i am telling the trut ...
captain , we 've discovered what happened to the four men .
you did ?
we 're sure this is all from the ship .
what could have done this to them ?
tokyo telephone ?
i need the kyoto shinagata istitute , rankenstein research unit .
hello ?
yes this is it .
yokosuka ?
hello , this is dr. stewart .
we have n't had a frankenstein here since the one that vanished at ount fuji .
yes ...
what did he say ?
he said that a frankenstein monster may have eaten some humans .
oh , my ... !
they want to ask you questions about the gargantuan , frankenstein .
have a seat .
-it is ?
he would n't be doing things like tippig over boat , or eating humans .
es , that 's my opinion .
let 's leave that closed , okay ?
now , this is what we have next .
not yet .
now , go ahead .
just before he escaped , he found his way into my apartment .
what ' wrong ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
heave !
they 're chasing ay story that relates to frankenstein !
i have ...
we just do n't know how much of this is false .
perhaps they just do n't know where he is currently iving .
look at this ...
it is ...
doctor , i would like to check it out , if you do n't mind .
what did you fid ?
do you know what it is ?
is n't it from the frankensein ?
no , i ca n't say what it is yet .
hey , wait a minute ...
up , over there .
it looks like we 've got a bit of work cut out for us back at the lab .
thank you .
i 'm araid that those ae from frankenstein ...
i do n't believe those cells could have come from any oher life form .
but ... why is it living beneath the sea ?
flight 17 , proceed 180° at 10 knots .
a monster i coming !
a monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
no !
emergency , emergency !
your back !
what was the ting that attacked hanea airport ?
i do n't know ...
we have n't yet heard any details of wat had happened .
did n't you say hat the frankenstein you had in custody posed no threat to mankind ?
everyone , please !
lease !
we leave for tokyo immediatel .
what could make frankenstein live in the sea ?
nothing ..
doctor , can you answer some questions ?
-doctor !
what is the defense plan ?
we plan on sending a powerful electrical current through tokyo bay .
he ca n't withstand e light on a clear day .
dr. stewart , what do you say ?
i think you 'e right ...
does that mean that you 'd continue your studies of frankenstein , regarless of what happened ?
yes ... yes , i would .
that is the point of our problem ...
do you know what would happen if frankenstein appeared in a peaceful city like this ?
the lights !
is there a doctor here !
is there a doctor ?
the monster is going away !
go get a stretcher !
-right .
the monster seems to e harned by bright lights .
the monter seems to be harned by bright lights .
please turn on every light in the city area .
please open all of your windows and hutters .
give me the book ...
hanks ..
let 's go find out ...
hurry !
randmother !
-kei !
kyo !
come wih me !
hurry !
let 's go , let 's go 
we 've done all that we can !
halt !
move !
ready the searchlights !
we 're all set !
lights !
here is the latest report from headquarters .
the creature has proceeded from tokyo to the mountains along the river .
take positions !
command , we are at position 10.95° .
the creature is approximately 300 meters ...
fall back !
-fire !
look out !
cease fire !
order all units to stand down for now .
whereve he emerges , we will be able to egage him with siz units .
alright  let 's go !
-yes , sir !
right !
we 're ready in this sector !
commander , helicopter unit one ...
you are ordered to lure the monster into the established attack zone .
roger , roger !
the monster has slowed its pace .
we 'll attack soon .
calling base !
roger .
i think we should let him go a little further .
firs unit is ready !
-right !
third unit is ready !
-switch the units on !
it 's time !
-alright !
converter one is ready !
-generator two is ready !
go !
bring the helicopters into position !
hurry !
-hurry 
fall back !
fall back !
fall back !
-right !
we 're all set !
-fire !
calling base !
switch on the eletricity !
-switching on !
alright !
commander !
calling the commander !
doctor !
that one has to be the frankenstein we know !
then it seems your hunch was corect .
well , it proves that there are two of them .
now , i have to convince them that one is innocent .
that is all ..
it 's incredible ...
what 's sanda got to do with this ?
maybe , if we do n't ask o man questions and try to find some clues , we 'll know that answer .
mr. yokosuka !
good find , akemi .
oh , thank you !
thank you for coming .
have you foun the monsters ?
you may want to check the lakes and streams around here .
i see ...
noify headquarers .
shall we continue on our way and see what we can dig up on gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like his hair and tissue ...
the cells are identical .
this means that the frankenstein 's ae brothers .
maybe not ...
he ould have torn off some flesh on a rock that made its way to the ocean .
once there , on protein-rich plankton , aother fankenstein could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the other .
doctor , i tat is the case , would n't an explosion create even more frankenstein 's ?
we 'll do what we can to avoid using them .
we can use napalm !
it 's strange ...
whenever there is a strong evil force around , youth seems to blossom .
are n't we guilty of doing the same thing ?
i do n't feel any guilt .
let 's go for a walk .
before this mist gets any thicker ...
run away !
help me !
akemi !
listen to me and do n't panic !
doctor !
akemi !
hold on !
are you okay ?
you remember who we are !
wait !
gaira is the one that 's dangerou !
they are north at 135.10° and appear to be running away !
orers !
we will attack with every available weapon at our disposal until they are finished .
we will deal with that after we have completed the task at hand !
all units , retreat !
retreat !
at the moment , he 's still moving .
sanda is inocent , general ...
to save , not destroy ...
i agree with him .
a plain and simple fact that has already been proven .
if you hit them with your heavy artillery , you wil scatter their cells halfway to china .
then you wil be faced with a thousand frankenstein 's .
ho can you be sure of your theory when it is n't proven ?
doctor , could you do that ?
they have he same cels , the same genetic structure and the same blood .
what could that mean , doctor ?
gaira !
that ' just what we needed .
doctor , you 're turning off the light ?
get me the defense agency .
yes , and hurry !
yes .
he now knows that where there 's light , he 'll find food .
turn off your lights !
-please !
hurry !
hurry !
hurry !
what 's going on here ?
hurry !
hurry !
turn off your headlights !
you 'll have to leave your car here !
-amn !
help me out !
here is he now ?
where is he now ?
hello ?
sanda 's in tokyo ?
i 'm positive he has n't come to help gaira !
doctor .
this is dr. stewart .
there 's nothing we can do .
sanda is entering tokyo .
i 'll be down there right away .
akemi .
where are you going ?
we have to convince him to turn back .
you ca n't .
i 's too late now .
this time i 'm going to save his life .
halt !
go on !
you silly nut !
come on now ...
for your own safety , please evacuate at once !
we 're all set to open fire !
for your own safety , pease evacuate at once !
you 're ordered to clear the street immediately !
thi way .
akemi !
akemi !
-what happened ?
ead for the secondary command !
akemi ...
are you alright ?
-yes .
by the way , sanda came to your rescue again .
i think he has a crush on you .
thirty minutes , then ...
but how do you know he will destroy gaira ?
two minutes to attack .
hello !
i 'm sorry , akemi .
i did everything i could .
the only thing we can do now is hope their cells do n't multiply .
they 've made their way to the docks .
more , more , ore , more , more ...
are you alright ?
are you excited by electric trains ?
annabel :

it 's not that i do n't love her .
i do .
why should n't i ?
annabel , where are you going ?
i do n't go for that eggs and bacon stuff .
i want you to be healthy .
what about your room ?

where have i been ?
i 've been waiting for hours .

all due to the extraordinary eforts of this brilliant ...
revolting .
i 'm afraid that 's not complimetary enough to the developer , my dear .
nothing very complimentary could be said about annabel .
no wonder they call it the terrible teens .
have you seen how she dresses lately ?
to see mr. dilk , the principal at school .
he 's asked for a confeence to discuss annabel 's lak of academic progress .
what do you think of that ?
i 'm sure you can handle it , ear .
i 'm up to my neck in this .
tank you .
she says she knows all we do there is kissing games .
she 's also on my back to get my hair trimmed .
last time it was trimmed , they hacked 6 inches off .
parents seem to be immue to it .
sometimes i blow my top 
yesterday i said to her ,
change my image ?
that 's funny .
virginia :
last night we had it out .
liten !
how come nobody ever gets to tell you what to do ?
annabel , i said .
when you 're grown-up , people do n't tell you what to do .
which is sometimes more difficult .
and do the laundry , i reminded her .
and the shopping and the cooking .
make tings nice for everybody .
together :
something really freaky .
that 's not my voice .
what am i doing here ?
that ' not my voice .
that s annabel 's oice .

let 's get out of here .
bye-bye , brains .

you get all the fun stuff to do , dad , like kitelers and ride moorcycles .
as long as we 're comparing , i 'd like to be i your shoes .
bill , i would n't pursue this any further if i were you .
science has sent orbiters to neptue , eradicated smallpox and created a supercomputer that can do 60 trillion calculations per second
science frees us from superstition and dogma and enables us to base our knowledge on evidence
previously , i 've explored how organized faith and primitive religious values blight our lives
they do now , but you were aware it as a norm
through faith and supestition or through the rigours of logic , observation and evidence , through reason
i want to confront the epidemic of irrational superstitious thinking
you really believe it ?
and throws up new age gurus who exhort us to run away from reality
reaon and respect for evidence are the source of our progress our safeguard against fundamentalists and those wo profit from obscuring the truth
300 years ago , in the age of enlightement scientists and philosophers from galileo to david hume had the courage to stand up for intellectual principles and reason
all kinds .
this is george .
hello , what can you do for me ?
yes .
wat do i do ?
take a seat , please .
should i take my glasses off ?
what we got here ?
would you ave somebody in spirits really , really close to you and he 's got the arms around you neck
well , that 's very nice to know
all these people reap the rewards of science an reason but many here revel in a foggy suspicion of scientific thinking
irrationality is woven into the fabric of modern life , we unthinkingly indulge unscientific delusion

loyal , sen too much money a good leader
a full quarter of the british population claim to believe in astrology
day in , day out , astrological horoscopes get far more newspaper column inches tha sciece
it is in your nature to be hard-working and methodical which should serve you well at work today
in your personal relaionships , especially this eening you 'll need to curb your natural tendency to obey orders
british :
your tiff upper lip may serve you well in business dealings but try to relax and le youself go in your social life
and so on , through 12 national stereotypes
of course , the astrology columns are not as offensive as that but we should ask ourselves exactly where the difference lies
both are guily o facade discrimination dividing humanity up into exclusive groups based on no evidence
this is a map of the cosmos with london in the very cener
i always thought tat by the 21st century science and reason would have long sine cleaned up and yet every day of the week we 'e enouraged to retreat into the fog the superstitious past
astrology is a primitive belief system made into eaborate pseudo-science
it was developed in the 2nd century ad by the philosopher claudius ptolemy and has not moved on since
you could ask a question you can say , 'who has stolen my money ?
did n't an actual physical influence for planets that somehow beams own and influences us , people ?
i think it 's very hard to see tha .
the position of planets in ...
and i told you i do n't know .
what is n't a deep dark mystery is why the trite vagaries of newspaper horoscopes seem to chime with readers
psyhologists ave identified what 's known as he arnum effect where by people tend o believe statements are accurate for them personally while in fact they 're general enough to apply to ayone
and then ask people ow accurate they were ?
yes , that would be a perverse thing to do , is it 
a test of what ?
well , how accurate you are ?
scientific tet well , even if it was mischief , how could that possibly influence it
you see , well , the fact that you 're not makes me think you do n't really in your heart of hearts believe it
i do n't think you really are prepared to put your reputation on the line
well , you 're in a kind of no-lose situation , do n' you believe it ?
but as a test , we said it appy to their own star sign
not only do you have clever mercur and ambitious mars , fortunes and success
remember however that there will be others ho want what you have and will stop at nothing to get it
asrologers say this should fit just capricorn and not the rest but what actually happened ?
what a lame unk !
tha is n't necessarily pertain to me this week it pertains to me generally
a pile of rubbish !
the same number of people agreed that the horoscope was accurate for them as disagreed and similar results are found with proper large state experiments
tecnically all but one of our group should have disagreed namely our only capricorn
there 's a far richer way of looking at the comos
astronomy is a triumph of the human intelect a real science constantly enriched by new evidence
ust lie in your back and gaze up at the stars
the heart-stopping sight you 'd see is 100 billion stars spinning through an expandin universe at a speed of a million miles per day
you 're staring into a deep time machine
and yet even as science unravels these natural wonders our society is drawn to te slim pickings of supernatural belief
simon goodfellow claims that with these cards he coud use his psychic powers to tune in to the spirits of dead people aound me
these voices from the past can apparently give him a glimpe of my future
now , richard , thank you .

e something tell me more about her , pease
the lady i do feel with her ... a lot of cats
all right she liked dogs , but she hated cats
not everybody
i mean i 've got people like yourself ...
extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
because now many peole come to this vent for some reason and because they want to close to ou in that direction in the line
many cases tat people that are , you know , have lost somebody , lost a child so dear to them then they can not get out with the fact of having lost the child and become addicted to these ...
okay , this a lady who is tring to connect with somebody at the front of ..
derren brown is a celebrated illusionist but also a skeptic
he makes clear his performances depend simply on mental tricks
she looks very , very elegant and there ' guilt on her part
he gives me the inside intelligece on how a psychic medium might exploit entirely earthly trade secrets
well , the saying was you 're constanly supplying the meaning yourself but it can be really convincing
charles ...
the psychic will , it 's a group throughout names ,
you know it really could be anything so soebody just pick up on it and tell you into what they want to depict
he 's saying something about a hat that you used to like or something with the hat
and he asks me back
no , and i just put another picture , i put a picture in the hallway of the family or something
and we ask that we can now build a bidge between this world and the next so that we can once again go some way to proving that we survive eath and the our loved ones in the spirit are forever with us .
okay , i expec most of you are familiar with spiritualism but those that ...
but i thought i could hear and it could be dave , devon or davenport something like that
no , but i have a home in davenport
you have a home in davenport ?
well , it depeds on what you call cold reading or something got a lot of te rations that come up saying that what you do or you say something can people basically make it fit
now , see if i can find the charles in a minute but let me ... give you a few things i can feel about you
has hat been a few prolems with the stomach condition around you
and i feel with this ady i want someone that 's a fairly comfortable build i would say a bigger build lady not the slight build lady that 's given me this , ye ?
i hate you when i ca n't find the link let me see if ..
i think if i wee talking to someone in the spirit world
i 'd say things like 'what 's it like being dead ?
i believe it 's a blending of thoughts between myself and the spirit communicator but if only it could be just like a telephone line
let me just say what we can get a little more information from her first
if you 've convinced the person that as their grandmother to the point that they 're actually crying
i mean surely those tears enough are perhaps proof that he had proed that really is thei randmother that 's making the communicaion
i could indicate just desperate wishful thinking perhaps
now , i do n't fi o with a steve bennet for i 've got those things i want to bring together somehow with particularly a car crash
my friend ben died in a car crash and he 's ... on school 's day
your friend ben passes and so thee 's not benet as i said it was ben
beyond whether it s true or false what concerns me as well is the exploitation of often vulnerable people
can i say when you were buying the new shoes have you been on your mind at that time ?
it was on my mind , i know i really buy , yeah
and you know his messaes reall in a whiny sorry , because he ca n't ...
he gives me the feeling that ...
but do peole move forward ?
he actually had a tire on the left hand ...
okay , well , i ca n't remember that
seriously you believe it ?
i have personal proof it 's true to me but as with religion if it hangs on private feelings that ca n' be proved or disproved by science then i what way can it be alid or meaningful to the rest of u
next i want to find out what happens when those who claim mysterious powers do alow hemselves to be tested
now , i think it 's false so shall we see how well you have done 
i want to show how scientific reason is always the best way to look at the world and explain the dangers of supertition
i 'm often asked how i know that there i n't a spirit world or psychic clairvoyance
it seems improbable but unlike the fixed world views of mysical faith science is always open to new possibilities
until quite recently scientists did n't know how bats fly around in total darkness
could they have paranormal extra-sensory perception ?
but the more scientists tested the eidence , the more robust the theor became
eveything about it added up to a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence that this realy was a fac
the more we look at it , the weaker it becomes
the alleged detection of water through dowsing is not obviously ridiculous it might work but does it ?
the only way to tell is through a rigorous experiment
how does dowsing work ?
1 question and nobody can answer you
i think of the question and i expect god respond in a way that i understand
i expect the right hand one point to the camera and the left and one straight forward , i wan na ...
have you doe the test yet in the tent ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm go na 6 right , 100 %
so what do you make that then ?
the pychologist chris french thinks there may be a simpler explanation
he has devoted his career to investigating claims of the paranormal
but there 're always the possible explanations there , what we 're trying to do it a set of conditions which rule out any of those explanaion then we get down to the very fundaental basic issue ca n't the dowsers actually do what they think they an do .
i think it 's alse
so shall we see how are you done ?
this is sand .
in that case i ca n't do this
this is the water in no .
3
well , you got one right and , that was 6 which is what we expet by chance
three .
what 's interestig is it does n't actually tend to dent their conidence at al
i think they are completely sincere and they are typicaly ver , very surprised when we run them through series of trials and actually say at the end of the day where your performance is no better than what we would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has happened but i did say from the outset could n't we just sort out some grey blocks and some scaffold boards , so then i can work about it which is what i would routinely do and i 've done for 40 years
who knows where or what ottles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole point
this state of denial is extraodinary .
even when confronted with ard fact these dowsers prefer not to face up to truth ut retain hei delusion
irrational belief from dowsing to psychic clairvoyance has roots in early mankind 's habi of attributing spirit and intention to natural phenomena such as water , the sun , a rock or the sea
in 480 bc , king xerxes of the persians built a pontoon bridge across the hellespont and the rough sea came and wrecked it
i wonder whether there 's something of king xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't want to believe that things just happen we want to believe that there 're some kin of deiberate intention behind everythin even when inanimate objects are concerned
and perhaps that is the key to humanity 's belief in the supernatural
even in the 21st century , despite all that science has revealed about the indifferent vastness of the universe the huan mind remains a wanton storyteller reating intention in the randomness of reality
the delivery of rewards by a one-armed bandit is determined at random but many gamlers want to think that what they do can increase their chances of winning the jakpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
here 're two kinds of mistakes they can make they ca either fail to detect pattern when there is some or they can seem to detect pattern when there is n't any and that 's superstition
60 years ago , the american pychologist b.f. skinner investigated the behavior of pigeons rewarding them with food when they learned to peck a key in the feeding appaatus
but then skinner set the apparatus to reward the birds at random now the pigeons just have to sit back and wait , but that is n't what tey did
when an individual pigeon , for example , happened to look over its left shoulder and the reward echanism just happened to click in at that point
by sheer luck as it happened the reward mechanism delivered food at the same time again and so the pigeon was reinforced in its idea that looking over the left shoulder was what got it the reward
and it went on and on and tured into a maniac for looking over the left shoulder
humans can be no beter than pigeons
spiritual self help guides o a roaring trade in the material word outnumbering science books by 3-1
but what does spirituality actually mea ?
so please take your seat and please come slowly and gently and so that we can star the proceeeing without losing time
so could you please ...
and he counts aongst his many fans price charles and dalai lama
i was present in the begining , in the first big bang and i 'l be here for billion of years o come
but is n't satish 's spirituality just about imposing yet another superstitious force positive ?
world is mae of two elements .
there the spirit is very big , and very holisic , and very inclusive world
it is not defined in a one particular way so when you go in a room you can sa the tree has a spirit
nature ithout spirit can not exist like tree can not exist without the sun .
light , it can not exist without rain , ... can not exist without soil also it an not exist without a treeness .
the treeness is the spiritual uality
or the rockness
whe you talk about the rockness or the quality of a roc
it al sounds very poetic , but it 's not reality like priests , mullahs , and rabbis , new-age mystics ceaelessly attemp to fill gaps in human understanding with fabricated meaning
science and rationality are often accused to having a cold bleak outlook but why is it bleak to face up to the evidence of what we know
the word mundane has coe to mean boring and dull , it really should n't , it should mean the opposite because it comes from the latin mundus , meaning the orld , and the world is anything but dul
there 's real poetry in the real world .
science is the poetry of reality
next i want to look at the dangers that poses
why do i have to trust , you know , the gp , why do i have to trust the royal society
i think you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong
in the last 50 years , science has put a man on the moon , cloned a sheep , decoded the human genome
and yet , sadl , the white heat of the 1970s seems to be treated as white elephant today
anything yellow close is okay..
the fundamental problem i thik lies with the fashion throughout our educational system to teach students to value private feeling more highly than evidence based reason
for relativists , scientific truth is just a patriarchal western orthodoxy that like the old roman catholic church stands i the way of other equally valid outlooks on the world
wih things like paranormal , the drive for alternative medicine , al these kinds of movements away from the orthodox in science
in terms of different kinds of treatments and things like that and in a way , not trusting the experts any more
i think you 're so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong , you 're absolutely wrong
we want to question authority .
we do nt want to say because his person is the president of royal society thereore what he says is riht
we 've got to go back to the evidence and find out what is actually true ?
but the impersonal algorithms of internet search engines do not weed out robust evidence from unsourced , uncorroborated assertion
paranoia conspiracy theories circulate unchallenged
sometimes they 're relatively harmless like the rumor that nasa faked the moon landing which is a bit of a joke because the evidence for going to the oon is so strong
but how about the malicious and utterly unfounded rumor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agents not to go to work in the world trade center on 9/11
as eidence is devalued een medical progress has become a target ... through vomiting .
hundreds of families blame me .
an innuendo ciculated that the establishment was conspiring to risk our children 's health
it led to hundreds of thousands of parents failing to protect their offspring from the threat of measles a seriou disease that in afghanistan kills 35,000 people a year
reason has buil the modern world , it is a precious but also a fragile ting which can be corroded by apparently harmless irrationality
next week , i look at how health has become one of the fiercest battlegrounds between reason and superstition

you do not have a right to talk .
you cause all the trouble and you eat all the food .
you kids should n't fight just because your ather 's trying to teach me a lesson .

it 's my family too !
hold on , hold on .

you 're not cutting class , right ?
i do n't know .
i guess i 'm just overly sensitive about thi whole job .

woud you like to step out an have a cigarette , mr graham ?
i understand .
she 'll be alright now , mr graham .
well , i have to take it in 2 or 3 times a week .
which is somewhat inconenient , but the car is well worth it .
how often do you drive it ?
2 or 3 imes a week .
i have to take it in eery time i drive it .
yes .
my own mehanic has not been very helpful .
ever .
and there 's a lot of carbon on the valves .
yes , there alays is .
usually needs a tune-up every few weeks .
your attorney , mr beckett , has been trying to reach you .
he 's been calling the superintendent 's office all week .
i do n't care to discuss it .
... and he told me there was carbon on the valve ... which was no news to me 'cause there 's always carbon on the valves .
ha ha , i told you a ferrari was useless in the city .
what a day .
that 's a perfectly insane ...
what is it ?
a mr eckett on the phoe !
beckett ?
has an urgent message .
half the time is pent taking off and the other half is spent on landing .
every time i bring her out she has to have repairs .
my mechanic says it 's carbon on te valves .
this is long island tower .
roger .
i 'll just get out here , thank you .
oh , jerry !
mr von rensaeller ?
he 's in the lounge with mr beaumont .
but i spraye and the crown gal is gone .
really ?
ah , those idiots .
i wa prevailed upon as honorary secretary to bring it to your attention ... so you can stir it up at the bank .
now , listen to me very carefully , please .
you see , when you have capital ... you are able to derive ...
i wil attend to the check in a moent , mr graham .
i unerstand about the check .
i 'm trying to explain something to you ... that is terribly important .
when we spend more , per month or per year ... than we have in income , you must then dip into the capital ... eventually exhausting the caital and of course , therefore , the income .
do you see what i mean ?
mr beckett .
i ' trying to explain to you that it is impossible to pay the check ... because your expenses have exceeded your income ... to such a poit that you have exhausted your capital .
do n't treat me as though i were a child , mr beckett .
no , what about his check ?
in other words , you do n't have $ 60 .
come to the point , beckett .
the point , mr graam , is that you do n't have any money .
what could i ... ?
how could i put it ?
that money ...
you have no money .
there 's no other way to put it .
you have no money .
and what of my stocks , my att , my general motors ?
y-yes , i know ...
my emeralda peat ?
yes , yes , i know about eeralda peat .
let me show you something 
i did not !
that is beside the point .
do you realize that this check has bounced , mr beckett ?
i mean , bounced !
it is not he first check that you 've had bounced , mr graham .
i 'd like to show you thi check of $ 550 .
you mean to say that i 'm now in the position of owing you $ 550 ?
no , no , no , do n't , do n't , please , do n't think of it as a loan , mr graham .
disliking you as intensely as i do , i wanted to be absolutely certain ... that when i looked back upon your financial downfall ...
i could absolve myself completely of any responsibility for it .
i do n't think he 'll give you a nicel , r graham .
and considering your gift for close personal relationships ...
thank you very much , mr becket .
this will cover the overdraft of $ 550 hat i owe you .
smoke them in good health .
goodbe .
goodbye .
goodbye 
nice to see you .
thank you .
i was looking ... for someone .
good afternoon , mr gaham .
i 'm kind of surprised .
would you like to have a table for one ?
no , no , thank you .
i just wanted to ...
but it 's always great to see you .
you 're always welcome here .
you know that .
i 'm sorry , m sullivan .
i know nothing more about your application .
i 'll come back tomorrow and check .
good afternoon  mr graham .
were you expecting some mail ?
certainly , sir .
i knew i could count on a straight answer fom you .
thank you , sir .
it 's the best suit you can find in ready-to-wear .
the racket club does not keep those members on a trust that worry missig their dues .
oh , no !
i was just about to ring for it .
harold , i have something to tel you .
is it about your money , sir ?
in any case , it 's gone .
yes , it was my first thought .
my attorney advised me against it on the grounds that it would be useless .
see , the thing of it is , harold ... that i have no hope of ever repaying him , or anyone .
all i am , or was , is rich .
i was so happy .
what will i do ?
what any gentleman of similar reeding ... and temperament would do in your position , sir .
no , sir .
i was n't going to suggest suicide .
you mean to a woman ?
that is what i had in mind .
it ' the only way to aquire property without labor .
i could n't ...
i mean , she 'd be here ... asking me where i 've been ... talking to me ... alking .
well , it was only a suggestion , sir .
but the alternatives ... are very limited and unspeakabl depressing , sir .
if you do not commit suicide , sir , you will be poor .
poor ?
hardly ay , sir .
you 've already reeived your third notice ... from both con edison and the bell telephone company , sir 
thak you .
do it , get arried , sir .
borrow enough mone from your uncle to keep up appearances .
you have managed in your own lifetime , mr graham ... to keep alive traditions that were dead before you were born .
yes .
thank you , sir .
no , no .
that 's a good idea .
i 'm going to do it , harold .
oh , i 'm so glad , sir 
yes , please , harol .
i hoe i do n't have to grovel too much .
can i tae it your answer is no ?
you 've been an ass , henry .
oh god , what a witty thing to say !
no .
what could you possiby do in six wees ... that would enable you to repay me ?
get what ?
yes .
get married .
to wom ?
by suitale you mean rich ?
yes , as far as marriage is concerned ...
you see , as far as marriage is ...
no .
and i can engage in any romantic ativity .. with an urbanity born of disinterest .
we are talking about character .
that is something i usually require of servants ... in the form of a brief letter written by someone like myself ... to the effect that the servant in questio ... does not have the ingenuity to steal .
what is my collateral in the event that you fail ?
my paintings and sculptues .
oh , well .
and my ...
what ?
no , what 
you said no .
i 'm asking for a $ 50,000 loan .
six weeks .
i 'll do it .
on one condition .
i am entitled to ten times the amoun i 'll lend you .
tose are my terms .
take them or leave them as you choose .
mh-hm .
good .
i 'll have my attorey draw up the documents tonight .
yes .
thank you , uncle .
it comes as rather a shock to me , too .
are there any here ?
i mean ... unattached ones ?
no , no , as far as i know , sharon has no close family .
her husband , robert hart , as a cattle baron , i think .
and it satisfies me .
i have found peace in connecticut .
i mean , after all , what else is there ?
i love , i wish love , i am human , i am a woman , henry !
damn mosquitoes !
no mother ?
you have no mother ?
no one at all ?
oh , henry ...
ho i long to hear another voice .
your aunt ...
yes , as a matter of fact she does .
no mother ?
no , tank you .
oh .
well , would you ... ?
henry !
what the hell are you doing here ?
i 'll never do it , harold .
not only do i still have to meet her , bu i have to court her ... mary her and get $ 50.000 from her ... before the honeymoon .
i 'll never do it ... unless i elope tomorrow .
you will do it , sir .
when we are working for something we really love , as you are , si ... we can always find a way .
do you really understand what you 're doing ?
oh , my dear .
yes , because ...
henry !
everybody !
this is heny graham .
this is harriet storch .
bo , of course , you know .
hi , henry .
mr and mrs sims , toot and roggie .

that 's becoming mad , bo .
she 's ol guy owell 's daughter .
was .
and who was he when he was alive ?
well , he was an industrialist or composer , something like that .
well , did he die with his wealt intact or ...
i heard he was enormously wealthy when he died .
is that right ?
i thought you did n't know who he was .
well , i did n't at first .. but the vividness of your description has restored him to my memory .
he was enormously wealthy when he died .
and the girl ?
she 's enormously wealhy , too .
no close relatives ?
no .
no .
she 's a botanist !
does n't ride , either .
does n't entertain .
i think she 's about the most isolated woman i 've ever met .
madeleine , would you get ms lowell another cup of tea , please ?
i 'm terribly sorry .
that 's alright , dear , really .
could n't care less .
it 's nothing .
it 's just an old rug .
i 'll take this .
forgive me a moment , will you , bo ?
excuse me .
henrietta , is this some kind of joke ?
once yes , but twice in a row ...
madam .
there you are , madam .
take your damn carpet to the cleaners and send te bill to me .
come , ms lowell , i 'm taking you home .
take your bag .
you dare call me a son of a bitch ?
you 're more to be sconed than pitied .
you can dismiss your car .
i beg your pardon ?
tis is very nice of you .
thank you .
no , you do n't have to apologize , ms lowell .
no .
you were a guest .
a woman of your tature has a right to expect every courtesy in any home she consents to visit .
what stature ?
i 've read far too many botanical journals ... to take that question seriously .
are you a botanist ?
every science has its fans .
carbon on the valves .
tell me about yourself , ms lowell .
your work , your hopes , your dreams ...
well , i work as a teacher and i also do fiel work and write monographs .
on m las field trip i identified and classified ... all the varieties of ferns on jolly buoy .
it was one of the longest monograph i 've ever written .
i 'd love to read it sometime .
i do n't know wat my dream is .
well , in any way , that is my work ad my hope , except for my dreams which i 'm not certain of .
oh , like parkinson 's disease being named after james parkinson .
that 's rigt .
or the bougainvillea being named after louis de bougainville .
brussels sprouts .
yes , i guess it is .
this seems rather presumptuous , does n't it , to hope for immortality ?
not to me .
if you ca n't be immortal , why bother ?
self-assured .
you 're so positive .
it almost gives me confidence just to be with you .
then i a very short time you will be a very confident botanist because ...
i intend to be with you a great deal of the time .
oh , yes .
oh , heavens !
yes .
until this evening .
good morning , mis-
you have exactly 7 days and 9 ours to destitution .
shall i serve your breakfast in bed ... or ould you like me to follow you about with the tray ?
i ave n't got time to eat .
reserve a table for two at pavillion for tonigh .
'55 was a glorious year for mouton othschild .
bette than '53 , i think .
may i ask you something ?
er , not that i can recall .
why do n't you just drink grape juice ?
it 's not as sweet .
good night .
nigh , steward , thank you very much .
thank you .
5 days and 11 hours 
listen to me , please , harold .
well , bone up and study the chapter on classification .
she has no spirit , no wit , no conversation ... and she has to be vacuumed every time she eats .
yes , she is .
i 'll have to start earl if i 'm going to propose .
yes , sir .
oh , shall i orde additional champane , sir ?
no champage .
i have recently been re-reading gregor mendel 's ... fascinain experiments with garden peas .
yes , but we must n't forget morgan and muller .
erm ... does it seem that to you ?
ollective appraisal has never appealed to me .
ooh !
is there any cold water ?
no , no , never mind .
henrietta , please .
nonsense .
i 've ruined another carpet .
stop that .
can ou possibly believe , for one moment ... that what hapens to this foolish , hairy floor covering matters to me ... when i have you sitting beside me ?
looking at me with your beautifully soft ... yet highly intelligent , well-informed eyes ?
you must think me very superficial .
would you care for some more wine ?
oh yes , i would love some .
it 's ... erm ... it 's , oh , it 's 10 o'clock and then we have to leave prett soon ... 'cause i have to get up tomorrow very early for a class .
we are both of te same division :
vertebrata ... the same class : mamalia ... the same order : primate ... the same famil : hominide the same genus : homo ... the same species : sapiens ... and the same variety of a class .
i do n't think there 's a class of variety ...
keep quiet , henr- !
i 'm very sorry .
in fact the oly difference between us is that i am a man and you are a woman .
y-yes .
oh , henrietta , if you care for me at all .
learn to care for me at all ... in a reasonable amount of time , please say yes .
there is often a tidy profit in speculation .
enrietta .
did ou hurt yourself ?
no .
i would literally ... have nothing .
there would be such a ...
i wo n't ...
you 're not ?
o .
that was my dream , henry .
that someday you would as me to marry you .
henrietta , darling , would this saturday be too soo ?
oh , heavens , mercy !
henrietta , i 'm intesely uncomfortable .
yes , es , yes !
you 're a good ... a good girl .
ouch !
stop that , harold !
i 'm sorry , sir .
that hurts .
i 'm enormously pleased , sir .
oh , i wish you could 've been there , harold .
you would have been astonished of my techniue .
harold , send an announcement out to te newspapers ... and put ms lowell 's attorney on the guest list .
it seems he 's a close personal friend of hers .
has the ine come up off the rug yet ?
no sir .
i 'm soaing it now in various solvents ... bu tey only seem to dissolve the nap .
i oughta sue her .
do you know how any lamas must have died to make hat rug ?
unseemly ?
did i say she was primitive ?
i retract that .
she 's feral .
i am nauseated .
i limp .
and i can feel my teeth rotting away from an excess of sugar ... that no amount of toothpaste can dislodge .
that woman is a menace not only to health ... ut to wetern civilizatio as we kow it .
she does n't deserve to live .
forget i said that .
oh , get off my lap , you little ingrate !
get off !
he did it .
he really , really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who henrietta lowell 's attorney is .
in fact  he has an office somewhere in this building .
he does n't seem to have a very active practice .
well , what i mea is ... he may not be exactly overjoyed ... at the idea of sharing her affections with henry .
no ...
andrew .
no , i wo n't accept it .
nonsense .
who is he ?
that little wino who wen with you on one of your field trips to the canary islands ?
no , it is not .
well then , who is it ?
a foreigner ?
some little wop with a fancy title ?
really , anrew .
of course , henrietta .
custom-made ... hat .
you will find ...
andrew , you will find some wonderfu woman ho deserves you .
what 's wrong ?
henrietta , darling ...
andrew , i 'm going now .
i 'm leaving , in order to meet henry ... who  it just so happens , is an american citizen of english extraction ... with a ery large fortune of his own .
what 's heny 's last name ?
graham .
alright , alright .
you wo n't get away with i , henry graham .
let me see .
now , i have o do something .
very well , put him on .
mr graham .
one day before the ceremony that will unite you as man and wife .
let me explain .
as henrietta 's friend and attorney , it behooves me to take on the ever unpleasant role of the devil 's advocate .
and despite her assurances that you are a man of means ...
excuse me , sir .
tea will be delayed by 7 minutes .
anrew , you had no right to do tha .
i have nothing to hide .
the grahams have been with the same bank for six generations ... as mr mcpherson has undoubtedly discovered .
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you can substantiate this hearsay , because i intend to sue you for slander .
i would n't be here if i could n't .
henrietta , here 's a photostat of the original note .
now take a good look at it .
you 're still gon na sue me for slander , mr graham ?
yes , mr mcpherson .
i am til going to sue you for slander .
alright .
now , let 's put in this way , graham .
agreed .
let 's hear te reason .
i was going to use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affairs ... and then immediately afterwards ... kill myself .
yes , henrietta .
my ife was over .
henry , why did n't you tell me ?
i woud have married you the very first day .
you do n't believe hat garbage , do you ?
any sex-starved half-wit would know that 's just a line .
what 's the matte with you ?
you have been unbelievably crue .
thank you for keeping me alive , henrietta .
you 're welcome , henry .
i ca n't believe this !
get off .
i beg of you , henrietta ...
i be of you , henrietta .
do n't get carried away .
if he 's not really interested in your money , make him prove it !
i would o anything in the world to prove to you , henrietta ... that i have n't the slightest interest at all in your money ... but there is absolutely no way i can do it .
there is no way .
i have a way .
but there is no way .
do n't listen to him , henietta .
tat way , people wo n't get the wrong impression from his uncle the way i did .
you would like ... you would ...
are you crazy ?
have you gone totally out of your mind ?
my idea was for him to disclaim all your money , not to share it .
it 's ver naive of you .
and then people really would think ... that he was marrying me for my money .
this way he 'll already have all my mone .
you nincompoop 
how dare you call my fiacee a nincompoop ?
harold !
i thought you were going to play the bach .
this is what he told me to play .
that little woman .
oh no .
she 's ...
harold , she 's unscrewing y montrosini .
i 'll screw it back when se leaves .
she 's destroying my living room .
why did i get into this ?
well , it 's not !
oh , sir , get a hold of yourself .
o , sir .
you will share things .
mcpherson sent you in ere to find out what was going on ?
i he the groom ?
i 'll ask the questions from hee on in .
herietta , if i could just alk to you ...
who are you really ?
and i want real names or else you 'll regret it .
i 'm dodi heinrich .
sir , you are hysterical .
you are due at the atar now .
i wo n't move unil she leaves .
get her out .
miss heinrich , i will escort you to the bathroom .
and she will not ouch my things .
it 's time .
what are you doing up there ?
frank , i tink one of my legs is shorter than the other .
it 'll get ... longer again after the ceremony .
henrietta , it 's not too late .
oh , henrietta , i just talked to his uncle ...
i 'll kill myself , henrietta ...
deary beloved .
i 'll be leaving now .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay .
thank you .
erm , henrietta , i will use this chest and you can use tha one .
and i will unpack my own hings .
yes , henry .
then shall we unpack ?
it 's probably been classiied for years ... but i might as well just try it anyway .
why not ?
this is really incredible .
commonly found in gardening sheds .
spreading and eulsifying agents .
soap , saponins , gelatin ...
get poison from gardening shed .
toxides : arseni acid , sodium arsenite , boron compounds , cyanides .. cyoyenates and related compounds ...
this one or that one ?
either one is fine for me .
and when we both use the same bed , we 'll use this one .
champagne ?
henrietta , where is your other arm ?
it fits over one shoulder and the other one goes inside .
it 's very uncomfortable .
fine ...
i just thik you have your head through the arm-hole .
if you 'll just stad up for a minute .
i think ...
no , not that one .
ut that one down .
that arm down .
let me put my glasses ...
oh , here .
alright .
see , you have your ...
you have your head through the arm-hole .
out of the arm-hole .
see  both of the holes look very similar .
where ... here is your head-hole ?
oh .
here you are .
no , wait a miute .
you have ...
that 's it .
this is a head-and-left-arm hole .
here .
there you are .
oh , i see .
now , there !
i 'm sorry to be so much rouble to you .
where is mrs graham , ir ?
who ?
is she not with you , sir ?
hello .
oh , welcome home , mrs graham .
may ... may i express my great joy at seeing you ... again .
he disappeared just as i was about to leave .
ould n't find him ?
no .
that 's why i uually take the bus .
who 's john ?
john is the chaufeur .
his memory lases .
i ...
i think you ought to prepare yourself , sir .
mrs graham 's household is incredibly democratic .
could 't find the cauffeur ?
chauffeur ?
henry , this is the housekeeper , our housekeeper , mrs tragget .
oh , well ...
i guess , er , his car broke down .
i 'll have to look into that .
very good .
you 're welcome .
oh , baby .
oh , i need ou .
oh , i want you .
tell me , henrieta , on what basis do you hire your servants ?
efficiency or persoal charm ?
oh , er , madam ?
this is the cook 's daughter , andy .
e , madam , ould you mind letting us through ?
harold !
harol ?
yes .
hm .
look at this , harold .
there are 17 servants in this house , including a cook 's daughter ... who gets $ 200 a week as her mother 's helper .
i want all the servants in this room ... and be sure that mrs graham is not present .
copy this ledger exactly and put it back under the mattress .
yes , sir .
it 's in the back of the garden .
oh , good .
we do n't have anything like that , mr graham .
ut surely some of the more basic pesticides ... arsenic , strycie ... that kind of thing .
oh , really ?
well ... if it really works , why change it ?
mr graham , on behalf of the entire staff , i would like to welcome you aboard ... and drink a toast to your success .
thank you vey much , mrs traggert .
no  thank you .
mrs traggert ...
there 's something about you that puzzles me .
surely , after having uccessfully managed ... to head the household accounts ... to the tune of 35,000 tax-free ollars per year , for the past five years ... you mut have salted something away .
have i ever .
i 'm not including , of course ... the token salary of $ 800 a week
four ... four hundred .
oh .
you receive as mad money .
mrs traggert , you 're fired .
it means that you are a thief , mrs traggert .
on what rounds are you making this accusation ?
if you are not out of this house by 10 , i will call the police .
uh , e ...
you , er , you would n't like to hear my side of the story ?
alright , alright !
i ' leaving 
john , do you think we ought to scrap our cars ?
huh ?
it would mean bankuptcy if we acually took them out on the road .
yeah , i have ive .
well , five will do very nicely , john .
i 'll ty to clarify it , john .
you 're being fired ecause you are a cheap crook .
i will shoot you as a trespasser ... with proved crimina intention .
and i am an excellent shot .
does that make it clearer ?
well , e ... why , if you got ta act like that ..
i quit .
as for the rest of ou , you have exactly two hours to get out .
you too , madam .
he means business !
henry , there are a lot of strange people in the oue , who are they ?
they are not people , henrietta , they are servants .
you know , henry , mrs traggert will be furious .
mrs traggert has been fired along with he rest of the staff ... so her emotional responses need no longer concern you .
fine .
henrietta , come , please .
thank you .
you may go , erica .
especially john .
we did n't vote on it , henrietta .
i simply told them they were fired .
oh no , oh no , henry .
do you have an idea how muc money as been spent to run this house ?
really , he has his finger on everything .
he co-signed all of mr traggert 's checks ?
he 's vey thorough .
henr ...
she said it would be easier for her .
so i ...
i , er ... did .
yes ?
never , er , never mind ...
i would like the bank to issue a statement covering all your accounts ... and please instuct them that no check has to be drawn on any account ... unless it was o-signed by me .
i can go over your holdings and your federal and state tax returns after you 're ... after you 're ... after , afterwa- , afterwards .
holding and federal , okay .
heavens .
yes ?
i suppose you 're absolutely satisfied with the oranic method ?
yes , i am .
now , mr mcpherson .
nobody did .
if a judge sees those salaries ... he 'll clamp you in jail on spec .
very few chauffeurs make $ 600 a week .
from all of us .
according to the records , i do n't take anything at all , and do n't you forget it .
laura !
wait .
laura .
now , wait a minute .
we 've been a great team .
we laughed a little .
pu a little away together .
... gardening shed ...

whom do i know with a gardening sed ?
i sprayed and the crown gal was gone .
what an exciting coincidence .
have ou ever thought of teaching , dear ?
do n't you ?
i have no inlination to teach .
how do you know , dear , if you 've never tried ?
... on a cash basis ... accrual basis therefore deduct taxes in the year in which they ae actually paid ...

he handles the income taxes rather well .
what ?
i wanted to ask you omething .
well , you know that every summer i go on a field trip ... for my reseach work .
i thought i might go on a canoe trip on the adirondacks .
it 's all sort of tangled and isolated .
and , erm ..

the adirondacks .
i ould feel safer even than with a guide .
i would n't if i were you , sir .
ell , do n't forget to pack my swiss army .

do you remember some weeks ago , sir , when ... when you told me that you 'd lost all your money ?
haold , do n't forget to pack the compasses and the maps .

and i discovered it during our honeymoon .
but i could n't believe it , so i sent it to wagner ... at the university of michigan .
and henry , it is .
i 've discovered a true species .
well .
that 's very nice .

alsophila grahami , for henry graham .

it 's the z11 that 's attracting them .
it only makes it itch more .
they say that if you do n't scratch , it ithes less .
i spilled the honey .
here , henrietta .
what will i do ?
it seems easier to paddle somehow .
that 's because the current gets stronger as we approach the rapids .

boy :
it was hotter than blazes , about 110 .
so we stayed in the house , in the air conditioning .
we just hung around , my siter and me and watched ountless hours of daytime tv .
too hot to go out .
we 'd melt in the sun .
that kaboom shook the oom .
we turned , and into our house something slid .
the first silly thing we can do ...
we 'll make a big mess .
but our parents were out .
they were gone for a week .
as for playing wih glue , my sis said :
kids need to have fun .
he does n't seem well .
hey , woodchuck , calm down .
just relax .
it 's you who smells bad .
said the kid in the lid .
as the ater got deeper , the woodchuck went :
blub !
it 's okay .
sai the kid .
i 'll pull on this chain so the water goes down .
it filled up he kitchen and bedrooms , and then ... it splashed out the door and into he street , where it provided relief from the afternoon heat .
kids came from all over to splash in the lake , not knowing the source was our potty break .
they 're swimming in water straight out of our toilet .
think we should tell 'em ?
you 'e rude , and you 're naughty .
to make matters worse , i 'm tuck in this potty .
perhaps you should nap .
said the kid .
i 've returned .
it would 've been sooner , but i needed a shower .
he opened the top and shouted :
let 's play .
then out sprang two kids , who responded :
they gave us a kiss ...
mwah .
the first kid was trouble , but these two seem worse .
hi .
how you doing ?
kid 2 looked at mary  then whispered :
then they ra all aroun , doing impossible feats , acting like kids who 've had too man sweets .
i 'm hungry .
he shot out he room and ran into the kitchen .
the san fracisco treat .
hey , that was delicious .
i 'm hypoglycemic .
oh , o , you must stop this .
aid sis to kid 2 .
then the walls started cracking .
oth :
we said it again .
they stood there , dumbfounded .
as they looked at the damage , we knew we 'd be grounded .
give us a call , and we 'll come back to play .
we ll rebuild your house and then paint it with glidden .
and that 's what they did , and in less than a jiffy , the house was rebuilt , and it looked really spiffy .
that night we ate well .
it had been quite a da .
but now life was happy .
can anyone hear me ?
i 'm still in the potty !

that 's our weed .
i was directing outback buddy .

you 've discovered a cure for insomnia .
do you realize we have to show this cartoon to the front office tomorrow ?

stay up all night if you have to .
i worked al night on that caroon .
i was exhausted , and then --

on the moning of february 30th .
i started drawing these weird characters .

* just as chipper as i can be *
* got no cares and got no worries *
all :

working with the warner was a true joy .
we made a series of buddy/warner cartoons .
and , of course , bus driver budd .
it was hard , but i had to fire him .
they liked hitting him with their mallets .
but still , it was time for him to go .
that was the biggest mistake of my life .
hey , i wan na tell you ...
do n't go away , huh ?
announce :
stay tuned .
we 'll be back with more of the warner brothers and their sister dot 's 65th anniversary special .

he was a hicken .
i said , plotz , what 's the matter with you ?

a-anyway , we sined the contracts .
when i heard they signed a ourcartoon deal ,

weed was always screaming and yelling at them .

he could do a buddy cartoon , sure .
it 's not that we did n't get along ...
how can i put this ?
i hate them .
so i had to take weed off the warner cartoons .
but he went on to direct hygiene films for the navy .
i on an award for how to shampoo , and the sequel , how to rinse .
no director woud get near the warners .
he let wakko direct .
what ayutz .
mm .
potz was furious about that cartoon .
their agent was livid .
do n't you take that tone with me , laboo .
the warners are finished 
i was so sad when i heard the warners were n't gon na make any more cartoons .
i was such a fan .
with no cartoons to make , the warners were free run around the lot as they pleased .
wait .
i did n't say , simon says .
yakko and wako would always pop out of something , give you a big kiss and say , uh --

yes , indeed .
he 's an emcee , a host and a celebrity , all rolled into one .
no , no , it was definitely the 17th , because it was precisely one week after my aunt lucreia 's birthday , which is the 10th .
well , is n't that interesting ?
of course , a lot of people do n't read much nowadays .
they watch television .
i caught a progam on pbs last night .
what took so long ?
mel gibson ?
pip :
i could n't remember her name , so i looked it up .
dot warner , this is francis pumphandle , but --
both :

tuesday the 17th ...
i 'm going to hut my brother badly .
some people play golf , others like tennis , horseshoes , bridge , canasta , and other uch fancy hobbies .
wakko waner , meet pip .
charmed to meet ya .
now , another hobby enjoyed by many is knitting .
it 's red , which is not my favorite color .
now , do n't get me wrong , red is okay for ties and suspendes , but with sweaers , i prefe more neutral colors .
but when i 'm relaing , i do n't care what wear .
long ants , bemuda shorts , -shirts or formal attire .
you know , i once stayed at a comfort inn .
it goes along with tha pastime of mine , relaxing .
whic of course is the optimum condition for relaxed strolling ...
we got ta run .
bye !
i kept humming and humming and humming and humming .
retreat !
we 'd love to stay and count our brain cells as they die , oe by one .
but we ca n't .
wakko :
bye !
all :
free at last !
thank --
well , i decided right then and there to go buy a musical instrument .
so on the particular tuesday , the 17th , to which was referring , i went dow to he sixth street music emporium to buy a new tambourine .
and as i was strolling along i detected a wonderful scent in the morning air .
what could i be ?
silence ?
i love a good pimento loaf and mayo sandwich .
the moe pimentos , the better .
is it from , how are you ?
howdy is one of those strange words that really has no origin .
more formal , i think .
arrivederci .
aloha oi .
home sweet home .
now , the smell was actually less bologa and more orchid , the beautiful flower found on the island state of hawaii .
of course , i was n't in haaii , so i needed to search out the location of the nearest orchid .
so i visited every florist shop in town .
i had a cat once .
it used its claws to tear my living room couch to hreds .
had a sleep-away bed in it , with a foam-rubber mattress .
the very same afternoon of that relaxing stroll aforementione .
anyway i did n't wan na pay extra for the delivery of the couch , so i decided to carry the couch home myself .
and just as i emerged onto the sreet , by accident i bumped into a well-dressed man with an orchid in his lapel .
well , it 's been nice chatting with you .
all :
huh ?
bye .
it 's too quiet .
i miss him .
pip , wait !

the landlord 's tale .
of the midnight ride of paul revere
on the 18th of april in '75
if the british march
ready to rie and spread the alarm
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swinging wide at her moorings lay
the somerset , british man-of-war
a phantom ship with each ast and spar
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the somber rafters hat round him made
a moment on the roofs of the town
beneath , in the churchyard lay the dead
in their night enampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that he could hear like a sentinel 's tread
a moment onl he feels the spell
of the lonely belfry and the dead
where the river widens to eet the bay .
a line of black that bends and floats
oh , m gosh !
on the opposite shore walked paul revere .
then impetuous stamped the earth
the belfry tower of the old north church
a limmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
one if by land or two if by sea .
and beneath , from the pebbles in passing , a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he as left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him tranquil and boad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its edge
now soft on te sand now loud on the ledge
and the barking of the farmer 's dog
that rises after the sun goes down .
the british are coming !
he saw the gilded weathercock
gaze at him wih a spectral glare
at the bloody work they would look upon .
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the ritih are coming !
in the books you have read
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the redcoats down the lane
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
and the midnight message of paul revere .
we 're finished .
the landlord 's tale just does n't cut it .
paul revere 's ride .
perfect !

i spent an incredible amount of time in gas stations , honky tons and other off-the-beaten-path places , trying to appear cool while obsessively following the descent of a steel ball down the playing surface of a garishly lit machine .
i came in with my grandfather , standing on pop crates to play pinball .
i was about eight years old .
they 'd say , you 're in the arcade , here 's a roll of quarters .
apartment houses had them in he laundry rooms .
i guess it was the kind of age when you do n't want to do things with your arents .
i also remember my father dragging me out by my ears , saying that i spent too much money .
a crowd hung around the machine and you had to wait to play .
i started playing at the local café 
took my books to study there .
sometimes it replaced studying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highest amount it could win , which was abou 15 games .
sell tem 12 games .
if you say pinball , people are like , what ?
there are many kids toay that do n't know what a pinball machine is .
and they come in here and they see something that they have n't seen in 25 years .
something that was a major part of their youth .
kids today do n't really understand pinball .
the kids today , between the computer games and the home games , and the nintendos and the sega sysems and gameboys , they just wo n't play pinball .
i can remember when i was growing up we used to eat all our meals at home .
and we used to go out for entertainment .
and now everybody eats out .
everybody always goes to restaurants .
they do n't cook at home much .
public places o amusement have been falling by the wayside in america like crazy .
you ca n't find a pinball machine .
there 's no more arcade in mall .
the bars today have a megatouch  a ukebox ad a pool table .
pinball is finished in france .
in england it 's finished long time ago .
in italy you ca n't find one pinball .
in germany no one pinball .
even in belgium , it was a pinball paradise .
it 's finish .
they said pinball was dead .
it starts with one .
then another one .
i was outgrowing the family room .
i 'd uy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 games .
it was a very rapid decline into obsession , i think .
once you get the lure of the silver ball in you it 's like an addiction and you ca n't stop and i just kept , you know .
you remember buying every one  where you got it from .
and just as i 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon na do this ,
pinball wizard comes on the radio an i think , no , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm finally home , exhausted .
they really do n't seem to be machines .
and te way they talk to you , you find yourself talking to it .
extra ball !
you just come in and admire them .
shine a light
all my life it was pinball .
it 's my life .
like some people .
i like pinball .
pinball and girls .
but girls is fiished .
hey , look at these guy !
they 'll all come over ad have a big party every week .
steve 's still kind of the centre .
1972 , y dad bought one for my room .
from there on , it just got prety wiked .
i 've got them in every room in my house .
the pinball dungeon .
the things i like i 'm very osessive .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect someting , whether it be pinball machines , jaws memorabilia , i got ta have it all .
like it says , i wan na rock and roll all night and party every day .
it was during the depths of the depression , the late 20s , early 30s , where the coin-operated amusement game industry id of got birth .
it literally was a name because there were various pins that were hammered ino a wood surface .
he games were evolving in the 1930s .
we have to outlaw it .
we ca n't control it .
but the majority of product that was out there was for amusement only .
in the case of new york city , chicago and los angeles , being three major metropolitan areas , as well as oter areas around the united states , pinbal as banned .
it was tis one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i got ta do something like that .
before that it was nothing but chance .
gottlieb ruled in the '50s and '60s .
before the cit council in april of 1976
as well as a demonstration of pinball being a game of skill , as opposed to a game of chance .
business was booming .
profit margins were huge .
when we started solid state electronics on pinball macines we were on the leading edge of technolog .
managers from the different retaurants and the broaway crowd .
kids always want some place to go , something to do .
i think that 's what gave growh to the arade business .
naughty or whatever .
you could kid of do what you wanted .
it was more like hanging out with you friends .
wasting time .
proud to have in a french bistro in paris an american machine .
game over .
special target .
what is it that makes you stop and play one machine ?
it 's something that 's pitched towars young ales .
there 's not really a lot of female-friendly images on these .
any violent misogynist thing you want is there on pinball .
a lot of these mahines have love scenes on the .
i 'm not in the supposing business .
what do you think ?
you 'd have those centrefold images of oung , rather buxom ladies , usually blonde , staring out of the machine at you , to inspire you .
but you beieve it is ?
no question about it .
sexually frustrated people play pinball a lot .
guy has a hot ball and it 's just flyin .
you 're getting ready to become ruler of the universe .
says williams perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been in my blood since i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
should have known i was going to be a colletor and i did n't start collecting until i bought this house in 1976 .
and the first game in my collection is my favourite ame of all time .
i always copy down serial nubers and i have a binder that i 've hand-typed since i do n't do comuters yet .
to me i think it would be interesting ,
i have 300 games , where they were at one time .
ere they in joe 's bar and grill or somewhere down the sreet or at a show ?
i have a column for the date .
notes .
i worked in the bowling industry for a lot of years .
and the last bowlin alley i worked at closed down 12 years ago .
that 's why i collect flyers .
tha s why i collect what they call press photos .
they 're chronological .
there 's a lot of games are missing scorecards .
how they get lost over the ears , it 's hard to believe , but they do .
in the front closet , there 's lots of binders in there alo .
i was blessed with an ubelievable memory .
jokes .
is n't that good ?
i do n't think about what it 's worth cos i do n't want to sell it .
lot of work and when you 're done and you turn it on and it does n't blow up , you feel real good .
i 'm a people person , i like people .
i looked forward to seeing people on monday , tuesday , wednesday .
i never had any brothers or sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got married and divorced twice .
and they say it 's kind of hereditary but m real ad smoked and drank and he was an alcoholic bu i never id drink or smoke .
the rush of being able to play any game you have at any given time by pushing the button , you ca n't explain it to people .
i wake up and do it eery single day .
like an extension of my hand or something , i guess .
they 'll be in a bar , with their friend .
we just sile .
chicago is the pinball capital of the world .
we live here .
we eed to have that fast turnaround .
each person does a litte part of it and asses it along .
today , we 're the only company making pinball machines and we strive to have 10 % of wha that market once was .
it 's a modern car that has some of the look and feel and coolness of it and it 's retro .
we 're the only pinball maufacturer .
gee , if i had just one moe shot ,
i know i would have goten it this ime .
i had two balls locked and i just got that last ball locked cos i did it last time .
we build working models of things and then we play with it .
but it tells us whether what we 're doing is going to work or not work or be fun or not fun .
this is what the inal version of the game looks like when it 's finally produced .
it  just you and the track now !
it 's what people said i was going to be .
and that 's what i am .
i 'm on coud nine !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothing .
a nice sound .
being a programmer by trade
i mean , for e this is like a ittle mii world .
so when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it 's having fun inside its own little world and you 're helping it along .
little fish in the tank having fun .
from displays to alpha numerics .
pinball lost a market of players because of their technologically enhanced games .
i love strategy .
it ' about achievement , it 's about goals .
and you go , oh , i see , if i do this and this , i get one of those .
piece of cake .
and then you play i ten times in a row ad you do n't do it .
and you 're like , oh , i can do that .
for instance , in pirates a very obvious strategy is to get time lock lit .
the ball will bounce around for three seconds while the post is up .
the post comes down and it still may bounce around .
and all the while you complete these lights .
so then i get the ship multiball , which is the ship .
so you shoot the ship , you shoot the ship .
i find tat very satisfying .
it just happens to come in a box .
like a slot machine .
an operator comes along and ollects the money .
he can win a free game .
even with a little glory .
the knoker goes off in a crowded bar .
i did that , i made that go off , ok ?
when you hear them cussing soetimes , or trying to kick the game to get some action , you know you 're getting the results that you ant , you know .
and you see them putting more coins in and you sa , i made it .
put another quarter in the pinball
everyone jokes abou there 's some sickness , there 's some insanity .
but it 's kind of like a geeky thing i probably the way pinball 's perceived by the outsiders .
how do you perceie pinball 
we are from tokyo , japan .
we are pinbal lovers .
and then now it seems almost like a definition of a nerd or a weird an marginal person to be caught playing pinbal .
but maybe there 's something attractive about that .
i 'm the jim morrison of pinbal .
i think it 's great for pinball .
i think the pingeek is good .
i have n't met anybody like him before .
i wan na start ith this one ecause it is very hard to find .
i ve got it .
i love pinbal .
i wan na show this one .
96 % of m ieas pan out to money .
i 'm here to save a hobb that saved my life .
i ove music .
i was pretty muc raised in arcades , because of divorce issues and just a mes .
and say , hey , i 've arrived for the show .
and guess who my ride is ?
she drops me off .
elton john was the ultimate showan in the '70s .
i want to be a showan .
and maybe that 's no the coolest thing .
eveybody tels me to take these dugs , i should be in an intitution .
i get so much crap advice that i 'd be dead and bankrupt if i listened to it .
talk to each other and there migt not be all this fighting and shooting .
watever happened to just going into a bar like john wayne 
and then you have a drink over it later .
i 'm definitely misunderstood , you know .
bu i tended to back away and said it 's not really man aainst machine .
if i can sense the rhythm of that game  the tempo of that game , i wan na be working in tande with it .
i 'm ot fighting it .
i 'm working with i .
i guarantee you it 's chemically similar to that of athletes 
when athletes get in the zone , they feel as though they 're watching themselves run the bal down the field .
piball reminds me o like dreaming .
because like when i 'm playing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not really wih like reality .
but yet you 're watching what you 're doing and trying to concentrate .
it really is a unique feeling to become one with the machine .
it 's sort of a zen where you 're sort of meditating an that 's all you 're concentrated on is the pinball .
you forget everything else .
you ca n't lose the ball out the middle .
and you stretch it out and you embellish it and you let all the people watching know that look at this person , this peson 's just done a very difficult thing .
when you get to put your initials on it 's like , there i am .
i own this game .
i put a lot of play time in on this machine .
i try to defend it .
that 's my home territory .
i was just simply ahead of the machine .
i was accumulating so many free games .
and eventually after about three or four ours i had to go .
so in a sense there is a possibility you have the illusion that you 've won .
thee is something inevitable about losing at pinball .
because there is a feeling often when you 're playing pinball that he machine decides when you need to go home .
the object of play in pinball is a high score .
when you see a truly skilled piball player , you realise i is a game of skill , not a game of chance .
it 's pure arenaline .
now what you have are players who control the tempo of the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honesty .
there are times when i stand back and marvel at the fact that they have the ability that hey have .
i look at a game , i try to find a weakness and eploit that weakness for my own game .
this is a sport .
to stand and stay focused for that long , it 's pretty draining .
i 'm sore in my legs .
i 'm sore in my shoulders .
i 've always wanted to be champion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnyvale , california .
i started playing when i was ten years old .
yeah , it 's the whole hing .
pinball 's gotten a lot more complicated noadays .
it 's becoming more and more unclear to me how people are etting big scores .
yeah , sometimes you see it all when you 're playing realy well .
i can see a ball going towards the out lane at 12 inches away and know to do something rigt away .
i 'll nudge the machine and when the ball gets there it jut does this thing off the post and rolls in .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off with whatever 
he 's got this routine that 's only his .
i wan na do what e 's doing .
and i could be like on one hand and one heel .
you know , what i really wanted to do
was play pinball but , gee , my mom told me that i hould get a career .
because i have pinball as my own world .
a diamond in the rough that i have personally shined .
pinball 's something that 's one something for me that i had to discoer for myself 
that was already there in a world that gives us all kinds of input about stuff that we do n't even want to hear other peope 's input about .
and i knew that all that input was mistaken .
pinball is a world of special rules and unique opportunities .
i would even go as far as say i am special because of pinall .
i 've always played pinball .
you 'd choke , you would n't do wel , and you 'd have to wait a year to try again .
but pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mental component to remain calm and in control .
the est players never do something tat affects the ball unless they do it for a purpose .
and ball control does n' mean always catching the bal , it means putting the ball where you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , not just where it is right now .
m othe lives with me in new jersey .
when i tell her i 'm going , she sai , go ahead and enjoy yourself .
you 've got ta ave some fun so go enjoy ourself .
six million !
basically i 'm a synthetic organic chemist actually working on trying to find a treatment for alzheimer 's disease .
i really have n't made it to finals in a major tournament in a while .
i did it once in '99 , but i got eliminated unfortunately .
surprising villages , flooding cities an towns ...
the storm is my nickname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so pinball and i kind of grew up togethe .
and i want to beat the best .
it makes it much easier to live thinking that i 'm the best and i just have n't had my moment .
what 's really important when you play pinall at the world championship level is to get your mentality straight .
because everyone is so good that you need the mental edge .
and if you can balance those two things you 'll be unbeatable .
an i feel like an outsider .
i feel kind of like ... someone that they all think they 're better tha .
and i know for a fact that i can beat hem .
one of the gentlemen here , neil shatz , has been in the finals three or four times .
and it 's like if there is a pinball god maybe they 're cursing him because he 's second or third place , and he 's so great he deserves to win finally and so if i were to pick someone to win ,
but sure , yeah , it 's tough but i enjoy just the thrill of competition .
what can we expect this morning , guys ?
absolutely i think those guys are simply better players .
lyman sheats .
lyman sheats .
best player in the world .
i programme pinball machines .
i work with designers and basically make the game do all of what it does .
i was in college , it was around 1986 .
it was about five years after that that i started competing .
the easiest thing is to hit the flippers inividually .
i do n't know ...
ou know , when they first play .
multiball here .
going to try and get one of the balls over the other flipper o make a shot .
score some poi .
and i watched this person methodically do a passing shot over , make the shot , kick down , go up , passing shot , over .
so i bounce the ball over to the other flipper , now it 's under control .
i never thought of playing pinball that way .
you say a pinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are .
world pinball championships .
and within one week there was a hurricane named ivan that cae up the east coast and the little creek in front of here overflowed its banks .
and there was nothing to be done .
everything we had just finished was washed away .
i was just frustrated and wanted to get the place cleaned up so i could decide if i wanted o try again .
it did prove possible to clean up and rebuild .
you ca have a great game .
there are a couple of people who are high-quality players .
very focused when they play , tough to beat .
one slip and the ball goes .
and that 's it .
it certainly presented an entertainment option hat was awfully compelling .
in 1980 you could not possibly build enough video games o saturate the market .
and all of a sudden our income doubled and tripled overnigt .
it just blew me away .
and the the pinball sat there almost forlorn-looking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen .
when you play pinball you 're playing a piece of equipment that you can move around and contro .
pinball machines you ca n't do that .
i 's a pinball achine .
there 's a begining but it 's endless .
i finished it .
the real backbreaker came when home video finally hit the maketplace .
of either myself playing at home or me and my buddy playing at home .
but it really spelled the end of certainly the pinball era .
it was widely believed at the time that video games had usurped pinball and there was no longer a need for pinball whatsoever .
pinball was back on the map again .
afte a decade of decline , flippers are flapping .
bupers are thumping .
pinball is bouncing back 
i had a lot of life tied up in it .
it was really a presence and just the daily interaction of the world that i had at my doorstop that i knew i was never go na have again .
it was a life-defining moment that saddens me and still saddens me actually .
i go out now and i see some of my old friends and i play pinball and that 's nice .
that 's just never gon na happen for me again .
so if you look at the downsie of it all , pinball deserves a better fate than what it curently has .
in truth it is n't a big part of our culture ay more .
but i 'm not sure that anyone will care in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball not to survive , the world would continue but a little bit o the fabric of life would be gone .
i think that there is a fleeting sense of one 's naiveté and inocence that games brin out .
ad as we get older , for many of us , we step away from oing those things that gave us joy when we were younger .
and i think that that loss of innocence is tough .
and everybody should tr it at some point in time .
you have a universe in a box .
under glass .
it 's very strange , very strange .

i 'm filing a report on this to the headuarters , this is lot of ...
he said ...
this missio just falling apat since commander powell died
it is because he so smart
i 'm tired of being treated like an old work rat
they are uncouth and failed to appreciate my better qualities
today over lunch i tried to improve moral and build a sense of camaraderie among the man
by holding a humorous round robin discussio of the early days of the mission
hee man do not ant a happy ship
i have finally identified the alfunction
communications laser number 17 ha ee damaged

have you checked your platinum euridiu energy hield ?
armed
lieutenant doolittle , hello !
has now been activated and will switch into a test mode
if you will look near the surface door
the laser will now energize please stand clear of the path of the beam
thank ou for observing all safety precautions
well , everything sounds fine

i read the same here
i do n't know if you can hear me
but i 'm going to try to adjust the cue switch on the laser
well ... here goes ...
my eyes , my eyes !
attention , attention the laser has malfunctioned
to do so will cause immediate ...
begin imery sequence
mark at 5-4-32-1-drop 
this is lieutenant doolittle calling bomb # 20
do you understand ?
i am programmed to detonate in 14 minutes 30 seconds
bomb , this is doolittle
i read you , lieuteant doolittle but i am programmed to etonate in 14 minutes
detonation will occur at the programmed time
attention , attention i have sustained serious damage
wich will confine the explosion to an area one mile in diameter
commander powell , this is doolittle
doolittle  you must tell me one thing .
they.. they roke up they isbanded over 15 years ago
ah ... pity , pity ...
ah , so any malfunctions ...
oh , well  did you try the azimuth clutch ?
negative effet
sorry , doolittle
i 've forotten so much since i 've been in here .
the time is running out .
commander , hello ?
come in
commender powell , hello
doolitle , hello ?
sorry , i 've got a blank
hold it
i forget so many things in here so man things
hold on , just a minute
let me think ...
but you ca n't explode in the bomb bay couse it 's foolish
you 'll kill us all there 's no reason for it
i am programmed to etonate in 9 minutes
would you consider another course of action
bomb !
oh  ye
talk to the bomb
but i have been talking to it , si ad pinback is talking to it right no .
doolittle ?
six minutes o detonation !
dooittle , what the hell are you doing ?
are you with me ?
how do you know you exist ?
what the hell is he doin ' ?
it is intuitively obvious
inuition is no proof
this is fun .
now listen , here is the big question
how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct ?
the gu !
gun !
gun !
no , boiler , you out of your mind
you 'll hit the bomb doolittle is talking to the bomb
you are bad shot , he 'll ave us you can shoo at
what i 'm getting at is this
ad this sensory data is merely a stream of electrical impulses
in other words , all hat i really know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more tie to discuss this matter
no , now give me the gun
to explode , of course .
that is corret .
of coure not .
well then
so if you detonate in ...
nine seconds ...
you could be doing so on the basis of false data .
you have no proof that it was correct data .
attention , attention the bomb has returned to the bomb bay
the destrution sequence is aborted
pinback ?
hello ?
hello , anybody !
i 'm coming in now i 'm down by the emergency air lock
you are now leaving the emergency air lock
thank you for observing all safety pecautions
hello , inback ?
what 's up doolittle ?
turn on his elmet radio o i can contact him
what 's wrong , i did n't hear ...
talby , can you read me ?
help , doolittle , help me !
alright , bomb
therefore , i shall ignore you .
false data can act only as a distraction
therefore i shall refuse to perceive you .
hey , bomb
doolittle !
calm down , i 'm coming .
and in addition to the darkness there was also me
and i saw that i was alone .
hey , bomb ?
doolittle , where are you ?
ere i am
i 'm pinning
we 're falling in opposite directions away from each other
what happened , doolittle ?
the ship blew up ?
what ?
funny , i thought i have the damn thing convinced
boiler ?
maybe not maybe there is a way
it looks like the skipper he made it .
talby , looks like i 'm headed for the planet going right towar it .
what a beautiul way to die ...
guess you 're right .
doolittle , i 'm heading right toward something it 's behind me , in the distance
something that glows .
i 'm going ino them i 'm going to hit them
doolittle
yeah ?
you were my favorite
to circle the universe.
forever
i 'm with them now ...
be back this way again some day
i think i 've figured out a way !
so , what 's the story ?
the story is about ... a girl of about 14 or 15 ,
who 's out riding her bike .
and i 'm in a rolls ...
i 'm not prince charming , that would be pushing it ...
i take her to a rather unusual hotel .
then she wans to see england again , she 's english , and the plane crashes .
you 'll have to explain that a bit .
in ne guinea , there 's an indigenous people , the papuans , who practice thi airplane worship , the cago cult .
they see these tings lying over their heads without eve seeing them land , and they want to benefit from them .
so they want the planes to crash to get their hands on the freight .
i draw a parallel with melody ' death , who was killed in a plane cash .
and i hope hat one of these cargo planes will fall with melody in it .
bring her back .
the trasposition of eternal love .
i 'm not a cynic , as others maintain .
and my candour .
they confused candour with cynicism .
in fact , wha you call ... ugliness is something you made into a tyle through your desire for perpetual andour .
i wrote somewhere that when i 'm called ugly , i laugh quietly so you do n't awake .
i 've had pretty women , i have the most beautiful now , so my ugiess ... those who are bothered by it ...
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah !
hey there , baby .
yeah , whateve .
not now , kid .
i hope you do n't take this the wrong way or anything , but there 's just too big of a generation gap between the two of us .
but all i want to know is what time it is .
how about a kiss there , missy ?
ooh !
oh !
baby !
uhh !
what are you looking at ?
say , baby , how 's about you and l --

narrator :
long before borders were drawn before the reign of genhis khan nomadic tribes have roamed the remote altai moutains of asia .
and for countless generations , this precious skill has ypically been handed down from father to son .
but this relationship between man and bird is finite .
custom dictates that after seven years of loyal ervice an eagle must be returned to the wild to continue the circle of life .
my dear eagle .
we have been together for a long time .
and you have only brought good things to me .
aisholpan :
my name is aisholpan .
i was born in the altai mountains .
there it is .
nurgaiv :
there it is .
i love my dad .
my dad and my grandpa are eagle hunters .
nurgaiv :
it is not a coice .
it 's a calling that has to be in your blood .
the horses the clothing , the equipment .
aisholpan 
please hold it gently .
but i do n't resent that .
great .
nurgaiv :
she holds the eagle with strength .
maybe it 's in her blood as well .
aisholpan :
because all the men in my family have een eagle unters my dream is to become he first eagle huntress in mongolia .
narrator :
girls do not eagle-hunt .
they get cold .
but i think girls and boys are equal .
girls can do anything bos can if they try .
my fathe taught me ...
... and i do n't want to let her dow .
nurgaiv :
yeah .
nurgaiv :
raise your arm !
that 's good !
launch it this way .
pa attention .
are you tired ?
we go to school by the syr river because there is no school in our area .
let 's play again !
i 've been living here sice the 2nd grade .
aisholpan :
we are at school for only 5 days .
i take cae of them .
all :
i feel good .
aisholpan :
but right now , all i can think about is becoming an eage huntress .
is dinner ready ?
place the spoons .
may god bless you .
nurgaiv :
quick , feed this tough child .
until now aisholpan has been using her father 's bird to learn te basics .
since she is serious i figure , et her bring up her own eagle and train it .
today , there 's te rare opportunity to seize a 3-monthold eaglet from a nearby mountain .
may we be so lucky !
do you see , my child ?
we 're going to have to climb up that side ad then descend from the top .
do not be afraid , oay ?
it 's a trong knot !
hold on tightly .
in the name of god .
give me some more rope , dad .
back , back .
do n't be scared .
aisholpan :
hold tight i said .
aisholan :
yeah , yeah .
go slowly .
no more slip-ups !
yes .
look 
there are two eagles nesting side by side .
nurgaiv :
yep !
ou got it ?
brig it over this way .
this way .
let it go a little bit more .
that 's it .
pull it .
aisholpan :
here you go .
nurgaiv :
hurry !
do n't pull .
give me some slack on thi other rope .
let it out moe !
aisholpan :
should i reel it in now ?
we did it !
nurgaiv :
this eaglet is a sign of good luck !
i 'm exhausted !
nurgaiv :
you proved yourself today .
thanks .
woman :
wind speed ill be rom 3 to 8 meters per second .
air temperature will be 8 to 13 degrees celsius .
let me compete in the festival this year !
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
pease ?
do n't worry 
we would freak out like crazy !
aisholpan :
yes .
aisholpan :
yes .
do you call , hey , eagle , come back here , please ?
huukaa !
huukaa !
is it afraid of other people ?
of course !
ow !
aisholpan is going to be an eagle hunter .
grandpa :
really ?
this is an important task .
both are young .
can you give your blessing to aisholpan ?
aisholpan !
may god help you pursue the huter 's path .
may you grow old like me with yelow teeth .
i entrust that eagle to you .
this will be a beast catching bird .
let it get old with you .
eagle hunters will train their daughters to ride horses then hold a bird .
it is a shame to do so for the bird .
they do not know how to properly approach the eagle .
the eagle is very picky about peope .
it demands respect and courage .
anyhow , she will have to get married at one point or another .
nurgaiv :
it 's all we ve ever known .
woman :
good morning , dear radio listeners .
nurgaiv :
narrator :
as their relationship deepens , the eagle ears to listen for her call 
as they start to work as a team , the response times improve .
woman :
as the festival draws near , the excitement builds across the region .
let 's go .
probably the most important part of the festival .
with calling the judges look at horse riding style eagle 's landing and eage flying sye .
this process is timed and every seond counts .
okay .
nurgaiv :
do n't hurry .
eat slowly .
you might not be able to fly if you eat too much .
if you do not mind .
mostly older men .
almagul :
i 'm worried for her .
this i her first festival .
be the head of this home while i am away , okay ?
all i wish for is her safety and welbeing .
is this okay ?
not too tight ?
nurgaiv :
almagul :
we should have cut it shorter .
all the best , stay safe !
narrator :
let 's let the horses drink .
nah .
around 70 eagle hunters from all over the reion are currently making their way o the festival ground .
oh .
there it is .
narrator :
for years , proud men have brought their eagles here to preserve tradition and battle for the title of champion eagle hunter .
no girl has ever competed i the history of this festival .
and aisholpan is arriving unannounced .
male emcee :
peace be with you , dear festival participants .
man :
male emcee :
man 4 :

nurgaiv :

nurgaiv :

announcer :
an animal skin target attracts the eagles and we measure their speed .
nurgaiv :
nurgaiv :
it can get scared and run into the crowd of people .
nurgaiv :
nurgaiv :
really nice !
in the name of god .
man 2 :
not everyone who has an eagle at home is a real eagle hunter .
more to come .
speed and skill are the most important part of this event .
male emcee :
who 's ext ?
we worry that our birds may not land in our hands when we call hem in front of a crowd .
why do 't you run and get it !
who 's next ?
do n't worry .
announcer :
really nice !
where 's my dad ?
ye , he 's already up there .
man 2 :
whose bird is that ?
aisholpan 's .
a lady .
women are suppose to stay indoors and quarrel for gifts after parties while men are meant for the outdoors , and we quarrel for the catch .
i was worried of course .
announcer :
nurgaiv :
eveone saw it , both the audience and the judges .
she managed to catch he bird in her hand in only five seconds .
that requires unique talent .
my hands are trembling .
funny feeling !
dad !
come here , my daughter .
announcer :
eagle huntes , please come forward .
today 's event was specia because a little girl participated in this celebration .
please make some space .
therefore , let me start with he third place .
second place , orazkhan .
dear people , please listen .
man 2 :
i was so hapy .
there will be snow , stoms , etc .
it is tough .
she wo n't endure .
i she can go eagle hunting in winter then she is a true eagle hunter .
nurgaiv :
aisholpa :
but first , they stop off or guidance at the home of a master eagle hunter in a remoe village close to the mongolian border with china .
but the kid is strong .
aisholpan :
he 's like my uncle .
there are a lot of lessons to be learnt here 
but the land is slippery the winter egan harshly .
but the kid has to be alert .
we will always worry for our children .
nurgaiv :
are we ready now ?
dalaikhan :
what a baby ees in the nest , it then repeats when it grows up .
turn here .
narrator :
she will now attempt the final step on he path to full eagle hunter status .
nurgaiv :
look at this .
the whole steppe is blanketed in snow !
nurgaiv :
there 's little comfort in these bitterly cold conditions .
it 's not unheard of for horses to slip an fall off the side of a cliff .
nurgaiv :
the stones the clifs , the snow .
it 's ime to find some fox tracks .
they are determined to repeat the process until she proves herelf a aster eagle huntress .
come closer .
it 's slippery here .
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
there it is !
time to ove it !
here it is !
you head that way !
nurgaiv :
the eagle hunter finds the highes place with the best view .
eagles make mistakes the first time they hunt .
aiholpan :
were you afraid , my dear ?
nurgaiv :
you shoot up that mountai over thee .
he hunter and chaser work as a team .
aisholpan :
nurgaiv :
it can easily jump from one to another .
the fox is a very sly animal .
not in a hurry to give up its life .
turn it around !
he wo n't budge !
keep going .
follow in my footsteps .
okay , my child !
yes .
let go .
you did very well for your first time .
you 're very brave .
you get to carry home your first catch and mom can mae it into a warm fur coat or you .
aisholpan :
nurgaiv :
she 'll be thrilled .

climbing over rocky mountain
passing where the willows quiver
by the ever rolling river
swollen with the summer ain , the summer rain
climb the hardy little lassies

make the most of fleeting leisure
hail it as a true ally
as they fly
make the most of fleeting leisure
though it perish by-and-by
let us gaily tread the measure
except for the memaids , it 's the very place for mermaids .
and who ca n't be said strictly to set foot anywhere .
i 'm going to take off my stocking .
stop , ladies , pray
a man !
but under these peculiar circumstances
i feel it is my bounden duty to inform you
a pirate !
horror !
oh , blushing buds of ever-blooming beauty
how pitiful his tale
how pitiful his tale
oh , is there not one maiden breas

yes , yes , i am a major-genera
he is !
hurrah for the major-geeral
to be a major-general
i am the very model o a modern major-general
i 'm very well acquainted , too , with matters mathematical
i uderstand equations , both the simple and quadratical
i 'm ver good at integral and differential calculus
in short , in maters vegetable , animal , and mineral
in fact , when i know what is meant
by mamelon and ravelin
when such affairs as sorties and surprises i 'm more wary at
and when i know precisely what is meant by commissariat
when i have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
when i know more of tactics than a novice in a nunney
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy
strategy ?
oh , my word .
wait a minute .
cup of tea .
has only been brought down to the beginnin of he century
but stil , in matters egetabe , animal , and mineral
encore !
can you do it one more time ?
and can you do it really fast ?
in fact , when i know what is meant by mamelo and ravelin
when i have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy
oh , you must n't do that !
ooh !
wha are you ?
i gathe that .
anything else ?
no , nothing else .
we obect to maor-generals as fathers-in-law .

i ask you have you eer known what it is to be an orphan ?
often !
yes , orphan .
i say , often .
often , often , often .
i tell you , hang on a minute .

i only repeated it once .
ooh !
now , when you say orphan ,
frequently .
seize that man !
an orphan boy ?
thee children hom you see
poor fellow
see , at our feet they kneel
our hearts we can not steel
orphan boy
indulged in an innocent fiction
which is not in the same cateory as telling a regular terrible story
which will tend to diminish his glory
it is easy , in elegant diction
to call it an innocent iction
but it comes in the same category
it 's easy , in elegant diction
although our dark career
we raher think that we 're
we 're always sorry to begi it
for what , we ask
is life
without a touch
hail , poetry
thou heaven-born maid
thou gildest even
all hail

but all in vain the quips we heard
oh .
until to somebody occurred
a startling paradox
a most ingenious aradox
the paradox
to which , however , i 've no desire to be disloyal
who ?
i o n't know who
very likely the astronomer royal
has decided that
if it were owing to the agency of an ill-natured fairy
you 'll easily discover
that though you 've lived 21 years
yet , if we go by birthdays
you 're only five and a little bit ove
let 's see !
five and a quarter , oh , that 's rich !
at common sense she gaily mocks
years 21 i 've been alive
yet , reckoning by my natal day
a paradox , a paradox
a curious paradox
a most ingenious paradox !
most absurdly whimsical .
five-and-a-quarter , eh ?
you would n't think it to look at me .
i 'm afraid you do n't appreciate the delicacy of your position .
you were apprentied to us .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
oh .
and going by birthdays , you are as yet only five-and-a-quarter .
and at any price
i will do my duty .
you 're one of us once more .
that 's the ship .
i will tell her i am bound by duty and my moral senses
so it really does n't matter , matter , matter , matter , matter !
i should show you in a moment how to grapple with the question
full of excellent suggestions when i feel a little beter
what we sing does n't matter what we sing does n't matter
no , it really does n't matter
mater , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
if i had been so lucky as to have a teady mother
and i might have lived and died a very decent indiwiddle
if it is , it does n't matter if it is , it does n't matter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
oh , horror !
what ' the matter ?
oh  yes , he did .
it breaks my heart to betray the honored father of the girl i adore .
break it .
and yet , as your apprentice , i have no alternative .
... that general stanley ...
well , he is no ...
you mean , orphan , a person that has lost his parents or often , frequently ?
a person that has lot his parents .
what ?
what ?
oh .
he never was one !
am i to understand that in order to save
we will go and collet our band and attack tremorden castle this very night .
not a word !
i burn , this base deception to repay
ere i expire
it strikes me to the core !
and , in return , tonight the traitor dies
yes , yes !
tonigt he dies
yes , or early tomorrow
they will welter in sorrow
to abuse it sall perish
aay , away !
away !
tonight the traitor dies !

no , i am brave
come one and all , undaunted en in blue
when the danger 's near
we manage to appear
as insensible to fear
young frederic was to have led you to death and glory
e will not so lead you
for he has allied himself once more
with his old associates
you speak falsely
he has acted nobly
his heroic sacrifice to his sense of duty
he has done his duty , i will do mine
we must do our best to capture these pirates alone .
it is most distressing to us to be the agents
hereby our erring fellow-creatures
are deprived of that liberty
when a felon 's not engage in his employment
or mauring his felonious little plans
is jus as great as any honest man 's
when constabulary duty 's to be done
to be done
ah , take one consideration with another
a policeman 's lot is not a happy one
to be done
a policeman 's lot is not a happ one
a rollicking band of pirates we
are trying their hand at a burglary

paris ?
omaha ?
no , sir .
i did n't know he could even spell amortization.
gloria ?
jeaie ?
mr. ryder , i think there 's soething you ought to know .

i did n't find out till later ..
it was n't quebec .
palm beach 
mirador ?
well , that 's here my uncle always stays .
with him being youruncle , his reputation and all ,
has she contacted you yet ?
sit down , wo n't you .
you see , i was on uty early saturday morning .
when i got halfway down the corridor ,
m ?
wearing a turkish towel ?
no ?
i tried .
but she beat me to the elevator and got away .
when i got back , your uncle 's room , the place was all a shambles .
dead .
no , no , sir .
only the manager .
he thought it would be betterfor everybody if we just kept this quiet .
did you ever see this gir before ?
no , sir .
it 's an earring i found on the floor nearthe bed .
good .
i have a hunch this girl 's gon na show up , and i want you to identify her .
oh , it 'd be a pleasure .
research .
these are very interesting figures , tony .
we 'd like to talk to you ...
he was a more remarkable man than you think .
sam , you were the colonel 's odest friend .
never .
the minute we paid her off .
it ought to .
that young woman has us over a barrel .
i can see the headlines :
founder offamily magazine dies in love nest wit a naked nymph.
and a smile on his face .
what are we goin to do ?
where ?
where 's a better place to show the world how much she 's gon na miss the colonel ?
so we ill know thursday .
the bank committee meets wednesday .
we 'll have the funeral tuesday .
that'stomorrow .
what about all the prepaations ?
what made you ask that ?
just my feminine sense of greed 
what 's that ?
i have n't met him yet .
guess who this is .
you ought to see a doctor .
but , honey , i am a doctor 
how was florida ?
oh , it was all right .
but i 'm glad i 'm back .
oh , yourfolks are in town ?
oh , well , that makes me feel better .
how about the four of us getting together , say , wednesda night ?
oh , that 's fine .
fine .
goodbye , dear .
bye .
i do n't know why you even went to florida .
deserve him .
you 're on the bargaining committee .
oh , no , harry .
union-wise , you 're in the big time .
now , do n't be upset if i do some table-ounding .
but i am worried .
the union commitee is here .
joe kowaski .
absolutely ridiculous .
seems pretty reasonable .
it seems reasonable on the surface .
but can management live with it ?
that 's not an answer , it 's an ultimatum .
i said that .
what do you think , miss ?
research ?
where is it ?
i was just saying the other day in health and welfare , we really should ...
yes , two b 's .
miss robbins , we 've got a very important agenda ere .
when it comesto fringe beneits , i 'd say the union 's getting all the benefits and management 's left holding the fringe .
well put .
look , if you do n't wan na negotiate , we 're walkig out .
oh , just a minute .
i have a better idea .
now  a subcommittee oftwo is an excellent suggestion , but any feelin-out process should logically take place between members ofthis group who have n't displayed antagonism towards one another .
now , you do n't feel antagonistic towards me , do you , miss robbins ?
good .
nor i towards you .
so i seems logical that you and i should meet .
no use asting valuable working hours .
meeing adjourned .
oh , i ...
do n't take them .
it must be that athing sui i bought in palm beach .
they were having a sale at this little place ...
this is n't my coat !
ryder building , new york , new york.
i guess it is my coat , is n't it .
marge .
just give me the chance .
well , it 's too important a step to just rush into like that .
health ad welfare found me a nice motel nearthe beach .
it was 7 dollars a day , including a coninental breakfast .
but i was n't interested in that kind oftraveler 's aid .
that eliminated just about everything that 's any fun .
there i was , trespassing in the arden of an exclusive hotel , pretending o be one ofthe elite .
wit all the romance around me , there i was with my partner , a very romantic sort of fellow .
ful of air .
hep !
he seemed to be drowning .
and i was wearing my flowered chiffon that cost me two whole months without dessert .
help !
i realized at once that oor mr. hackett had been drinking .
that was his name , kirby ackett , ofhackett industries .
so i decided to help him up to his room .
as long as he was sound asleep , i decided to get dried off .
that was my third mistake .
m. ackett had been playing possum .
please , i 'm not dressed !
mr. hackett !
i went through some curtains .
tere was a man in bed .
frank sinara .
oh , marge .
our colonel ryder ?
yes .
oh , i 'm perfectly willing to listen to the other half 
mr. hackett !
bright and early the next morning ,
i got a phone cal .
it was mr. hackett 
because i do n't deserve it .
oh , marge .
i refuse to be obligated to a man who practically drowns himself just to get me up to his room .
okay , okay , now , wat about colonel ryder ?
now , you get to the penion plan before you finish yourfruit salad .
important .
yes , harry 
seniority rights , roat duck .
yes , harry .
yes .
stand pat .
thank you .
penny forenny .
i may have to get ahold of you in a hurry some niht .
463 east 76th 
if your uncle ad n't been colonel ryder , what do you think you 'd be doing now ?
playing golf , i guess .
i sarted just one step below .
i had the exerience , but i had to keep proving to the ryders .
if you 're a relative , you 'e supposed to be an idiot .
seniority rights ...
excuse me .
senioit rights .
an old man is like an ol car .
your spak plugs were stuck .
you do n't just throw an old man on the scrapheap forthat .
and then you give him another chance .
seniority rigts , fringe benefits and pension plan .
what do you say we take the rest ofthe afternoon off .
why did you pick on me to do the negotiating ?
but you see , i 'm in research , mr. ryder , and i 've been doing quite a bit of research on you .
and i 'm afraid i 'm not yourtype at all .
you 're a good researcher , but do n't believe everything you read .
well , i would like to do some shopping .
okay .
just what i had in mind .
why do n't you use my car .
and i 'll drop off at the club , take a cold shower .
yes , thank you .
just one moment .
but when i opeed the box , i discovered it was n't the bathing suit i bought o sale in palm beach .
yes .
yes .
there seems to be a problem with this lady 's coat .
ishere something wrong with the coat ?
oh , no , not at all .
oh , yes .
oh , but there is a mistake .
i see .
it 's already paid for .
i have n't done aything to earn it .
oh , i mean , al i did wastake him up to his room an put him to ...
well , i did .
will you tell mr. hacket i returned the coat ?
i do n't care ifhe went to devil 's island in a canoe .
how much is he coat ?
eleen thousand dollars .
are you sure you woud n't like to think this over ?
i m in no hurry if you 're not .
there 's another 5 .
overtime .
oh , no , not miss robbins 
thank you .
i wish somebody woul test my princiles .
as long as you keep out of chinese restaurants .
pardon me .
oh , wonderful .
oh , marge , that was just his business sense .
are we talking about the same colonel ryder ?
but talk about raw emotion !
i 've been looking for you .
forwhat ?
union 's got three seats .
you 're one ofthem .
oh , harry , i could n't possibly .
it 's not just tear .
i mean , i cry .
at funerals ?
she better stay away from my uneral .
the great man that we have gathered to honortoday volunteered once more for military duty .
and in six months ofhard , grinding toil , he brought chaos ...
and that christmas , i may now reveal , not a single dough boy in the front lines no one had to do witout a slice ofmom 's fruit cake .
once i even cried at an auto show .
you go on , harry .
that 's our girl .
you recognize he ?
even with he clothes on .
she 's our blackmailer .
they never are .
there 's no use arguing .
i 'm going straight upstairs and apologize to mr. ryder .
cased blackmailer 's apartment .
you mean you were spying on her ?
washed hair .
washed dishes .
better get down to work .
i still ca n't believe she did it .
oh , no .
gentlemen , i 'd say miss robbins had us over a barel .
are we sure this isthe girl we 're looking fo ?
of course we are .
lasker identified her , did n't he ?
mr. ryder ..
and i say that a person is innocent unti proven guilty .
how do we know she 's guilty ?
those earrings .
could be a coincidence .
ten thousand !
i she really waste blackmailer , where would she be now ?
mr. ryder .
in my office , waiting to see me .
she said it was importat .
to see me ...
careful , tony .
sticky , tricky .
good morning , mr ...
thank you .
sit down .
thank you .
i know what you must think of me , mr. ryer .
but honestly , i could n't help what happened .
no , it was n't anybody 's fault .
oh , believe me , i did n't wan na go .
and you were dazzled , huh ?
dazzled ?
well , that is a betterword , i guess .
oh , i 'm sure you could think of a betterword .
especially when i think about all those wonderful poems colonel ryderwrote .
po ... ?
oh , they were so sensitive and passionate .
love is a wild volcano seething with dark desire
yes .
you know , your uncle was a very warm and tender man , mr. ryder .
oh , well , you must n't worry about that .
we both know why you came up here , right ?
now that we know where we both stand ...
yes .
no , we ll talk .
what 'll we talk about , fringe benefits ?
we 'll talk about loyalty .
why , no .
shall we say  50 a week more ?
i think you 're a little unstrung by the funeral .
if you ...
two hundred dollars a week .
take it or leave it .
o , i 'll take it , i 'll take it !
good , good .
now , remember , do n't talk about thisto anyone .
well , why do n't you look it up yourself .
how do you like that ?
some wise guy tryig to tell me we had a president amed andrew johnson .
i realize tat you 're new in research , mr. lasker , but ifthere are any more hone calls , especially about presidents i 'll be glad to take them .
oh , by the way do you and mrs. lasker bowl ?
i do .

something tragic has befallen a member of our community .
exhibit a .

oh , dear .
i do say , christopher roin , the inners of such contest are traditionally awarded some form of remuneation .
oh , gracious , no .
oh , christopher robin , i was hoping for something a bit ... sweeter ?
why , pooh , tha 's a grand idea .
a pot of honey .
pooh realized that a pine cone would not win him the honey .

oh , bother 
my tummy is feeling a little 11 oclock-ish .
do you still tell the time , clock friend ?
i ca n't tell by the expression on your face .
in fact , he as so distracted by his rumbly tummy , that he did n't notice tat he was walking onto the next paragraph .
is there honey in this paragraph ?
well , then i do n't find it very useful .
eeyore , you tail !
all good things come to an ed .

this reward goes to a good friend and a loyal companion .
so it is with great , great honour and a humble heart  that i bestow this pot of honey upon our dear friend b'loon .
wonderfu iea , rabbit .
thank you , b'loon 
goodbye .
hooray !
oh , bother .
yep .

easytobeaman

hello ?
~subtitle by joshua romel ladrera~
this is the story of the day my life ended .
i 'm kidding !
everyone dying to catch a glimpse of me.
i meant us .
well ..
we are gathered here today to elebrate the joining of rapunzel and eugene in marriage .
in everlatig peace .
may i have the rings ?
had their loops in the love and friendship .
frying pan .
release the ducks .
that 's the ducks , release the lanterns .
happy birthday !
so , who want a piece of cake ?
is there a reason you 're calling first thing in the morning ?
he 's dead .
who ?
cut the crap .
takayama ryuji , kill himself ?
or it might be something else .
it looks like they 're gon na have to do a little moe investigating .
sudden death ...
it 's takayama ryuji .
you plug he numbers into this chart and then use the resulting abbreviation .
ripper .
takayama ?
ripper ...
there 's arterial blockage .
direct cause of death is heart attack brought on by blockage of the left pulmonary artery .
andou !
there was something strange in his stomach .
e would appear to have been somethig of a ...
trange man , would n't you agree ?
his ex-wife , asakawa reiko .
that boy in the picture is their son .
but after tha she returned home and retieved her son .
and one of he ambulance crew saw her with a videotape taken fro mr. takayama 's aprtment .
but the first person to find his body was mr. takayama 's girlfriend .
she 's a gloomy one , though .
our questioning is n't going anywhere ...
this is dr. andou , who was in charge of the autopsy .
o the doctor , this time .
where , i wonder ?
tell us what you can recall .
i do n't know anything .
please answer the question .
i do n't know anything .
i realy do n't .
tell us wat you know .
you knew that takayama ryuji was meetig with his ex-wife , did n't you ?
just a ...
before he died ...
dr. takayama was investigating something with reiko .
investigating what ?
a videotape .
whoever watches it dies .
whoever watches it dies ?
yes .
that 's simply not ossible .
mr. andou ?
yeah .
it was amazing .
he knew , did n't he ?
that you and i would meet like this .
why ?
this is stupid .
professor ?
professor !
hey !
a tumor ?
but ... this is n't malignant .
i could n't find anything like it .
there 's no way .
the smallpox virus wa eradicated ages ago .
what aout takayama 's girlfriend ?
she told me something a lot crazier than a virus .
you best tell me .
a videotape ?
yeah .
it 's he police .
they were in an automobile accident .
luckily , the driver came away with only minor injuries .
we were just now able to remove he bodies .
though they 'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we contacted them ..
but there 's something a little strange .
what are you doing !
sorry .
i was asakawa 's senior co-worker .
vcr ?
he went to slee already .
i 'm just gon na check on him .
i 'm sorry .
i woke you up .
what is it ?
the child died , too ?
yeah , but he did n't die because o the accident .
he was already dead .
their son saw the video too , did 't he ?
this has nothing to do with a video .
we know what exactly what caused his death .
what did he say ?
leaving his dna in this world ?
mr. andou .
he ... saw something .
that mouse is glowing !
so it 's already progressed this far ...
that 's amazing .
o you rememer me ?
yes .
i 'm yoshino from nnb broadcasting .
is there something i can help you with ?
what 's that ?
record ?
four people died of a heart attack at exactly the same time .
i now know that one week earlier , the four of them had watched a ideotape at a lodge in izu .
she watched it , and was sure that she too would die one week later .
thus , aided by takayama ryuji , she began her investigations , trying to uncover everything she could about the videotae .
sadako 's mother , yamamura shizuko , was reporedly clairvoyant , which had the press all up in arms .
sadako was killed by her father .
sadako had the power to lay a curse on someone , and to kill them with it .
let me tell you about asakawa .
he killed himself .
he 'd written will .
it said :
do n't worry .
this is yamamura sadako .
please , feel free to watch it if you like .
do n't you think ?
present ...
saako !
sadako !
forgive me sadako 
you were wee never meant to be born into this world .
sadako !
you ca n't report this o the pulic at all .
that video ... it 's he embodiment of sadako 's hatred .
do you realize what you 're saying ?
i ave it to you already .
video ...
now wait just a minute !
give me that tape !
we are throug talking .
will you please let go of me ?
lke you you 're about to die or something .
yeah ...
you want e to inject you with some of that proein from the glowig jellyfish ?
the aministrative autopsy was carried out in yokohama .
what 's more , the cause of the attacks was a tumor in their bloodstream .
oh ...
but i do n't get it .
i it is a virus , why did n't asakawa reiko also die from a heart attack ?
because the cause of death is n't a virus .
a curse .
gim me a break .
to wipe that video off the face of this world .
he thouht that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan .
he 's trying to get me destroy that video in exchage for granting my wish .
and what is your wish mr. andou ?
about what ?
that  not what dr. takayama wanted .
what else could it be ?
dr. andou .
you have a phone call , fro a reporter named mr. yoshino .
the well that sadako fell into ... by chance , is there a chunk missing out of one side ?
you atched the video ?
to hell with this , all of it .
i 'm giving you the video .
i have n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appears in my dreas .
i just want to hurry u and forget all about this .
mr. yoshino ?
mr. andou ?
do n't look .
let 's go .
it 's over now .
i 've put an end to yamamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm this video 's last victim .
you 've thought about dying many times over .
nor is regretting that you watched the video .
that i let my son die ?
just a little .
he was the only person that i could be with .
so i guess i ca n't lie to you .
it 's just like you said .
i 'm scared of dying .
why did i watch that video ?
is n't it painful ?
knowing how i feel ?
there were times when i thought it was just an excuse .
but he mean it .
nobody knows what 's going to happen to them .
not me .
never seen anythin like it , have you ?
i think he 'll turn up symptoms of the virus as well .
his cause of death was different ...
well , it 's interesting !
the data is then restructured inside the body , creating a virus .
hat could be it !
think a moment .
she saw the video too , id n't she ?
you 're not making a whole lot of sense .
listen to me .
when i watched the video , sadako 's memories entered y body .
i saw a hospital in the woods .
now you tak a hospital in izu from around tat timeframe , what does that make you think of ?
tuberculosis ?
mai !
where the hell did she go ?
take a look .
it 's mutated .
what ?
they 're saying that the family wants to talk to you about how to proceed with the deat certificate .
probably .
i 'll catch up with you later .
mr. maekawa !
i have never had a case like this before .
it ca n't be .
they appear to have found evidence indicating that she gave birth .
yes .
the building 's air vent ... it looked just like a well .
yamamura sadako 's well ...
does it by chance have a chunk missing out of one side ?
but he still got infected with the virus .
wh do you think that i ?
it 's asakawa reiko 's notebook .
the color of the well , the way it looks .
it 's like i m actualy there .
but that does n't mean tat everyone dies .
there 's a way to save youself .
a way to save yourself ?
just reading it is enough to infect the reader with the virus .
she became yamamura sadako 's helper .
what did you do ?
i ...
you 're the only survivor .
liar !
give me back that notebook .
into mai 's womb .
why did you have to kill mai ?
mai is n't dead .
all of mai 's memories are inside of me .
you are sadako .
no mai .
i wanted to help you .
what the hell do you now 
you killed mai !
mai .
forgive me  mai .
i forgive you mr. andou .
know what ?
stop it , please !
sadako !
meeting him wa what allowed e to come back .
that 's why i was able to be reborn .
that 's impossible .
so this time , i want to help him .
we can do it if i use my womb ...
no .
there 's no way .
do this for me , and i can grant your wish too .
takayama !
then , return i to my womb .
the memories prior to death remain in the dna itself .
if you use one of m fertilized eggs , it should mature to the same age as when the person died within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones o quicken the rate of cellular division .
once this is put back into takano mai 's womb , we 're all finished .
you look terrible .
we traitors , are n't we ?
bu who have we betrayed ?
what 'd you think of my present ?
he is my brother , after all .
and te people who rea it ...
the virus wil develop inside their bodies .
what will the world become because of the virus 
there will be moe and more people like sadako .
his virus will cause a change in humanity itself .
and now it 's time for that evolution to proceed to the next level .
the world will change .
we have been dragged inside that vortex of change .
stay away from takanori .
just keep away .
is n't that riht ?
let go of me .
goodbye .
takayama , do n't wat your own child back ?
i could n't do such a terrible thing .
i could n't bring a child back into this world .
andou ... it wil be a long , long time before there is peace again in this world .

i might just do that .
go on , then .
i dare you .
bother !
leave him alone !
i 'm just an apprentice witch , you know .
look out , charlie !
you flaming brute !
i do n't see why we ca n't al be friends .
of course i 'm not .
if only i could trust you .
most secret .
what do you say , charlie ?
we can keep a secret .
i do n't follow .
if we broke the pact , we 'd hae to give back the valuable object .
i wonder what i could give you .
would you settle for one of my spells ?
i like you better as a rabbit , charlie .
well , i never had a rabbit .
no one has ever seen it before .
when i signed for my witchcraft course , there was a free bonus ... a certain marvelous traveling spel , if you paid promptly in advance .
poisoned dragon 's liver ?
poisoned dragon liver .
well , it comes prepared .
ah , here we are .
the traveling spell .
all right , now , let 's see .
what about you , paul ?
always carry a few things around with me .
horseshoe nail .
what 's that ?
yes , i think that will be all right .
glowworm fire , firefly light !
there .
is n't that pretty ?
how does it work ?
well , you take this knob and put it bak on the bed upstairs , then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left .
then in a firm , clear voice , tell it where you want to go , and the bed will take you there .
go on !
me ?
yes .
mine , were n't it ?
that 's the way the spell works .
nice mess he 'll make of things .
but mind you do n't ty anything with the edknob until i get back .
yes ?
thak you very much .
no .
me ?
paul , i need the bedknob back .
i must get to lonon immediately .
i 'll handle this .
well , yes , in a way , but-
well , a few odd shilling might fix matters up , as you might say .
go ahead .
i was execting a very important spell in the mail ... from my teacher , professor emelius bowne , and it has n't come .
with his help , we may be able to bring this war to a successful end .
i may be windy .
twice .
good .
i 'm not going .
but why , charlie ?
lovely .
jus so 's you leave me out of it .
i do n't fancy making a fool of myself .
what 's come over you lately  carlie ?
that 's what my father used to call the age of not believing .
you 're at the age of not believing
that 's charlie to a t .
you 're at the age o not believing
what 's that supposed to be , poetry ?
you must face the age of not believing
lovely sentiment , i 'm sure .
now , when i ay go , ta the knob three time and turn it a quarter turn to the left .
that 's it .
one , two , three .
that 's very odd .
of course .
take us to professor ...
very good .
headmaster , correspondence college ...
of witchcraft , london .
now , go .
one , two , three .
well , charles , are you convinced by now ?
i do n' see no professor browne .
this bed was supposed to take us to professor browe .
look !
professor browne .
i do n't know .
hurry up !
professor emelius browne .
i do n't keep money in me ear .
yes , mada , a trick .
or to use a kinder word , an illusion .
but what is n't , in these troubled times ?
it is not hat things are .
it is what they seem to be .
is that not so , madam ?
that ai n't the kin of professor i expected .
i 'm not sure it 's the kind of professor mis price expected eithe .
you see , it really does n't matter what i do , what i do , as long as i do it ... with a flair .
what effect a little smoke is .
with a dash of hocus-pocus and the scet of buning-
i ' a fraud , a hoke a charlatan , a joke
may i also draw your attention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail .
now , i shall place the framed glass ... in this brown , unprepared- unprepared , mark you , ladies and gentleen .. unprepared brown paper ag .
and fix you with my best hypnotic stare
with my moans and groans and soporific tone
they have cheered me everyone
will mystify and disarm
it works
so it really does n't matter what i bre , what i brew
as long as i brew it with a flair
though i 've never cast a magic spell
i 'm a rogue , a rake a ountebank of fake
but i do hate'er i dare
and my magic incantations can be raed as decorations
the prices are so low , you will never cease to marvel at them .
for you , sir , one penny .
we foud him or you , miss .
do n't work .
how may i serve you ?
the late headmaster .
i m sorry , my dear .
look at your contract .
i bid you good day .
do n't let him get away .
will you get this child off my leg ?
filigree , apogee , pedigree , perigee !
cor !
i changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells .
my spell ?
they were just nonsense words that i got out of an old book !
i changed them aroun a bit .
what a treasure .
we can discuss my ideas at the same time .
we ' be delighted .
do these three jackals belong to you ?
wel , not exactly .
however , we shall all go together .
on the bed ?
come along .
you go 'round the other side .
fly ?
in point of fact , i do .
i found the front door open , the house was deserted .
merciful heavens !
i hould think you 'd be terrified at the very idea of living here .
you 'd have thought so .
i am , by nature , well , a little bit of a coward .
but then i pondered , as i often do .
shall we go in ?
mr. browne , the book- where is it ?
why do you keep the curtains close ?
more likely so 's a copper do n't pee in ad catch you hidin ' out here .
i want to have a chat with miss price .
es , run along , children .
remember , this house does not belong to mr. browne .
no .
and neither have you .
i must see the nature of the spell 
precisely , my good woman .
but now you must hear my ideas .
isle of naboombu .
animals wearing hats and things .

and the moonbeams the moon
and a flair
there 's serious work to be done .
to do my bit in the national eergency

and i slaved at every lesson as it came
your suggestions are rash and your manner is brash
though i 've no taste for playing the clown
i wo n't let you down
your lot and my lot have got to combine
mr. browne , i 'm warning you !
i warned you , mr. browne .
oh  you 're back  mr browne .
the spell which creates this force ... is five mystic words .
but where are the other pages ?
i have n't the foggiest .
you will be if you do n't pay attention .
whee did you get this book ?
there was a bit of unpleasantness , as a matter of fact .
there was a sort of scuffle .
he got one half ad i got te other .
where 's the other half no ?
but if it still exist , there 's only one place to find it .
where is that ?
rare alabaster

charles .

troop movements and massing of barges in french and dutch channel ports .
the prime minister has told the natio to be on the alert ... for signs of a possible invasion .
to think i might have been able to do something about all this .

treguna , mekoides , trecorum satis dee ?
how do you know that ?
you mean it was there in your book all the time ?

hello !
you 're a failure , emelius browne , and a coward .
when you english get it through your head ... that the germa forces can land at will whenever and wherever we please , perhaps you will consider a reasonable peace .
go on , miss price .
i must say , it 's very tempting 
not again !
your memory , miss price .
and the moonbeams he moon
all i need to succeed in my plan
with a flourish and a flair
eglantine .
filigree ...
filigree , apogee ,
pedigree , perigee .

i 'm afraid they 're a bi acient .
oh , he 's on his way to london .
if you are mr. browne , would you be kind enough to get down off my lap ?
it is you 
oh , i am glad to see you .
that ought to be useful .
well , we have to chance it .
thank you , eelius .

i 'd say you ould use a good , stiff drink .
you 're right , mr. kirby .

will you get it ?
that 's it 
eo ... ?
eohippus .
over the period of evolution , horses have grown larger .
and that center toe has become the hoof as we know it .
what is more incredible is the fossil beside it .
possily ore than 50 million years ago .
y resources  both financial and physical are running precariously low .
thank you for your kindness .

t.j. , i want to know ...

it took a while to train him , but now he 's about ready for his debut .
a horse dancing on horseback .
i can see it all now .
presenting el diablo , the world 's only miniature horse .
we are on our way to a fortune .
yeah , it was those three toes that started me thinking .
and four on its hind feet .
yes .
it could be a freak of nature , o course .
well , is there any way you can tell ?
the greatest scientific discovery of the age ?
t.j .
buffalo bill , barnum and bailey .
bromley .
we 'll play one off against the other .
sell to he highest bidder .
impossible .
destroying all my dreams 
reason is something my people do not understand .

camp .
lope ?

maam , i 'm prepared to pay a guide hansomely .
what 's this forbidden valley ?
superstitious claptrap .
if you knew where the little horse was hidden , what would you do ?
a centavo for your thoughts , señor .
oh , hi , lope .
she could make a fortune .
i ca n't understand it .
love .
love 's for latins .
lope , when you help someone you loe you hel yourself .
what 's the big discovery , seño ?
oh , no , no , no .
you 'll end up wanting a cut .
i 'm doing fine on my own .
i mean , you 're going on a ourney .
hey , tuck !
do n't be a fool , ma !
what happened ?
who ?
your friend , kirby .
stealing ?
why , the dirty ...

look here .
we 're headed in the right direction .
he 's working with the professor .
they were speaking of scientific interest .
tuck wants el diablo for buffalo bill .
you shoul have listened to me , t.j .
all right , all right !
he was right .
to where ?
i do n't know .
yeah , just about there .
you can make it easy or hard .
that 's up to you .
well , the ypsies too him .

where there i one eohippus , there must be others .
at least two , the sire and the mare .

i 've got it !
take your thieving hands off him .
he 's mine .
hey , we ot him cornered .
i can see daylight in there .
yeah , tat 's that because we 're not .
it opens into another whole valley through there .
wier inside .
take up the slack easy .
take her away .
okay , that did it !
come on , boys .
whoa .
here , what 's this ?
do you see what i see ?
what 's that ?
it looks like a plucked ostrich !
let 's get him for the show .
then what 's it doing here ?
precisely .
what is it doing here ?
ake off , t.j .
get on a horse , boy !
come on , professor .
there 's a big lizard back there , heading this way .
leave me alone , mr. kirby .
i 'm not leaving now .

carlos ?

a hole in the ground could swallow me up too .
you ca n't tell a friend from an enemy , cockeyed female .

tuck , carlos !
in a dream , i saw it 
the great jaws snapping , the riderless horse .
and so will you be doomed , all of you unless the evil one is set free !
the only thing that 's evil about him are his jaws .
a show !
a show 
it 's disgraceful to think of putting this creature on display in a cheap circus !
we can do what we like .
he belongs to us all , to mankind 
world tour !
wha 's this about a world tour ?
forgetting something , are n't you ?
oh , yes , new york .
no , not new york , wyoming !
the reason i helped you was so that all of you could get paid off handsome .
but now it 's worth saving .
tuck , ca n't you see ?
same old tuck .
as you like ?
i guess it is .
ell , i 'm sorry or you .
señorita , you must go after mr. kirby .
he 's a very proud man and he 'll never come back .

is it happening ?
not just a boy !
now i can go to my city , and people can see me .
now i have a plan .
you really are an ungrateful person .
the least you could do is ask her for a dance .
# keep the magic going
# through the power known as love ... #
it 's the prince , all right .
i 'd recognise him anywhere .
so , he 's alive .
we got ta go tell the king .
see that cloud there ?
his mother turned me into a wooden nutcracker , and then he released his army into the city centre , scaring all of my people , on a beautiful spring day .
ell , hopefully , she 'll come round tomorrow .
so he has to burn everything in a smoke factory , includin all the children ' toys , just o keep that cloud going .
come on !
something juicy , i hope .
i see no king .
you can turn our prince into wood , and turn us into your slaves , but you 'll never be more than a mangy , dirty rat to us .
uch a pity .
it 's all so unnecessary .
here .
# tey had their chance
# but human just could n't do it
# far too bright and breezy
# two , three four !
# welcome to a stygian era
# days eliminated
# so humans , sunshine , light we ca n't stand them
# rattus rules quod erat demonstrandum
# and the lights go out
genius !
yes , a masteriece , huh ?
you the man !
way to go , boss !
please , you are too kind .
and i 'll let you in on a little ratty secret , m greasy , terrorist little friend .
soon , only us rats will be left , ad e 'll ave an empire that will last ... a thousand years !
sorry 
too long .
lousy brakes .
nothing special 
no big deal .
what news ?
your favourite prince is still alive , sir .
i knew it .
maybe i should run into a hole ... and hide .
take them to the smoke factoy !
the prince is alive !
zip it , baldy .
he 's alive !
get my wig , quick !
any idiot can face a crisis .
oh , mother !
mother !
oh , it 's only you .
you appear to be slipping , old gal 
your spell on the prince is broken .
closer .
be a rat !
i 'll put a new high-grade cuse on that little unt , and then maybe one of your stupid soldier can gab him !
you bit me !
make it stick the next tie , wil you ?
i need to build up my strength .
a little rat juice .
little cutesy bore !
come on .
fantastic !
maybe some girls are good at miitary strategy .
oh , this is good .
what 's happening ?
i 'm comig .
ary !
why are n't you in bed ?
what , max ?
wha on earth is going on here ?
oh , you 're safe , you 're safe .
would you care to explain this ?
erm ...
illows ?
that was before .
i tried to ell you .
joseph , do something .
what 's going on ?
you , get in here !
i think i see one !
this i am sure of .
enough !
everybody , get to bed .
children .
i told you .
the ceiling as gone .
louise , even max does n't believe her .
not a word .
make this room grow before our eyes .
a bit of fun is one thing , mary  but quite blatantly lying is another .
now ... give me that doll .
i never do .
where are you going ?
i do n't want you to see me cry 
not even trying .
# i m lying
# but on reflection
# i 'm simply different
# one of a kind , i do n't mind
# dreams become eal ad i feel i 'm wanted
# and it 's all i need # .
i 'd better check .
i swear !
quiet !
is everything all right ?
of course .
mary has become unmanageable , and , uncle , i 'm sorry but it 's more than a little bit your fault .
she 's living in a fantasy world .
i know .
reality is merely an illusion , albeit a very peristent one .
when you leave , please will you take the doll 's house away with you ?
what 's in your pockets ?
# there was a boy
# holding the pebble , he was king
# the boy felt that he 'd lost everything
# he searched ong and hard
# his enchanted world forsaken
# and all too soon his life was overtaken
# he grew serious and grand
that was joseph .
why so sad ?
i saved it for you .
that old rat witch is not retiring any time soon .
what rank are you ?
captain .
yes !
there 's a real rat king ?
mm-mm !
oh !
no .
now , are there any weapon that are n't broken ?
come on .
good work , captain .

you can come on one condition .

i ca n't see anyhing .
give me your hand .
wow .

not in the teeniest bit .
in fact  i only came to ask you to play with my toys .

hm ?

pull over  i 'll drive .
you razy dinga-ling driver , orlo !
our financial worries are over .

pitch .
it might be a matter of pitch .
come on .
yeah , charlie .
baby , you 're looking at a believer .
that 's right .
and if she worked a six-hou day , uh , give or take a couple of coffee breaks  uh , corn breaks .
we 're talkig about a 100,000 dollar a ay business .
that 's right .
our fortune ?
what do you mean , our fortune ?
look , al , sweetheart ,
uh-huh .
i 'll have to devote full time , figuring how to incorporate a duck , and not have the internal revenuers on our neck .
oh , fine .
oh , it was no trouble , really .
thanks .
and do n't tell anybody about this , especialy , uh ...
hold it .
do n't spend any of that money yet .
make no changes in your liing standards .
now , let 's try and get some sleep .
no , the duck 's asleep with jimy and i do n't want jimmy disturbed 
and , fred ..
do you think maye now we could afford to re-shinle our house ?
we could buy the pentagon .
albert , just how rich will we be ?
now wait a minute .

the fellow in the fable let greed destroy him .
we wo n't do tat .
we 're gon na play it cool , kee our feet on the ground .
albert ?

he might catch cold .
oh

now , run along .
you 're gon na be late for school , goodbye .
yes .
who ?
well , hi .
bad checks ?
uh , uh , wel , you printed them .
no , mrs. dooley .
we 've explaine several ties that you can not write checks for more money than you have in the ank .
you could be arrested for that .
oh , no .
please do n' .
r. meaker , i , uh ...
i guess you 'll just have to call my husband about that ...
wait .
uh , i 'll be right down .
and tha 's my deposit slip for it .
next , please .
what kind of a bank is this , anyway ?
have n't you bankers ever heard of gold ?
mrs. dooley , even if that were gold bouillon there 's nothing ...
tat would n't do very much for your account now , would i ?
well , i should ay not .
the only possible place you could take that is to a refinery .
where 'd you get the hat ?
what hat ?
o , now alert , it was on sale .
you know , if you wrote a check for that hat , we 're overdrawn again .
no , we 're not .
from the refinery .
no , not tose .
well , the bank told me to .
no , no , no .
hi , partners .
that 's all we can do because we do n't have a license to handle gold .
i 'd like a gold license for my little ducky who lays gold eggs .
he works for the u.s. treasury .
why ?
you could get ten years in he jug for hoarding .
why ?
yes , but you 're ...
wait a miute .
you did n't tell them where the gold came from , did you ?
what did he say when you told him ?
she can tell them the trut and they 'll never believe it .
a new suit ?
keep moving aound .
no , no , no .
this is exceptionally high grade ore .
all seem to be the identical size and shape .
what kind of duck was that ?
thank you .
mrs. dooley , listen , about these nuggets ...
bye-bye .
we do n't have your address .
beauty .
you would n't happen to have a layaway plan , would you ?
no , i did n't think so .
well , i ca n't buy it now , but ...
i 'll be back .
gentlemen  they may ave learned how to make gold .
i know that .
the point i 'm trying to make is that they 've found a wa to make god cheap enough to put on the arket .
remembe what happened to common , every day , ordinary bread mold ?
penicillin .
i hesitate to think what would happen if this were to get out of this room .
take it on one .
no  no , no .
nothing to it at all .
well , we have had a little flap about gold around here , but everything is absolutely under control .
bye , bob .
rutledge .
yes , this is he .
hello , rog .
oh , no .
not a single foreign country will hear anything about it .
it 's all ours .
america is producing instant gold .
it is a plot .
americans make it for ten dollars an ounce , we make it $ 8.95 .
the white house ?
yes , sir .
i fuly realize you have enough trouble without this .
i understand , sir .
huh ?
known under various aliases , uch as k.w .
quote katie klaus quote dooley .

your neighbor ?

i have n't even talked to him .
well , how about jimmy ?
he 's our son , remember ?
i know that .
ho about that car ?
that 's the car i had my eye on .
old freddie-boy is going to see you get a whole stable full of them .
hee i am , slaving my head to the bone while you ...
how about that for a company name ?
dooley 's wrought iron sauna baths ?
it 's a sure loser .
besides hooper , i still can not identify the radioactive element in our gold .
if i ca n't identify it , i do n't know what its alf-life is .
if i do n't know its half-life ...
in other words , it could run out .
run out ?
well , get it , al .
i have 20l20 hearing .
what do you mean out ?
jimmy took him for a ride in that cute car with the wadlow boys .
not that !
come on .
you guys said you 'd take me and charlie for a ride .
take i easy , man .
get him off !
hey , arvin , look .
huh ?
we 'll give you two bucks cash .
great .
the fun 's over , son 
no , no , no .

it 's not a ciil rights case .
i guess you 're right .
you ca n't do that .
uh , jimm ?
hi , jimmy .
i 'm not supposed to go into your yard .
i 've got a present for you 
if you want it .
my little nephew outgrew it .

you know , quack , quack .
and this duck lays gold eggs .
i saw it happen .
they bark at it .

and that causes the duck to lay these .. gold eggs .
i see .
i did it myself .

it was after prohibition ...
chief , there may be someting to thi .
i thought he was putting me on , but ith hooper telling us ...

so ... stop that .
it 's all some fairy tale talk .

41,000 dollars wort of egs , and not one cent of income tax has been declared .
well , sir , this duck of yours could very well be the most single valuale asset in the united states today .
that duck is a natural resource .
that duck 's entitled to the protection of the u.s. government .
i understand that the duck will produce on command .
i 've done it myself .
i 'd ike to confer with my client .

oh , no .
sorry , gentlemen .
mr. hooper , did you actually witness the duck lay a golden eg ?
i did , indeed .
would you demonstrate it for us ?
it 's the wrong pitch , is n't it ?
your honor , he 's not doing it right .
i 'd like to get tis out in he open .
if that duck can lay gold eggs , then we should establish that .
you 're out of your mind .
if we lose the duck , so be it .
tere it is .

godzilla vs. megalon
brought to you by showa video
brother !
sue .
an earthquake ...
it 's an earthquake !
it wo n't moe !
hey , roku !
the national seismic institute believes the earthquakes are an effect from the second nuclear bomb test .
they also warn that more tremors are expected ,
it 's incredible , is n't it ?
it 'll be the end of all mankind
it 's like this ...
both were great civilizations , until a big earthquake destroyed them .
hey , would n't it be interesting if the earthquake destroyed your robot ?
you 're really funny ...
hey ...
broter !
damn !
professo !
roku !
damn , they really made a mess of this place .
brother , those guys made a mess of my room .
ho about here ?
every room seems to be messed up , bu nothing was stolen .
however , we should make a thorough check .
there 's some funny powder on the floor here .
what do you think it is ?
it looks like sand .
it ' a button i got from one of those guys .
it must have been from their shoes , we found it next to the robo .
nah , i 'm just an amateur .
you think it 's okay ?
bye-bye !
good afternoon ...
oh , it looks like it 's finished !
they had found rows of 20 meter high statues overlooking the sea .
it 's working !
congratulations !
you 've done it at last !
jet jaguar ... ?
ey , let 's go !
let 's try i out !
there are tv cameras in its eyes .
it 's also equipped with evasion devices so it will always get out of your way .
as far as i m concerned , it ca have the right of way !
it 's them !
seatopia , seatopia .
we hae managed to occupy the laboratory and capture the inventor as well .
after three million years of peace , we finally have to fight .
we do not want to make wan but the people of earth leave us no choice .
we must tight for the sake of seatopia !
we will give the earth people a taste of thei ow medicine .
rise to the surface of the earth !

they 've got us in a metal container .
i think they 're going to kill u both !
a little more !
brother !
how uch longer until e get to the lake ?
well , it should be around an hour , riht ?
yes .
why would you want this container taken to the crac in the lakebed ?
what 's in the thing anyway ?
i guess we 're not supposed to now what 's inside that thing .
brother , i di it !
the robot has made it to the lakebed ,
where are you taking my two friends ?
seatopia ?
we 've created our own oxygen supply , and later we constructed our own sun .
we are a very advanced people .
if you 're so superior , why steal a robot ?
for the ake of our peace we needed to steal it to create an army .
now you 're going to tell e where my friends are !
alright , you 're free now .
brother !
unit one !
te young prisoner i was holding has escaped .
roer .
that would be just as good as taking it to the lake .
brother !
you 've got to get us out of here !
what happened to the foreign guy ?
damn !
are you alright ?
id n't that look just like jet jaguar ?
that 's jet jaguar !
alright , that 's what we 'll do .

this is an ultra-sonic computer transmitter that i made in case the main computer failed .
open fire !
yes , sir !
jet jaguar , stop !
thi is an emergency ...
the robot 's control has been restored to the professor .

it 's just beginning !
we 'll start testing .
behold my powes .
stronger even than mew .
those fools thought you were a science experiment but i see you as a valuable partner .
it will be the same wih your powers unless you control them .

your power are no being suppressed .

that is what sets them apart and will make them pokémon masters .
good luck to all of you .
the world 's greatest pokémon master is waiting fo me .

giovanni insisted on super-clones more powerful than any living pokéon .
but the creature 's anger is out of control .
-sounds like a real pokénstein .
so this must be the lab .
no .
your pokémon will not be spare .
they have isgraced themseves y serving humans .
those pokémon are nothing ut slaves .
so , you say i am wrong ?
you are as pathetic as the rest .
humans and pokémon can never be riends .
are you okay ?
go , rhyhorn .
-no !
like most pokémon trainers i too began with charmander , squirle and bulbasaur .
but for their evolved forms i used thei genetic material to clone even more powerful copies .
-copies !
our fake venusaur ca n't beat my real one !
it may not have a nickname , but i do have a charizard .
i choose you !
charizard , i did n't say start .
your charizard is poorly trained .
saur .
i underestimated you last time , but that wo n't happen again !
shellshocker , hydro pump !
those clones are too powerful .
i 'm not giving up .
harizard , use your spee , not power , and you 'll win .
are you okay ?
this is my world now .
i know !
it 's futile to try and escape my ower .
dewgong .
but me , i got a special place in my tail for this one .
look there !
it 's pikachu !
i m so lad you 're okay .
-they 're faulous aes !
but where are the real ones ?
te poké originals !
i am sparing your lives , for the moment .
but you can not escape your fate .
behold !
with pokémon an humans eliminated the clones shall inherit the world .
you 're mine !
can it be ?
mew .
superior to mew .
mew and mewtwo !
why do you flee from me ?
-what 's it saying ?
and that a pokémon 's real strength comes from the heart .
now we shall see who triumphs .
pokémon are n't meant to fight .
what can come ou of it ?
now i can see how horrible fighting really is .
even the best of friends will fight ometimes .
i 'll proie never to fight again if you will .
let 's get something straight !
you was born different .
how do i kow you 're not going to pull a fas one o me ?
you 're right , we do have a lot in common .
the same earth , the same air , the same sky .
maybe if we started looking at what 's the same instead of always looking at what 's different , who knows ?
how ?
metwo wants to prove how srog thoe super-clone are .
i 'd rather risk my life out in mewtwo 's storm than watc pokémon destroy each other .
those pokémon are ready to fight to the death .
someone s got to take a stand .
someone 's got to say no and refuse to fight .
oh , no !
please , no !
i pitted them against each other .
i see now that the circumstances of one 's birth are irrelevant .
-this could be the worst storm ever .
you have got to find shelter .
the pokémon treatment center will open as a shelter .
they keep geting more beautiful every time i see them .
well , i guess we 're just here because we 're here .
yes , let 's eat .
i ca n't believe it .
-that 's so weird !
what 's tha ?
-l do n' see anything , ash .
-this is paradise !
i 'd really like to o sailing in one of them catamarans .

great .
as you could see yugo ... his little idea was to add us to his frozen heroes collection .
why did he take adamaï along ?

it 's rather nice .
i should come visit you with eva and the kids !
difficult .
i still did n't find the way home .
they 're all looking at me like i was the last of the iops .

he 's getting back the powers he lent me .
i 'm not ure he 's ready .
yes !
these days i feel pretty badass .
with people i do n't know 
ok fine .
the revelation i have to disclose requires you to hold to your underwear .
just a little etail .
what ?
but be serious rubi .
pinpin .
he 's the iop god !
it was easier to believe he 's a woman ...
the ... the iop god ?
for my people .
i would n't call that egoistical .
harebourg .
mull over your actions .
do n't go !
and i note you did n't fail in you mission .
my dear .
and i mean you no harm .
the iop god had to come down on he world of twelve to face a dreadful trial .
you have other children ?
.. othe families ?
evangelyne .
but not really .
usually gods can live for quite a while .
extreme emotionnal shock .
now you must take back your place .
... in your hands ... we 're not interested .
maybe .
so what 
little dragon ?
it would be very violent !
and .. who 's we ?
a secret guild that aims to watch over the world .
evey sibling is a demigod or a dragon offspring .
and you otomai son o the feca goddess .
i do n't believe a single word of your story !
if that 's a trick ...
i have explained what will happen if you use the dofus .
you should let him rest .
not to mention he 's currently receiving a nice big chunk of divine energy .
that 's tremendous .
princess .
it 's the occasion to ge our revenge against ush .
i ' rather have you go to the sadida kingdom with our friends .

you 'll hae to earn them .
another one of his stupid games .
during which everything goes .
it 's impossible .
nothing can destroy a dofus .

unwillig hero ...
see !
the future is our adventure .
their survival is at stake .
we did n't entrust you with two dofus for a stupid bargain .
especially not to wave them under the nose of the little eliatrope .
we ca n't use them .
harebourg .
however i can tell by the sound of your voice that your decision is final .
big sister .
then make sure you do n't fail .
not a moment too soon .
time goes by so fast 
chibi !
it 's the chef 's piece !
and tonight you can forget the next part of the book i 'm reading you .
at last !
a talking bird !
i 'm the emissary of princess-
help me !
amalia shera sharm .
what doe she mean with 'urgently ' ?
that 's the way it works does n't it ?
we all know that 's the way it works .
everyone on board !
recall potions ?
i made them .
i must go get the percedal family .
yeah ... what does he mean with 'archaic ' anyway ?
you 're a fat gobball !
you be .
what is that ?
elely !
especially when it 's mine !
it 's so ugly !
it 's mine .
this is n't for me .
i wanted to give it to your mom .
but everytime something happens .
but ...
nothin will happen .
it 's now or never !
mommy !
huh ..
that shows how important our kingdom is to them .
even the king of bonta- who will be of invaluable assistance .
powerful sadida .
granda ruel !
i welcome you .
the consequences have been catastrophic for the sadida kingdom .
another bout of crying from ogrest could wipe out the entire sadida kingdom .
we 'e studied all the olutions .
and whose subjects we 've never see .
prince armand !
adamaï .
gone ?
but found only two so far .
the count harebourg .
hey that 's great !
what ?
uh ...
i 've said something dumb ?
and ... and you 've accepted ?
who does he thin he is 
to create an unrecedented diplomaic incidet ?
you know it .
us too !
cout .
darkness .
you 've only seen her in pictures 
it 's beautiful .
they come from another worl and i have no idea how to use hem .
amalia is my best friend ... we all know there 's more to it .
while her ... she has become a queen .
can you imagine me by her side ?
the entire sadida kingdom would make fun of her .
so what ?
this is the princess ' decision .
the leaers of this world must someimes take hard decisions .
and he will need you by her side to support her .
and i have my idea for the next two .
i 'd like you to come with us .
yes ye yes .
you hae a visitor .
canar .
your mother would never have allowed me to let her leave .
an exceptional situation calls for exceptional measures .
we 're only a small reconnaissance team .
long live the princess !
we 're almost there .
i tell you ...
is it war ?
a attle ?
but surely i would have been better .
you had to guide us through some danerous place again .
{ \i1\ch00ffff } grufon :
straight ahead !
i 'd like you to stay in the vehicle .
that 's unfair !
and it 's an honor for me to welcome the brotherhood of the tofu .
come inside warm yourselves .
would you give me this honor ?
but i believe my future wife should know what i look like .
before you freeze on the spot .
you 're ruining my focus .
mommy said e hould stay inside !
some things ust stay the way they are .
unlike our ancestors .
and mine holds the secret hope tha our arranged marriage wo n't stay that way for too long .
no .
i do n't think so 
but ... these mechanisms .
you want to do the same thing he did .
little yugo 
nox wanted to go back in time and demontrated how it 's nearly impossible .
and my subjects .
we would have all the resources at our disposal to live independently from the other nations .
forever .
such nice morals .
just like amaia is ready to marry a stranger to help her people .
without subjects to protect .
but somethin is tickling my beard .
with what magic are you going to manage al that ?
of course .
when yugo will have told me how they work .
sheltered from all disasters .
you 're wrong hareourg .
what 's wrong with you ?
princes .
we 're nearly there .
and search through the place .
you 'd better gie them .
it 's time to put daddy 's lessons into practice .
just try not to rush in like-
but i need to use you for a bit .
i suppose i can make an exception .
ad keep moving !
you taught him well eva .
he looks like itsy-bitsy you .
carnage !
you want some ?
let go of my sister !
hats off .
your rug rats are awesome .
kids ?
no way !
keep giving those cowards a beating !
i promise you 'll lose some teeth in no time !
do n't worry kids .
it 's bath time !
you peak as if you were on the brink of war .
i feel ten feet tall .

no jump .

daddy !
would you accept to make me a happy iop ?
yes !
and your ring ...

... or for ever hold your peace !
what is it ?
i beg you o respect my decision !
amalia .
what a wild child !
step aside .
vey well ...
you 're a crook .
it would be much simpler if you accepted o use the eliarope dofus to carry out my plan .
what is your choice ?
wrong answer !
your fighting style fits you well .
join me !
oin me .
join me .
ugo .
he sadida 's fate is in your hands .
amalia ...
i 've always wanted to save a princess .

your eoistical behavior is a danger to our pan .
especially not to wave them under the nose of the little eliatrope .
these dofus are worthless .
we ca n't use them .
i 've never seen anthing so beautiful .
it 's magnificent !
alibert ays it 's the last one he makes for you .
what 's happening ?
you 're out of order !
you will end up in the cooking pot .
i heard you adamaï !

everyone on board !
old pal .
ecall potions ?
but it costs a fortune !
i made them .
and now i must leave you .
yeah ... what does he mean with 'archaic ' anyway ?
at my age it 's rather them who should look after me .
it 's already noo !
even when they sleep !
you 've won !
i 've already told you not to rummage in people 's stuff .
especially when it 's mine !
ugh !
mine !
but you can wear whatever you like 
i wanted to give it to your mom .
pinpin we decided the firing range was m little secret garden .
daddy has something to tell you !
i wanted to ask you eva-
i guess you were right about the powerful curse .
none !
young yugo 's party should arrive soon .
i welcome you .
i 'll let ou explain the situation to our friends 
the consequences have been catastrophic for the sadida kingdom .
but only one seems viable .
master joris ?
the kings of the word hae asked me to retrieve the six eiatrope dofus .
what ?
how dare you !
these dofus belong to our people 
adamaï .
even if you people is not on our world .
adamaï .
i commiserate with the problems of the sadida kingdom .
what have you done with the eliatrope dofus ?
nothing .
but ...
the count harebourg .
an island which he is the absolute master .
and ... this count has made us a proposition .
he asked for your hand ?
hey that 's great !
congratulations !
pinpin !
and a small price to save our forests .
he demands only the brotherhood of the tofu as an escort .
who does he think he is ?
very bright idea .
you know it .
i 'll get ready .
count .
darkness .
it 's beautiful .
they come from another world and i have no idea how to use them .
i think someone can tell me .
you look so dissapointed .
we 've never talked about your feelings for amalia .
amalia is my best fiend ... we all know there 's more to it .
this is the princess ' deision .
he leaders of this world must sometimes take hard decisions .
it must be very important if you make the effort to ask me .
and i have my idea for the next two 
i 'd like you to come with us .
i 'll try to survive .
stop .
yes yes es .
it 's very cold around frigost .
evangelyne .
your mother would never have allowed me to let her leave .
father .
with adamaï and otomai we will leave at the same time as amalia 's convoy .
good .
three masters wo n't be too many for such a quest .
i promise .
my little girl !
i 'm counting on you to keep an eye on armand .
long live the sadida ingdom !
my dear yugo .
we 're almost there .
i tell you ..
but surely it would have been better .
straight ahead !
you have arrived !
and it 's an honor for me to welcome the brotherhood of the tofu .
but i believe my future wife should know what i look like .
it 's beautiful ... your castle is a rapture for the eyes .
princess amalia .
i 'm bored .
can you be less noisy please ?
you 're ruining my focus .
you 're the baby !
or feed an entire people ?
as the kingdom of his sadida friend crumbles under he waters .
our union will allow our two kingdoms to survive and thrive .
unike our ancestors .
respect your half of the bargain .
have a kama to spare grandpa ?
of course .
but ... hese mechanisms .
you want to do the same thing he did .
not the past .
and my subjects .
what others ?
who will it worry ?
with what magic are you going to manage all that ?
of course .
when yugo will have told me how they work .
the power of dofus is too great to be mastered .
amalia !
wha 's wrong with you ?
i 've promised to marry the count in exchange for the security of the sadida kingdom .
fine .
the count wants answers on the dofus .
it 's time to put daddy 's lessons into practice .
i suppose i can make an exception .
you taught him well eva .
carnage !
you want some ?
let go of my sister !
shut up !
kids ?
then surrender .
no way !
fun time is up .
you have my word .
do n't worry kids .
you speak as if you were on the brink of war .
really ?
i love you amalia .

here 's for you .
let 's no forget we 've been attacked in our own home .
do i have to remind you tat he left alone to fight ogrest ?
armand !
we are able to go help him out .
lady echo has warned us about the consequences if we oppoe them to ogrest 's rimordial dofus .
you sound like you believe her theories .
i do n't trust this woman myself .
but we should not underestimate the impact of a clash between two beings wielding six dofus each .
my ogrest is drowning the world merely by crying .
your brother already said that amalia .
pinin is our friend .
we ca n't do nothing while his life is at risk .
lady echo has said-
lady echo !
elely has a problem .
this aura ... it looks like tristepin 's .
rubi .
pipoune .
porker !
i 've seen him .
and pinpin too .
we can .
using them could destroy the world of twelve !
you do n't seem yourself .
but we ca n't risk the world .
you are sipho .
what 's wrong with you ?
you can tell me someting only us could know .
he was complaining every time he cut some meat .
we even had his initials engaved on the blades .
you ca n't even recognize your own brother .
you 've had some difficult times recently .
i ...
i wanted-
elely can communicate with pinpin .
maybe .
but you need the dofus .
and pinpin is like a brother for us .
ad ' !
you do n't even know how to use the .
i ...
i 'm a fast learner !
of course !
no .
yugo .
bro .
if i do listen to you ad ' ...
i love you bro .
i promise to get him back in one piece .
what about adamaï ?
we could nt find a agreement ... but he will get over it .
things may get nasty over there .
his father .
i must come along .
my ... heart ... is beating wildly .
i 'm among you .
wakfu streams traveling across the world of twelve .
then let 's get moving !
amalia .
yugo !
i 've come to brin you back pinpin .
buddy .
and my family !
do n't waste time and-
i do n't hear anything .
nice !
and now that i 've become a god ... what is the backup plan ?
i his belly ?
that 's suicide !
try to distract him while i get closer .
for me too .
hey yugo !
each blow i take weakens te world .
i can take hits as long as needed .
ogrest !
i 'm sorry my son .
i 've done everything i ould .
ogrest .
addy otomai is a liar !
hey fatty !
this one must have hurt .
or ogest is going to hurt him .
daddy otomai should never have done that ... right .
but i have an idea .
i 've used too much wakfu .
e must egroup if we do n't want to get massacred .
and we ca n't do anything .
looks like your owers have ailed .
i 've had an issue .
are you still there ?
the world of twelve is in danger .
goultard wants to speak to you .
yes ?
what 's the situation ?
do you have a solution ?
but you can choose where it doe .
you wo n't get another try .
focus your efforts to protect the tree of life !
trust yugo .
two ...
not me .
them .
but ... where is ogrest ?
daddy !
i 've missed you ...
especially the moment where you did-
master otomai .
may i use the occasion to introduce a surprise guest .
guards !
are you crazy ?
ca n' you see he 's inoffensive ?
my name is elely !
creating one of the worst disaters his world has ever known .
right ?
but do n't worry yugo .
even if you did n't ring him back in one piece .
what about the eliatrope dofus ?
i 've entrusted them to someone who wo n't lose them .
no one should use them ever again .
yes !
and in the name of all the nations of the world of twelve present to celebrate your union .
you may kiss the bride .

ma'am is so vulgar .
i 've been brought here by lord harrogate to make his colliey pay .
what exactly is the problem , dear ?
the real problem is we ca n't get the coal out in sufficient quantities .
and , therefore , it 's too expensive at that price , we ca n't sell it .
what will you have to do , father ?
it 's not fair !
do n't wory , i 'll wait for you when i get there .
oh , no you wo n't .

uh , no , thank you .
yes , yes , i know all about that .
now , as my new anager , tell me , hat do you propose to do about that ?
i 'd like to explore the possibility of using machiney in the pits , my lord .
machiney ?
are you suggesting we might use machiney instead of miners , perhaps ?
um ..
but it might be possible to bring the coal from the face to the shaft by means of machiney instead of ponies .
hm , yes , yes , at least , i am prepare to explore that idea .
hm .
go away , you horrible dog !

it 's a girl up a tree .

who pays for their feed ?
what 's the matter ?
there 's only one thing to do .
how 'll we do it ?
bert would help us .
you 're not to mention it to bert .
but you said ...
he 'd be afraid of losing his place .
then how can we get to them ?
oh  they always keep plans of all the workings .
in your father 's office .
he says i ca n't take this stuff down .
es , but where ?
let 's look up here .
ou know , for winding the cage up and down .
father , how does a winding engine work 
miss coutts , i want my daughter to be a young lady .
but i also want her to take an interes in the thing about her .
this should go in there .
no , it should n't .
you 're doing it all wrong .
no , i 'm not .
now all it needs is some grease .
what do you want ?
i do n't know where the water comes from .
if you did n't pump the pit out evey day , it would soon be flooded .
hey , we 'd bet not get too muky or they 'll woder where we 've been .
it must work .
it must .
it does n't help .
and how do you think you 'll do that ?
you and tommy and the little miss ?
it should n't be too hard .
but not for too long .
someone 'll hear it .
well , i must be off to the tables .
me ?
i 'll not tell anyone .
and the stables .
oh , give over .
ta .
good luck , dave .
aye , good luck .
was it an explosio ?
aye .
how far will he have to go to get through to the present workings ?
them levels run for miles .

alice .
i 'm afraid alice has been given too much libem , mrs. sandman .
clara tells me she went out for a walk .
you 'll get lost as well .
it 's him !
i knew you could do it !
hooray !
we can bring 'em here .
only a shepherd in winter with his sheep .
the lead miners used to work here , but their pit 's been closed for years .
yes , this 'll be the best place to keep the ponies .
now then , there 's some fodder in the barn behind the pithead .
we can get it up here , and then ...
bert says the pit belongs to hi and to all them that died there .
who was that i saw with you ?
yes .
you mean because your father is only the manager of the mine ?
es , miss coutts .
come on , love , you 'll be late .
dave , they 're connecing up the machiey today , and tomorrow the ponies ill be brought up ad sent to barnsley .
i 'm not botheed .

them ponies have served us well .
helped us to win coal and earn our living .
will you let them be taken off to be slaughtered like they was so much raw meat ?
what is it ?
get those ponies back to the station , put in the vans .
we did n't earn more money yesterday when we were laid off .
there 's dislocation at first , when we 're changing ...
aye !
that 's the dislocation !
they 're changin ' over from men to machines .
we never asked for machines .
_ye .
that machiney is here to protec your livelihood .
an if you were n't such fools ...
you can work your own pit , mister , with your own machiney , if you think it 's so fine .
want to lose a day 's pay ?
get down there .
and if you put them ponies in that van , we 'll never come back .
now , i 'm not going to punish you .
and are vey sory for it .
well ?
they might .
dave , i do n't know wha you 've got to grin about .
are n't you glad they 're not gon na kill the ponies ?
ponies .
ponies wo n' put food in your belly or clothes on your back .
and , as for you , i 'm not having you under my feet all day .
you can have your breamast tomorrow , then get out of the house .
the better be back at wok by then , or else ...
no , they call it anthracius .
when he was down underground , he kew his way about , so nobody noticed .
mm ?
yes , my lord .
yes .
all right , all right .
what 's the trouble this time ?
i suppose they want more money , hmm ?
the men feel that in replacing the ponies with ...
shh , shh .

now you told me that this machiney woud , in time , or should , in time , make the colliey begin to pay .
not a bit .
quiet , me beauties .

hey !

the manager s called a meeting at the pit .
come on !
for good .
l mean wha i say .
then we ' be assured of ork for the whole year ?
what about the ponies ?
no place for ponies in this pit .
we ca n't take an ultimatum .

aye .
if pit closes , we 're out on street  all of us .
and our wives and bairns .
nowhere to live .
no food and no work .

we should have a vote !
let 's vote .

mrs. armstrong , sir .
hey , do 't touch it .
all right , lad , all right .

but it 's knocked out the main ventilation shaft .
and the afterdamp is vey bad .

rodan is in moscow ?
what 's going on here ?
a subterranean monster has just appeared from the arc de riomphe .
no , the world 's treasure is about to be destroyed by his monster .
the monument is collapsing .
it 's een destroyed .
paris is being destroyed by this subterranean monster .
we 've just received a new report .
godzilla has appeared in new york .
godzilla is in new york .
what about you , dr. yoshida ?
i have no anwers right now .
why ha n't tokyo been attacked when it 's closest to monsterland ?
i 'd very much like to know why myself .
moonlight sy-3 !
hey !
yes , sir .
it wo n't get away today .
this is more important .
that 's a ufo out there .
it 's dangerous to get any closer .
moonlight sy-3  what 's wrong ?
go .
i do n't know what 's happened on earth , but it 's absurd to ask us for help .
they did n't ask .
it 's a recall order .
you 'll land at monsterland on te bonin islands .
receiving guidance beam .
roger that .
stand by for atmospheric entry !
someome may have commandeeed it .
ascertain their identity and objective .
they may resist .
roger .
no ign of radioactivity or sulfur dioxide .
all right , let ' go .
what 's going on here ?
welcome .
doctor !
hello again .
why are you here ?
what 's all this about , doctor ?
cooperate othing .
ou let all the monsters free while director yoshida was away .
they 're not running free .
we have them under remote control .
take a look .
godzilla is in the pacific .
we can call them back to this island anytime we want .
i 'll introduce you to the inventor of this remote-control system .
follow us .
welcome , gentlemen .
i imagine you have lots of questions .
how does destroying our cities establish anything ?
some degree of sacrifice is unavoidable .
what ?
kilaak ?
belief does nt matter .
that barrier is completely unbreakable .
getting you out of here .
call them .
c'mon .
hurry up !
kyoko !
kyoko !
fall back !
listen , otani .
the only way we can help is if you answer .
do n't you get that ?
where 's their new base ?
please , ell me .
our friendship wo n't make any difference to them .
doctor !
hands off .
there 's no point in moving him now !
we need o go 
halt !
scalpel .
it 's some kind of metal i 've never seen .
i agree .
they cae to get him for fear we 'd find this .
there must be a transmitter somewhere .
i 'll search from the air .
yes , sir .
look , i 'm usy .
yeah , but still ...
there !
it 's that !
let me see .
over there !
sy-3 ?
we went to the moon with takeshi that time .
is he doing well ?
we 're investigatig a signal .
please observe tis object , which appears to be a stone .
the unsc has confirmed it as the kilaak monster-control device wreaking havoc upon our world .
what 's more , they 're being discovered in the most unexpected places .
one was even discovered in a coconut on guam .
we estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2,000 km .
so the monsters are likely being controlled by devices in their respective areas .
regarding the kilaaks and their prisoner from monsterland ...
tetuo ise , age 30 
kyoko manabe , age 23 .
thank you , miss .
you can go 
we beg your pardon .
it doe .
prepare to attack .
do we hae proof the kilaaks are behind it ?
there 's a subterranean monster at aagi .
they must be using a new control device now .
thank you , doctor .
it 's kyoko manabe .
let 's talk elsewhere .
no , i want to talk to all of ou here .
do n't tell me again !
especiall the reporters .
amd if we do n't , they 'll destroy us with the monsters .
that 's coercion , not negotiation !
i 'm talking to everyone here .
you be quiet .
what are you doing ?
she was being controlled with these .
we 'll investigae them immediately .
kyoko !
good , you 're awake .
it 's me .
it 's al right .
i ...
yellow poison gas 
she has no memory of when she was being controlled .
all right then .
prepare to attack .
yes , sir !
sy-3 has begun its decent !
good .
halt descent !
emergency ascent !
all right 
open fire !
hey , what 's wrong ?
it 's anguirus !
what ?
damn ...
yeah .
determie where it 's landing .
catain , running away sucks .
let 's fight back .
it wo n't follow us where there 's no air .
advance !
keep advancing !
s-spread out !
spread out !
first platoon , take the left forest road !
second platoon , to the right !
this way !
what 's wrong ?
i 'm all right .
let 's go .
damn it ...
it wo n't budge .
i bet it 's a kilaak cave .
our only choice is o move forward .
all right .
okay , get back .
i knew it .
so what 's the important business ?
proclamation ?
please listen carefully , major tada in particular .
earth does n't belong to humans alone .
te area beneath the mt .
fuji volcanic chain now belongs to he kilaak .
understand ?
what ?
let 's go .
that 's the true source of the signal !
we 'll send sy-3 to the moon .
and do n't take of those spacesuits till you deal with the kilaaks .
proceed to the target .
take a look at your chart .
yes , sir .
watch out for ufos and approach from a low altitude .
we 'll be on our way then .
our approach vector is 45 degrees to port .
from the sea of tranquility to the sea of vapors .
that 'll bring us to the casaini crater .
roger .
it 'd be surprising if we were n't .
full stop .
prepare to descend .
all right , here we go .
prepare the rover !
preparing he rover !
lose te fuel valves !
activate cooling system !
activating cooling sysem !
coolant pressure ?
at max !
what ?
at this rate , the fuel tank will eplode !
no time .
yes , sir !
fire !
commander .
we detected a flare at cassini .
i hope this works .
if they fail , we 'll be the next to die .
we might get vaporized along with this base before long .
yes , sir 
okada  yoshikawa , arima , come with me .
come on .
dismount ad disable anything important .
understood , sir .
even the most advanced science will have some weak point .
over there too !
when we destroyed the wall , te temperature dropped .
gather them up .
this is the control device 's core .
damn thing 's still running .
moo base .
moon base !
no answer ?
none at all .
the base wo n't aswer , and the signal 's still there .
let 's detach the excavator !
detach the maser .
get a hig-voltage cable !
screwdrier .
i thin our only choice is to assume they faile .
okay , switch it on !
what 's wrong ?
i do n't care !
turn it on and up !
i worked !
hurry !
yes , it is .
now we know why they wee after the mt .
at constant high temperaures , they can probably live forever .
forever ?
that 's right 
eavy ue of freeze rays .
yes , sir .
godzilla !
again ?
you 're there ?
yes .
excellent .
doctor , this is no time for that !
our control device is complete , so we thought we 'd tet it on godzilla .
the monsters are on our side .
it and the primeval aokigahara forest are silent , as if awaiting the impending full-scale giant-monser attack against the kilaak base .
rodan ?
oh , there 's one !
now mothra has appeared .
it ' anguirus from the asairi plateau o the left .
truly a sight to see .
following anguirus are manda , baragon , and gorosaurus .
one after another , they 're bearing down on the kilaak base here in aokigahara .
flying ove lake motsu with the southern alps in the horizon .
will gozilla lead the opening charge ?
this force of gian monsters with godzilla at its head is truly a sight to behold .
we ca 't control him .
what do we do ?
earth 's monsters are mo match for him .
the monsters are read .
this is an amazing struggle !
a burning monster ?
it 's heading straight for us !
evauate !
the kilaaks are signaling us !
what now ?
do we attack ?
fire ragon can reduce tokyo to ashes in two to three hours .
the monsters are on the offensive .
get away from here .
g !
fire dragon , 15 degrees ahead to port !
prepare to fire freeze-ray missiles !
yes , sir !
yes , sir !

the q wire is attahed .
the rhombus wheel is turning .

batteries .
each battery lasts 100 years ,
oh , dear .
what 's wrong 
i just remembered hat when i put the batteries in ,
quick .
i thik it 's working .
all right !
can we make christmas ?
it 'll be awfully , awfully tight ,
and quickly !
but it is n't a permanent situation .
i have high hopes for you , allie thompson 
but it also comes with a great deal of responsibility .
it does ?
and taking what does n't belong to you .
and unselfish .
imagine if i just decided to skip christmas .
think of all the billions of children ho would wake up on christmas morning
you did a wonderful job helping me today , allie ,
and i 'll never forget that 
i may lose my lunch .
can we just get on with this ?
edwin .
i could n't be more ashamed .
hmm ?
what made you so mean ?
everything !
ever since i was a little boy ,
i was busy playing with hermometers .
they 'd look at the clouds and see ponies
all i could see were condensed forms of atmospheric moisture !
oh , mr. martino was right .
oh , edwin .
edwin , you 're not a failure .
a place where the weather is exciting ,
a place where you can share your knowledge
really ?
yes .
no more lying , cheating , or stealing .
nothing about our little adventure .
do i hae your word ?
as a gentleman .
and more importantly , as a meteorologist .
you 'll see , edwin .
we 're ready , santa !
merry christmas .
i 'm so sorry .
to tell you the truth , i forgot all about them .
we are gon na be having turkey sandwiches
for the next 5 years .
mom ?

that he might not even make it back today .
ok .
your gift should arrive right about ...
i 's dad !
kids , i 'm home !
dad , you 're home !
whoa !
oh !
this has your name on it .
i thought it was petty appropriate ,
i would have found a way to get hee ,
i love you so much .
i love you , too .
i o n't know , it 's ...
the ultimate christmas present ?
that 's exactly right , allie .
allie !

there was a first clause , but also a second clause .
get on with it !
when the last santa fell off your roof and you put on his coat , you found this .
right .
and the rest would be history , right ?
but it seems ou number two elf , the keeper of the handbook , overlooked the single most important detail in the history of chrismas !
wow .
look .
i ca n't see that .
better now ?
better now ?
it 's gettin ' there .
or now ?

if anybody can do tis , it 's you , number one .

most importantly , he 's very happy with his new look , and i would caution you all not to poit or stare or use the word plastic .
okay .
thank you .
back to work , please .
comet , because i do n' want to take prancer .
i want to take a trip with you .
we know what that means .
it 's beautiful .
it really is .
it has a poer reserve that measures how much magic you have left .
it 's at 10 .
that should be enough .
but if you use up any magic for any reason  the level drops .
uh-oh .
for you to come back !
thank you .
it 's one top .
scott !
we should ge going .
oh , okay .
ow do you always know when there 's a problem ?
i see you when you 're sleepin ' .
i know when you 're awake .
this time he defaced school property .
he 's waiting for us in principal newma 's office .
someting about her makes me want to deface public property .
both :
principal newman .
then i would n't spend so much time with you ,
oh .
good mornin , principal newman .
keep this up and you will spend your life stabbing trash .
have a nice trip .
it 's an affront to authority and blatant disrespect for property .
if this continues , i 'll have no other recourse than to supend ...
excuse me .
so am i. charlie , we 're all worried about you .
it feels like you 're tring to get someoe s attention .

i appreciate that .
believe it or not , you have a great capacity for love .
hmm .
have you ever helped anyone ?
ever ?
as promising as this sounds , i do n't need help with this area .
a double letterman .
so as far as dating goes ,
i think if anybody can stir up the old mojo , it would be moi .

do n't you do anything till i get down !
a lump of sugar ?
certainly .
you 're not sis .
now , you put your hand underneath here and , wait now ...
here we go .
that 's because i live in europe .
what happened ?
you like it ?
no , i 'm not .
see ?
my word .
mother counted last night and one came out .
these hotels .
i thought ou were german .
well , she 's my aunt .
yes , i like her .
randolph , you try that and i 'll fix you .
how do you like that ?
she 's right 
what are you doing ?
i 'm going up te alps .
that s the wa you come down .
your brother and i have made acquaintance .
you 'd better leave it somewhere .
italy ?
why , going over .
i wan na go to america !
do they have candy ?
you can just see the dents du midi .
it 's not a ery good one .
i like just hanging round .
he 's american .
we 'e from new york state .
where i want to be .
you have n't tod me your name .
randolph c miller .
my father is ezra b miller .
he 's in schenectady .
i 'm gon na climb that tree .
he does n't like me , either .
well , one , but he goes round with a teacher .
your brother has no teacer ?
mother thought of getting one .
an american lady .
but randolph did n't want a teacher travelling round with us .
she asked why i did n't give randolph instruction .
can you fin people in italy to do that kind of thig ?
yes , in geneva .
i 'd never been in so many hotels until i came to euroe .
there are a number .
i 'm gla ..
so many intimate friends have been .
whenever i put on a paris dress i feel i 'm in europe .
pardon ?
but i do n't know here the society keeps itself here .
do you ?
are you taking the cure ?
i 've always had plenty of it .
there 's los there .
i 've more friends there .
i 've had a lot of gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the château e chillon .
no .
i want to go , dreadfully .
i would n't leave without seeing it .
you can drive , or take the steamer .
randolph says it 's too old to be iterestin .
mother 's afraid to leave him alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find someone to stay with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd rather go to chillon .
she 's not much bent on going , anyway .
we ?
you and i ?
oh , eugenio .
to chillon ?
mademoiselle has arranged it ?
i o n't be happy till we go .
you 're really american ?
she will tell you all about me .
the carriage is waiting .
they 're horribly common , y dear frederick .
one does one 's dut by just ignoring them .
milk ?
i ca n't not .
she has that charming look they have .
and she dresses to perfection .
ca n't think where they get their tate .
after all , she 's not a comanche indian .
does she ?
there 's no other name for it .
very likely they 've never seen a man with such good manners .
probably corresponds to the young lady 's idea of a count .
you might have mentioned you had made her acquaintance .
pray , what did you say ?
who is a thousand times obliged to you .
you do n't say that as if you believed it .
how does one say it ?
i should think that proved just the contrary .
how long had you kown her when this project wa formed ?
you 've been in vevey 24 hours .
that she 's a orror .
she fully intens to .
then i must decline the honour of her acquaintance .
think what , sir ?
that he 's the sort of girl who expects a man to carry her off ?
you 're too innocet .
my dear aunt , i 'm not too innocet .
too guilty , then .
yes .
this is the stupidest evening .
have you been alone ?
she 's gone to bed ?

she does n't see you .

he just ca n't .
he is tiresome .
he would n't even go to that castle .
your daughter has allowed me the honour of being her guide .
or on the boat .
i do n't see ...
we only want to see the principal ones .
we saw several in england .
yes , but chillon is worth seeing .
it seems there is n't anyting she would n't undertake .

do let her go .
you have n't spoken to me for half an hour .
i want you to take me out in a boat .
i got you to say something .
i do n't think so 
i love how he says it .
it would be .
why wait for anything ?
it 's eleen o'clock .
i 'm going on a boat .

i just want a little fuss .
i 'm puzzled .

a mass of towers on a block of boulders .
i have a passion for steamboats .
why are you so solemn ?
i was grinning from ear to ear .
your eas are very close 
come on , let 's be the first ones off .
what 's up here ?
excuse me .
i 'm sure you know all that .
the point was , the castle was n't all constructe at the same time .
between the 9th and 1 3th cycles .
four years .
is that how long you 've been here ?
oubliette .
the casle comletely dominated te pas hrough the alps .
it 's an impression you give .
be careful !
it 's very rotten .
why are you rushing ?
what 's through here ?
look !
wha ?
hello .
l wonder what 's through there .
wait for me .
miss miller !
aen !
do n't forget me .
my goodness .
lord byron carved his name on it .
wrote that poem about him .
it was during the reformation .
here are seven pilars of gothic mould in hillon 's dungeons deep and old
i never saw a man who knew so much !
do n't you wan na teach randolph ?
you 're not in business .
but i do have engagements .
i do n't believe it .
i 'm cold now .
wait for me .

i think you 're horrid !

please sop .
ae n't you ?
at any rate , i will cetainly come .
well , there 'll be a arriage .
you were saying

the fortune hunters are of the inferior sort .
she takes them to such houses as her nose is allowed into .
where is the mother ?
i have n't he leat idea .
slendid .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he sees prodigiously busy .
i find it difficult to take tea .
i think i might go .
whether or not being vulgar is being bad is a question for the etaphysicians .
the 're bad enough to blush for .
who is the portrait for ?
i 'm resenting each one with a copy .
it 's ludicrously expesive .
you stayed here ?
but there are some singular stories about her .
but i 'm not through with you .
hello , mr and mrs johnson .
madame miller .
i want you to meet the sinclair .
hello , miss miller !
i 'm ever so happy to see you !
i 'm so happy to see you .
here 's your mother at last .
and i know you .
i arried today .
we go a bigger place .
i knew you 'd say something .
i hope you 'e been well .
i 've got it , too .
ather 's got it bad .
in schenectady he 's at the very top .
we 'd heard so much about it .
you never were .
we 've seen laces ahead of rome .
it 'll turn around and go the right way some time .
yes .
i 've heard .
se goes round more than i do .
she knows a great many gentleme .
she thinks there 's nothing like rome .
at vevey , you would n't stay when i asked .
he went to geneva .
eugenio will raise something fierce .
delighted to hear it .
a intimate friend .
mr giovanelli .
he wants to know some americans .
he 's tremendously clever .
mother , eugenio 's reall on na raise something .
we 'd better go back .
you go .
i 'm gon na walk round a little .
alone ?
it 's not safe .
give her that medicine .
mrs walker , ou 're too perfect .
i 'm meeting a friend .
is it mr giovanelli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
what a fuss .
if mr winterourne were as polite as he pretends , he 'd offer o walk me there .
i knew her ...
eugenio says we have the best hotel rooms in rome .
i thought it ould be awfull quiet and okey .
i was sure we 'd be going round with one of those old men who explain aout pictures .
i know ever so many people .
i tink i like the english best .
shall we buy some candy for poor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk you back .
i 'm not helping you find him .
i 'll find im .
you sound too imperious .
you should lisen to a gentleman sometimes , the right one .
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen .
here !
ever meet .
not at all .
to america ?
ever ?
never .
i do .
thank you .
mr winterbourne !
mr winterbourne ?
she ask you come .
excuse me .
women follow wherever he goes .
walking with two men .
fifty people have noticed er .
it 's a shame to make a fuss .
or to let her ruin herself .
she 's innocent .
she 's reckless .
the world wil see he 's not running wild .
hello again .
this is he .
this is mrs walker , who so sweetly asked you to her party .
i 'm not five years old .
come in here and i will tell you .
i do n't think i want to know .
gracious me !
if this is improper , i 'm improper .
have a lovely ride .
all right 
your honesty 's only put her off .
she meant no harm .
that 's what i thought a month ago .
sitting in corners with mysterious italians .
dancing all evening with one partner .
receiving callers late at night .
he must be edified by what he sees .
we should n't pay attention to servant .
her only fault is to think giovanelli a gentleman , when he 's a poor imitation .
he 's some tird-rate artist .
she 's naturally indelicate .
two days .
that remark about your going to geneva !
i think you should stop .
givig her any further oportunity to expose hersel .
i ca n't do anything as elightened as that .
if you wish to rejoin her ...
as you ish .
finally .
it 's the first ime i 've ever been to a arty alone , especially in italy .
does n't she intend ...
... to faour us with her company ?
daisy dressed efore dinner .
a friend is there , the gentleman she was bringing .
mr giovanelli .
i guess they 'll come before very long .
i 'm sorry she 's coming in tat way .
i o n't peak to her .
i 'm afraid ou thought i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made him go over them .
you are hungry ?
yes .
the siging kept him awake .
i do hope this is the finale .
she 's worked her way over to your old college chum .
they were quite estless there .
we paired off .
that was etter .
he seems more in control of his limbs than you are .
he 'd never dare ask a young italian lady to walk about the streets with him .
what nice girl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flirt only with me .
i would n't flirt with ou .
you 're too stiff .
you say that too often .
if it makes you angry , i 'll say it again .
it does n't exist here .
poor mother .
and neither of us is flirting .
we 're real intimate friends .
i see .
i just love that song 
especially in winter .
your friend has n't moved all evening .
really ?
why do n't you break in ?
she 's a disgrace .
thank you so much .
goodnigh .
i certainly do n't want her to leave them without me .
buonanotte .
that was very cruel .
he never enters my draing room again .
preoccupied , anyway .
you were supposed to come by or me .
i do n't kow what .
miss miller .
do you think so ?
se thiks him the finest gentleman .
expects a commission if the fellow succeeds in marryin her .
i 'm not sure she 's capable of thought .
i certainly see no evidence of it .
she romps on from day to day , from hour to hour , as they did in the golden age .
i can imagine nothing more vulgar .
the little roman .
he 's perfectly espectable .
a lawyer , i think .
but he ca n't really hope to pull it off .
if it is n't mr winterbourne !
good afternoon !
am i interrupting ?
not at all .
mr giovanelli will now sing ...
hurry , mr winterbourne .
eugenio 's taken him and mother to buy shoes .
no , you sing you song .
the most difficult song i never hear .
ever hear .
come on , we 're waiting .
mr winterbourne is getting impatient .
i 'd enjoy that .
then maybe i 'll sing .
here we go .
bravo !
encore !
no , i think e has heard me .
very much .
all rigt .
i thought he was with you .
that boy will be the death of me .
excuse me .
mr giovanelli 's gon na sing for you both .
but they 're always together .
se says she ai n't .
i see .
mr giovanelli has promised to tell me .
of course .
randolph !
looking for e .
mr winterbourne .
you think i go out too much with him .
everyone oes .
you 'll find they do .
they 're not inviting you places .
have n't you noticed ?
i noticed you and that you are as stiff as a ramrod .
i 'm no half as stiff as some .
try going to see hem .
what will they do ?
you know what that means ?
what mrs walker did ?
i would n't think you 'd let people be so unkind .
do you ?
your mother says she believes you 're engaged .
i guess she does .
but since you 've mentioned it , i am engaed .
she wants me to come to geneva .
freddie ?
you did n't say ten words at diner .
i do n't know .
i saw he today .
where ?
she 's certainly pretty .
she 's a mystery .
what ?
yes , i suppose .
she 's carried away with giovanelli .
i do n't think you 'e missed a thin .
ae you sure ?
yes .
how long have you been here ?
well ...
i see .
for myself i have no fear .
but when was mademoiselle ever ...
i was bound to see the colosseum by moonlight .
we 've had the most beautiful time .
i go to see if the couriers are there .
the colosseum is one thing i can rave about .
why are you always so stiff ?
did you believe i was engaged the other day ?
i just came by to say goodbye to my aunt .
and mrs walker , i hope .
she 's over there .
will you ?
i must say i 'm not surprised .
charles .
what do you hear about daisy miller ?
feddie .
she 's always going around at night .
it 's so blasted dark over here , you ca n't see anything unless the moon 's up .
ai n't that ight , eugenio ?
i 'm going .
excuse my coming so late .
i only just heard .
i do wish dr avis were here .
is there aything i can do ?
no , thank you .
i wish radolph would go to bed .
but he 's been very helpful .
it always gets very high before it drops .
daisy spoke of you the other day , quite pleasantly .
half the time she does n't know what she 's saying , but this time i think she did .
i 'm sure i 'm very glad .
he has n't bee ear us since she was taken ill .
i said i would n't give any such message .
she was the most beautiful young lady i never see .
the most innocent ?
the most innocent .
for myself i had no fear .
yes ?
she did what she liked .
she did what she liked .
no .
i 'm convinced .
i 'm sure .
is that some modest way of saying you think she would have reciprocated your affetion , had you shown it ?
that remark you made last summer .
rope him !
me too .
quake of '65 pinched off the veins .
has n't been 10 cents of gold in quake city since .
and the name quake city ?
when you build on the alaveras fault , you expect to be shook up .
ai n't that bad , homer .
planning on settling here ?
if you want to sue , court 's open on tuesdays .
leonard ?
the trouble is , i 'm expecting aluables on the stage 
me neither .
yes .
mayor sharpe ?
onavan !
santa fe , when you sold me the marshal 's horse ?
i was just funning , donavan .
two pairs bets $ 2 .
there 's your two , raise you five .
you ca nt have an inside straight again .
if you claim them for me ,

here 's $ 5 on account , if you want it .
since you have $ 5 , i 'll apply it to your loan at the bank .
it is .
thanks , donavan .
let 's see them .
hit it again !
i do n't believe that .
the good thing about luck is , it changes .
it was n't long they d been gone from the eastern shore
for whom the posses rode
and they called them the apple dumpling gang
quake city .
you can eat at the hotel across the sreet or at the hard times café .
take your stuff .
any breakage in ransit , report it to the icket office .
excuse me !
dusty , my weeklies come ?
they 're in the mail pouch .
right in front of you .
thank you .
for what ?
i am not .
last night you agreed .
clydesdale at your service , sir .
there appears to be an unfortunate misunderstanding about the children .
cut through the fat .
this tin horn agreed to pick up the kids for wintle .
magnolia !
where are the legal guardians of these waifs ?
they 've been shipped here to wintle , their second uncle .
halfway o san francisco , i 'd say .
the stage made eliver to the consignee or his agent .
as soon as we ort this out .
she ca n't wait too long .
take my word for it .
it might be prudent to resolve the more imminent problem forthwith .
all riht , come on .
i 'll show you 
hey !
i 'l be right back .
jus hold on !
right here .
meanwhile , rest assured that the butterfly stage and freight company will make every endeavor to satisfy the problem to the ultimate satisfaction of all concerned parties .
mr. bradley 's lingering illness left him destitute .
anything would be an improvement .
no , i 'd say you had best keep these youngsters or provide for teir safekeeping .
and , donavan , i would n't go on lon rides , if i was you .
covis do nt like to be touched .
nope .
stop !
stop !
it 's a sample .
what 's that ?
it looks like fat .
that 's dinner ?
that 's dinner .
ca n't you make apple dumplings ?
because even if i could , i would n't make them for you or anyone .
bobby !
it s raining on celia again .
then move her !
bobby !
had some extra son-of-a-gun stew .
i 'm merely pointing out that you have a way with children .
yes , they are .
till you find somebody else to take them off your hands .
not like you ad your wife could .
get out of there !
i 'm attached to the little fellows , but i ca n't care for them .
good morning !
but they 're healthy specimens , and tey do n't eat much .
i can explain .
really !
the little girl could help you in the kitchen and scrub your clothes .
good day , sir .
i have a proposition .
ah , the lady of the house !
yuck !
if you could jus ...
mr. donavan !
celia !
deuce , jack , a king .
it 's too delicate .
what is it , bobby ?
i do n't know .
ah

he s afraid we 'll get his laundry dirty .
it looks like a mine .
a mine ?
kings bet $ 10 .

one mirror , $ 300 .
one melodeon .
why is bedtime so early ?
what 's that ?
a cherished token of a lady 's affection 
i 'm sure you 'll understand , belle .
i miht need the investment capital .
if you 'd get the gold in the mine  you could keep the token of affection .
there is no gold .
i do n't have to answer to three whelps who are n't dry behind te ears yet .
what ?
he .
why would he come this way ?
stop trying to think !
why not just tell him to hand it over ?
god poured your bains in with a teaspoon and someone joggled his arm 
i keep telling you , we got no lead and no powder to throw it with !
that 's right .
come on .
this 'll be easier than robbing a bird 's net !
you wait on the roof , i 'll hoot when he comes .
here he is .
i got i .
yes , pa .
i have to stop in here and see some people , magnolia .
where are you off to ?
he 's not getting much out of his food .
yes , back there .
who are they ?
till amos shot stillwell in the leg .
hey 're pretty harmless .
mm-hmm .
i 'm sorry ...
not so loud and a little slower .
no more biscuits and greens !
mr. purvis in the office says it 's on bald hill .
because my head hurts .
why has he got your cherished token of a lady 's affection ?
what did you loe ?
a posse ?
they 're all loaded for bear , too .
we got ta make a decision .
just what do you mean , blaze of glory ?
the jail in santa fe was n't so bad .
what do you say ?
ooks that way , amos .

if we meet again in that big round up in the sy sometime ,

three kids with shovels walk into our hideout !
and you burned my hand !

i am .
it 's just an owl .
tis looks like a good place to di .
you start over there  i 'll dig here .
no .
i 'm not !
it wo n't stand stil .
bobby ?
are we trapped ?
there must be another way out .
the cas deposit will be in the children 's name .
i just wanted to be sure that their interests are protected .
we 'll see that the nugget is well taken care of .
can we touch it ?
sorry , that 's as close as you get .
act natural !
i figure that if it 's worth $ 87,000 , it 'll weigh close to ...
yeah , but ...
got a match ?
did he ?
see ?
and make arrangements for the kids .
a lot of people are anxious to take them to their bosoms .
no shortage of applicants .
there 's my darling !
let me have her !
let go , you 'll hurt her !
this is a private party .
it 'll be decided later a the hearing .

see what i mean ?
there 's always mis clydesdale .
but she 's not married .
well , who can you get ?
i now , but dusty ?
she 's a fine specimen of womanhood .
i saw her get caught in a cloudburst once , and i can tell you ...
if we go to mrs. stockley  will she hit us ?
when mr. stockley gets mad , he uses words i never heard before .
you wo n't be thrown in the river !
o n't worry .
if celia gets pneumonia , i 'll take care of her .
that you gave away .
three little swindlers , you mean !
okay , come on .
amos ?
amos !
yeah ?
it 's too long to get out this way 
you get one end , i 'll get the other .

soon as we get across , it 'll be al downhill .
you 're going to bust it !
do n't do that !
my spur 's caught !
get off !
maybe you should see if the front door 's open .
great scheme .
agreed .
what do you get out of this arrangement ?
and that 's all ?
do you mean ...
exactly .
nothing more .
i give my word as a gentleman .
but it 's the best i can do .
are you calling or folding ?
al right , i 'll go along with it .
the sooner you leave this town , the better .
it ' going to be daylight before we get in .

thank you , your honor .
and bring your own rope .
the hardware 's closed .
dummy .
how can you be hung without a rope ?
then they 'll deserve it .
i want to get them out of town for good 
staring at a bank through a spyglass wo n't make us richer .
worried about the sheriff ?
with a down-home sheriff , you get a town full of vigilantes .
we could be walking into a hornes ' nest .
we got to get the gold some ime 
i did n't ride 200 miles just to look at the scenery .
is your leg hurtig again ?
always acts up on me , every time the weather changes .
i 'll tell you one thing .
homer , can we talk with you ?
as barber , sheriff or judge ?
two bits .
now get , before i fine you for loitering .
they 'll get a square deal and a good home .
you 're like ice cream and whiskey 
you 'd be man and wife , like any couple , and nobody could say different .

i 'm here to claim them .

it would please thi court to ee both of you run out of town !
give me that !
they 're yours , wintle .
you and that jackleg get out of here before the cour gets contemptuous .
exactly how much does this nugget weigh ?
356 pounds , without the crate .
i assume you have a lot of men protecting it .
there 'll be extra guards from marysville tomorrow .
i see .
being a man of the cloth , it can do no harm .
e 're taking it out when the bank closes at 4:00 tomorrow .
they wo n't be going by the regular route but over china grade .
i imagine that they 'll not encounter so much as a horn frog on that road .
however , i would be happy to accept this as a contributio for te poor .
i seem to have left my purse at the ofice .
hi , dusty !
we must have set a record .

remember , everthing quiet , calm , inconspicuous .
that brazen creature .
right in broad daylight !
a strange man just went into the house with patti .
so what ?
this man was nicely dressed .
that 's the way plumbers dress now .
do you have any riends ?
i 'd prefer a room on the second floor , actually .
uh-huh .
what did you say ?
ah , dc .
that 's his favorite spot .
this is the informat , as we say down at the office .
good , good kitty cat .
does n't seem to like me , does he ?
i guess that 's a bad sin , the kind of people
that animals do n't like ?
wha are you oing to do ?
bless you .
you 're catching a terrible cold .
you want me to get you something ?
it 's just a light alery i have around c ... c ...

there you go .
oh , yes .
uh ...
there we go .
come on , dc , cooperate .
come on , dc , you 're working for the fbi now .
there .
there .
we ca n't see him properly .
here 
back under the bed .
i should 've taken the pawprints first .
sure , if you want to lose a hand .
the bureau has spent $ 19,800 of the taxpayers ' money training me for emergencies .
well , you are a very brave man .
al right , when i count three  we 'll both grab him at the same time .
but move fast .
one , two , three .
oh , dc .
i 'm afraid you underestimate me .
we shall proceed wit the pawprinting .
all right .
what 's that ?
ink ?
ca n't we do that in the bathroom ?
oh , sure .
let 's go .
do n't ake such a fuss , dc .
sorry about the washing .
it s okay .
i guess i 'll put the pawprint in the space for the thumb .
i ca n't hold him any longer .
here we go , now .
yes , and he has kitchen privileges , and he 's as easy to get rid of ...
try to get rid of him .
just keep him away .
okay , tiger , it 's either you or me .
patti ?
yes ?
what kind of a get-up is that to go surfing in ?
well , patti , are you all right ?
can i help ?
it 's all right .
wat was what ?
that bloodcurling scream .
canoe , will you please go ?
i 'm sorry .
oh , do n't be silly .
he 's having a bath .
all right .
if you wo n't go to the beach , i 'll make myself a sandwich .
yeah , except on the card .
the word is move , and move swiftly .
we 're gon na follow an inforant whose information may or may not be reliable .
okay , here 's the physical .
name of the informant :
siamese .
sex :
seventeen pounds ?
exactly .
black streaked with tan and white .
you did say fu ?
correct .
you want us to follow a cat ?
they climb trees and phone poles .
wither he goest , you will go .
i 've got an ol dog who 's a lot better a tracking cats than i am .
we do n't have time for comments .
okay .
when the informant leaves , it 'll be our job to contain him loosely , within a moving , fluid perimeter .
it 's important he does n't become aware of us as tis might alter his regular nocturna behavior .
hold it .
who do you thik you 're kidding ?
what do you mean ?
you think i do n't know
you do ?
i did n't come in from stupidsville on last night 's bus .
hod it .
do n't double-talk me .
that 's all .
i do n't care if it 's pocahontas .
what 's wrong with her ?
the old batle-ax knows we got a dame up here 
she heard her talking .
i told her it was your mother .
i told you a million time  the v .
why private ?
please .
all right , all right .
go in the kitchen and get a glas of water .
and stand by the sink , where i can see you .
whee ?
back of a store , where they dump trash .
anyway , i do n't like boies .
listen , dan anything else i play it your way , right ?
she goes .
all right .
but not until later .
you sure your sister wo n't mind us using her room ?
spires , this is control .
sweet and clear .

in the alley , about 30 feet from the randall back gate .
let me know which way he turns .
about three minutes to go .
affirmative .
uh , no , not anymore .
as you very properly pointed out today , a woman 's life may depend on what we do .
i 'm sorry .
do you want me to leave ?
maybe that would be best , yes .
i only thought if dc happened to wake up and find a strange man in the bedroom ...
i just do 't know how he 's go na take it .
uh , you 've got a point here .
raham , are ou settled in ?
if the inormant goes west , you 've got him .
i 'll give you a new positio .
the informant .

he 's interested in something on the second floor .
let 's start pulling in our perimeter .
kely , move down eighth to the building .

i have to ask you to be quiet .
spires , start your car and move towards the location with you lights off .
back away from that window .
informant 's on the move again .
he 's proceeding north on eighth street the way he came in .
i love dc , but he can drive you up the wall sometimes .
dozens ?
informant 's crossing main .

just go wash them
not enough , indeed
two sweeties

bro bajie
bro bajie
since the karma of weal and woe is predestined why worry yourself sick , madam ?
i was forced to marry into the purple
many people died
there was a rumor that i brought on the disaster to their village
i as seen as a demon
to honor the gods
but later i survived
so you can say passing time is not necesarily a good cure pain comes from stubbornness
it loos hard to overcome but , as long as ou take a bold step forward
i 'm sure you can do it as well
you ca n't bluff my eyes with your disguise
wan na go ?
come on out
i 'm sure i 'll find you soon
she died
it was too wrong .
master , help me
master
your sin of killing is oo much
if i let you get away with it like thi it 'll be a disaster for the world
that damned monkey was too fierce
trouble ?
are you going to use this incantation o keep me under control ?
we only believe what can be seen in our eyes
now i understand wy te buddha made the two of us together on this journey
what pulls us together is this journey of 36,000 miles for the scriptures
bu i hope you believe that every time i recite the incantatio
please help save my daughter
can someone save her ?
exacfly
the kingdom of cloud was prosperous
she feeds on these young kids
pleae rise , your majesty
amitabha .
guard his majesty !
repeat it
eat him now if you can
i 'm here for you
let 's talk outside
of you ?
master
do n't hurry
out with it
e are oth demons of the same kind
that 's why e should help each other
what can you help me with ?
your hoop looks nice on you
you can keep it if you like
why not ?
go ahead
look at this monkey
he has to do whatever is told by his master
white bone spirit
let me be the bad guy
please calm down
sun wukong gets in the way
so , as long as she tackles that monkey we 're sure to have a chance
wukong , are you alright ?
no way
do you really want to enlighten this demon ?
i ca n't leave a single life unenlightened on this journey
i can never make myself assured even though i can make it through to he scripture
i can never feel assure
it 's a style
do you know what you 're supposed to do here tonight ?
i 'm here
again ?
wukong , why are you ere ?
do n't fool around here
yeah
lady white if you have guts have a good fight with me
fair enough ?

whatever
listen , i can give up everything
but !
we 'll see
someone help !
i 'm stuck
where 's the monk ?
i wonder where
now it 's your tur
this is your karmic rewar
even the buddha can not extinguish human 's evil within
this sort of person is more vicious tha demons
now .
if it were n't for him , kiling all the way with his cudgel you could go nowhere !
wha merits and retribution are you looing to ?
every word you say is nonsense and every step you take coul kill
by what right ?
holy monk , please wait
the folks of our kingdom will be grateful for your kindness forever
please accept our gifts
thanks for saving my life
i 've said
she 's a demon
are you okay , sweetheart

big brother
big brother !
master !

you are .. an unsympathetic , unfaithfu jerk !
i 've long been putting up with you
yes !
bro ha , hit his face !
the horse is yours
draon horse , le 's go to save master
because if i eat you , i can become an imortal demon
i want no reincarnation .
i hate being a human
in this case what happened in your previous life ?
that 's just a story about my previous life
do n't think you 're different from those who had left me on the lone cliff
hatred can only give birth to hated
why must you be so had on yourself ?
stop enlightening me
wukong .
even if you get back to your place today that is not your final destination
big brother
do n't be afraid , everyone
only you can save master , big brother
look how young he is and how old you are , hu ?
a branch can be ... easily snapped ... snapped without efort while en branches are unbreakable together
if the four of us are united and bound we will reach the west and fetch the scripure for sure
what shall i do ?
you tell me !
wukong
golden cicada has waited for nine lifetimes before you 're available to be his disciple in this life and you 'll be rectified and led to buddhism
am i at fault ?
i 'll still be waiting here , okay 
i hope my death can take away your stubbornness
who is it ?
evil monkey !
bro sha , you go !

buddha

when you 're a mom on the other side of 40 ,
sometimes , you ust ca n't help but wonder ...
like , what if i 'd taken that internhip
being a mother is not all that different
juggling all those little details that nobody really notices .
where you learn to tell the difference between a real problem ...
still making sure everyting gets done .
one day , you each a point
where your isight and experience are appeciated ,
david sarlo asked me to the dance !
he s so cute !
at first , i thought he liked avery , but then jenna told sophie that he liked me ...
that can only be nurtured over the years by listening .
but that 's where the similarities end .
you never retire from being a mother .
not to mention the driving lesons ,
it wa spring of her senior year ,
and she suddenly ...
grew up .
they 'll always need you
well , that just might tur out to be the hardest art of the job .
happy birthday , carl .
vegan !
besides , you need to get home to your baby .
and besides , i ive right next door , so i can literally be there in two seconds if they need me .
thank you for everything you did for my arty .
it was so much fun .
can i go ?
thanks .
love you .
oh , and happy birthday .
and to think i was worried you would n't have anything to do tonight .
i just hate to see you alone on your birthday .
troy .
di n't know you wee stopping by .
yeah , i was , um ...
just until next payday .
you really need to manage our money more responsibly .
yeah , i also aways say
i o n't be sendin you money every tie you blow through your monthly allowance once you 're in college .
thank you for playing .
better luck next time .
i really learned an important lesson today .
thanks , aunt lauren .
you know 
if you 're a baseball player
if you 're a parent with that same batting average ,
all you can think about is where you went wong .
maybe there should be .
i brough a centerpiece from the store .
tis all looks deliious .
well , that 's kind of the idea .
hey , did you get an invite for the bloggers event at the community arts center ?
i do n't know ...
i 'm a little distracted right now .
well , ou know , sadie goes off to college , you have some time to maybe , you know , live it up a little ?
carly , it 's been 14 years since jeff walked out on you , and you 've done a wonderul job raising sadie , but it 's springtime
i need to see your throat again , so can you open our mouth , like , real wide ?
mm-mm , no .
can ou open your mouth real wide like a big old shark , aout to take a bite ?
no ?
what do you want to be ?
yeah .
can you just ...
good morning .
would you send conner 's swab over to the lab , and see how fast they get back to us with resuts ?
tracy , are you still at the same address over in deehurst park ?
same address .
me and conner .
he 's there practically every morning .
maybe .
i wan na play , i wan na play , i wan na play ...
okay , yeah , souns good .
sure you wo n't change your mind about dinner ?
troy , you here ?
i love he way you look at me
until you 'd smile ...
best chicken tacos in town .
i 'll try the chicken taco .
thank you .
falling deeper for you
just like a clock sriking midnight
deeper for you
no one else could see
all right , conner , let 's go in here 
i wan na go to the par !
now !
come on , conner !
come on ..
you do n't want a snack ?
come on , buddy ...
conner , come here !
no .
you know , i might have some binoculars in the back , if you think that would help ?
in the park .
the ... the food truck , next to the flowers .
right , yes !
you saw that , huh ?
kind of worth it .
so , um .. flowers .
good nose .
that 's wy i came in here this orning , to , uh , try some of your finest spring flowers .
well , that depends .
but i this a specia occasion ?
possibly ?
oh , no , i think it 's probably more of an ordinary occasion .
hey , have a really orinary day .
that sounds perfect .
amen .
and with suc pleasant company , too .
i ca n't believe we have n't already met .
yeah , right .
um ... sure .
then one day , out of the blue , you meet somebody , and right off , bam !
especiall in spring .
everything is growing , and so ... full of life .
it ... it 's ...
the cicle of life !
so , hery ,
wel , i would n't say popular .
she 's just being modes .
i never touch alcohol .
i live next door , you really do n't have to walk me home .
a gentleman always sees a lady to her door .
oh , believe me , henry , that 's not what i would call you .
wh should the shadows come ?
wh should my heart be lonely
oh ..
yes !
i ca n't believe that we finally bumped into each other .
i do n't think he gives conner the attention that he needs .
eat your food .
i want yours .
do you mind ?
no , i want mustard !
he really thrives on the hands off , instinctive parenting approach that besie mom talks about in her blog .
i 'm sorry , who ?
it 's all about how to be a sesitive , emotionally available parent to your child , without setting a lot of rules or boundaries .
betie mo ?
more like beastie-mom .
let 's see ...
vegan ?
speaking as a single dad with a teenage son ,
of course , i always try to lean from oter people 's mistakes .
a .
silly ?
pretty .
dear jugglin dad ,
try it .
you 'll be amazed what a difference it makes .
yeah , do n't have an answer for that , do ya ?
just writing my blog .
do n't go weird on me , mom .
tere comes a time when we must ask ourselves , what is at the heart of our duty as a parent ?
i still ca n't believe henry went for it .
to be true to themselves ...
mom , i was thinking , maybe i should n't go straight to college after i graduate .
i should see the world a little first .
travel ?
or maybe indonesia ?
that sounds exciting .
she was completel oblivious to the fact that her son was terrorizin the enire restaurant , including me .
that 's the thing about woen with kids , it 's a package deal .
simon , look at me .
you look happy-ish .
i do n't need lauren setting me up .
with those bright eyes and that cute smile , are you kidding ?
half the women who bring in their kids just want to give you a big hug and a warm meal .
come on , i 'm being serious .
especially if you get your parenting advice from bestie mom .
not what .
it ' a mommy blog .
you know about this ?
of course i do .
nothing wrong with the wa we were raised .
something you might want to keep in mind .
what does that mean ?
we had it al figured out , two years of community college , then she transfers to university to get her degree .
well , i ca n't do that .
our relationship has always been built on mutual respect and understanding .
this incredibly arrogant father who 's been posting on my blog .
well , i can hardly wait to read it .
just as soon as i figure out what i 'm gon na say to sadie .
the way i see it ,
but sharing with your child keeps those doors open to a future you can build together .
ello , bestie mom .
if this blog of yours doe n't work out ... you have a great future in comedy ...
seriously ?
your problem is ,
well .
if you do n' know the difference
it 's called passion ...
aybe not ...
do n't bother .
you wo n't get an answer from me .
okay , so what was wrong with that last pair of jeans ?
i want them to ook good on me .
listen , i was thinking about what you were saying about traeling , and i think we should talk aout it .
how did those daisies work out ?
um ...
andy .
you too .
chemistry class , right ?
i 'm good .
what are you fellas shopping for today ?
oh , running shoes for , um ...
all right , we 'll be back .
uh ...
what about sadie ?
now ... we 're talking .
yeah .
she passed away when troy wa seven .
and we talk , but ... well , we ...
i guess we grunt our meaning across , you know ?
i know wha you mean .
lately ... not so much .
i shouted upstairs to troy to ask what he wants for dinner , and , um ... he texted me back .
troy ' dad .
oh , i , uh ...
no .
you obviously ike him .
he seems like a nice enough guy .
so , what 's the problem ?
i have troy 's number , so we can hook you two up .
i 'm not going to try to talk you out of it .
just think about it , anything could happen .
he 's waiting .
thanks for the ride , mom .
sadie ..
have fun .
i love you , too , babe .
when she 's thousands of miles away ?
not to mention what a bad idea it is
for her to put off starting school .
hot ?
in a strictly pg kind of a way .
people like that need to be called on the carpet once in a while .
on the other hand , eeting somebody would n't be so bad either .
okay , but you ca n't tell lauren .
simon , i 'm serious .
we really seemed to hit it off .
go for it .
my man .
you , uh , you going somewhere ?
dad , i 'm guessing it 'll be thursday next week .
dad , seriously ?
everyone else can stays out till 11:00 .
all right .
goodnight , uncle simon .
in a situation like this ,
and that somebod is you .
like i 'd take advice from you ?
i even hae a suggestion
but she 'll be in school , and is n't that wha you want ?
what i want is what 's best for my daughter .
i do n't get it .
she 's trying to break out and be her own person .
i mean , we all did it .
i 've neer eld her back , i 've never set a bunch of rules .
it is not fun .
i 'm definitely sensing some chemistry between te two of you .
like telling sadie exactly what you think ?
oh ...
what ?
when ?
wait , who is he ?
oh , uh , okay .
okay .
yeah .
no ...
i mean , uh ...
enjoy this wonderful spring weather .
actually , i was hoping for something a litle less ordinary .
i was hoping so , yeah .
for example , if it ' , like , a date , then roses would be nice .
that is the general gist of the ... direction i was kind o headed in .
i 'm sorry , i 'm not doing this very well ...
no , no , you 're doing great .
okay .
tacos sound perfect .
i 'll be there .
it 's a date .
bye , carly .
oh , uh ...
someone ?
troy 's dad .
yeah , all right , mom .
you 've obviously got to look good , but you ca n't look too good , because you 've got ta leave somewhere to go fashion-wise , if there ' a second date .
i m in high school , this is what we do .
tell me , what are we doing , whee are we goig ?
eah , if you want to go off to a strane country , where you do n't speak the language or know the local customs , then who am i to stand in your way ?
yeah .
not even me .
yeah , that s ...
i 'm really proud of you .
whatever you say , dad .
i have a date .
sure , i ...
thanks .
got it 
no roblem 
so those are crocuses walks in the park and these tacos got me through some pretty bumpy times after my husband left .
see , i end up wearing half of mine .
oh , easy  it 's all in he wrist .
i mean , i was n't oing to get anywhere near her .
i 've been known as the teddy bear doctor .
how did you choose flowers ?
well , i knew i could n't keep working an office job 9:00 to 5:00 , and raise sadie alone the way i wanted to , and , well ...
oe of my favorite quotes is by emerson ,
uh , it 's been a while .
oh yeah , thank you .
et 's go one ore time around .
ait , what ?
no , i never said i did n't want to go to college .
that was fun .
i 'd like that .
hand me your phone .
the last time i did this , you had to actualy write the number down .
i would never lose your number .
call me .
it was ... nice .
goodnight .
change your mind ?
uh-huh ?
if i go away to ollege , then i still get to travel , but i m staing in school .
well , thank you , i 'm so lad it helped .
carly ?

i 've known you all your life , little brother , an i 've only seen that smile once before , the day you met your future wife .
do n't know what you 're talking about .
and een if i did n't know you so well , you should realize by now that my husband ca n't keep a secret .
yeah , that 's probabl true .
now , who is she ?
i mean , i just met her and all , so ...
but every time i see her , i ...
this i got ta see .
hi .

buy me a toy !
okay , come on .
would you look at that 
you know , write some sort of a journal , slash , vegan cookbook kind of thing .
what do you think ?
carly 
just checking my messages .
this would n't have anything to do with the guy in the flower shop , would it ?
but it was really fun .
and there was a kiss .
but he said he would call .
oh , honey , it 's still early .
he probably works all kinds of crazy doctor hours , right ?
e 'll call .
you and mr .
floppy were both very brave today .
so , that was our last patient of the day ,
all right , let 's hear it .
first of all , you rush into tha community arts center like those mommy bloggers are rock stars , then you run out like the building 's on fire .
carly ... is bestie mom .
i know .
i mean , ho was i supposed to know
what are you going to do ?
no .
maybe the best thing to do is just walk away .
what ?
that 's te person she knows .
but it ' over now .
just waned to give another shout out to jugglig dad
thanks to you , my daughter 's no loner set on travelin the world .
instead , she 's decided to go away to school .

a long as it 's not here .
but that 's not your problem .
did you know there 's a great humanities program in anchorage ?
i ha no idea .

there was n't enough room to write all the things i wanted to say .
yeah .
i have n't felt this way abou anyone in a long time , and i ...
what was i supposed to hink when you just disappeared like that ?
i know .
it ' no excuse , and i would n't blame you if you told me to hit the road , but ... if you 'd give me one more chane ?
i want to stay ma at you longer .

i was scared , too .

i tried .
ouch .
to be honest , i do n't know what i 'd say  if she did let me talk to her .
i 'm sorry would e a nice start .
i do n't know why she 'd give me another second chance .
maybe she just needs some time to sort herself out .
no , it 's too late .
you know the rules .
home by 10:00 .
yeah , but , uh ...
i kind of have a situatio ...
troy , hey !
is that clear enough for you ?
you know , ad , sometimes , i just ca n't believe you .
they 're te same person .
oh , okay , so then he 's also a kind , funny , intelligent , goo-looking man .
well , maybe he had a good reason .

i do n't want her to worry .
well , she 's your mom 
about me , about my going away to school .
well , it 's a big decision .
i mean , you 've got to find a schoo that 's right for you , right ?
your mom 's a prety smart lady .

if you found one you liked , you could probably come home on weekends whenever you wanted .
she 's going o be fine 
she 's got a mild form of pleurisy , which is an inflammation around the lungs .
i 'm even more sorry that i did n't take your advice .

okay , ell , listen  i 've been thinking , as long as you 're feeling up to it , maybe we should , u , plan a little road trip next weekend .
you ca n't decide where you want to go if you have n' seen them for yourself .
that woul be great .
it 'll give me a chance to really plan out my next stes , you know ?
morning , everybody , and welcome to the 5th annual mom blogger symposium !
we have bloggers here from every corner of the world .
are you guys excited ?
and we want to hear what 's on ou ind .
thank you , karisa , for giving me a moment of your time .
i now everyone here is probably busy , so i promise this will just take a second .
y name is andy sommers , but some of you might know me better as ...
juggling dad .
yes , i 'm that guy , who , uh ... who thought he was qualified enough to tell everyone else the right way to be a parent .
afte meeting her in person , it did n't take very long before i was falling for her .
but after some of the things that juggling dad had said , or ritten online 
i was scared that she might not like andy after she found out we were the sae person .
so , i did n't tell her .
and that was bigges mistake i 've ever made .
that 's why i 'm here today .
i was never been happier than when i was with you .
go ...
carly , you once told me that yellow roses were for fiendship and red meant i love you .
i 'll let you decide .
can i have both ?
all right , mom !
way to go , dad !
no , you do n't .
there 's no place like home
be it ever so humble
how do you do ?
nice of you to drop by me humble abode .
my name is bunny .
what started all this chasing ?
when was the very first chase ?
in order to answer that question ... e 'l have to swing back in tie a little bitty bit .
quite dark , too .
anyway , noboy complained , which was odd ... until you realized that there was n't nobody around to complai .
until one day ... very deep in a sixth-rate galax called the milky way ... circling around a fourth-rate star called the sun ... on a tenth-rate planet , a strange creature appeared .
and the first domesticity and the first boredom .
what 's on the all tonight , dear ?
but after about 25,000 years of this ... and having developed severe cricks in their necks ... man and woman became bored again ... even with all those brilliant , ultamodern , inovative ideas ... like he first motion-picture cameras .
and then one day ... another strange and historic creature appeared .
me .
fathers like tedd pierce ...
warren foster ... and mike maltese , who wrote most of me biography .
and , o course , a father named mel blanc ... who had thousands of voices ... and was nice enough to give me one of them 
an animation director ... who goes by the unlikey name of chuck jones .
and old chuck seemed determined ... to get poor little old me into outer space , too .
i 'l never mix radih juice and carrot juie again .
the hole seems ong this morning .
holy cow !
why , the sun ai n't even out yet .
no wonder i 'm so sleepy .
what was that ?
where the heck am i , anyways ?
at long last , my drea come true .
i wan na ask you something .
the earth will be gone in just a few seconds .
no point in wasting money on a flying saucer ... when the earth 's not gon na ...
pardon me again , doc , but just what did you mean ... by that crack aout the earth bein gone ?
i 'm going to blow it up .
it obstructs my view of venus .
now , i shall have to create more martians .
my illudium pu-36 explosive space modulator .
boy , it 's really wonderful to be back in civilization .
run for the hills , folks , or you 'l be up to your armpits in martians .
but other people , if you want to call a duck people ... had close encouters with that little martian , too .
as the ensuing , gripping ... and nerve-tingling drama now demonstrates .
i have sent for you , dodgers , because we are facing a crisis .
now , we have reason to believe ... that the only remaining source is on planet x .
and you want me to find plane x , is that it ?
can you do it , dodgers ?
indubitably , sir .
because there 's no oe knows his way around outer pace ... like duck dodgers ... in the 24th and a half century !
oops !
then , west in an astro-arc deviation to here .
then by space-navigable compass to here , here ... and then to ere and here ... by 13-point stratocumulus bearing four million light-years ... and thus to our destination .
now , do you know how to reach planet x ?
oh , sure .
i wish you 'd explain it to me sometime , buster .
that 's ridiculous .
gad !
and there just ai n't room enough on this planet ... for the two of us .
you may fire wen ready , grizzy .
who ?
what ?
where ?
when 
how ?
who ?
who ?
what ?
just when i had him going , you had to butt in .
get back in that spaceship .

i remember well the first time he tried to sell himself ... as the logical successor to errol .

or will it ?
eat your heart out , burt reynolds .
i will come to you and fulfil my gracious promise and bing you bac to this land .
he is the king of babylon , ruler of the four quarters of the earth ,
kurus , in the old persian tonue .
he is cyrus the great .
who are you , old man ?
i am daniel of the tribe of benjamin , made captive nearly 70 years ago by nebuchadnezzar .
he served darius well after he captured the city in your name .
the beasts would not touch him .
i know who you are no .
you wil give us entertainment while we eat .
the palace will be there in the morning .
my king , the hebrews eat and drink only their own food which is prepared according to their rituals .
cyus :
ou pomised me a tale , four , in fact .
when i was just a boy , he threw down the assyrian empire , my people 's ancient nemesis , but the destruction of isael 's enemies brought us no relief because in the 3rd year of nebucadnezzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with tears , for you , lord , are righteous , yet we rebeled against your command .
male # 3 :
as do i .
i have only begun my studies , but here .. the prophet , jeremiah , son of hilkiah , has written that we shall serve the king of babylon for 70 years --
daniel :
as punishment for our sins .
and even if we were to urvive it , we would be very old .
you are summoned for your meal .
why would they only take 10,000 of us and leave the rest of our people behind ?
yes , look a who they 've taken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest can easily be governed .
they ve changed our names , hoping we 'll forget our god ;
et it here .
where is it from , ad how was it slaughtered ?
the catle are from the king 's herd .
the swine are from the king 's pens .
e are forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has commanded us ,
you are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses .
but the king can not he will not change the customs of his hall to fit your wishes .
you must know this .
and we will not ask him to .
i have been charged with your well-being .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , the king , will do .
and we would not wis it so .
for 10 days give us nothing but vegetables to eat and mater to drink .
cyrus :
i have no doubt the lord favorably disposed his heart to hear our request .
and we emained un-defiled .
were presente before nebuchadnezar himself .
the king 's executioner , arioch , will be in the chamber .
they are belteshazzar , shadrach ,
you have destroyed nineveh the mighty , seat of assyria , and taken from her hand the scepter of nations .
why should i allow you , sons of my former enemies , to serve in my court ?
because you ave spared the lives of our people who were delivered into your hand and because the word of the prophet jeremiah has come unto us saying ,
the god of israel , says to all those
pray to the lord for it  for if it prosper , you too will prosper . '
this is good .
i wil speak only the truth , and when you would ot hear it , you must ask me nothing .
have their names e written in the book of the wise .
male # 2 :
if they can be trusted .
daiel :
trusting the words of the orace of delphi ,
were uable to help him .
no !
command , and it is done .
i need to know hat it means .
oh , king , tell your servants your dream , and we will interpret it for you .
astrologers who read nothing in the stars .
it is up to you to discern and interpret them .
but , my lord , if only ou would tell us your dream we could interpret it , as we have always done .
i know you 're trying to gain time or trick me into revealing what i 've seen .
either may i 'll have none of it .
no king has ever asked such a thing before .
why do n't you come along ith me and ask him yourself ?
speak .
daniel :
i have eard your decee , and i understand that i shall fall beneath the blae if your dream is not made known and interpreted .
the sentence is to be carried out at sunrise .
you may withdraw so long as you return at daw , as your fate and that of the others is one i the same , and when you return be sure to bring your companions with you .
shall i send guards along , my king ?
eve if we were to flee the city the whole world would 've been against us , not that it mattered
i had given my word and intended to kee it .
oh king , live forever .
daniel 
belteshazzar , your death is upon you as well unless you know my dream and can inerpret it .
praise be to the god of my fathers forever and ever .
he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge o the discerning .
he reveals deep and hidden things and has ade plain all that you have aked , for he has shown me the vision of the king .
then speak !
the head of the statue was made of pure gold , its chest and arms of silver , its belly and thighs of bronze , its leg of iron , its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold were all broken to pieces at the sae time , and the winds swept them away without a trace , but the rock that struck the statue became a mountain
you have done what i was told was impossible .
you know my dream as if you dreamt it yourelf .
what does it mean ?
you , oh king , are the king of kings .
after you , another kingdom will rise , inferior to your .
and in the time of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold 90 feet high .
live forever !
as your dutiful servants , we know the law that when the horn sounds we all bow down .
none .
wise man :
they neither worship you gods or serve the image of gold you 've created .
nothing .
is this true ?
do you refuse to worship my statue ?
then you shall be thrown into the furnace , and no guard will save you from my hand .
let the furnace be heated sevenfold .
but now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has not harmed your bodies .
you were willing to give up your lives ather than serve any but your own god .
daniel :
and for a time all was well until nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was troubled yet by another dream .
before i was born , my grandfather , astyages , was troubled by a dream where a floo beginning nea his throne was overflowing the whole earth .
e did n't learn until 10 years later ta the boy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned the boy and restored him to his rigtful parents , and for a time the matter was forgotten .
daniel :
old astyages , he knew of the prophecy , but he was powerless to overcome it .
for when he dreame that great dream , his enchanters , sorcerers , and astrologers were one again unable to inerpret the vision .
the images i saw terrified me .
the beasts of the field ook selter under it , and the birds of the air lived in its branches , and from it every creature was fed .
tri off its branches .
strip its leaves .
but let the stump and its roots 
this is the ream that i ad .
you have become great and strong .
but you saw a messenger , a holy one , coming own from heaven , saying ,
while its oots remain in the ground .
let him live like wild animals .
you will eat grass like cattle until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wises .
therefore , oh kig , be pleased to accept my advice .
renounce your sins by doing what is right and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed .
seek the lord while he may e found , and it may be that your prospeity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often short , and 12 months later when the king was waking on the roof of the roal palace of babylon -- of babylon --
nebuchadnezzar :
i 've placed upon the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised mountain high .
is this not the great babylon that i have built as my royal palace with my mighty power or the glory of my majesty ?
daniel :
go now from thi kingdom which you claim .
because he insisted on being more than he was ade , he became less than he was made .
even in his insanit neither the lion nor the bear disturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept naked in te places where they found their food because it had been prophesied tha one day he would honor the most high .
honor and glory to im who lives forever .
rise , nebuchadnezzar .
before him all the people of the earth are regarded as nothing .
he may do as he pleases with the powers of heaven and all the people of the earth , and no one , no one , may say him , nay .
and so nebuchadnezzar returned to his throne , ut eventually he was gathered to his fathers , and a series of new kings came to the throne , none fasting more than a short ime .
well , at last we come to the pan of the tale where i have some nowledge o share .
for though i had conquered from east to west ,
i was enough to freeze the heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from whence it came i do not know , like some spirit of god whispered it in my ear .
but the river euphrates which flowed down to bablon raised above its natural leel hemmed in by dams ad dikes , but if dams were opened full and the dikes were broken , the river which ran straight through the heart of the city
and i suddenly realized i 'd been given a key to defeat the mighty babylon .
it was as though in all the world , throughout all of history ,
i was he only one that had the thought .
all it required was the right moment to act .
listen , oh king , and i wil tell of the second king of my story ,
they seem quite concerned about this , my king .
first , they must build a causeway across the moat .
that alone will take months .
bring me the golden vessels from the temple of jerusalem .
but , my king  is it wise to use the vessels ?
y king , these cups are considered sacred , are they not , my king ?
but here they are spoil for our gods , and they would have you use them as i see fit .
bring them !
a judean once told nebuchadnezzar , your forefather , of his dreams 
he succeeded when everyone else had failed .
i a told you are able to give interpretations and olve difficult problems .
if you can read the writing on that wall , you will be clothed in purple , have a chain of gold placed around your neck , and be made tird highest ruler in the kingdom .
oh king , the most high god gave your father , nebuchadnezzar , greatness and glory , but when his heart became arrogant he was deposed from his throne an stripped of his glory until he acknowledged that the most high is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of heaven .
would you humble the almighty by desecating his possessions ?
would you bind him like a captive and beat him like a slave ?
this is his answer to you .
mene , god has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end .
upharsin , your kinom is divided and given to the medes and persians .
thus says the lord , your line is ende .
our rule is over .
ls tere nothing to be done ?
will the least of your slaves comfort you , or will they desert you , seeking to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldiers together :
i am king belshazzar of he babylonia .
as he has commanded , i shall assume the crown .
you ae darius , the mede-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem taken this ity .
by right of conquest , you are now the king .
yes , and you are an official of babylon .
it is a reward for lettig belshazzar know that you were about to take the city .
he read the inscription and reveaed the message .
he told the king that he would die this very night .
daniel :
if i was to lie , would this be the lie i would choose ?
and how could you hae done so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i will speak to you honestly , my king , and when you would not ear the truth you must ask me nothing .
so be it .
yet i shall name you one of the three .
if they were loyal to the former master , they are no good to me .
cyrus :
he 's twice my unle by blood and marriage ad serves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yes .
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once he is in charge he 'll be looking into everything we do .
perhaps we should eliminate him .
how ?
he does n't hunt .
a sudden illness or a drownin .
who would believe it ?
here is no corruption in him nor any negligence .
there s a spirit of excellence in him .
no one is that hoest .
i had a man try to bribe him once , and a very generous bribe at that .
such a man is dangerous .
ho long before he learns tat we 've been generous with ourselves and covered the thefts with false accounts ?
then perhaps we need to make him stop .
he wo n't do it .
if we could forbid his prayers for an entire month under penalty of immediate execution ?
do 't be ridiculous .
i know him .
the king knows that danie and his people pray continuously and only to one god .
which is hy we need to disguise our pupose .
indeed , they could find nothig amiss in my work , neither willfully nor through negligence or lack of care , so they tried to trip me up wit my prayers .
but since worship of the most high was not prohibited by the laws of the realm , they had to conceal their purpose like poison in a cup of honey .
and have not submitted to your rule .
indeed , we have labored to construct a plan whereby the loyalty of all may be tested .
but what of the gods of peria , my servant , obey ?
how would you enforce such an edict ?
no one would be allowed to o before any altar or shrine for the entire period except for you .
and anyone found violating the ecree would be thrown into the lions ' den before sundown on the very day of the offense .
male conspiraor # 3 :
in a single stroke .
i approve your plan .
in anticipation of you approval , oh king , we have taken the liberty of draftin the edict and bringing it along .
cyus 
and once a law is written , even te king himself can not chage it .
daniel !
the king 's seal is barely dry .
you chose your god over your king .
take him awa !
oh king , it is my sad duty to inform you that someone has already defied your decree .
uard :
bring forth the prisoner .
he ays no attention to you , oh king , or to the decree you have put in writing .
daniel is my chief advisor .
no one is above the law .
bring foth the tablet .
shall be thrown into the lions  den
by my hand and seal , darius the king , ruler of the medes and persians .
knowing the king 's command , i have disobeyed it .
i shall ommand my wise men to make every effort to search out some reason tat the law may be found unenforceable .
let them search , oh king , but only or a short time beause your own law commands that sentence be caried out the day of the ofense .
daniel :
it is as i expected .
a king who will not enforce his own laws can not be a king .
i will walk with you , daniel , one last time .
as you wih , oh king .
my forefather , abraham , ame from this land , and the most high said unto him ,
i will make you into a great natio .
and may yet live to reap the fruits of that curse .
a cup of wine from the king 's own hand .
not so , daniel .
in he cup i have poured no libation .
good bye , my friend .
farewell but perhaps not good bye .
hear , oh irael , lord our god ,
have mercy on me , o god .
no , no , take it away , all of it !
in you my soul takes refuge in the midst of lion , surrounded b ravenous beasts with teet of pears , with tongues as sharp as swords .
come near .
a toast to the lions who show no partiality to a hebrew over any other an .
but tose who seek the lord will lack for no good thing 
daniel !
servant of the living god , has your god been able to save you ?
oh king , live forever .
my god has sent his angel , and he shut the mouth of the lions .
they have not hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the man pay if he steals another man 's treasure ?
with his hands erhaps .
is there any penalty less than death which will do ?
but , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashioned my own words as a snare above my feet knowing my edict could not be reversed , ut the living god , te god o daniel , has elivered him out of my hand .
no !
please wait , king , please !
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he rescues , and he saves .
for 70 years i had waited , and i knew our time was near .
my heart grows with excitement that now that time has come .
belsazzar , the foolish ;
darius , who was deceived .
who is this fourth king ?
it is one chosen by the most high to perform great ad mighty deeds before he as ever knitted in his mother 's womb .
a bird of prey ?
true , i had never saw the regions of the euphrates or further westward until i came in conquest .
and yet you chased your enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i tae hold of-
it mentions me by name ?
to subdue nation before him ,
so that gates will not be shut .
i will go before you and will level the mountais .
and cut trough bars of iron .
please continue .
so that from the rising of the sun
to the place o its setting ,
how else might it be explained ?
daniel :
you have answered your own question , oh king .
tis is what the lord says .
who spread out the earth by mysef ,
and makes fools of diviners ,
and of their ruins , i will restore them . '
i , who was saved by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i was raised in a shepherd 's house .
sevent years since i was taken from the land of my birth .
babylon has been punished .
you have punished her .
only one thing remains :
your god has called me a shepherd , and so to your people i shall be , to rescue them from wolves and tyrants , to gather them gently and to relieve them from bondage and provide for their return .
the lord god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed for me to build a temple in jerusalem in judea .
any one of his people among you , may his god be with you .
let him go to jerusalem in udea and build a temple of the lord , the god of israel-
however , my heart was joyous as my brothers and sisters departed o their journey home while i remained in babylon awaiting the day when i , too , would be gahered to my ancestors .

once upon a time in the land of flutterield , there lived a butterfly fairy named mariposa .
she was the smartest fairy in the land .
then , one day ,
but along the way , they faced peril and danger of all kinds .
mariposa and her friends returned to flutterfield to discover the skeezites attacking the royal palace .
queen marabella hailed mariposa and er friends as heroes , which they are to this day .
hey , mariposa !
hello , mariposa !
hi !
hey , mariposa !
moning , mariposa .
hey , mariposa !
good morning .
excuse me .
yes .
i will , for sure !
bye !
ow come i never get an autograph ?
you must be the most famous librarian eve .
easy , zee .
i 'm right here .
what is it ?
the queen ?
huh ?
of course , your majesty .
the crystal faiies ?
from shimmervale ?
yuck !
huh ?
their land is built on an amaing natural energy source called crystallites , and the crystallites heat and power everything in their realm .
hardly .
you see ?
everyone knows that .
only because that 's what we 've been led to believe .
it 's what s in our fairy tales .
look .
then , the crystal fairy king accused the butterfly fairies of trying to steal their crystallites .
the butterfly fairies denied it , he crystal fairies di 't believe them , and everyone got angrier and angrier until te two sides delared themselves eternal enemies , and vowed never to ave contact again .
where 's the picture of that ?
you wo n't find it .
research , not hearsay .
i 'm convinced .
huh ?
but crystal fairies are dangerous !
willa can manage that .
ah , willa told me i 'd find you here .
hello , carlos .
oh , but you are the smartest fairy i know .
you 've read ever book on shimmervale .
but what if i o n't ?
what if i say or do the wrong thing ?
what if i make things worse ?
and remember , the best way to make a friend , is to be a friend .
hmm .
o !
i almost forgot .
my mother asked me to give this to you .
ooh .
it 's made from the most precious maic of flutterfield .
whenever ou have doubts , just take it out and it wil remind ou of us .
please , thank the queen for me .
bye , carlos .
goodbye !
goodbye !
yes .
uh , what was that thing you said ?

hmm .

mmm-mmm .

including a parade , marching band , and fireworks.

in the name of his royal king regellius , it is my privilege to give you an official tour of our fair and .
welcome to shimmervale city .

follow me .
wait .
historians say thi is where shimmervale 's first resients discovered crystallites .
yup .
it 's why e end the tour here .
and now to the palace  where you 'l be staying .
the castle was built over 4,000 years ago under the reign of king fremulou the fourth .
his wife , queen safrila , designed much of what we still see today .
ah , you 're mariposa , are n't you ?
yes .
i 'm atania .
hey !
there you are .
anyhoo , let 's show you to your room .
ee !
yo !
tah-dah !
tah-dah !
wow !
it 's ...
i decorated it myself .
really interesting .
i based it on everything we crystal fairies know about butterfly fairies .
that was thoughtful .
nah , i could n't figure out how to make it work .
i did put in hidden thorns , though !
please welcome mariposa ,
i introduce king regellius and princess catania of shimmervale !
hey ?
is n't that right ?
in flutterfiel .
let 's repair to the terrace for tea .
hm .
hey !
you almost made me spill my smoothie .

sparkly , like a iece of jewelry , or a lake !
i could n't sleep either .
hmm .
it says here that outsiders are forbidden to touch a crystallite , especially the hearsone , which is the most powerful crysallite in shimmervale .
that 's why the king was so uset at tea .
oh !
i 'll never live that down .
well , it neer really came down to battle.

well , it looks like everyone is busy today .
well , it appears my subjects are preoccupied .

and mother thought two years in art school was a waste of time .
a long time ago , i forget how long , our fairy forefathers built flutterfield on top of a purid swamp .
it says that flutterfield was built on a magnificen and exquisite garden .
yeah .
willa , you 're not supposed to bring the visitors back here .
today will be better , zee .
oh !
the king has asked me to invite you to the annual crystal ball .
crstal ball ?
what 's that ?
just the biggest social event of the year .
i want o thank him for the invitation .

guard 5 :

we 'll be fine !
garrett :

a king would hold a more noble weapon .
a king would hold excalibur .
where 's ruber ?
he has the king trapped inside .
do you think that 's a good idea ?
garrett , garret , on your left !
your other left .
right !
look out !

say hello to your new king .
you 're right .
perhaps i 'm more of a god .
hey , ruber !
ruber :
ruber :
hold your ground until the last possible moment .
two for the price of one .
the stone !
you forgot this .
i dub thee lady kayey .
you have reminded us that a kingdom 's strength is not based on the strenth of the king but the strength of the people .
from this day forward you wil both sit as knights of the round tale .
do nt even think about it .
well done , ayden .
