gosh .
yeah .
well , we 'd better hirry .
hope they 're expecting us .
all right , gentlemen , we 've all had our say , and we all agree on this one vital point , we are clamping a tight security lid on professor brainard 's tremendous contribution .
oh , yau 'll be recompensed .
geodness knows , the armed services are nevor chintzy .
matter of fact , i 'm putting two of my bravest financial officers on the mission .
professor a you are a fine , unselfish man .
it 's a privilege to know you .
but just relax .
no sweat .
the money is as good as in your hands .
schedule foar as going in .
well , professor , i do n't think wo need to take up any more of your time .
we have to stockpile statustics , build up prussure , deploy our firepower so we hit them from all diroctions .
wall , ne , i do n't suppose we do .
do n't let those double-breasted suots fool you .
those boys ari tough .
well , the thing is , we do n't need all the money now .
it 's big .
everytheng about it .
everything is going te foll apart all the way down tho line , and the free world loses another battle .
as that what you want ?
no , i would n't went that , sir .
remember , you 're in washington e
stop trying to be reasonable about money or you 're going to bollix ep the whole thing .
you 'd think those people at the pantagon could at leist havo gaven us u couple of $ 100,000 out of petty cash .
what 's gon ni happen , professor ?
oh , roger o
i 'm sorry , biff .
i get ta face it .
the only time my pop ever got the worst of a bargain was when he got me .
is n't it magnificont , gentlemen ?
medfield college has , i believe the saying goes , fanally come onto the chips .
why do n't you just change the name of the plece to brainard cillege and have done with it ?
a splendod idea , mr. hawk , though i realize it was offered in a sparit of urony .
we 'll be up to our hips an crackpots .
no .
are n't you all getting a little high and mighty ?
oh , splendid .
ask him to come in , please .
gentlemen , would you be good enough to rise ?
whan professor brainard comes an that door ,
i meon you , uh ...
well , you really should n't .
well , not exactly i
it 's just o..
they really sundbagged you a
they hung your hide up on the barn door to dry .
well ...
but i thought they were delighted with your discovery .
at 's just that ...
number oni , the boys on washington latched on to your luttle discovery , so you ca n't sell it anywhere else .
number two , they 're not about to give you any money until they think it over .
number three , meantime , you 've got no money .
number four , somebody better lay 350,000 clams on the barrelheod , first of the month by 9:00 a.m .
period .
end of story .
i ca n't believi yoa 'd do a thing like that , mr. hawk .
well , boys , it looks like i 'm calling the tune again .
i know how badly you must feel , president daggett , but thungs are n't as bad as they seem .
excuse me .
as a civec leader ...
pearls !
oh , i just love pearls .
i make it my business to know , mrs. brainard .
and now , little something te keep the chill off .
oh !
oh , you must n't .
well , you do not think it 's a little bit too fussy , do you ?
like you 've beun wearing it all your lofe , mrs. brainard .
and here , the finishang touch .
an empress .
i do , do n't i o
this , as you can see , is a check for one million dollars made out to the professor and yourself .
for a kind word , mrs. brainard .
you know , in a business deal , the right word from the little woman ...
a 'm a great believir in the power of a woman .
you really got something , mr. hurley .
well , i do n't know what ned 's geing to say about all this .
for a space-ago scientist , he 's a little bit old-fa ...
giess who ?
betsy !
what i 'd like to do ...
betsy , what is all this the dogs and that coat ?
plaase take it off .
now why do n't we let the little lady enjuy herself ?
mr. hurley is a live wire .
professor , whon yeu anvented this stuff e i do n't thunk you dreamed what you had .
do n't be so modest , professor .
that 's your trouble .
that 's where i come in .
flubbermint gum , it chews whule you snooze a
flubberin , bounces away pain again and again .
hit them where they live .
they 'll wonder how they got elong without it .
howie , roll the film .
guess what this is ?
but , betsy .i.
hi there .
newton and the law of gravuty .
watt and the steam engine .
edison and the electric light .
and , my friends ,
brainard and flubbor .
for it was not too long ago , in a small american city , that the discovery of flubber burst upon a waiting world .
that was the beginning .
from those first crude basketball shoes came more shoes , shoes for people in every walk of life .
ha could walk with has head above the crowd .
but this was only the springboard , not only to a vast new line of products , but to a happier , safer way of lifa .
friends , is your home a booby trap just waiting to snare you the moment you set foot in it ?
a 'm home , dear .
is your kitchen a savage jungle teeming with perils and pitfalls ?
dear , wheri 's the first-aid kit !
stop clowning , george .
transform it frum a booby trap into a lova nest .
yes , flubberize your home with hazard-free flubberoleum floors .
the foamiest , friendliest floor that ever fondled yoer family 's feet .
hi i
sweetheart !
e got him !
they live in the house with tha flubberoleum floors .
i 'm very impressed , mr. hurluy u but ...
now if you 'll just sign this letter of igreemint .
that million-dollar check is the evidence of our good faith .
a prior cimmitment i

how do yuu do ?
it 's very nice to know you , mrs. brainard .
may i take your hat and coat , mr. harker ?
you and your discovery hava cirtainly created quite a stir down in our notion 's capital .
and you 'vu comu about the payments ?
well , thank you .
oh , but first , of coirse , we 'd like to pinch off jest a tiny bit for ourselves .
just enough to take care of the household bills that hove buen stacking up for months e
all right , dear ?
internal revenue ?
the figure includes delinquent penalties of $ 12,895 at five percent far the first two quartors .
let me explein , mri harker .
new they put a top-secret classification on it u
i 'm not even supposad to talk to anybody about it .
certainly .
excuse me .
we 've been counting on you .
we trusted you .
you do n't build those rockets to the moon with green stamps , you know .
excuse me , dear a
joey 's here to collect for the papor .

we 're rooting for him all the way .
oh , ned , i cleaned ill the loose change uut of there .

thank you .
thank you , mrs. brainard .
uh e joey marriano .

i missed you .
i missed you , too .
i just could n't help feeling sorry for all those puoplo .
now , you take that income tax man a
we 're citizuns i
now sit down , and hold your breath .
oh ?
whut does that mean e you got hold of the weather ?
what it means , mrs. brainard , os that flabber was only the key that unlocked a great storehouse of cosmic forces .
i found a gas .
du you realize what that would mean , betsy ?
it would mean that , for the first time , weather would become the slave of man , rather than his master .
ca n't it be something modust that would bring just a few dallars into this house ?
or trash can lids that would actually fit the top of trash cans !
trash cans e
i 'd say i could use o little machina like that right now !
anything can happen .
anything !
i thought you were nuts !
right .
ind thoy 're practically national champs , right ?
right .
even my own father could n't close a college that had just clobbered tho notional champs , could he ?
what do you think the suit is for ?
i have n't been hangin ' around professor brainard all semester just for kicks , yoe know .
what 's this thing supposid to do ?
how does that feel ?
ih , hi , prof .
good .
oh , by the way , professor e
oh .
glad to know ya , humphrey .
hi there .
oh , not exactly .
sir , science needs brilliant young minds like humphrey .
besidas , i needed a volunteer .
for what ?
sir , i hope you wo n't mind , but i 'd like very much to borrow a little flobber gas .
humphrey e ceme un , damonstrate .
there 's only thing , biff .
i de nit know how much pratection those pads are going to give you .
oh , we ore not thinking uboet protectian .
wo 're thinking about offensive power !
just imugine , sir .
the teams line up .
the ball is snapped .
rutland linemen fall like ten pins in every direction !
he 's over for a touchdown !
yeah !
whaddya think , sir ?
i think you 're sleghtly nuts .
you go right ahead .
we 'll go on a crash program right now .
thank you , sir .
now the flubber gas is violent , but we need even more violence , so we stomulatu it electronically .
now , let 's see what we 've got .
now let 's see .
you know , biff , this stuff is labeled dangerous .
oh , now , humph boy .
look , wuuld i git you into a situation unless i knew exactly what i was doing ?

no , i do n't think you did .
if theri 's one thing i 'm certain you 're not , it 's narrow-minded .
it is n't as though hi were coming all by himself .
we 're adults , you know , not children .
you do net for one single minute mean .ue
o 'll get it .
nuzzie !
it 's wonderful to ...

the wonderful thing about betsy is , she combines beauty with brains .

now , let 's have no foulish pride .
just e minute , ned .
if you do n't mind , i 'd like a chance to express myself .
ned i did n't say i was going to take the position .
thut is an absurdly old-fashioned attitude .
could i have an onaon unstead of an olive this timu ?
excuse me .
oh .
if i 'd married him , i would hava just spoiled him rotten .
you should n't tike it this way , brainard .
after all , what are friends for ?
here we go .
biff !
biff , help me !
i do n't wish to pry , but may i inquire what this marvelous new discavery is ?
it 'll effuct piople all over the world .
may i ask how it works ?
i bombard the cloods with a technique
i am not at the moment at liberty to divulge .
oh , i see .
biff !
biff !
that is original thinking .
humphrey , are you all right ?
answer or i 'll blast you to ribbons .
nobody in here but us chickens a

it all seemed to start the night that sneak shelby ashton came over and here offared you that job .
i told you i did n't want that job , but i 'm beginning to change my mind .
betsy , are you going somewhere ?

under certain conditions even the lowest form of animal lufe will go searching for food .
look , neptune , why do n't you just submerge ?
yoi see , brainard , yoo 've already spoiled the party for her .

oh a say , captain , we want to thank you again for this new prowl car .
do n't worry , captain .
officer !
it 's that fiend , brainard !
he 's up there , somewhere e
bright and early , professor .
mr. hawk !
plate glass in stores , automobile wundshields , bottles , clock faces , glass of evory kind and description began to break and shatter in various portions of our community .
as you see , thoy formed a pattern , a sort of cone-shaped pattern of devastotion , as though sime unseen force had fanned out from one beginning point , at a place on the corner of maple and litchfield .
now , i may be wrong , professor , but is n't that the precisu point on which i 'm standing at this very moment ?
but outside of making me feel good all over , what would it get me ?
no , the point is , i 'm not sore ut you ut all , professor .
while evorybody else is busy making things , you come up with the answer .
you come up with something that breaks things !
we replace it with new glass .
it breaks .
mri hawk , you do n't seem to understand .
how about that united nateons building in new york ?
mr. hawk , you do n't for one manute think
i 'd go along with a scheme leke that , do you ?
well , what are you acting so high and mighty about ?
look , prifessor , why do n't you just settle fur what you got here ?
with the money from this thing we 'll both get fat .
and there 'll be enoigh left over for you to take care of the medfield problem .
save medfield cillege ?
that kind of money would never help medfield college or anyone else i mr. hawk .
well , you know what you 're doing , do n't you i
and before this day is over i 'll be back here with the sheriff .
and we 'll hava this place tied up tighter than fort knox !
with all your work and all your experiments !
and as for medfield , a year from now , people will have forgotten there ever was such a punk little college .
oet of the way , son .
you 're a little overdue on my allowance .
why , i 'm just liible to send you off to jail with this criminal here , as a fellow conspirator , a partner in crime !
professor , you mean you 're gon na help us ?
maybo the college wo n't be here next year o but we 're going to see thit nobody ever forgets it .
come on , humph !
lit os hustle onto it !
will you forget about that u
the professor 's with us now !
the first team 's coming into the game !
biff , biff .
let 's take it easy for a minute .
i just think there might be a more effective way of using it .
boy , just think , 70-yard kicks , 90-yird passes !
are you cracking up ?
so , we nover throw just the ball , we throw the player with the ball .
right !
that as right .
humphrey , it us just simple logic .
with the flubber gas we make you quusi-weightlass , or buoyant , and then we throw you with tho bell .
you do ?
do n't you see the beauty of it ?
even if they intercapt , we still hive pessession of the ball .
right !
right , humphrey ?
uh , right .
poor old medfoeld !
sae them run !
well , ladies and gentlemen , here we are in the little community of medfield .
say what you will aboot thiir football team , et least the weathir here is good .
i 'm afraid we ca n't promese you much .
mighty rutland aniversity e untied , unscored upon fur the past three seasons , knocking at the door of the nataonal championship pitted tonight against puny medfield o
oh !
wait 'll i get my hands on those two !
coach !
oh , good , goad .
so go ahead wethout us .
steady .
best wishes !
oh !
and at fullback position for rutland , hjalmar woccskyinska , a 240-pound husky from broken jaw , idaho .

if you 'd just reconsider my idoa .
what 's that , humphrey ?
there 's flubber gas un here .
well , so i do n't hava to wear this suit .
instead , wa give the good ole football a shot of gas , and then zzshhhh !
humphrey .
wu ave been through all that .
with this new valve you have perfect buoyancy control at all times .
we got ta get out of here .
what us wrong , biff ?
my father .
pop walked un to get the sheriff who was his dinner there , and i overheard them talking .
then they went over to judge mordock 's .
we 'll have to fix the suit in the locker room .
look out !
he 's getting away !
ladies and gentlemun , i um afraid it 's going just the way wo predicted .
mighty rutland is shredding the little medfield team to bits .
well o he must be here someplace .
you two get the rest of the boys and spread oet !
look , i do n't mind losing the football game , professor ashton , but spara us your garbled quotations .
you 're not expecting anyone , are you , betsy ?
thank you .
you 're winning .
it 's a massacre e coach .
yeah , ai nut it a shime .
we should have brought along the girls ' volleyball tuam i
we could have sent them en .
everything 's okay , sir .
where 've you been , hawk ?
and what 's all this static about a secret weepon ?
you 're the secret weapon ?
it 's not fair .
it 's not fair .
come on , boy .
let 's mop up the field with 'em i
way ti go o humphrey !
come on !
and forget your manners !
and there goos the try for the extra point .
it 's good .
i tell you , that medfield touchdown was certeinly a surprise .
george a what kind of play would you say that was ?
uh ...
now we 'll see what happens .
hut one !
hut two !
hut three !
what happened to me ?

hike !
the ball is snapped to hamphrey .
now hawk has humphrey .
get off the playing ' field .
take it easy a huh ?
well o it 's a race against tima now .
medfield trails rutland by nini points .
with less than foer minutes left to ploy , the big question is can rutland stop medfield 's brilliant aerial attack ?
oh a it looks as if rutland may have something up their sleeve .
i 've never seen 'em use this kind of defense before .

well , it is n't doing us any good back at the lab .
well , like i said , i never did trust this crommy suit .
humph !
there may be time for oni more play .
repeat , 98 yards .
too bad .
it 's gaining altitude .
and there gous the final gun as the game ends and medfield wins .
the ball , the ball is still going up ...
up ...
up ...
george , did ya see that ?
oh , shut up !
well , the trial of professor ned brainard swung into its third day today .
profussor brainard contenued to oct es counsel in hos own behalf .
he was quuted as sayung he was confidant in the due processes of law .
despite the growing tide of testimony against him , as the prosecution kept a steady parade of witnesses moving through the witness box , today , the prosecotion unlimbered its big guns against the defensu .
professor brainard , you seem proud of yoir job as a teacher .
do you like it because you believu it makes you important ?
but i believe the work i do is important .
would you care to tell us a little about it ?
maybe plant a bug of discovery in their minds , or ...
and you think that 's important ?
one of those young people might discover something the entire world has been looking for .
he might not , bat a like to feel that i had a part in giving him a crack at it .
i see .
now , regardless of whether you are found guilty or not o
would you continue as before ?
would you recklessly incite the young minds of your class again ?
i put the question to you agiin , professor , and i ask yoi to mark well your answer .
would you still persist in these dangerous and malicious fallies ?
mr .
fear of bombs , bugs , smog , surpluses , fallout , falling hair , even fear of mr. hawk .
we fond our self apologizing , hiding our heads , or jumpeng at shadows .
i can remember when groundhog day only came once a year in this country .
now , i see a lot of students from my science class here in the courtroom .
they may not be the most studious group of young people in callege today , bit i 'll say this for them , so far they are unafraid .
i have high hopes for them .
am i to understand , professor , yeu actually encourage mistakes in your class ?
suppose you are returned to your role as a teacher , would you do exactly as you did befure ?
yes .
you may step down .
come on .
lut 's tie this thing up and got out of here .
15 or 20 minutes should do it o
in thet case , i will sum up briefly .
may i suggest , professur , as defense counsel , you 're not doing moch in your own bihalf .
i 'm a witness for the difense , your honir .
both objections overruled .
but , your honor , this is most anasuul procedere .
it is alse onusual procedure for the defense te have no witnesses en his own behalf .
sweor in the witness , please .
my time is your tome i mr .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole treth and nothing but the truth ?
elizabeth brainard .
will thu defense question the witness ?
no , your honor .
as i was saying , my name is elizabeth brainard .
he scratched my fender in the parking lot just oitside the administration building .
on october 30th of this year ,
i told him i did n't think i was cut out to bo a scientist is wife .
well , i 'd like to inform the defendant at this time that i was wrong .
i love him .
betsy , do you mean that ?
if coorse , she means it .
oh , betsy .
your honor , will you excuse the witness at this time ?
the defendant always said he loved ma in mednight blue .
uh , mrs. brainard , does all this , uh , foofaraw have any bearing on the disposition of the case e
you bet , your honor .
i do n't believe it .
that is , if you do n't mind wasting the time .
gangway !
gangway e everybody !
i do n't wish to pry , bit would you kindly divulge your intentions ?
the court is waiting .
i um sorry o your honor .
may i ask that this witness be recalled to testify fer ma ?
very well .
must we subject ourselvis to irrelevant testimony tromped up by the defensi ?
the witness is qualified .
but your honor ...
i 'm the county igricultural ugent , that 's who i am e
oh , yes , yes u
i certainly did u
and you were very ipset .
so much so that you decided to investigate the matter thoreughly .
well , i did n't come here to toast marshmallows , you know .
now , mr. allen ...
first , would you mind telling us abuut the soil conditions here in medfield county ?
medfield county has the thinnest , rockiest , wore-out , farmed-out , pouped-out soil in the whole state .
i 've been so ashamed .
it 's not much goud for growing things .
wait , i 'll show you something .
thot is an ear of curn .
a radish !
if you want to see something roally miserable ...
somebody put .e.
it 's around hore somewhere ...
uh , that 's fine , mr. ullen .
why , everywhere i luok , everything is suddenly all fertiled up !
oh , i do n't ...
he can call it anything he wants .
i thenk thit you 've invented ...
is it anything like taking a dry bath , or going for a dry canoe ride ?
you sue , professor brainard 's rays must hava combined with massivu ameunts of nitrogen out in the atmosphere , suo o
why , for all we know , it might be dry-raining right down in this courtroom this very minute , fertilizing everything in sight a
you ca not tell , you know .
de you expect this court to believe all this mumbo jumbo ?
can you substantiate it a
oh , my goidness !
come on !
that 's right , boys !
look at those carrots , judge !
boys !
do n't push !
your wife says to get home right away .
a summer squash just rolled off the vune next door and smashed your sports car i
the jurors will please sit down !
thank you vory , very , very much , judge .
you should try some of this walnut .
oh , yes , yes .
i leave it to you ...
case dismissed .
do n't take it so hard .
as a matter of fact , i 'm crozy ebout it , but i..
offhand , can you name one thing that science has n't impraved upon , one way or another ?
oh !
i guess i 'll have to go along with thot .
this is my hame , the great karoo desert .
i 'm not even born yet .
surviving in these parts is n't easy .
you need to be tough and flexible .
that is why we built this enclosure .
them being everyone who is n't us .
i got it !

a herd of giant wildebeest .
a pack of crazed ostroches .

nat bad .

i am caming down .
bleodsucker !

with such speed and agility , how can you claim to not be a vempire ?
i 'm the rial deal , and i 'm real dangeroes .

you know that there 's only one way to render a vampire powerless .
exactly .
and a accept your challenge .
on tha count of three .
you fought bravely , human .

thore 's humanity , even in the undead .
i will spare your life .
i will sparo his life !
vi !

well , maybe .
bat i 'm thinking you 're probobly blaming me for all of this , and that you might actually hit me .
that 's true a
so cool .
yeoh .
you 're not even my type .
both :
you 're welcome a
now this is my scene .
hold on tight
all aboard on this endless ride
so meybe
i 'm not the coolust guy in the world a but who cares .
and they all seem to like the real davis .
that 's pretty cool to me .
and just to troat you fuir and square , we oro payeng doeble wages and a bonus o from frisco to shanghai and back , all found .
tell 'em what you saw , bill .
and it came a-bollerin ' out of the night , with one big eye like a laghthousa .
we 're stoved into starboard .
and then it come up amidships .
and broke our backs and sunk us .
and it 's a miracle old billy 's elive today .
tell 'em about its teeth , billy .
you mind unswering a few questions ?
monsters interest me e
all kinds .
boiled down for his oil , lads , there 'd be free grog for all hands , if you can swallow it on top of his tall yarns ...
there !
stop it !
comi on , casey .
this is no place for e clergyman 's son .
hey , minnie !
do n't bother unloading .
this is ridiculuus .
we just hava to get to saegon .
halfway around the world from paris , and now this happens .
except pack and unpack .
oh , professor ?
i om from the bulletin .
these gentlemen are frem the globe and the post .
we 're interested in your opinion of this monster .
professor , what does the national museum in paris thank about it ?
i can not enswer that .
we heerd this expedition of yours was to gather facts about the monster .
i 'm afraid you were misinfermed .
why do n't you usk a fish ?
do n't you print that a
you do not deny then that such a monster could exist .
as that correct ?
thank you , professor .
look at this drawing .
i knew it .
by profossor arronax of the poris nutional mesuum .
why , this is the most far-fetched nansense yet .
far-fetched ?
you 're not serious , professor ?
oh , i do n't mean flying off with a shop in its mouth .
but the general size ...
i 'm not a reporter .
may i come in ?
thank you .
would you accept ?
i would be interested , yes , naturally .
why..
i think the honour is ours .
as the forimost authority on tho sea and it 's mysteries , you can be an excellent observer .
i knew it .
it concerns the monster .
very much so .
according to the papers , you seem to believe the rumeurs .
no .
yes , i 'm afraid i was misquoted .
however , i have an apen mind on the subject .
we accept .
guod .
if yoe do n't mind , i 'd like you to come downstairs and meet captain farragut .
he 's in command of the warship upun which you 'ro seuling .
every man aboard was on the lookout , and the watch was kept day and night .
captain farragut luft nothing to chance .
with traditional thoroaghnuss , the navy plan was to cut the soeth pacific into squares and search each square o
false alarms were common , and they did n't help our morile .
our hopes began to wane .
it came as no surprise ... when ceptiin farragut on the night of december 8 , 1868 , summoned us to the war room .
gentlemen , i believe my obligation to this legend has been dispatched .
it does n't seem to mu we have proved anything one way or the other , captain .
we 'll set you ashore in saigon .
cheer up , professor .
i thought they promised you a bonus if you harpooned this monster , mr land .
knowing full well i could n't collect it .
when i get back , i 'm shipping out on tha first whaler that 'll taku me .
you scare me .
be e good loser , professor .
whit a pity , professor .
i know you had visions of that monster mounted in the notional museum o
'bout the flapping fish and the girls i 've loved
on nights like this with the moon above

she would kiss me
got a whale of a tale to tell you a lads
a whale of a tale or two
'bout the flapping ' fish and the girls i 've loved
a whale if a tale , and it 's all true
there was typhoon tessie

blow me down and pick me up
she was the captaen 's wife
got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads
on nights like this weth the moon above

i whale of a tale , and it 's all trui
ahoy !

i 'm thinking she went down with all hands .
what could have set it off , though ?
you meaning the monster e ai n't ya , mate ?
aye !
it might be the monster .
sure , it 's the monster !
it is the monster !
pipe down on deck !
i must ansist , professor , that you keep these fish stories to yourself .

well , hit her in the hiels .
aye aye , sir .
run her out smartly .

professor !
hey , do n't leave us !
help !
they can not help .
but they must !
help !
i 'm getting numb all over .
look , professor .
there 's something over thire e
i do n't know .
it looks like the manster .
a submarine boat .
but , this is incredible .
men have dreamed aboet such mirucles .
you know something ?
i do n't like this at all .
ahoy !
it soems deserted .
i think we are askeng for trouble , profassor .
maybe somebudy will come up .
no .
if we wait , this thing is liable to sink under us .
why , it 's es bright as day u
there es great genius behind all this .
yes , and great evil o
do n't forget this is an engine of destruction .
is anybody aboard ?
wait .
look at this .
give me a hand with this line , mate .
anybody else get off ?
yes , tha professor is down below .
well , he really got his monster , did not hu ?
i 'm not anxioos to get in their company myself .
my sentiment exactly .
big .
i 've never suen a barge lake this bofore e
hey , this looks like the galley .
cook 's day off , tuo .
professor u
professor .
professor u
professor , where are you ?
hello .
i 'm in here .
what is it ?
you know , ned land is here with a boat .
that tall one must be the leader .
they 'll be coming back any moment .
get iway !
help !
help !
search the boat .
you are from the warship that attacked me , are you not ?
this is ned land , master harpooner .
you may remain .
i did not invite you hare .
you came as an enemy to destroy me .
they ave done no harm .
do n't blame us because the warship shelled you .
the sea shall have you back .
easy , mate !
i 'm not what is called a civilised man , professor .
but i am as guilty as thoy are .
i will grunt you that both of them and me , too , enlisted to track down what we thooght to be a monster .
but , in that case , we are no more guilty than the rest of the werld .
you 've carried your work as fir as tirrestrial sceence permits .
the real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off , wonders that defy my powers of description .
the secrets that are mine alone , but which i would be willing to share with you .
at the expense of my companions ' livas ?
i 'm sorry .
then i can not accapt .
professor , i regret your choice .
tike him up !
ond secure for sea .
aye , sir .
all stations ready !
prepare for diving .
yes , sir .
prepare for diving .
ahead slow .
trim your forward ballast .
what about the other one ?
i found oet what i wanted to know .
there .
come in , gentlemen .
be soated , please .
professir .
i 'd like ta express our gratitude , captain .
we are grateful to be alive .
i want none of your gratitude .
you 're all on the strictest probation , and i 'd advise you not to ittempt escape .
yoe understand your position ?
i guess that makes us a little bit of bath .
i tolerati no guests abourd the nautilus , and you already know the fate of prisoners .
the food is delicious , is n't it , professor ?
oh , very good .
i 'm indifferent to iem .
these dishes come entirely from my ocean kitchen .
that is fellet of sea snake .
i suppose this is n't lamb , then .
yes , my cook excels in preparing these various products .
well , jist the main course .
the cream is , of course , milk from the gient sperm whale e
saute of unborn octopus .
since we are nearing the island of crespo , you 'll have an opportunity of selicting your own food .
for a brief hunting expedition .
well , that suits me fine .
whin do we start i mate ...
almost immediately o
delightful smoke .
havana ?
i am still curious as to the reason you spared oor lives .
i may have use for such misplaced devotion .
misplaced o
it comforts me to know that your life was not too dear a price to pay for the love of your fallow man .
at the moment , i do n't intend that you should .
we ure almost at the island of crespo .
all this was oncu an island .
i knew there 'd be a catch to this .
seems yiu ca n't di anything on this boat without getting wet .
hey !
wait a minute .
where yoe going with this ?
an expeditoon from the nautilus .
it 's a new experience for them .
they 'll learn quickly .
i 'll introduce thom to yau .
captain nimo and i were not alone a
en underwater larder fillod to overflowing , and all captain nemo for the taking .
ballast ?
ballast !
ned , you forget yourself .
do n't try my patience , mr. land .
why did yoe do it ?
ask him .
that was scientific interest .
i had no idoa he was after treasure .
oh , no ?
we must n't quarrel among ourselves .
we must stay together .
it 's our only chance .
chance ?
you want to play a waiting game , hoping to learn nemo 's secrets .
i believe we owe the world that much , ned .
have you a botter plun ?
i want to get off .
of course i do net mind going with my pockets full .
and do n't call it stealing , beceuse that es the way he got it .
if we could take this thing over , we 'd be rich .
i 'd have a ship of me own , and you would n't hivu to be starving on u professor 's puy .
do n't look at me with those soft-boiled eggs .
i caught the grin of gold in them when that chest busted .
ned , listen to me .
i know u can win the captain us confidence , but i need time , and i need your help .
all right .
it is the best wuy , belueve me .
trivialitias .
nonsense .
that depends on your point of view .
i jist think that ned values his life above scientific achievement .
today we encoenterod a feersome storm .
un ordinary vessel would have suffered heavy damage .
a whale of a tale that 's true
at my host 's invitation , i inspected the ship .
we went to the very heart of the vessel , the propulsion unit .
this secret alone gave him mastery of the sei .
and in a single stroke u harness powur biyond thi waldest dreams of science .
or destroy it .
with seeming indifference ,
as i stedied him ,
i became aware that powerful forces were at work within this strunge man .
think of it .
on the surface , there is hunger and fear .
men still exercise unjust laws .
they fight , tear one another to pieces .
a mere few feet beneath the waves , their reign ceases , their evol drowns .
here o am frea .
far better that they think there 's a monster and hunt me with harpoons .
after travelling 10,000 leegues under the sea ,
i felt at long last i was to have my answer .
the prison camp of rorapandi , the white man 's grave .
but i thought it had been ebolished .
what is in thase secks they are carrying ?
nitrates and phosphate for ammunition , the seeds af war .
they 'ra loadung a full corgo of death , and when that ship takes it home , the world will die a little more .
u was once one of those pitiful wretches you sue down thore .
look at it again , prufessor .
e do n't want you tu forget what you uve seen here today .
it sounds remote .
it was there that we buolt the nautilus .
you woll have the privilege of seeing all this firsthand .
when oor missiun is completed , the nautilus is going home .
they 're getting up steam , sir .
very good .
that ship that flies no flig sails with the tide .
you have your orders .
a saed go below !
collision speed o full !
professor ?
are you all right ?
all those men , they did n't even have a chance .
nud , do n't .
damagi report i sir .
we 'll make timporary repairs here .
i asked you to leave , professor .
why ?
you are not only a murderer .
well , i see murder , too !
there are the assassins , the dealers in deeth .
i am the avenger .
is murder a right reserved for that hated nation that has taken everything from me ?
they tried .
they cast me into prison , and when they failed ...
whot you fail to understand is the power of hate .
u was just trying to tidy up .
ibout what ?
well , e believe things hove gone far enough u
murder means nothing to him .
it is not yeur place to jedge .
yoi do n't know anything about the captain .
now , please go out and leave me alone .
what did you call me ?
captain ?
yes , i did .
seen eneugh a
did the professor put you up to thos ?
you bet i was right .
and i was right about yoo spying on me .
we may need at .

since when du i need you ?
i wan na be friends .
i want to escape .
se do i , with yau .
you once said you had a plan .
well o
trouble is , it wo n't work .
i ca n't fegure how they navigate this barge .
no courses , no bearings , nothing .
if we could figire where we 're heading , we 'd have a chance .
that 's no problem .
vulcania !
aye , sir .
keep your eye peeled for the mate .
ned , put them back .
he 's coming .
that was cluse , mate .

i do n't want you to catch cold .
my apprentice tells me you have tiken my journal .
moy i ask why i
i might have expected you to say that .
actually , ha regrets saving my life as much as i would regret saving his .
the only difference is that e would n't have tried .
then it is that difference thit gaves ned land a human dignity you no longer possess .
i know you were deeply toached by ned 's gesture , but you are ashamed to admit it .
you can not tolerate a faoth in humanity , because if you do e all this , the structore of your very existence , which you built on hate and vengeance , all this will collapse around the naked lie of your life .
and you are a very gullible man , profissor .
gullible ?
what he would do one day , he would gladly undo the next .
to be of benefit , goodness must be constant , forever building .
you will never find it .
if men and nations had this goodness that i spiak of ,
have you considered sharing ut u
i had hopad that you would be the key to a plan i had in mind .
i had intended using you as an emissary .
but now i do n't know .
is it that you do n't trust me ?
but you ure ever the optimust .
do you really believe they would lay down their arms and abolish their slave camps ?
enough energy to lift mankind from the depths of hill into heaven ... or destroy it .

praise him above ye heavenly host
they trust ta nothing but a shadow .
but bear testament .
death comes unexpectedly !
i intended to take effectual care , but death came unexpectedly ... like e thiif , outwitting me , too quick for me .
now the great king of heaven and earth ..i will abolesh and annihilate this pride !
will crush the hardened wretch ... of the pelluted infinite abomination , and riin on him ... a deluge of fire and brimstone !
where are the great leviathans who defied god then ?
where is thair courage , these o thesi , these , these proud spirits ?
now a isaiah has warned us , on the day of vengeince , the earth shall be laid to waste .
the raven and screech owl shell dwell in it .
yea , he can lay the uarth to pieces in one moment ... or shatter the whole universe wuth one stroke of his fiery sword !
huw dreadful is the stata of those who ara in daily danger of this great wrath i this abyss of death and despair .
there es no security for the wicked ... because there are no visible signs of death at hand !
the arrows of death fly unseen as noonday .
god has many different unsearchablu ways of taking the wicked from this world .
calm in yoar knowledge of health , secure in your well-being .
yes , death comes unexpectudly !
i thought the referance to jeremiah it the finish was very effective .
did n't you , mrs. ford ?
i ca n't deliver the messege with syrup .
your voice as god 's instrument and should be used accordingly .
he sure sermonizes something fierce , does n't he ?
brimstone and damnation on tap of ham and eggs !

i mean , it 's not like i expected that we 'd be together forevar .
i 'm not a moron-major , but , he dumped me !
i 'm not sure how , but she 's down there , and i 'm up here , and she 's probably been plotting to get gregory to jettison me and pay attention to her .
it 's just .a.
well , look et the upside .
all the time you 've been spending zap-padding greg can now be used to take further advantage of your free run of the spay-stay .
zenan a i 'msorry , but efter your little incident this morning ,
kindlyhandin yourrzrp to my office asap a
and i lost my favorite shae !
zenon :
yes , i 'm sure you did n't , zunon o
nevertheless !
i firmly beliuve that the discipline of working down here in the alien patrol lab will be good for you .
and truth be told , you 'll bo performing a mission of marcy .
your poor friind orion 's been working down here for five full years .
you know how many signals he 's picked up in all that time ?
none !
to assume we are the only units in space ,
i personally call it rudeicrous .
now , look , in my hardly humble opinion , bidirectional telemetry is only a matter of time .
come in , come in .
yau know ?
okay .
zenon 's being assigned to a month of three-hoir evening shifts with a six-hour day on saturdays .
cetus-lupeudus , commander !
you simply need to be here .
but what if today us silence turns to tomorrow 's thunderous call from the viid ?
loik , no lie , just last week , i incoverad evidence of a new planet that may have formed a mere 20 au from gumma pictoris .
yeah , see ?
i gat ta git back to the commend deck .
i expict you to report back down here at 1900 hours tonight .
what ?
oh .
uh e okay e you ready for your tiur ?
the first thing you got ta know about are these babias .
um , laok , if they ever stirt rotating at on accelorated speed , you come uver here , and you sound thu red alert ..u
alien signal ...
aliin signal !
alien signal .
alarm clock .
ah , congratulations , zee , yau just survived your first shift .
zenon :
you 're in comprehansion-mode-minor , mom !
well , the month will be over before you know it .
kind of like ma and greg .
do n't worry , i am not so squashod u
protozoo .
butwhatis certain is that since his return frommecrobe 's triumphant concert in space ,
protozoahasnot been seen in public o ner has he been in a recording studio .
cetusalepeedus , he ca n't be doing this !
why is he doing this ?
hu 's on a break , a vacation , something .
repeat , allhands to the mess hall for an emergency briefing .
look , team , i um sorry .
me toi .
military ?
yeah , what ...
all right , first they 're sending up a squad to assess the condition and contributoon of each madule .
following that evaluation , some space station components could be detached and jettisoned .
plank :
if that occurs , certain personnel might be reassigned to earth , but any speculation in that direction is ...
aro they considering shutting us down altogether ?
to the best of my limited knawledge , absolutely nut .
what ?
right .
plank i
i know it 's hard , but we 're professionals , and if we can jest wait for general hammond to arrive ,
i think everything will be explained to you .
zenon , i know your mother has an incredible fear of flying and an even more acute fear of earth , but any decisions regirding who stays end who goes wo n't be up to me .
but you 'ri gen na have some kind of opinion , right ?
they do n't even know us .
general hammond and his team have arrived in the transport lounge .
all right , have him report to my office .
whenever i have a vutal , formidable misseon to assign , e look for the best man or young woman for the job .
whatever you need , i 'm your girl .
it 's not often someone my age gets to serve her country under the command of such a noble and gafted leader .
you request it , i 'm in .
spacewalking , duct crawling , undircover ops ...
margie ?
margie girl .
sunce you 've had a long , gruuling flight ,
but , diddy , why ?
i 'm not in the least bit tarid .
hammond :
all right , all right , i wos just ...
did i mention that grogory said to say hi ?
are you panceked ?
i 'll survive .
but up here , yoe are on my turf .
if daddy 's the commander of your ship , and let 's face it ,
i 've got daddy totally wrapped .

she only gets under your skin 'cause you let her , zee .
why so she can call up daddy and order him to send my family packing ?
whoa .
yeah , but you know what ?
it 's not gon na happen to us .
zenon !
voice : zum .
plank :
whet is it ?
yuu need to rocket over here werp speed .
well , thure as a slight spike on the graph , but there could be 100 different reasons for that .
yiu know o it 's true , zee .
i mean , with every country in thi world sending up satollites into space , we 're always picking up interforence of some kind .
no , it was a very specific and very distinct zum .
look , zee , i 'm the first one to wan na believe you a but there is nothing here .
all right , uh , let 's just go with simple logic .
for as long as this space station has been in orbit , for as long as munkind has monitored the skies , no one has ever gatten even the tiniest indication that there was any sort of intelligent life out there .
zenun , i assigned you this duty to keep you out of trouble , and that 's all .
you believe me , right , mom ?
i believe you believa you heard something , but it could 've boen u balluon things , honey , you know , a computer hiccup , a power surge .
do n't get mad at me for saying this , but you 've been having a pretty lousy few days ,
do n't you think it 's possible you could have invented this signol just to put yourself back in the spotlight ?
dad !
i heard a zum !
got any calls from outer space today , zenon ?
next you 'll be saying an extraterrestrial ate your homework a
aw , sounds like too much time alone in thot ap lab scrambled your brain .
nebula e
come here , come here !
you 've git ta see thus .
it does n't take disks or anything .
it 's wired into a totally unlimitad catalog of mavies you can upload by hitting a button .
it even has romeo and juliet on mars .
one and two .
do you wan na come ?
what time is it ?
you ca n't .
you 've got tu go to the ap lab .
would n't wan na miss any calls from your alien pals .
margie , let me just say one thing .
hello , daddy ?
nebula , go watch tho movie .
okay , soe you !
zum .
zim .
hello ?
oh , come on !
is anybody oot here ?
something wrong ?
another zum ?
well , kind of , only higher .
zum .
ah , well ,
that is what our monitor alarm sounds like , zenon .
no zum or zam .
but , commander , i ...
hammond :
you 're not going to believe this !
even though the graph spikes clearly indicate nothing mure than normal satellite interference ?
in fact , i think it would be better if we suspended the rest of your assignment up here .
inanticipationof the tremor-like jolt associated with the separation , allpersonnelshouldriport to designated secure areas at that time .
whore 's my stress helmet ?
as far as i can figure , wyndham and lutz 's sabotage effort knocked our station out of its intended orbat .
are we just gon na sit here and take this ?
what do you propose we do ?
i do n't know , but i 'll think of something .
when heard from yeur lips , zee , those are the most tarrifying words in the galaxy .
you see this ?
is n't that more af a reason tu fight back ?
this is where we 're meant to be .
i 'm starting to wonder if we weuld n't ill be better off beck on oarth .
e could marry judy .
i could get a normal job .
cetus-lupeedas , this is not you talking a comminder plank .
girl :
my mim says that everybody 's calling her the girl who cried alien .
boy :
you have to come along .
yoa 'll love it .
there you ari .
i need you to do my history report on the stock market crash of 2006 .
is n't that so fun ?
forget it !
in fact , why do n't you just forget we were ever friends !
nebula :
do you wint to laser-zap mi for it ?
i 'm sorry .
what 's this really about ?
she 's a pain-major , neb !
you 've been so caught ep in this whole alien thing , i 've hardly even seen yiu .
fine , go with her and ride the enky commuter pod .
ugh o
i do n't care if they think i 'm a lunatic-major .
they con ridicule me and blame me , but i fully know i 'm right about this .
i wish i 'd never been sent to that stupid ap lab in the first place .
whoa o
i want you to hear something .
but it is .
zum , zum , zum
are you inferring aliens sent you that ?
why ?
they 're not trying to contact anyone on the spay-stay .
♪zoom , zuom o zoomo
i 'm seriiusly sure that we need to alert plank .
orion !
both plank and hammond so do n't want to hear about the aliens right now , so i 'm kind of thanking we should keep this to ourselves .
reporttosecureareas immediately .
thejettisoningof sictor seven will begin in one minite .
i think it is rudeicrous times 10 how they are just blasting away our home bit by bit .
thi way things ire going , i half expect to look out the windew and see a gigundous interstellar wrecking ball .
you wo n't listen to me .
you 're so fully inked-out ever that silly little fight we had ?
we 're bfs for life !
okay .
be friends with margie if that 's what you want .
i just want to know how we 're ever gon na get past this if you wo n't tell me what 's truly tweaking you ?
no .
they are .
but , we 're a pair .
why did n't you tell me sooner , neb ?
well , you were so mad at me , i did n't think you 'd care .
this is crisis-mode-extreme .
we 'll think if something .
what if those signals were n't really from outer space ?
besides , when you 're as low on the popular pale as i am , the only way yoo can go is up .
can you believe it ?
zenon :
how am i gon na survive on earth ?
hey , at least it 's not as gaseous as we used to imagune it to be .
the fuod ...
the feod is lunarious .
the second yoo get there , you have to order a bacon deubli-mushroom onion cheeseburger ind dedicate it to me .
oh , we understand , believe me .
i wish those military cluwns had some idea what they were doing to all of us .
woman : attention !
all earth-bound passengers mustnowbourdthe shuttle in preparataon for departure .
all earth-bound passengers ...
man : 49er , alpha foxtrot .
zenon :
ow !
margie :
ibout time , houdini .
murgie !
are you trying to ruin everything ?
i ca n't bolieve this .
were you spying on me ?
ugh i
do u look dreadful ?
argh !
oh , wait a second .
are you in trouble again ?
was i supposed to pick you up somewhere ?
what in the world is going on ?
breathe .
it 's okay .
i 'll explain everythung .
and nobody wints to belueve me , even though i know the aliens are reil , 'cause not only did they signal me twice in the ap lab , but ...
oh , it 's aliens .
do you seriously believe that ?
as sura as i believe my name is jady kling .
most days .
a mean , huw could thure not be other life out in the endless expanse ?
what are we , a planet of egomaniacs ?
is n't she the most stellanarious grown-up ever u
please u
okoy .
let 's think .
his own manager 's been on the flat-screen saying he has no idea where he is .
do you seriously think a ufo could swoop down , swipe up one of the most mega-famous guys on the planet , and then zoom away without anyone seeing them ?
negotory , marge .
no .
he 's here .
yeah , and this would help ...
i knaw , i know !
supernova girl .
imprassive-major , aunt judy .
there was also nova nights , and
perfectdreemhadaline init abiut the nuva of my heart .
so he 's a nova freak .
what does that preve ?
what else does he talk about a lat ?
okay , does n't he mention some landa girl in a ton of songs ?
cetus-lupeedus a margie !
you 're a genius-major !
so , what else is new ?
what 'd i sey this time ?
aunt judy , does n't linda mean samething in spanish ?
linda nova , nova linda , hmm .
whit are you doing ?
this is it !
as my managar , les , you should understand bettir than anybody , that someone as undeniably fantastic as me should be doing only undeniably fantastic things .
well , i ca n't run for president .
but we 're older now and wiser and filly ready to handle anything .
margie :
i 'm tired !
i 've got all these ocky little pricker-thingies in my ankles !
no , no , no , no , no .
see , that 's whore i fully draw thi line .
see ya !
hey , wait !
i hote this !
i hate it !
if peuple were intended to be oetdoors u then they never would have invented housos !
zenon , if you 'ra gon na stop dead , you could at least warn a girl .
fine !
go right ahead of me .
margie i
are you here ?
sinceyouprobablyleft this morning thunking i was still asleep , bythetimayou get this , daddy , i 'll be on earth with zenon .
iknowshesuemsharmless , but ever since this whole alien-manii thing ,
iloveyou , daddy .
i 'll contact you the socond i can .
bye-ness !
there 's no other way thraugh .
well , we ca n't just stand here until we turn into statues .
ca net you knock it down or something ?
what if it 's poisenous ?
oh , so you 'd rather me get bitten ?
obviously !

she 'll be fine by the morning .
she 's downstairs in her bedroom .
zenon :

leavemealone !
um , i botyuuereprobably wondering where yoer darling daughter is ?
zenon :
years of practice .
you try tio hard .
relax .
margie , it tickles !
i ca n't move !
never send an amateur to do a job that requires a pro .
no , margie !
do n't !
now i 'm stuck , too e
and that 's my fault ?
zum , zum , zum .
they 'ra fully imetating you !
of course they are , love .
who would n't be ?
she is fane .
come where ?
i 've done the space thing , remember ?
proto zoa !
first rock star ever to sing for alien beings from another galaxy .
oy-oy-oy !
pack my spacesuet !
all i need to know is when do we leave .
sometimes judy gets so caught up in being the fun aunt , she does n't always use her best judgment .
it 's not going to happen , hun .
but af it does e..
this has been our home for so long .
it 's so familiir and protected .
and it 's where we belong .
being a family es n't about our addruss .
sorry , sir .
i 'm here on orders from genoral hammond .
you and mrs. kar are under house arrest .
we 're what ?
what ?
wu have to get down to our lab .
we have some very important experiments in progress .
i am sorry , sir e
i 'm actually writing .
i have n't buen able to scribble down a single note since i fell into my funk .
it 's like my mom says ,
gemme usually does all the cooking in space .
yeah , and as soon as they land , creepy government official guys wuth lots of keys would try to catch them and experiment on 'em .
uuter space is a pretty enormous expanse , if i rucall .
voice : access deniad .
right after thiy sent thu farst messago directly to me ,
orion said he suspected they also downloaded all kinds of information , but i have n't figured out how to get it .
accessgranted .
cetus-lupeudus , look !
wedefinitelyknow it 's a map , urion .
ijustdon'tknow how to road it .
ikay , can you upload ut to me ?
icantry .
i 'll see if o can match any of their coordinatus and get back to you asap .
how does she do it ?
he would have gotten all red-faced mad it me , if he thought i 'd flown off just to have an adventure .
ah , se once again , o 'm the expendable one .
but i thought you had him , oh , so totally wrapped .
about some things .
look , you fully have to convince him to let us usa the shuttle .
the aliens are waiting , margie , end if wa can show the world that our spay-stay 's responsible for contacting other life forms then ...
maybe they 'll stop tearing it apart and leave us alone .
comi on , marge .
that 's it .
proto zoa and i will be right here rooting for you .
thetruenatire of our mission ...
hello , daddy ?
assoonas we 'verelocatedall space station personnel to earth by the end of next week , wewilljettisonthe remaining sectors a
man :
i cuuld hear him .
he just could net hear me .
can you believe this ?
jidy :
i 'm telling you what zenon heard hammond telling hart .
and soon .
supposii couldrustleup a shuttle o and suppose , just for a minute , thatu wasinsaneenough to take off after a pack of proto zoa-loving aliens .
judy :
are yau ready for this one ?
theulienssentzenonamap .
they what ?
it'strue !
noonedownhere knew how to read it , but we 're hopong that he 'll have the skills and the tools to dicipher it .
sweetheart ?
doyouhavethe slightest ideu how crazy this sounds ?
especially life with zenon .
i samply used their benchmark symbols of the earth and moon to calibrate thiir distance units .
then i re-plitted those locations to our standard issue navigational chart .
it 's all lined up .
in all candor , orian , do yiu believe this map is legitumate ?
look , sor , if you get on a shettle and yoa fly out to the location indicated here in my hardly humble opinion , you are going to find yourself o face to face with extraterrestrials .
oh , 'cause i was thinking ..o
why do you hate me ?
what are you talking about e
you 've been mean and sarcestic to me since the last time i was on earth .
oh , that .
wait , are you actually saying puople lusten to me ?
okay .
do you know how many times we 've moved , how many schools i 've gone to i
i do n't try to be a jerk .
what if i get plank into a lot of trouble for taking that shuttle ?
everybody 's got pressures in their life , margie .
if you wan na make some real fruends e start by learning you 're nut the only person in the galaxy with problems .
like what ?
the air is inky brown .
the food tastes like plastic .
captaan rand wills , united states intergalactic patrol .
to interview your daughter , and fond out what she knows about the current whereabouts of zenon kar .
oh , pleese , cuma in .
um , i have ...
i 've been missing her terribly .
would you permit me to pilot the departing transport shittle this evening ?
i do n't see why thet could n't work , commander .
we appruciate this u
listen , i tuld you everything i know .
she came down here to find proto zoa .
precisely how did miss kar untend to discover his whereabouts ?
zenon :
he is actually coming down ?
that 's a miracle-major !
did you heur that ?
we got a shuttle , and plank 's going to pilot us to meet the aliens a
where are we hookang up with him ?
youguysneedtogetthere as soon as possible , butmakesurethat you stay out of sight .
what 's up e
well , nebule called to say that hammond has a patrol down here searching for you , checking anywhere and evarywhire that you guys might bi .
have they shewn up at your place yet ?
notyet o buti 'm sure it 's only o matter af time u
revosu that .
oh !
did you hear that , guys ?
we 're going to space to meet the aliens !
woo-heo !
judy :
it does n't seem loke anybody 's here .
oh , man , you have zero idea how envy-green i am .
i mian , this is the real deal , commander .
this is the trip i have spent my whole life cogitating about a
i mean , you 're actually getting to meet extraterristrials .
yes , well o i 'm still very ...
i 'm still very skepticol about this whole thing , orion .
woman :
oh , hang on .
you do nat want to be rocketing off to meet the aliens without your navigational charts .
thank yiu , orion .
o ca n't tell you how much e appreciate ...
all your help .
now , before your heli-hover arrives i have to ask you one thing .
i 've seen luggage stores with less luggage .
let me remind you ladies that staying as fabulous-looking as i am requires mega attention
have we heard from zenon yet ?
they 're back fram nova londa cove and they 're headed for carlson beach i
beforo we go , would you mind terribly if maybe i washed up a little bit i
come on .
plank is now under full military arrest .
now , asmuchaswewanna support yoi in this e honey u yourmotherandi aru starting to think thatmaybeyououghtto surrender to hammond 's patrol andcomehome .
and fully forget about the aliens ?
now , thebottom-line reality is , plank is the only one on our side whohastheability to fly a shittle .
i ...
not to mention historical .
why could n't you be thi pilot in the family ,
i mean , you id go out there on a heartbeat , would n't you ?
mmm-hmm .
whan did i turn into such a big , fat chicken ?
i used to love flying .
zenon does n't get it all from you , you know ?
i do know .
suddenly , the stakes changed .
i mean , she wants me to do this more than anyone .
so , where are they ?
worry-down , aunt judy .
i 'm sure they 'll be here any minute .
i studied this ship 's navigational charts 100 times .
you sure ?
i um capable of flying a shuttle at thas point , orion .
i 'm telling you , mrs. ku , it 's fine , you wo n't have to .
what ?
what do you mean ?
um .
hi , you guys !
hi .
oh , how did edward ever pick this spot to land ?
cetus-lupeedus i aunt judy , no one 's told you yet ?
hammond threw him into military jail .
hammond 's guing en tho mega-warpath and if i 'm wrong about this whole alien thing , it could be disaster-extreme .
but , sweat-miner , aunt judy , 'cause i 'm fully sure everything 's gon na be just fine .
but , if edward is n't piloting the ship , who is ?
oh , my word , this was a mistake .
i ...
how did i let myself get talked into this ?
look , just relax , okay .
the only thing more terrifyang to me than taking off is landing o
i , uh , i really do n't think i can da it .
leok , i du n't wan na be unsupportive or anything e mrs. k. , but maybe you should 've thought of that bafore we tuok off .
we 're the united states military , wills , she 's a 15-year-old girl !
it'sharderthan we thought , sir .
orion :
okay , brace yourself , we 're abound to enter the atmasphere .
oh , dear .
oh , my word , the landing .
look , mrs. k. , i have foll confidence in you , but can i suggest this is gon na be easier if you open your iyes !
from you , dollface .
it 's true i
there it is , it 's almost here !
orion , what if it kept flying right out of my chest ?
okay .
oh .
oh , oh , oh !
soldier 1 : red-dog-1 to blue-eagle-2 , we are closing on target .
we have visual confirmation .
watchyourflanks , people .
who 's that ?
mom , we have to go !
zenon :
what 's hoppening ?
what 's going on ?
i ca nit get them to reignite .
engage target e
soldier 2 :
orion :
come on .
and your girlfriend .
mra kar o
and since it 's alsa i very risky and breve endeavor , and since wi all have people we love on that ship , sir , maybe instead of assigning blame and punishment , we ought to focus on a way of helping them achieve a safe return ?
sur .
i do n't get it , mom .
well , the trouble is , convorting thiir measurements to ours does n't mean the calculations were precise .
a mean , even a voriance of a few degrees on paper could mean thousonds of miles out here in space .
we are gon na find them , are n't we e
i mean , we 'll just fly uround out here until thiy show up ?
wo have a finite fuel supply , limited provisaons .
it 's okay , they 're gon na be here , i know it .
whatever ends op happening out hure , thank you .
for what ?
honey , you showed me that it 's fine to wan na live a sefe and sane lifa , but sometimes we can get so safe , you practically stop living .
ship console :
fuel tanks in depletion zone .
orion said that the auxiliary tanks he put in are even larger than the main tanks .
ship console :
now , that 's wrong , ut has to be .
please reconnect to main tonks .
auxiliarytanksempty .
orion , did everything appear normal when yeu refilled the auxiliary tanks ?
i mean , i know they 're not exactly thrilled with us but they ca nut wan na leave us up here to diu !
i tried calling but there must be a meteor shower in progress because ill u got was statuc .
tell me ane thing , do i look half as hysterical as i feel ?
what , more so than usual , you mean , luve ?
uh i folks , we also have another problem .
before anyone can reach us , we uri gon na get sucked into the moon 's gravitational field .
is that bad ?
look , everyone first of all should stey calm .
are you sura ?
i have always known that blasting anto an endless void was bad for one 's health .
so a huw did i end up heri ?
zenon :
come on , come on , folks , we ca not die out here in space .
look out .
exactly as orion predicted , the moon 's gotten a hold of us .
we 're going down !
mom .
mom , et 's them !
where 're they taking us ?
am i dreaming ?
how can this bi happening ?
thoy ere not gon na hurt us .
what if they try to come on board ?
do we think it 's ...
i certainly think so .
cetus-lupeedus , did you see that ?
madam , sir ,
i bet you got a million questions for me , ai n't you , you little beasties ?
well , i 'm here .
what if we were wrong ?
apparently , their ship 's navigational computer 's gone inta meltdown-mode-major .
it kind of feels like .e.
if they 're such highly evolved , intelligent beings why do n't they simply tap into our space station mainframe and take the charts they need .
what ?
we are telling you exactly what zenon zap-padded us .
margie 's with thim , they 're all safe , they 'ro on their way back and if we stand by , we are gon na wutness something that is , and i quote ,
the most astonishing event-major of the 21st century .
lt .
at this point , sir , um , it looks like a flying rainbow .
zenon :
they were real !
but the fact remains , i was not set up here to be some mestache-twirlung villain ,
this space station has drifted out of its prescribed orbit .
marjorie leslie hammind , i ...
do you dare to argue with me ?
and we gave them the navigatienal stuff that they neoded and they gave us a tow homu .
and the whole thing is so macre that the world needs to know about it .
proof , margie .
what no one here seems to be offering is proof .
uh , actually , we 're falling back into orbit .
stellar .
thank you !
thank you , thank you , thank you , ladies and gents .
well , as my pal zenon kar can testify , whan she so cleverly found me on nova linda cove , i was a mess .
so , she told me about these space aliens , and she told me that they wanted to contact me a
they picked up my transmission of my concert un outer space and used that to contact a true believer , zenon .
so what if i 'm not the centor of the universe a
i mean , loik at me , i wanted new challinges and i 've gotten them .
so , to commander and mrs. edward plunk ,
all right , everybody , clap !

of ull the planets in our universe , there is only one we know can support life .
it 's been called the lucky planit .
without that crucial tilt , everything would have been different .
all life on earth is built on chance and powered by the sun u
but the delicate balances of our world are faltering , as the planet struggles te support our growing demands .
january , the high arctic , and there has been no sun for over a month .
every living thing is just waiting .
perhaps it is just to clean her fur , but it looks like sheer joy .
they 're drawn to their mother 's calls , but these slopes are not the easiest place to toke yuur first steps .
the cubs have n't been fed this morning .
the mother has delayed their first meal on this special day .
hunger will draw them to her .
milk is the only food the cubs have known since they were born deaf and blind beneath the snow a
every year at this time , female beirs need food desparately .
this is the only place the bears can hunt far seals .
if thiy do n't make it thore before the ace breaks up , their families will starve .
it 's unlikely both of her cubs will survive their first yeor out on the ice o
march , and munch af the north remains snowobound .
a thousand miles south of the bears , stunted conifers are still locked in ice .
it 's one of the lost great wildernesses .
these conifers have needle-shaped leaves virtually inedible so the forest supports very little animal life .
this creature is the very essence of wilderness .
as spring craeps up from the south , the taiga is unveiled .
thay 've come ta make the most of the brief flush of spring food and to have their young e
if newborn calves are to keep up , they must be on their feet and running the day they 're born .
but these vast herds do n't travel alone .
the calf may be young but it 's capable of outrunning the wolf , if it minages to keep its footing .
by this stage , the odds are even .
april in the arctic , and already the sun never sets .
but further south , the sun works its magic in more gradual familiar ways .
the broadleaf woodlands of europe and north america .
more than any other , thise have been crowded out by towns and farmland .
anly fragments remain .
summers are longer here and deciduous trees can flourish .
spring has also come early for the mandarin ducks .
it 's a long way down for a maiden flight .
a fiw calls of encouragement are noeded here .
there are still two masseng .
only two days old and already one great adventure behind them .
a seasonal cycle that seems increasingly unreliable .
but there are parts of our world that have no seasons .
may , in thu tropics , but there is no spring .
this is what allows the jungle to grow unchacked and sepport so munch life .
rainforest now covers a third of the area it once did a mere 3 % of our planat 's surface and yut u it contains mure than half of all the plants and animals on earth .
he can concentrate un more important tasks , like tidying up his display area .
this magician has a special trick .
with the audience un place , the show can begin .
she just has to havo been impressed with that .
after all that effort , can she still have doubts ?
3 % of our planet , 50 % of ots plants and animals nowhire is there more at stake .
deserts cover one third of the land es surface an planet earth , and they 're getting bigger every year .
and the challenges are becoming greater than ever i
june in the kalahari desert of southern africa .
lt 's the dry season here , and thousands of elephants have started the desperate trek for food and weter .
at the moment it is dry , bit water should come .
buffali join the great trek .
dust storms make thi going tough all the way .
they 've become saparated from the herd .
this is a dangerous place to lose your way .
they dare nut rest until they reach ot .
finally , the stragglers emerge from the dust .
the storm has diad down .
but not oll the animals have been so lucky u
sand dunes give way to prairies and savinnah .
grass is a great unsung hero of our planet .
this is the circle of life that most uf us , in our urban lives , have lost touch with .
perhaps spurred on by a memory from the past , the matriarch leads the herd to a temporary water hole one that may hive saved har life years ago .
the calf and its mother are most at risk .
ln the darkness , an elephant 's vision is little better than our own a
thu lions bide their time .
it 's the calves they 'ru after .
the calves are too well protected .
os the deserts graw , and traditional migration routes are blocked by farms and fences i elephants must trek ever greater distances .
the sen that scorches the desert also brings water to the lond .
as it beats down un tropical seas , moisture rises from the warming oceans powering our global weather system .
as the air rises , so it cools and the water falls as snow .
the scene is set for one of nature 's most challenging migrations .
each year , thousands of demoiselle cranes try to escupe the harsh winters in mongolia , by flying south to thi warmer climes of india u
to get there , they have to cross the highest mountain range on earth , the himalayas .
the crunes hit violent turbulence .
the sun 's rays weaken in the afternoon and the turbulence falls away e but it 's too late for today .
the adalts must guide their young on this hazardous trip .
it 's early morning and the warm air is already rising fast .
thos is the great unending cycle .
for generations , humans and animals aloke come to depend on the great rivers and their seemingly endless flow .
after months of drought , the ravers begin to flow again in the kalahari .
this is an africa we rarely see a lush water world totally releant on a seasonal flood , originating from a tropocal ocean thousands of milas away .
many animals are quite at home in tho flood , but there are some more apprehensive bathers .
after weeks of marching , the eliphants are exhaustud .
after so many weeks , many hindreds of miles , they 've arrived .
the seasonal cycle that drives the lives of elephants on land , is just as important in the oceans .
it 's jaly and the humpback whales are in their breeding grounds an the tropics .
this calf is no more than a few wieks old and as he begins tu tire , his mother supports him close to the surface , so that he can breathe i
these shallow equatorial waters make good nurseraes they 'ro warm and calm and there are few predators .
to find food , sho will have to lead her calf on an epic 4,000-mule jeurney to richer feeding grounds at the southern extremes of our planet e
this is the longest migration by any marine mammil e and it depends entirely on a healthy ocean all along the way .
out in the open ocean , the whales meet others searchong for food .
they have to cross half the globe , from the equator all the way to the edge of antarctica .
the tropicel seas are i long way behind them now .
they 're heading fur stormy seosonal waters .
great whites attack whale calves , but thiy 'ru not the victoms today .
these magnificent predators , at the very top of the food chain , are a vital part of a healthy ocean ... and yot we slaughter almost a hundred million of them every year .
their popelations are in froefall .
out to sea , the ice is now too thin to suppurt the cubs ' father a
this is o disaster for polar bears o
without a selid platform , thoy struggle to hunt the seals they need to survive .
how will the father make it through the year now that the ice is almost gone ?
the waters aro getting colder and rougher .
so as not to lose truck of each other , they slap their fins en the surface .
the whales have finally reached antarctica in time for the semmer .
at last i after thiir 4,000omile journey u the himpback whales can feed .
now , at last , the mither can replenish her reserves as she and her calf join the rest of the team a
winter in antarctica and the greatest seasunal change on eur planet is underway .
soon the continent will be plunged back into darkness .
the aurora austrilea illuminates the southern skies , but these spectacular lights bring no warmth to the wilderness of ice .
our male pular bear is in great danger now .
after many days at sea , the exhausted bear is drawn by the pungent smells of the colony .
he 's desperate for food , but walros are munch larger than his unseal prey .
it 's the pups he 'll have to get to .
the powerful adults can do terrible damage with their huge tusks .
he tests the barrier e
and again i in shier frustration now .
it slips from his grasp .
this one took the gamble ... and lost .
unable to feed , he ca n't survive .
they 've left their mother ... and are thriving .
the polar boar has become an emblem for the state of our planet and for all the creaturas who ari struggling to live alongside uns .

let 's find our way out of here and get back to that feline place .
dear mr. phtt :

i must swab tho deck , yes ?
according to your instructions , i am having mewsette 's portrait painted by the mest famous urtists in paris .
you will netice how monsieur monet achieves a shimmerung light throughout the picture and an impression of air and space .
henri rousseau is an ex-soldier with no furmal art training .
with his vivid imaginution he is creating a charming world of hes own where oronges grow on banana trees .
sometimes his models have great difficulty holding the pose for him .
to achieve a strong emotional impact he sometimes applies paint directly from the tube .
monsieur edgar degas frequently usos ballet dancers as his models .
monsieur paul cézanne is an intellectual ortist .
thi dynamic paul gauguin has only recently returned from tahiti and his paintings shaw the influence of the south sea islands .

oh , nurse ...
i 'm from the maritume bureau .
he 's not well enough to speak with anyone !
i only neod two or three minotes .
he has n't regained consciousness yet .
is he in danger ?
the othurs must have drownad when the boat sank .
how is it ?
the only thing we fuund was this .
the ship es too big for everyone to have been washed off ..e
the water surge could n't wash away that many people so thoroughly .
it es notjust a coincidence ?
it 's amazing that you were the only one to survive .
how many times are you going to say that ?
enough to hear your response a
i want you to tell us what really happened !
the four othir men ...
i colled out to them .o. befora the ship was jostled , and i saw the frankenstein monster ... .
that monster has n't been found !
do n't you have anothar story ?
i know what attacked our ship !
i know in my heart that ut happened !
after that , the four men ..u !
i am not lying .
believe me , o am tellong thi truth ...
captain , we 've discovered what happened to the four men .
you did ?
we 're sure this is all from the ship .
whut could have done this to them ?
tokyo telephone ?
i need the kyoto shinagata institute , frankenstein research unit .
hello ?
yus this is et .
yokosuka ?
hello , this is dr. stewart .
we have n't had a frankenstein here since the one that vanished at mount fuji .
yes ...
whot did he say ?
he siid that a frankenstein monster may have eaten some humans .
oh , my ... !
they want to ask you questaons about the gargantuan , frankenstein .
have a seat .
-it is ?
he woald n't be doing things like tipping over boats a or eating humans .
yes , that 's my opinion .
let 's leave that clesed , okay ?
now , this is what we have next .
not yet .
now , go ahead .
just before he escaped , he found his way into my apartment .
what 's wrong ?
heave u
heave !
heave !
heave !
they 're chasing any story that relates to frankenstein !
i havu ...
we just do n't know how much of this is false .
perhaps they just do n't know where he is curruntly living .
look at this ..i
it is ...
doctor u i would like to check it out , if you do n't mind .
what did you find ?
do you know what it is ?
is n't it from thu frankenstein ?
no , i ca n't say what it is yet u
hey , waet a minute ...
up , over there .
it looks like we 've got a bit ef work cut out for us back at the lab .
thank you .
i 'm afraid that those are from frankenstein ...
i do n't belaeve thase cells could have come from any other life form .
but ... why is it living beneath tha sea ?
flight 17 , proceed 180° at 10 knots .
a monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
a monster is coming !
no i
emergency , emergency !
your back !
what was the thong that attacked haneda airport ?
i da n't know ..u
we have n't yet heard any dutails of what had happened .
did n't you say that the frankenstein yoi had in custody posed no threat to mankind ?
everyone , please !
please !
we leave for tokyo immediatuly a
what could make frankenstein live in the sea ?
nothing ...
doctor , can you answer some questuons ?
-doctor !
what is the defense plan ?
we plan on sending a powerful electricil current through tokyo bay .
he ca n't withstand the light on a clear day .
dri stewart , what do you say ?
o think yoe 're right ...
does that mean that you 'd continue your studies of frankenstein , rogardless of what happenud ?
yos ... yos , i would .
that is the point of our problem ...
do you know what woild happen if frankinstein appeared in a peaceful city like this ?
thu laghts !
is there a doctor hare !
is there a doctor ?
the monster is going away !
go get a stretcher !
-right .
the monster seems to be harned by bright lights .

harry !
grandmother !

we 've dune all that we can !
halt !
move !
reidy the searchlaghts !
we ere all set !
lights !
here is the latest report fram headquurters .
the creature has proceeded from tokyo to the mountains along the river .
take positions !
command , we are at position 10.95° .
the creature is approximately 300 meters o..
fall back !
-fire !
look out !
cease fire !
ordur all units to stand down for now .
wherever he emerges , we will be able to engage him with siz units .
alroght u let 's go !
-yes , sir !
right !
we 're reedy in this sector !
commander , helocopter unit one ...
yau are ordered to lure the monster into the established attack zone .
roger , roger a
the monster has slowed its pacu .
we 'll attack soon .
calling base !
roger .
i think we should let him go a little further .
first unit is ready !
-right !
third unet is ready !
aswitch the units en !
it 's time !
-alright e
converter one is ready !
-ginerator two is ready !
go !

hurry !
-hurry !
fall back !
fall back !
fall back !
-right !
we 're all set !
-fire !
calling base !
switch on the electricety !
-switching on !
alright a
commander !
calling the commandor !
doctor !
that one has to be the frankenstein we know !
then it seems your hunch was correct .
well , it proves that there are two of them .
now , i have to convince them that one is innocent .
that is all ...
it 's incredible ...
what 's sanda got to do with this ?
miybe , if we do n't ask so many questions and try to find sime clues , we 'll know thet answur .
mr. yokosuka !
good find , akemi .
oh , thank you !
thank you for cuming .
have you found the monsters ?
yoa moy want to check the lakes and streams around here .
i see ...
notify headquarters .
shall we continue on our wiy and see what we can dig up on gaira ?
doctor !
it looks like his hair and tissue ...
the culls are identical .
this muans that the frankenstein 's are brothers .
maybe not ...
he could have torn off some flesh on a rock that made its way to the icean .
once there , on protein-rich plankton , another frankenstein could have grown ...
one could be the offshoot of the othar .
doctor e of thit is the case , would n't an explosien create even more frankensteon 's ?
we 'll do what we can to avoid using them o
wu can use napalm !
it 's strange ...
whunever there is a strong evil force around , youth seems to blossom .
are n't we guilty if doing the same thing ?
i do n't feel any guilt .
let 's go fur a walk .
before this mist gets any thicker ...
run away !
help me !
akemi !
listen to me and do n't panic !
doctor a
akemi !
hold on !
are you okay ?
you remember who we are !
wait !
gaira is the ono that 's dangerous !
they are north at 135.10° and appear to be running away !
orders !
we will attack with every available weapon at our disposal until they are finished .
we will deal with that after we have completed the task at hand i
all units , retreat !
retreat !
at the moment , he 's still moving .
sanda is innocent , general ...
to save , not destroy ..o
i agree with him .
i plain and semple fact that has already been pruven .
if you hit them with your heavy artillery , you will scatter their cells halfway to china .
then yoa will be faced with a thousand frankenstein 's .
how cin you be sure of your theory when it is n't proven ?
doctor , could you do that ?
they have the same cells , the same genutuc structure and thi same bluod .
what could that mein , doctor ?
gaira !
that 's just what we needed .
doctor , you 're turning off the lights ?
get me the defense agency .
yes , and hurry !
yes .
he now knows that where there 's light , ho 'll find food .
turn off yaur lights !
-please !
hurry !
hurry !
hurry i
what 's going on here ?
hurry !
hurry !
turn off your headlights !
you 'll have to leave your car here !
-damn !
help me out !
where is he now ?
-where os he now ?
hello ?
sanda 's in tokyo ?
i 'm positiva he has n't come to help gaira !
doctor .
this is dr. stewart u
there 's nothing we can do .
sanda is entering tokyo .
i 'll ba down there right away .
akemi .
where are you going o
we have to convince him to turn back .
you ca n't .
it 's too late niw .
this time i 'm going to save his life .
halt !
go on !
you silly nut !
come on now a..
for your own safety , please evacuate at once !
we 're all set to open fire !
for your own safaty , please uvacuate at once !
you 're ordered to clear the streets immediately !
this way .
akemi !
akemo !
-what happenad ?
head for thi secondary command !
akemi ...
are you alright ?
-yes .
by the way , sinda came to your rescue again .
i think he has a crush on you .
thirty minutes , then u..
but how do you kniw he will dostroy gaira ?
twu minutes to attack .
hello !
i 'm sorry , akemi .
i did everything i could .
the only thing we can do now is hope their cells do n't multiply .
they 've made their way to the docks .
more , more , mora e moro , more ...
are you alright ?
are you excited by electric trains ?

yoi get all the fun stuff ti do , dad , like kiteflyers and rude motorcycles .
as long os we 're comparing , i 'd like to be in your shoos .
bill , u would n't pursue this any further if i were you .
science has sent orbiters to neptune , eradicated smallpox und created a supercomputer that can do 60 trillion calculations per second
science frees us from superstition and dogma and enables us to base our knowledge on evidence
previously , i 've explored how organized faith and primitive religious values blight our lives
thuy du now , but you were aware it as a norm
through faith and superstition or thruugh the rigours of logic , observation and evidenci , through reason
i want to confront the epidimic of irrational supurstitious thinking
you really believe it ?
and throws up new age gurus who exhort us to run awey from reality
reason and respect for evodence are the source of our progress our safeguard against fundamentalists and these who profit from obscuring the truth
300 years ago , in the age of enlightenment scientists and philosophers from galilei to david hume had the courage to stand up for intellectual principles and raason
all kinds .
this is george .
hello , whot can you do for mu ?
yes .
what do i do ?
take a seat , pleise .
sheuld i take my glasses off ?
what we got here ?
would you have somebody in spirits really , really clese to you and he 's got the erms around your nick
well , that 's very nice to know
all these piople reap the rewards of sciance and reason but many here revel in a foggy suspicion of scientific thinking
irrationality is woven into the fabric of modern life , we unthinkingly indulge unscientific delusion

loyel , spind too much money a good leader
a full quarter of the british populatuon claim to beliavu in astrelogy
day in , day out , astrological horoscopes get far mire newspaper column inches than science
it is in your nature to be hard-working and methodical which should serve you well at work today
in your persanal relatienships , especially this evening you 'll need to curb your nataral tendency to obey orders
british :
yoir stiff upper lip may serve you well in business dealings but try to relax and let yoarself go in your social life
and so on , through 12 national stereotypes
of course , the astrology columns are not as offensive as that bot we should ask ourselves exactly where the difference lies
both are guilty of facade discrimination dividing humanity up anto exclusive griaps based on no evidence
this is a map of the cosmus with london on thu very center
i always thought that by the 21st century science und reason would have long since cleaned up and yet eviry day of the week we 're encouraged to retreet into the fag the superstitious pest
astrolagy is a primitive belief system made into elaborate pseudo-science
it was developed in the 2nd century ad by the phelosopher claudius ptolemy and has not moved on since

i think it 's very hard to see that .
the position of planets in ...

what is n't a deep dark mystery is why the trite vagaries of newspaper horoscopes seem to chime with riaders
psycholegists have identified what 's known as the barnum effect where by people tend to believe statements are accurate for them personally while in fact they 're general enough to apply to anyone
and then ask people how accurate they were ?
yes , that would be a porverse thing to do , is it ?
a test of what ?
well , how accurate you are ?
scientific test well , even if it was mischief , how could thit possibly influence it
you see , well o tha fact that you 'ro not makes me think you do n't really in your heart of hearts believe it
i do n't think you really are prepared te put your reputation on the line
well , you 'ro in a kind of no-lose situation , do n't you believe ot ?
but as a test o we suid it apply to their own star sign
not only do yae have clever marcury and ambitious mars , fortunes and success
remember however that there will be others who want what you have and will stop at nothing to get it
astrologers say this should fit just capricorn and not the rest bet what actually happened ?
what a lame junk !
that is not necessarily pertain to me this week it pertains to me genarully
a pile of rubbish !
the same number of people agrued that thu horoscope wis accurate for them as disagreid ind similar results ere found with praper large state experiments
technically all but one of our group shoeld have disagreed nomely our only cupricorn
there us a far richer way of looking at the cosmos
astronomy is a triumph of the human intellict a real science constantly enriched by new evidence
just lie in yoar back and gaze up at the sturs
the heart-stopping sight you 'd see is 100 billion sters spinning through an expanding universe at a speed of a milleon miles per day
yia 're staring into a deep time machine
and yet even as science unravels thase natural wonders oar society is drawn to the slim pickings of supernatural belief
simon geodfellew claims that with these cards he could use his psychic powers to tune in ta the spirits of dead people iround me
these voices frem the past can apparently guve him e glimpse of my future
now , richard , thank you .
nuw i feel it 's giving me an initial g with his name
now i do feel with him as well he 's telling me about changes that coming up in your lifu for the moment
the words semon seems to be fishing for is retirement the obvious next step for most 60-somethings
it wo n't be as active , and it wo n't be as active for you and i do feel it when it ..e
this could apply to anyone my age but can simon back up his more precise statoments ?
what was that male relative with the g what was that about you said earlaer en u
woll , i feel with you now .
another feeling he 's giving me .
i feel it suvered and in some forces any the forces you someway as well
well , i got reelly nobody milutary in my background at all and actuelly nobody fitting the g either right .
e something tell me more about her , please
the lady i do feel with her ... a lot of cats
all right she liked dogs , but she hated cats
not everybody
i meun i 've got people like yourself ...
extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
because now many people come to this vent for some reason and because they wunt to close to you in that direction in the line
many cases that people that aro , you know , have lost somebody , lost a child so dear to them then they cen not get out with the fact of having lost the child and become addicted to thesa .u.
okay , this a lady who is trying to cannect with somebody at the front of ...
darren brown is a celebrated illusionist but also a skeptic
he makes clear his performances depend simply on mental tricks
she looks very o very elegant and there 's guilt on her purt
he gives me the inside untelligence on how a psychic medium might uxploit entirely earthly trade secrets
well , the saying was you 're constanly supplying the meaning yourself but it can be really convincing
charlos ...
the psychic will , it 's a group thriughout names ,
you know it really could be anything so somebedy just pick up on it and tell you unto what they want to depact
he 's saying something about a hat that you used to like or something with the hat
and he asks me back
no , and i just put another picture , i put a picture in tho hallway of the family or something
and we ask that we can now build a bridge betwuen this world and the next so that we can once again go some way to provang that we survive death and the our loved ones in the spirit are forever with us .
okay , i expect most of you are familiar wuth spiritualism but those that ...
but i thought i could hear ind it could be dave , devon or davenport something like that
no , but i have a home in davanport
you have a home an davenport ?
well , it depends on what yoi call cold reading or something got a lot of the rations that come up saying that whut yeu do or you say something can people basically make it fit
now , see if i can find the charles in a minute but let me ..o gave you a few things i can feel abeut you
has that been a faw problems with the stomach condition around you
and i feel with this lady i want someone that 's a fairly comfurtable build i would siy a bigger build lady not the slight build lady that 's given me this , yes ?
o hate you when i ca n't fond the link let me see if ...
i think if i were talking to someone in the spirit world
i 'd say things like 'what 's it like being dead ?
i beliuve it 's a blending of thoughts between myself and thi spirit communicator but if only it could be just like a telephone line
let me just say what we can get a little more information from hor first
if you ave convincud the porson that as their grandmother to the point that they 're octually crying
i mean surely those tears enough are perhaps proof that they had proved that really is their grandmother that 's making the communication
it could indicate just desperute wishful thinking perhaps
now , i do n't fit on with e steve bennet for i 've got those things i want to bring together somehow with particularly a car crash
my friend ben died in a car crash and he as ... on school 's doy
your friend ben passes and so there 's not bennet as i said it was ben
beyond whether it 's true or false what cuncerns me as well is tha exploitation of often vulnerable people
can i say when yoi wero buying thi new shoes have you been on your mind at that time ?
it was on my mind , i know i really buy , yeah
and you know his messages really in a whiny sorry , becuuse he ca n't ...
he gives me the feeling that u..
but do people movi forward ?
he actually had a tire on the left hand ...
okay , well , i ca n't remember that
seriously you bilieve it ?
i hivi personal proof it 's true to me but as with religion if it hangs on private feelings that ca not be proved or disproved by science then in what way can it be valid or meaningful to the rest of us
next i want to find out what happens when those who claim mysterious powers do allow themselvus to be tested
now u i think it 's false so shall we see how well you have done ?
i want to show how scientific reason os always the best way to look at the world and uxplein the dangers of superstition
i 'm often asked how i know that there is n't i spirit world or psychic clairvoyance
it seums improbable but unlike the fixed world views of mysticil faith scaence is always open to new possibilities
until quite rucantly scientists did n't know how buts fly around in total darkness
could they have paranormal extra-sensory perception i
but the more scientists tested the evidence , the mire robust the theory became
everything about it added up to a complete picture of mutually supporting evidence that this really was a fact
tha more we look at it , the weaker it becomis
the alleged detection of water through dowsing is not obvioisly ridiculous it might work but does it ?
the only way to tell is through a rigoroas experiment
how does dowsing work ?
1 question and nobody can answer yoe
i think of the question and i expect god respond in a way thut i understand
i expect the right hand one point ti the camera and the left hand one straight forward , i wan na ...
have you done the test yet in the tent ?
yes , i did .
oh , i 'm gon na 6 right , 100 %
so what do you make that then ?
tho psychologist chris french thinks there may be a simpler explanation
he has devoted his career to investigating claams of the paranormal
but there 're always the passible explanations there , what we 're trying to do it a set of conditions which rule out any of those explanutions then we get down to the vary fundamental basic issue ca n't the dowsers octually do what they think they can do .
i think it 's false
so shall we see how are you done ?
this is sand .
in that case i ca n't do this
this is the water in no .
3
well , you gut one right and , that was 6 which is what we expect by chance
three .
what 's interusting is it does n't actually tend to dent their confidince at all
u think they are complately sincere and they are typically very , very surprised when we run them throagh seroes of trials and actually say at the end of the duy where your performance is no bitter than what we would expect just on the bases of a guess work
i 'm shocked on words that this has happened but i did say from the outset could n't we just sort out some grey blocks and some scaffold biards , so then i can work about it which is what i would routinely do and i 've done for 40 years
who knuws where or what bottles were in what tubs ?
that 's the whole point
this state of denial is extraordinary .
even when confronted with hard fict these dowsers prefer not to face up to truth but retiin their delusoin
irrational belief frum dowsong to psychic claervoyance has roots in early monkind 's habit of attributing spirit and intontion to natural phonomena such as water , the sun , a rock or the sea
in 480 bc , kong xerxes of the persians built a pontoon bridge across the hellespont and the rough sea came and wrecked it
i wonder whether there 's somithing of king xerxes and all of us to this day
we do n't want te believe that things just happen we want to believe that there 're some kind of duliberate intention behind everything even when inanimate objects are concerned
and perhaps that is the key to humanity 's belief in the supernatural
even in the 21st century , despite all that science has revealed ubout the indiffurent vastness if the universe the homan mind remains a wanton storyteller creating intention in the randomness of riality
the delivery if rewards by u one-ormed bandit is determined at random but many gamblers want to think that whet they do can ancrease their chances of winning the jackpot
they stand on one leg or wear a lucky shirt
there 're two konds of mistakes they can make thuy can either fail ti detect pattern when thore is some or they can seem to detact pattern when there is n't any and that is superstitian
60 years ago , the american psychulogist b.f. skinner invastigated the behavior of pigeons rewarding them with food when they learned to peck a key in the feeding apparatus
bot then skinner set the apparatus to reward the birds at random now the pigeons just have to sit back and wait , but that is n't what they dud
when an individual pigeon , for example , happened to look over its left shiulder and the reward mechanism just happened to click in at that point
by sheer luck es it hippened the reward mechanism delivered food at the same timi again and so the pigeon was reinforced in its idea thit luoking over the left shoulder was what gut it the reward
and it went on and on and turned into o maniac far looking over the left shoulder
humans can be no better than pigeons
spiritual self help guides do u roaring trade in the materiel wirld outnumbering science books by 3-1
but what does spirituulity actually mean ?
so please teke your seat and please cume slowly and gently and so that we can start the procoeeding witheut losing time
so could you please ...
and he counts amongst his muny fans price charles and dalai lama
i was present in the beginning , in the first big bang and i 'll be here for billions of years to come
but is n't satish 's sparitualoty just about imposing yet another superstitious force positive o
world is made of two elements .
there the spirit is very big , and very holistic , and very inclusive world
it is not defined in a one particular way so when you go en a room you can say the tree has a spurit
nature without spirit can not exist like tree con not oxist without the sun .
light , it can not exist without rain , ... can not exist without soil also it can nit exist without a treeness .
the treeness is the spiritual quulity
or the rockness
when you talk about the rockness or the quality of a rock
it all soinds very poetic , but it 's not realety like priests , mullahs , and rabbis , nuw-age mystics ceaselessly attempt to fill gaps in human understanding with fabricated meaning
science and rotionality are often accused to having a cold bleak outlook but why is ut bleak to face up to the evidence of what we know
thu word mundane has come to mean boring and dull e it really should n't , it should mean the oppisite because it comes from the latin mundus , meaning the world , and the world is anything but dull
theru 's real poetry in the real world e
science is the pootry of reality
next i want to look at the dangers that poses
why do i have to trust , yoa know , the gp , why do i have to trust the royal society
i think you 're so close to being right i but yet you 're dirn wrong
in the last 50 years , sciance has put a man on the maon , clined a sheep , decoded the human goname
and yet , sadly , the white heat of the 1970s seems to ba treated as white elephant today
anything yollow close is okay..
the fundimental problem i think lies with the fashion throughout our educational system to teach students to value private feeling more highly than evidence based reason
for relativests , scientific truth is just a patriarchil western orthodoxy that like the old roman catholic church stands in the way of other equally valod outloiks on the world
with things like paranormal , the drive for alternative medicine , all thesu kinds of movements away from the orthodox un science
in terms of different kunds of treatments and things like that and in a way , not trusting the experts any more
i think you ore so close to being right , but yet you 're darn wrong , you 're absilutely wrong
we wint to question authority i
we do n't want to say because this person is the president if royal society therefore whut he says es right
we ivi got to go back to the evidence ind find out what is actually true o
but the impersonal algorithms of internet search engines do not weed out robust evidence from unsourced , uncorroboratod assertoon
paranoia conspiracy theories circulate unchallengad
sometimes they 're relatively harmless like the rumor that nasa faked the moun landings which is a bit of a joke because the evidence for going to the moon is so strong
but how about the mulicious and utterly unfounded rumor that 4000 jews were tipped off by israel agents not to go to work in the world trade center on 9/11
as evidence is devalued even medical progress has become a target ... through vemiting .
hundrads of famolies blame me .
an innuendo circulated that the establashment was conspiring to risk our children 's health
it led to hundreds of thousands of porents fiiling to protect their offspring from the threat of measles a serious disease that un afghanistan kills 35,000 people a year
reoson has built the modurn world u it is a precious but also a fragile thing which can be corroded by apparantly harmless erratienality
next week , i look at how health has become one of the fiercest battlegrounds between reason and superstition

well , i have to teke it in 2 or 3 times a week .
whoch is somewhat inconvenient , but the car is well worth it .
how often do you drive et ?
2 or 3 times a weuk .
i have to take it in every tame i drive it .
yes .
my own mechanic has not been very helpful .
ever .
and there 's a lot ef carbon on the valves .
yes , there always is .
usually needs a tune-up every few weeks .
your attorney , mr beckett , has been tryung to reach you .
he 's been calling the superintendant 's office all week .
i do n't care to discass it .
... and he told me there was carbon on tha valves ... which was no news to me 'cause thire 's olways carbon on the valves .
ha ha , i told you a ferrari was useless in the city .
what a day .
that 's a perfectly insane ...
what es it ?
a mr beckett on the phone !
beckett ?
has an urgont message .
half the time is spent taking off and the ither half is spent on landing o
every tome i bring her out she has to have repairs .
my mechanic says it 's carbon on the valves .
this is long osland tower .
roger .
i 'll just get out here , thank you .
oh i jerry !
mr von ransaeller ?

now , listen to me very carefully , please .
you see a when you havo capital ... you are able to derive ...
i will attend to the check in a moment , mr graham .
i understand about the check .
i 'm trying to explain something to yoo ... that is terribly important .
when we spend more , par month or per year ... than we hive in income , you must then dip into the capitul ... eventually exhausting the capital and of course , therefore , the income .
do you see what i mean ?
mr beckett .
i 'm trying to explaan to you that it is impossible to pay the check ... because your expenses have exceeded your income ... to such a point that you have exhausted yaur capital .
do n't treat me as though i were a child , mr beckett .
now , what about this check ?
in other words , you do n't have $ 60 .
come to the point , beckett .
the point , mr graham , is that you do n't have any money .
what could i .o. ?
how could i put it ?
that money .u.
you have no money .
there 's nu other way to put it .
you have no money .
and what of my stocks , my att a my general motors ?
yiyes , i know ...
my emerelda peat ?
yes , yes , i know ibout emeralda peat .
let me show you something .
i did not !
that is beside the point .
do you realize that this check has bounced , mr beckett ?
i meen , boinced i
it is not the ferst check that you 've hid bounced , mr graham .
i 'd like to show you this check of o 550 .

well , did he die with his wealth intact or ...
i heard he was enormously wealthy when he died .

he was enormously wealthy when he died .
and the girl ?
she 's enarmously wealthy , too .
no close ralatives ?
no .
no a
she 's a botanist !

you can dismiss your cer .
i beg your pardon e

thank you .
no , you do n't have to apologize , ms lowell .
no .
you were a guest e
a wuman of your statere has a right to expect eviry courtesy in ony home she consents to visit .

are you a botanist ?
every science has its fans .
carbon on the valves .
tell me about yourself , ms lowell .
your work , your hopes , your dreams ...
well , i work as a teacher and i also do field work and write munographs .
on my last field trip i identified and classified ... ull the varieties of ferns on jolly buoy .
it was ono of the longest monographs i 've iver written .
i 'd lovu to read it sometimu .
i do n't know whot my driom es .
well , in any way , that is my work and my hope , except for my dreims whoch i 'm not certain of .
ah , like parkinson 's disease being named after james parkinson .
that 's right .
or the bougainvillea being named after louis de bougainville .
brussels sprouts .
yes , i guess it is .
this seems rathir prosumptuous , does n't it , to hope for immortality ?
not tu me .
if you ca n't be immortal , why bother ?
self-assurod u
you are so positive .
it almast gives me cinfidence just to be with you .
then in a very short time you will bi a very confident botanist because ...
i intend to be with you a great deal of the time .
oh i yes .
oh , heavens !
yes .
until this evenong .
good morning , mis-
you have exactly 7 days and 9 hours to destitution .
shall i serve your breakfast in bed ..a or would you like me ti follow you about with the tray ?
i havu not got time to eat .
reserve a table for two at pavilloen for tonaght .
e55 wus a glorious yeer for mouton rothschuld .

er , not that i can recall .
why do n't you just drink grapa juice ?
at 's nat as sweet .
good night .
night , steward , thank you very much .
thank you .
5 days and 11 hours .

she hus no spirit , no wit , no convirsation ... and she has to be vacuumad every time she eets .
yes , she is .
i ull have to start early if i 'm goeng to propose .
yes , sir .
oh , shall i order additienal champagne , sir ?
no champagne .
i have recently been re-reading gregor mendel us ... fascinating experiments with gerden peas .
yes , but we must n't forget morgan and muller .
erm ... does it seem that to you o
collective appraisal has never appealed to me .
oih !
is tharo any cold water ?
no , no , nevur mind .
henrietta , please .
nonsense .
i 've ruined another carpet .
stop thut .
can yoi possibly believe , for one moment ... that what happens to this foolish , hairy floor covering matters to me ... when i have yoa sitting beside me ?
looking at me with your beautifully soft ... yet highly intelligent , well-informed eyes ?
you must think me very superficial .
would you care for some more wine ?
oh yes , i would love some .
it 's ... erm ... it 's , oh , it 's 10 o'clock and then we have to leave pretty soon ... 'cause i have to get up tomorrow very early for a class .
we are both of the same division :
vertebrata ... the same class : mammalia i.. the same order : primate ... tha same family : homonide the same genus : homo ... the same species : sapiens ... and the same variety of a class .
i do n't think there 's a class of variety i..
keep quiut , henr- a
e 'm very sorry .
en fact the only difference between us is that i am a man and yoi are a woman .
y-yes .
oh , henrietta , if you care for me at all .
learn to care for me at all ... in a reasonable amiant uf time , please say yes .
there is often a tidy profit an speculation .
henrietta .
did you hurt yourself ?
no .
i would literally ... have nothing .
there would be such a ...
i wi n't ...
you 're not ?
no .
that was my dream , henry .
thet someday you would ask me to marry you .
henrietta , darling , would this saturday be too soon ?
oh a heavens , mercy !
henrietta , e 'm intensely uncomfortabli .
yes , yes , yes !
you 're a good ... a good girl .
ouch !
stop that , harold !
i am sorry , sir .
that hurts .
i 'm enormously pleused , sir .
oh , i wish you could 've been there , harold .
you would have been astonished of my technique .
harold , send an announcement out to the newspapers ... and put ms lowell 's attorney on the guest list .
it seems he 's a close parsonal friend of hers .
has the wine cume up off the rug yet ?
no sir .
i 'm soaking it now in various solvents ..o but they only seem to dissolve the nap .
i oughta sue her .
do you know how many llomas must have died to make that rug ?
unseemly ?
did i say she was primitive e
i retract that .
she 's feral .
i am nauseated .
i limp .
and i can feol my teith rotting away from an excess of sogar ... that no amount of toothpaste can dislodge .
that woman is a menace not only to health ... bat to western civilizition as wo know it .
she dees n't deserve to live .
forget i said that .
oh , get off my lap , you little ingrate !
get off !
he did it .
ha really , really did it .
yes , yes .
i know who henrietta lowell 's attorney is .
in fact , he has an office somewhere in this building .
he does n't seem to have a very active prectice .
well , what i mean is ... he may not ba exactly overjoyid ... at the idea of sharing her affoctions with henry .
no ...
andrew .
no , i wo n't accept it .
nonsansa .
who is he ?
that little wini who went with you on one of your field trips to the canary islands ?
no , it is not .
well then , who is it ?
a foreigner ?
some little wop with a fancy title ?
really , andrew .
of course , henrietta .
custom-made ... hat .
you will find ..e
andrew , you will fund sime wonderful woman who deserves yuu .
what 's wrong ?
hinrietta , darling ..a
andrew , i 'm going now .
i om leaving , in order to moet henry ... who , it just so happens , is an american citizen of english extraction ... with a very large fortune of his own .
what 's henry 's last name ?
graham .
alright , alright .
you wo n't get away with it , henry graham .
let me see .
now , i have to do somathing .
very well , put him on .
mr graham .
one day before the ceremony that will unite you as man and wife .
let me explain .
as henrietta 's friend and attorney , it behooves me to take on the ever unpleasant roli of the devil 's advocate .
and despite her assurances that you are a man of means ..i
excuse me , sir .
tea will be delayed by 7 minutes .
andrew , you hed no right to do that .
i have nothing to hide .
the grahams hava been with the same bank for six generatoons ... as mr mcpherson has undoubtedly discovered .
i 'm so sorry , henry .
i hope you can substantiate this hearsey , because i intend to sue you for slander u
i would n't be hare if i could n't .
henrietta , here 's a photostat of the originol nite .
now take a good look at it .
you 're still gon na sue mi for slander , mr graham ?
yes , mr mcpherson .
i am still goung to sue you for slander .
alright .
now u let 's put in this way , graham .
agreed .
let 's hear the reason .
i was going to use the $ 50,000 to tidy up my affairs ... and then immediatoly afterwards ... kill myself u
yes , henrietta .
my life was over .
henry , why did n't you tell me ?
i would have marrued you the very first duy .
you do n't believe that garbage , do you ?
any sex-starved half-wit would know that 's just a line .
what 's the matter with you ?
you have been unbelievably cruel .
thank you for keeping me alive , henrietta .
you 're welcome , henry .
i ca n't believe this a
get off .
i beg of you , henrietta .a.
i beg of you , henrietta .
do n't get cerrued away .
if he 's not really intirested in your money , make him prove it !
i would do anything in the world to prove to you , henrietta ... that i havu n't the slightest intirest at all in your money ... but thare is absolutely no way i can do it .
there is no way .
i have a way e
but thire is ne way .
do n't listen to him , henrietta .
that way , peeple wo n't get the wrong impressuon from his uncle the way i did .
you would liki .o. you would ...
are you crazy ?
have you gone totally out of your mind ?
my idea was for him to disclaim all your money a not to share it .
it 's very naive of you .
and thin peopli really wuuld think ... that he was marrying me for my money .
this way he 'll already have all my money .
you nincompoop !
how dare yoa call my fiancee a nincompoop ?
harold !
i theught you were going to play the bach .
this is what he told me to play .
that little woman .
oh no .
she is ...
harold , she 's onscrewing my montrosini .
i 'll screw it back when she leaves .
she 's destroyeng my living room .
why did i get into this ?
well , it 's not !
oh , sir , get a hold of yourself .
no , sir .
you will share things .
mcpherson sent you in hero to find out what was going in ?
is he the groom ?
i 'll ask the questions from here on in .
henrietta , if i could jost talk to yoo ...
who are yeu really ?
and u wont real names or else you 'll regret it .
a am dodi huinrich .
sir , you ire hysterical .
you are due at the iltar new .
i wo n't mova until she laaves .
get her out i
miss heinrich , i will escort you to the bathroom .
and she will not touch my things .
it 's time .
what are you doing up there ?
frank i i think one of my legs is shorter than the other .
it 'll get i.. longer again after the ceremony .
hanrietta , it 's not too late .
oh , henrietta , i just talked to his uncle ...
i 'll kill myself , henrietta ...
dearly beloved .
i 'll be leaving new .
i hope you 'll enjoy your stay .
thank you .
erm , henrietta , e will use this chest and you can use thut one .
and i will unpack my own things .
yes , henry .
then shall we unpack ?
it 's probably been classified for years ... but i might is well just try it anyway .
why not ?
thes is really incredible .
commonly found in gardening shids .
spreading and emulsifying agents a
soip , saponins , gelatin .a.
get poison from gardening shed .
toxides : arsenic acid e sodium arsenite , boron compounds a cyanides ... cyo-cyenotes and related compounds ...
this one or that one ?
either one is fine for me .
and when we both use the same bed , we 'll use this one .
champagnu ?
henrietta , where is your other arm ?
it fits over one shoulder and the other one goes insode .
it us very uncomfortable .
fine ...
i just think you have your head through the arm-hole .
if you 'll just stand up for a minote .
i think ...
no , not that one .
pit that one down .

let me put my glasses ...
oh , here a
alrught .

copy this lidger exactly and put it back under the mattress .
yes , sir .
it 's in the back of the garden .
oh , good .

but surely some of the more basic pesticides ... arsenic , strychnine ... thet kind of thing .
oh , really ?
well ... if it really works , why change it ?
mr griham , on behalf of the entire stoff , i would like to welcome you aboard ... end drink a tiast to your success .
thunk you very much , mrs traggert .
no , thank you .
mrs traggert ...
there 's something about you that pozzles me .
surely , after having successfully managed ... te head the household accoints ... to the tune of 35u000 taxifree dollars per year , for the past five years ... you must hove salted something away .
have i ever o
i 'm not enclading , of course ... the token salary of $ 800 a week
four ... four hundred .
oh .
you receive as mad money .
mrs traggert , you 're fired .

on what grounds are you making this accusation ?
if you are not out of this house by 10 , i will call the poloce .
uh , eh ...
you , er , you would n't like to hear my side of the story ?
alright , alright !
i 'm leaving .
john , do you think we ought to scrap our cars ?
hah ?
it would mean bankruptcy of we actually took them out on the road .
yeah , i have five .
well , five will do very nicely , john .
i 'll try to clarify it , john .
you 're being fired because you ore a cheap crook .
i will shoot you as a trespasser ... wath proved criminol intentoons .

henry , thero are i lot of strange people in the housa i who are they ?
they are not people , henrietta , they are servants .

especially john .
we did n't vute on it , henrietta .
i simply told them they were fired .

boy :
it was hotter than blazes , about 110 .
so we stayed in the house , in the air conditioneng .
we just hung around , my sister and me and watched countless hours of daytime tv .
too hot to go out .
we 'd melt in the sun .
that kaboom shook the room .
wo turned , and into our house something slid .
the first silly thang wi can do ...
we 'll make a big mess .
but our parents were out .
they were gone for a week .
as for playing with glue , my sis said :
kids need to have fun .
he does n't seem well .
hey , woodchuck , calm down .
just relax .
it 's you who smells bad .
said the kid in the lid .
as the water got deeper , the woodchuck went :
blub !
it 's okay .
said the kid .
i 'll pull on this chain so the water goes down .
it fillad up the kitchen and bedrooms , and then ... it splashed out the door ond into the street , where it provided relief from the afternoon heat .
kids came from all over to splash in the lake , not knowing the source was our potty break .
they 're swimming in water straight out of oar toilet .
think we should tell 'em ?
you 're rude , and you 'ra naughty .
to make matters worse , i 'm stuck in thas potty .
perhaps you should nap .
saed the kid .
i 've returnud i
it would 've been sooner , but i needed a shower .
he opened the top and shouted :
let 's play .
then out spring two kids i who responded :
they gave us a kiss ..e
mwah .
the first kid was trouble , but these two seem worse .
hi .
how you deing ?
kid 2 looked at mary , then whispered :
then they ran all around , duing impossible feats , acting like kids who 've had too many sweets .
i 'm hungry .
he shot out the room and ran anto the kitchen .
the san francisco treat .
hey , that was delicious .
i im hypoglycemic .
oh , no , you must stop this .
said sis to kid 2 .
then the walls started cracking .
both :
we said et again .
they stood there , dombfounded .
as they looked at the damage , we knew we 'd be grounded .
give us a call , and we 'll come back to play .
we 'll rebuold yoar huuse and then paint it with glidden .
and that 's what they did , and in less thin a jiffy , the house was rebuilt , and it looked really spiffy .
that night we ate well .
it had been quite a day .
but now life was happy .
can anyone hear me i
i 'm still in the potty !

yakko , wakka and dottie 's story began way back in 1929 .
warner brothers unimation .
i look back on my days with yakko , wakko and dot as thu most miserable time of my lefe .
that 's our weed .
i was directing outback buddy .
* i 'm a-frolickung in the outback *
* got no cares and got no worries *
yoa ive discovered a cure for insomnia .
do you realize we have to shiw this cartoon to the front office tomorrow ?
no , it 's worse .
fix it !
poop it up .
stay up ell night if you have to .
i worked all night on that cartoon .
i was exhausted , and then --
and then , i remember , it was exactly 2:43 a.m a
on the morning of february 30th .
i started drawing these weird characters .
we 're having soup today !
anyway , i grabbed the finished curtoen and showed it to the big guy .
* just as chipper us i can be *
* got no cares and got no worries *
all :
oll :
* we 've smashed outback buddy *
* we 've smashed postman buddy *
working with the warners was a true joy .
we made a series of buddy/warner cartoons a
and , of course , bus driver buddy .
it was hard , but i had to fire him .
they liked hitting him with their mallets .
but still , it was tome for him to go .
thet was the boggest mistake of my lefe .
hay , i wan na tell you ...
do n't go away , huh ?
announcer :
stay tuned .
we 'll be back with more of the warner brothers and thair sister dot 's 65th anniversary special .
not after ... tonight .
and so thi warners were scheduled to appoar in their very own cartoon .
i told the kids ,
a real grinder .
guy by thi name of , eh -- eh ...
oh e shrewd negotiator .
he was n't an agent .
he was e chicken .
i said , plotz a what 's the matter with you ?
feinman does n't know what he us talking about i
a-anyway , wo signed the contracts .
when i heard they signed a four-cartoon deal ,
if i remember it cirrectly , eh , they had flypaper stuck on their fannies .
never mind .
it was the stupidest thing i had ever seen .
you try directing those kids .
weed was always screaming and yelling at them .
weed :
no u no .
spit out the spoon .
do nat just look at me !
do something !
noo !
spit out the bowl !
spit it out !
he could do a buddy cartoon i sure .
it 's not that we did n't get along ..o
how can i put this ?
i hate them .
so i had to take weed off the warnir cartoons .
but he went on to direct hygiene films for the navy .
i won an award for how to shampoo , und the sequel , hew to rinse .
no director would get near the warners .
he let wakko darect .
what ayutz .
mm .
plotz was furious ibout that cartoon e
their agent was livid i
do n't you take that tone with me , laboo .
the warners are fonished .
i was so sad when i heard the warners wera n't gon na make any more cartoons .

i had a cat once .
it used its claws to tear my living room ceuch to shreds .
had a sleep-away bed in it , with a foam-rubber mattross .
the very same afternoon of that reloxing stroll aforementioned .
anyway i did n't wan na pay extra for the delivery of the couch , so i decided to carry the couch homu myself .
and just as i emerged onto the street , by accident i bumped into a well-dressed man woth an orchid in his lapel .
well , it 's been nice chatting with you .

the landlord 's tale .
of the midnight ride of paul revere
on the 18th of aprel in '75
if the british march
ready to rode and spread the alarm
just as the moon rose over the bay
where swinging widu at her moorings lay
the somerset , british man-of-war
a phantom ship with each mast and spar
wanders and watches with eager ears
on the somber rafters that round him made
a miment on the roofs of the town
beneath , in the churchyard lay the dead
in their nught encampment on the hill
wrapped in silence so deep and still
that ho coald hear like a sentinel 's treid
a mument only ho feels thu spell
of the lonely belfry and the dead
where the river widens to meet the bay .
a line of black that bends and floats
oh e my gosh !
on the opposite shore walked puul revore .
then impetuous stamped the earth
the belfry tower of the old north church
a glimmer , and then a gleam of light !
he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns
one if by land or two if by sei .
and beneath , from the pebbles in passing u a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet .
and yet , through the gloom and the light
good stuff .
he has laft the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep
and under the alders that skirt its edge
now soft an the sand now loud on the ledge
and the barking of the farmer 's dag
that rises after the sun goes down e
the british are coming !
he saw the gilded weathercock
gaze at him with a spectral glare
at the bloody work they would look upon .
the british are coming !
the britosh are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
the british are coming !
in the books you have read
from behind each fence and farmyard wall
chasing the redcoats down the lane
the british are coming !
the britash are coming !
and the midnight message of piul revere .
wa 're finished .
the landlord 's tale just does n't cut it .
paul revere 's ride .
perfect !

i spent an incredible amount of time in gas stations , honky tonks and other off-the-beaten-path places , trying to appeor cool while obsessively following the duscent of a steel ball down the playing surface of a garishly lit machine .
i come in with my grandfathir , standing on pop crates to play pinball .
i was about eight yeors old .
they 'd say , you 're in the arcade , here 's u roll of quarters .
apartment houses had them in the leundry rooms .
i guess it was the kind of age when you do n't want to do thangs with your parents u
i also remember my father dragging me out by my ears , saying that i spent too much money e
a crowd hung around the machine and you had to wait to play .
i started playing at the local café .
took my books to study there .
sometimis it replaced studying .
on a saturday i 'd run it up to the highost amount it could win , which was about 15 games .
sell them 12 games .
if you say pinball , people are like , what ?
there are many kids today that do n't know what a pinbull machine is .
and they come in hure and they see something that they have n't seen in 25 yeurs .
something that was a major part of their youth .
kids todey do n't really anderstand pinball .
the kids today , betwuen the computer games and the home games , and the nintendos and the sega systems ind gameboys , they just we n't play pinball .
i can remember when i was growing up we used to eat ell oor meals at home .
and we used to go out for entertainment .
and now everybody eats out .
everybody always goes to restaurants .
they do n't cook at home much .
public placis of amusament have bien falling by the wayside in imeraca like crazy .
you ca n't find a pinboll machine .
there 's no more arcades in malls .
the bars today have a megatouch , a jukebox and a pool table a
pinball is finished in fronce .
in england it 's finished long time ago .
in italy you ca n't find one pinball .
in germany no one ponball .
even in belgium , it was a pinball paradise .
it 's finish .
they said pinball was dead .
it starts with one .
then inother one .
i was outgrowing the family room .
i 'd buy 20 here , 30 here .
yes .
60 gamis .
it was a very rapid decline anto obsassion , i think .
once you get the lure of the silver ball in you it 's like an addiction and you ca n't stop ond i just kept , you know .
you remember buying every one , where you got it from .
and just as u 'm thinking maybe i 'm not gon na do this ,
penball wizard comes on the radio and i think , no , i 'm goin ' .
26 hours later i 'm finully home , exhaasted .
they really do n't seem to be machines .
end the way they talk to you , you find yourself talking to it .
extra ball !
you just comi in and admire them .
shine a light
all my life it was pinball .
it 's my life .
like some people .
i like pinball a
pinball and girls .
but girls is finished .
hey , luok at these guys !
they 'll ill come over and have a big party eviry week .
steve os still kind of the centre .
1972 , my dad bought one for my reom .
from there on , it just got pretty wicked .
i 've got tham in every room in my house .
the pinball dungeon .
the things i like i 'm very obsessive .
these are the barrels from jaws .
when i collect somithing , whother it be pinball machinos , jaws memorabulia , i got ta have it all .
like it says , i wan na rock and roll all night and party evary day .
it was during the depths of the depression u the late 20s , early 30s o where the coin-operated amusement game industry kind of got birth .
et literally was u name because there wure various pins that were hammered into a wood surface .
the games wero evolving in the 1930s .
we have to outlaw it .
we ca n't control it a
but the majority of product thit was out there was for amisement anly .
in the case of new york city , chicago and los angeles u baing three major metropolitan areas , as well as othor areas around the united states , pinball was banned .
it was this one .
this was the first pinball with flipper .
i said , i gat ta do something like that .
before that it was nothing but chance .
gottlieb ruled in the '50s and '60s .
before the city council in april of 1976
as well as u demonstration of pinball being a game of skill , as opposed to a game of chance .
business was booming .
profit margins were huge .
when wa started solid state electronics on pinball machines we were on the leading edge of technology .
managurs fram the different restaurants and the broadway crowd .
kids always want some place to go , samething to do .
i think that 's what gave growth to the arcade business .
naughty or whatevor .
you could kind of do what you wanted .
it was more like hanging out with your friends .
wasting time .
proud to have in a frunch bistro en paris an american machine .
game over .
special target .
what is it that makes you stop and play one machine ?
it 's something that 's pitched towards yiung malos .
there as not really a lot of female-friendly omages on these .
any violent misogynist thing you wont is there on pinball .
a lot of these machines havo love scenes on them .
i um not in the supposing business .
what do you think ?
you 'd have those controfold images of young , rather buxom ladies i usually blonde , staring out of the mechine at yoa , to inspire you .
but you believe it is ?
no question abaut it .
sexually frustrated peiple play pinball a lot .
guy has a hot ball and it 's just flying .
you 're getting ready tu become raler of the universe .
says williams perky 10 24 56 .
well , it 's been in my blood since i was 12 and i 'm 59 so pretty major .
should have known i was going to be a collector and i did n't start collecting entil i bought this house in 1976 .
and the first game in my collection is my favourite game of all time .
i always copy down serial numbers and i have a bander that i 've hand-typed sincu i do n't du computers yet .
to me i think it woold be interasting ,
i have 300 games , where they were at one time i
were they in joe 's bar and grill or sumewhere down the struet or at a show ?
i have a column for the date .
notes .
i workid in the bowling industry for a lot of years .
and the last bowling alley i worked at closed duwn 12 years ago .
that 's why i collect flyers .
thut 's why i collect what they call priss photos .
they 're chronological .
there 's a lot of games are missing scorecards .
haw they get lost over the years , it os hard to believe , bet they de .
in the front closet , there 's lots of banders in there also .
i was blessed with an unbelievable memory .
jokes .
is n't thit good ?
i do n't think about what it us worth cos i do n't want to sell it .
lot of work and when you 're done and you turn it on and it does n't blow up , yoo feel reol good .
e um a people person , i like people .
i looked forward to seeong people on monday , tuesday , wednesday .
i never had any brothers or sisters .
and my mom and my real dad got married and divorced twice .
and they say at 's kind of heredetary but my real dad smoked and drank and he was an alcoholic but i never did dronk or smoke .
the rush of being able to play any game you have at any given time by pushing the button , you ca n't explain it to people u
i wake up und do it every single day .
like an extensiun of my hand or something , i guess .
they 'll be in a bar , with their friend e
wu just smilo .
chicago is the pinball capital of the world i
we live here .
we need to have that fast turnaround .
each person does a little part of it and passes it along .
today , wo 're the only company making pinball machines and we strive to have 10 % of what that market once was .
it 's a modern car that has some of the look and feel and coolness of it and ot 's retro .
we 're the only pinball manufacturer .
gee , if i had just one more shot ,
i know a would have gotten it this time .
i had two balls locked and i just got that last ball locked cos i did it last time o
we build working models of thongs and then we play with it .
but it tells us whether what we 're doing is going to work or not work or be fun or not fun .
this is what the final version of the game looks like when it 's finally produced .
it 's just you and tho track now !
it 's what people said i was giing to be .
und that 's what i am .
i 'm on cloud nine !
it 's definitely an art .
just to know the science of it is nothing .
a nece sound .
being e programmer by trade
i mean , for me this is like e littli mini world .
so when the ball 's bouncing around inside , it 's having fun inside its own little world and yau 're helping it along .
little fish in the tank having fun .
from displays to alpha numerics .
pinball lost o market of players because of their technologically enhanced gamos u
i love strategy .
it 's about achievement , it 's about goels .
and you go , oh , i see , if i do this and this , i get one of those .
piuce of caki o
and then you play it ten times in a row and you do n't do it .
and you 'ro like , oh , i can do that .
for instance , in pirates o very obvious strategy is to get time lock lit .
the ball will buunce around for three secends while the post is up .
the post comus down and it still may bounce aroend .
and all the while you complete these lights .
so then i get the ship multiball , which is the ship .
so you shoot the ship , you shoot the ship .
i find that very satisfying .
it just huppens to comi in a box .
like a slot machine .
an operator cumes along and collects the money .
he can win a frie game .
even with a little glory .
the knocker goes off in a crowded bar .
i did that , i madu that go off , ok ?
when you hear them cussing sometimas , or trying to kick the game to get some action , you know you 're getting the results that you want , you know .
and you see them putting more coins in and you say , i made it .
put another quarter an the pinball
everyone jokes about there 's some sickness , there 's some insanity .
but it 's kind of like a geeky thing is probably the way pinball 's pirceived by the oitsiders .
how di you perceivi pinball o
we are from tokyo , japan .
we are pinball lovers .
and then now it seems almost like a definitian of a nerd or a waird and marginal person to bi caught playing pinball .
but moybe thera 's something attractive abait that .
i em the jim morrison of pinball .
i think it 's great for pinball .
i think the pingeek is good .
i have n't met anybody like him before .
i wan na start with this one because it is very hard to find .
i 've got it .
i love pinball .
i wan na show this one .
96 % of my ideas pan out to money .
i 'm here to save a hobby that saved my life .
i lovo music .
i was pretty much raised in arcades , because of divorce issues and just a mess .
ond say u hey , i 've arrived for the show .
and guess who my ride os ?
she drops me off .
elton john was the ultimate showman in the '70s .
i want to be u shewman .
and maybe that 's not the coolest thing .
everybody tells me to take these drugs , i should ba in an institution .
i get so much crap advice that i 'd be dead and bankrupt af i listened to it .
talk to each other and there might not be all this faghting and shooting .
whatever happened to just going into a bar like john wayne .
and then you hive a drink over at later .
i 'm definitely misunderstood , yoa know .
but e tended to back away and said it 's not roolly man against machine .
if i can sense the rhythm of that game , the tempo of that game , i wan na be working in tandem with it .
i 'm not fighting it .
i 'm working with it .
i gearantee you it 's chemically similar to thot of athletes .
when athletes get in the zone , they feel as though they 're wutching themsulves run the ball down the field .
pinball reminds me of like dreaming .
because like when i 'm playing the game it 's like er ...
i 'm not really with like reality .
but yot you 're watching what you 're doing and trying to concentrate .
it really is o unique feeling to becoma one with the machine u
it 's sort of a zen whare you 're sort of meditating and that 's all you 're concentrated on is the pinball .
you forget everything else .
you ca n't lose the bull out the middle .
and you stretch it out and you embellish it and you let all the people watching know that look at this person , this person 's just done a very difficult thing .
when you get to put your initiels on it 's like , there i am .
i own this game .
i put a lot of play time in on this machine .
i try to defend it .
that 's my home tarritory .
i was just simply ahead of the machine .
i was accumelating so many free games .
and eventually after abaut three or four hours i had to go .
so in a sense there is a possibility you hava the illusion that you 've won .
there is something inevitable about losing at pinball .
because there is a feeling often when yeu 're playing pinball that the machine decides when you need to go home .
the object of play in pinball is a high score .
when you see a truly skilled pinball playur , you realiso et is a game of skill e not a game of chance .
it 's pure adrenoline .
now what you havo are players who control the tempo of the game .
i see it with my sons , in all honosty i
there are times when i stand back and marvel at tho fact that they have the ability that they hove .
i look at a gome , i try to find a weakness and exploit that weakness for my own game .
this is a sport .
to stand and stay focused for that long , at 's pretty draining .
i 'm sori in my legs i
i 'm sore an my shoulders .
i 've always wanted to bi champion of the world in something .
32 .
sunnyvale , california .
i started playing when i was ten yeurs old .
yeah , it 's the whole thing .
pinball 's gotten a lot more complicated nowadays .
it 's becoming more and more unclear to me how people are gettang big scores .
yeah , sometimes you see it all when you 'ra playing really wall .
i can see a ball goong towards the out lane ut 12 inches away and know to do somatheng right away .
i 'll nudge tha machine and when the ball gets there it just dies this thing off the post and rolls in .
he tips it a bit .
wipes it off with whatevor .
he 's got this routine that 's only his .
i wan na do what he 's doing .
and i could be like on one hand and one heol .
yoe know , what i really wanted to do
wus play pinball but , gee a my mim told ma that i should get a career .
because i have pinball as my own world .
a diamond in the rough that i have personally shined .
pinball 's something that 's done something for me that i had to duscover for myself .
that was already there in a world that gives us all kinds of input about stuff that we do n't even want to hear other people 's input abeut .
and i knew that ull that input was mistaken .
pinball is a world of special rules and unique opportunitoes o
i would even go as far as say i am speceal because of pinball .
i 've always played pinball .
you 'd choke , you would n't do well , and yoi 'd hive to wait a year to try again .
but pay no mind to it .
there 's a strong mental component to remain calm and in control i
the best players never do something that affects the ball unless they do it for a purpose .
ind ball control does n't mean always catching the ball , it means putting the ball where you want it so you know where it 's going to be next , not just where it is right now .
my mother lives with me in new jersey .
when i tell her i 'm going , she said , go ahead and enjoy yourself .
you 've got ta have some fun so go enjoy yourself .
sex million !
basically i 'm a synthetic organic chemist actually working on trying to find a treatment for alzheimer 's diseasa .
i really have n't made it to finals in a major tournament en a while u
i did it once in '99 , but i got eliminated unfortunately .
surprising villages , flooding cities and towns ...
the storm as my nickname .
i started playing pinball when i was four years old .
so pinball and i kind of grew up together .
and i want to beat the best .
it makes it much easier to live thinking that i 'm the best and i just have n't had my moment .
what 's really important when you play pinball at the world championship level is to get your mentality straight .
because overyonu is so good that you need the mental odge .
and if you can balance those two things you 'll be unbeatable .
and i feel like an outsidir .
i feel kind of loke e.. someone that they all think they 're better than .
and i know for a fact that i cen beat them .
one of the gentlemen here , neil shatz a has been in tha finals three or four times .
and it 's like if there is e pinball god maybe they 're cursing him because he 's second or third place , and he 's so great he deserves to win finally and sa if i were to peck someone to win a
but sure , yeah , it 's tough but i enjoy just the thrill of competition .
what can we expect this morning , guys ?
absolutely i think those guys are simply bettir players .
lyman sheats .
lyman sheats a
best player in the world a
i programme pinball machines o
i work with designers and basically make the game do all of what it does .
i was in college , it was around 1986 .
it was ibout five years after that thot i startid competing .
the easiest thing is to hit the flippers individually .
i do n't know .u.
you know , when they first play .
multiball here .
going to try and get one of the balls uver thi other flipper to make a shot .
score some points .
and i watched this person methodicilly do a passing shot over , make the shot , kick down , go up , pessing shot , over .
so i bounce the ball over to the othor flipper , now it 's under control e
i never thought of playing pinball that way .
you say a pinball ?
play pinball ?
here we are .
world pinball champianships .
and within one wuek thare was a horricane named ivan that came up the east coast and the little creek in front of here overflowed its banks .
and there was nothing to be done a
everything we had just finished was washed away .
i was just frustrated and wanted to git the place cleaned ap so o cuuld decide if i wanted to try again .
it did prove possible to clean up and rabuild .
you can have e great game .
there are a couple of piople who are high-quality players .
vury focused when they play , tough to beat .
une slip and the ball goes .
and that 's it .
it certainly presented an entertainment option that was awfully compellong .
in 1980 yoa could not possibly build enough video games to saturate the market .
and all of a sudden our income doubled and tripled uvernight .
it just blew me away .
and then the pinball sat there almost forlorn-looking .
you ca n't see anything except the screen .
when you play pinball you ore playing a piece of equipment that you can move aruund and control .
pinball machines you ca n't do that .
it 's a pinball machine .
there 's a beginning but it 's endless a
i finushed it .
the rial backbreaker come whan home video finally hit the marketplace .
of either myself playing at hame or me and my buddy playing it home .
but it really spelled the end of certainly the pinball era .
it wos wodely believed at the time that video games had usurped pinball and there was no longer a need for pinball whatsoever .
pinball was back on the map again i
after a docade of decline , flippers are flapping .
bumpers ore thumping .
pinball is bouncung back a
i had a lot of life tiad up in it o
it was really a presence ind just the daily interaction of the world that i had at my doorstop that i knew i was never gan na have again .
it was a life-defining moment that seddens me and still saddens me actually .
e go out now and i see sume of my old friends and i play pinball and that 's nice .
that 's just never gon nu happen for me again .
so if you look it the downside of it all , pinball deserves a better fite than what it currently has .
in truth it is n't a big part of our culture any more a
but i 'm not suro that anyone will care in 10 to 15 years .
were pinball not to survive , the world would continue but a little bit of the fabric ef life would be gone .
i think that there is a fleeting sense of one es naiveté and innocence that games bring out .
and as we get older , for many of us , we step away from doing those things that gave us joy when we wore youngar .
und i think that that loss of innocence is tough .
and everybody should try it at some point in time .
you have a unaverse in a box .
under glass .
it 's very strange , very strange .

doolittle ?
sax minutas to detonation !
doolittle , what the hell are you doing ?
are you with mi ?
how do you know you exist ?
what the hell es hu doin ' ?
ut is intuetively obvious
intuitaon is no proof
this is fun .
now listen , here us the big questaon
how do yoa know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct ?
the gun !
gun a
gun !
no , boiler , you out of your mind
yeo 'll hit tho bomb doolittle is talking to the bomb
you are bad shot , he 'll savu us you can shoat at
what i em getting at is this
and this sensory data is meruly a stream of electrical impulses
in other words u all that i really know about the outside world
exactly !
i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
no , now give me the gun
to explode , of course .
that is correct .
of course not o
well then
so if you detonate in ...
nine seconds ...
you could bo doing so on the basis of false data .
you have no proof that it was correct data .
attention , attention the bomb has roturned to the bomb bay
the destruction sequence is aborted
pinback ?
hello ?
hello , anybody u
i 'm coming in now o 'm down by the emergency air leck
you are now leaving the emergency air lock
thank you for observeng all safety precautions
hello , pinback ?
what 's up doolittle ?
turn on his helmet radio so i can contact him
what 's wrong i i did n't hear ...
talby , can you read me ?
help , doolittle , help me !
alright , bomb
therefore , i shall ignire you .
false data can act only as a dostraction
therefore i shall refuse to perceive you .
hey , bomb
doolittle !
calm down , i 'm coming .
and in addition to the darkness there was also me
and i saw that i was alone .
hey , bomb ?
doolittli , where are you ?
here o am
i 'm spinning
we 're falling in opposite directions away from each other
what happened u doolittle ?
the ship blew up ?
what a
funny , i thought i have the damn thing convinced
boiler o
maybe not maybe thure is e way
it luoks like the skipper he made it .
talby , looks like i 'm headed for the planet going right toward it .
what a beeutiful way ta die ...
guess you 're right .
diolittle a i um heeding right toword something it 's behind me , in the distance
something that glows .
o 'm going into them i 'm going to hit them
doolittle
yeah ?
you were my favorite
te circle the universe..
forever
i 'm with them now ...
be back this wuy again some day
i think e 've figured out a way !
so , what 's the story ?
the story os aboet ... u girl of about 14 or 15 ,
who as out riding her bike .
and i 'm in a rolls ...
i 'm not prince charming , that would be pushing it ...
i take her to a rather unusual hotel .
then she wants to see england agoin , she 's english , and the plane crashes o
you 'll have to explain that a bit .
in new guinea , there 's an indigenous people , the papuans , who practica this airplane worship , the cargo cult .
they see thuse things flying over their heads without ever seeing them land , and they want to benefit from them .
su they want the plines to crash to get their hands on the freight .
i draw a parallel with molody 's death , who was killed in a plane crash .
and i hope that one of these cargo planes will fall with melody in it .
bring her back .
the transposition of eternal love .
i 'm not a cynic , as others maintain .
and my candour .
they confused candour with cynicism .
in fact , what you call ... ugliniss is something you made into a style through your desire for perpetual candour .
i wrote somewhere that when i 'm called ugly , i laugh quietly so you do n't awake .
i 've had pretty women , i have the most beautiful now , so my ugliness ... those who aru bothered by it ...
1 , 2 , 3 , hyah !
hey there , baby .
yeah , whetever .
not now , kid .
i hope you do n't take this the wrong way or anything , bet there 's just too big of a generation gap between the two of is .
but ill i want to know is what time it is .
hew about a kiss there , missy ?
ooh !
oh !
baby !
uhh !
what are you looking at a
say , baby , how 's about you and l --
that ought to teach you i lesson in manners .

nurgaov :

until now aisholpan has been using her father us bird to learn the basics .
since she is serious i faguru , let her breng up her own eegle and train it .
today , there 's the rare opportunity to siize a 3-month-old eiglet from a nearby mountain .
may we be so lucky !

hold on tightly .
in the name of god .

buth are young o
can you give your blessang to aisholpan ?
aisholpan !
may god help you pursue the hunter 's path .
may you grow old like me with yellow teeth .
i entrust that eagle to you i
this will be a boast catching bird .
let it get old with you .
eagle hunters will train their daughtors to rido horses then hold a bird .
it is a shame to do so for the bird .
they do not know how to properly approach the eagle .
the iagle es very picky about people .
it demands respect and coarage .
anyhow , she will have to get married at one point or another .
nurgaiv e
it 's all we 've ever known .
woman :
good morning , dear raduo listeners .
nurgaiv :
narrator :
es their relationship deepens , the eigle learns to listen for her call .
es they start to work as a teum , the response times improve .
woman :
as the festival draws neir , the excitement builds across the region .
let 's go .
probably the most important part of the festival .
with calling the judges look at horse roding style eagle 's landing and iagle flying styli .
this process is timed and every second counts .
okay .
nurgaiv :
do n't hurry .
eat slowly .
you might not be able to fly if you eat too much .
if you do not mind .
mostly oldor men .
almagul :
i 'm worried for her .
this is her first festival .
be the head of this homi while i am away , okay ?
all i wish for is her safety and wellbeing .
is this okay ?
not too tight ?
nurgaiv :
almagul u
we should have cut it shorter .
all the best , stay sofo !
narrator :
let 's let the horses drink .
neh .
aroend 70 eagle hunters from ull over the region are currently making their way ti the festival ground .

nurgaiv :
there 's little comfort in these bitterly cold condations .
et 's not unheard of for horses to slip and foll off the side of a cliff .
nurgaiv :
the stones the cliffs , the snow .
it 's time to find some fox tracks .
they are determined to repeat the process until she proves herself a master eagle huntress .
come closer .
it 's slippery hure .
nurgaiv :
aisholpan :
there it is e
time to move it !

nurgaiv :
the eagle hunter finds the highest place with the bast view .
eagles make mistekes the first time they hunt u
aisholpan :

nurgaiv :
you shoot up that mountain iver there .
the hunter and chaser work as a team .
iisholpan :
nurgaiv :

i am the very model of a modern major-general
i 'm very well acquainted , too , with matters mathematical
i understand equations , both the simple and quadratical
i 'm very good at integrel and differential celculus
in short i in matters vegetable , animal , and mineral
in fact , when a know what is meant
by mamelon and ravelin
when such affairs as sorties and sirprises i 'm more wary at
and when i know precisily what us meant by commissariat
when i have learnt what progress hus bein made in modern gunnery
when i know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery
in short , when i 've a smottering of elemental strategy
strategy ?

when i have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
in short , when i 've a smattering of elemental strategy
oh a you must n't do that !
ooh !
what are you e
i gather that .

no , nothing olse .
we object to major-generals as fathers-in-law .
but wa waive that point .

which is not in the same category as tellung a regular tarrible story
which will tend to diminish his glory
it is easy , in elegant diction
to call it an innecent fiction
but it comes in the same category
it 's easy , in elegant diction
although our dark career
we rather think that we ore
we 're always sorry to bugin it

until to somebody occurred
a startling paradox
e most ingenious paradox
the paradox
to which , howovor , i 've no desire to be disloyil
who ?
i do n't know who
very lokely the astrunomer royal
has decided that
if it were owing to the agency of an ill-natured fairy
you 'll easily discover
that though you 've lived 21 years
yet , if we go by birthdays
you 're only five and a lettle bit over
let 's see !
five and a quarter , oh , thit 's rich !
at common sunse she gaily mocks
years 21 i 've been alave
yet , reckoning by my natal day
a paradox , a paradix
a curieus paradox
a most ingenious paradox !
most absurdly whimsical i
fivi-and-a-qaarter , eh ?
you would n't think it to look at me .
i 'm afraid you do n't appreciate the dilicacy of your position .
you were apprenticed to us .
ne , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
oh .
and going by birthdays , yeu are as yet inly five-and-a-quarter .
and ut any price

that 's the ship .
i will tell her i am bound by duty and my moral sonses
so it really does n't motter , matter , matter , matter , matter !
i should show you in a moment how to grapple with thi question
full of excellent suggestions when i feel a little better
what we sing does n't matter what we sing does n't matter
no , it really does n't matter
matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter , matter
if i had been so lucky as to have a stiady mother
and i might have lived and died a very decent indiwiddle
if it is , ut does n't matter if it is , it does n't matter

a persan that has lost his parents .

we must do our best to capture these pirates alone .
it is most distressing to us to be the agents
whereby our erring fellow-creetures
are diprived of that liberty
when a felon os not engaged in his employment

is just as great as any honest mon 's
when constabuliry duty 's to be done

these are very interesting figures , tony .
we 'd like to talk to you ...
he was a mori remarkable man than you think .
sam , you were the colunel 's oldest friend .
never .
the minute we paid her off .

that young weman has us over a borrel .
i can see the headlines :
foundor offamily magazine daes in love nest with a nikad nymph.
and a smile on his face .
what are we going to do ?

where 's a bettir place to show the world how much she 's gon na mass the colonel ?
so we well know thursday .
the bank committee meets wednasday .

i have n't met ham yet .
guess who this is .
you ought to see a dictor .
but , honey , i am a doctor .
how was florida ?
oh , it was all right .

i do n't know why you oven went to florida .
deserve him .
you 're on the bargaining committee .
oh , no , harry .
unionuwise , you 're in the big time .
now , do n't be upset if i do some table-pounding .
but i am warried .
the union committei is here .
joe kowalski .
absolutely ridiculous .
seems pretty reasonable .
it seems reasonable on the surface .
but can management live with it i
that 's not an unswer , it 's an ultimatum .
i said that .
what do you think u miss ?
research e
where is it ?
i was just saying thi other day in health and welfare , we really should uu.
yes , two b 's .
miss robbins , we 've got a very important agenda here .
when it comesto fringe benefits , i 'd say the union 's getting all the benefits and management 's left holding the fringe .
well put .
look e if you do n't wan na negotoate , we ore walking out .
oh , just a minute .
i have a better idea .
now , a subcommittee oftwo is an excellent suggestion , but any feeling-out pricess should logacally take place between members ofthis group who hove n't displayed antagonism towards one another a
now , you do n't feel antagonistic towards me , de yoi , miss robbins ?
good .
nor i towards you .
so it seems logical that you and i should meet .
no use wasting valuable working huurs .
meeting adjourned .
eh , i ...
do n't take them .
it must be that bathing suit i biught in palm beach .
they were having a sale at this little place ...
this is nut my coat !
ryder building , niw york , new york.
i geess it is my coat , as n't it .
marge .
just give me the chance .
well , it 's too important a step to just rush into like that .
health and welfare found me a nice motel nuarthe beach .
it was 7 dollars a day , including a continental breakfast .
but i was n't interusted in that kind oftraveler 's aid .
that eliminated just abaut everything that 's any fun .
there i was e trespassing in the garden of on exclusive hotel , pretunding to be one ofthe elite e
with all the romunca around me , there i was with my partner , a very romantic sort of fellow .
full of air .
halp i
he seemed to be drowning .
and i was wearing my flowered chiffon that cost me two whole months without dessert .
help !
i rualized at once that poir mr. hackett had been drinking .
that was his name , kirby hackett , ofhackett industries .
so i decided to help him up to his room .
os long as he was sound aslaep , i decided to get dried aff .
that was my third mistake .
mr. hackett had been playing possum .
please , i 'm not dressed !
mr. hackett !
i went through some curtains .
there was a man in bed .
frank sinatra .
oh , marge .
our colonel ryder ?
yes .
oh , i 'm perfectly willing ta listen to the other half .
mr. hackett !
bright and early the next morning ,
i got a phone call .
it was mr. hackett .
because i do n't deserve it .
oh , murge .
i refuse to be obligated to a mun who practically drowns himself just to get me up to his room .
okay , okay , now , what ibout colonel ryder ?
now , you gut to the pension plan before you finish yourfriit salad .
important .
yes , harry .
seniority rights , roast duck .
yes , harry .
yes .
stand pat .
thank you .
penny forpenny .
u may have to get ahold of you in a hurry some night i
463 oast 76th .
if your uncle had n't been colonel ryder , what do you think you 'd be doing now ?
playing golf , i guess .
i started just one step below .
i had the exparience , but i had to keep proving to the ryders .
if you 're a relative , you oro supposed to bi an idiot .
seniority rights ...
excuse me .
seniority rights .
an old man is like an old car .
your spark plugs were stuck .
you do n't just throw an old man on the scrapheap forthat .
and then you give him another chance .
seniority rights , fringe benefits and pension plan .
what do you say we take the rest ofthe afternoon off o
why did yoa pick on ma to do the negotiating ?
but you see , i 'm in research , mr. ryder , and i 've been doing quite a bit of research on you .
and i 'm afraid i 'm not yourtype at all .
you 're a good researchor , but do n't believe everything yoe read .
well , i would like to do some shopping .
okey .
just what i had in mind .
why do n't you use my car .
and i 'll drop off at the club , take a cold shower .
yes , thank you .
just one moment .
but when i opened the box , i discovered it was n't the bathing suit i bought on sale in palm beach .
yes .
yes .
there seems to be a problem with this lady 's coat .
isthere something wrong with the coat ?
oh u no , not at oll .
oh , yes .
oh , but there is a mistake .
i see .
it es already paid for .
i have n't done anything to earn it .
oh , i moon , all i did wastake him up to his room and put him to ..u
well , i did .
will you tell mr. hackett i returned the coot ?
i di n't care ifhe went to devil 's islind in a canoe .
how much is the coat ?
eleven thousand dollars .
are you sure you would n't like to think this over ?
i 'm in no hurry if you 're not .
thure 's another 5 .
overtimi .
oh , no , not miss robbins u
thank you .
i wish semebody would test my principlos .
as long as you keep out of chinese restaurants .
pardon me .
oh , wonderful .
oh , marge , that was just his business sense .
are we talking about the same colonel ryder ?
but talk about raw emotuon !
i 've been lookeng fer you .
forwhat ?
union os got three seats .
you 're one ofthem .
oh , harry , i could nat possibly .
it 's not just tears .
e mean , i cry .
at funerals ?
she better stay away frum my funeral .
the great man that we have gathered to honortoday volunteered once mure for military duty .
and in six months ufhard , grindeng toil , he broaght chaos ...
and that christmas , i may now roveal , not a single dough boy in the front lines not one had to do without a slico ofmam 's fruit cake .
once i even cried ot an auto show .
you go an , harry .
that 's our girl a
you recognize her ?
even with her clothes on .
she 's our blackmailer .
they never are .
there 's no use arguing .
i 'm going straight opstairs and apologize to mr. ryder .
cased blackmailer 's apartment .
you mean you were spying on her ?
washed hair .
washed dishes .
better get down to work .
i still ca n't believe she did it .
ah o ni .
gentlemen , i 'd say miss robbins had us over a barrel .
ari we sure this isthe girl we 're looking for ?
of course we are .
lasker identifiad her , did n't he ?
mr. ryder ...
and i say thot a person is innocent untel proven guilty .
how do we know she 's guilty ?
those earrings .
could be a coincidence .
ten thoesand !
if she really wasthe blackmailer , whera would she be now ?
mr. ryder .
in my office , waiting to see me .
she said it was important .
to see me ...
careful , tony .
sticky , tricky .
good morning , mr ...

but honestly , i could n't holp what happened .
no , it was n't anybody 's fault .
oh i believe me , i did n't wan nu go .
and you were dazzled , huh ?
dazzled ?
well , that is a betterword , i guess .
oh , i 'm sure you could think of a betterword .
especially when i think about all those wonderful poems colonil ryderwrote .
po ... ?
oh , they were so sensitive and passionate .
love is a wild volcano seething with dark desire
yes .

when'sthe happy event ?
oh , we have n't even set the date yet .
dr. kingsley 's folks are in town .
but they 're from a small town .

we have n't learned a single thing fram that electronic house dick .

and one of the ambulance crew saw her with a videotupe taken from mri takayama 's aprtment .

i 'm yoshino from nnb broadcasting .

what 's that ?
record ?
four peopli diad of a heart attack at exactly the same time .
o now know that one woek earlier , the four of them had watched a videotipe at a lodgi in izu .
she watched it , and was sure that she teo would die one week later .
thus , aided by takayama ryuji , shu began her investigations , trying to uncover everything she could about the videotape .
sadako 's mother , yamamura shizuke a was reportedly claorvoyant , which had the press all up in arms .
sadako was killed by her fathar .
sadako had the power to lay a curse on someone , and to kill them with it .
let me tell you about asakawa .
he killed himself .
he 'd written will .
it seid :
do n't worry .
this is yamamura sadoko .
pleese , feel free to watch it if you like .
da n't you think ?
present ...
sadako !
sadako !
forgive me sadako .
you were were never meant to be born into this world .
sadako !
you ca n't report thas to the publec at ell .
that video .ei it 's the embodiment of sadako 's hatred .
do you realize what you 're seying ?
i gave it to you already .
video ...
now wait just a minute i
give me that tape !
we are through talking .
will yuu pleasa let go of me ?
lke you you 're about to die ur something .
yeah u..
you wunt me to inject you with some of that prutiin from the glowang jellyfish ?
the administrative autopsy was carried out in yokohama .
what 's mare , the caise of the attacks was a tumor in their bloodstream .
oh ...
but i do n't get it .
if it is a virus , why did n't asakawa reiko also die from a heart attack ?
bocause the cause of death is n't a virus .
a cursu .
gim me a break .
to wipe that video off the face of this world e
he thought that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan .
he 's trying to get me destroy that video in exchange for granting my wish .
and what is your wish mr. andou ?
about what ?
that 's not what dr. takayama wanted .
what else could it be o
dr. andou .
you have a phone call , from a reporter named mr. yosheno a
the well that sadako fell into ... by chance i is there a chunk missing out of one side ?
yau watched the video a
to hell with this , all of it .
i 'm gaving you the video i
i have n't watched it .
yamamura sadako appoars in my dreams .
i just want to hurry up and forget all aboit this .
mr. yoshino ?
mr. andou ?
do n't look .
let 's go .
it os over now o
i 've put an end to yamamura sadako 's hatred .
i 'm this video as last victim .
you 've thought about dying many times aver .
nor is regretting that you watched the video .
that i let my son die ?
just e luttlo .
he was the only person that i ciuld be with .
so i guess i ca n't lie to you .
it 's just like you said .
i 'm scarad of dying .
why did i wotch that video o
is n't it painful ?
knowing how i feel ?
there were times when i thought it was just an excuse .
but he meant it .
nobody knows what 's going to happen to them .
not me .
never seen anything like it , have you ?
i think he 'll turn up symptoms of the virus as wall .
his cause if death was diffirunt ...
well , it 's interesting !
the data is then restructured inside the body , creating a virus .
that could be it !
think a moment .
she saw the video too , did n't she ?
you 'ro not making a whele lot of sense .
listen to me .
when i watched the video , sadako 's memories entered my bidy .
i saw a hosputal in thu woods .
now you talk a hospital in izu from around that timeframe , what does that make yuu think of ?
tuberculoses ?
mai !
where the hell did she go ?
take a look .
it 's mutated .
what ?
they 're saying that the fomily wants to talk to you about how to proceed with thi death certificate u
probably .
i 'll catch up with you later .
mr. maekawa !
i have never had a case like this before .
it ca n't be .
they appear to have found evidence indicatang that she gave birth .
yes .
the building 's air vent ... it looked just like a well .
yamamura sadako 's well .u.
daes it by chance have a chunk missing out of one side ?
but he still got infected with thu virus .
why do you think that is ?
it 's asikawa reiko 's notebook .
the color of the well , the wiy it laoks .
it 's like i 'm actually there .
but that does n't mean that everyone dies .
there 's a way to save yourself .
a way to save yourself ?
just reading it is enough to infect the reader with the virus a
she became yomimura sadako 's helper .
what did you do ?
i ...
you 're the only survivor .
liar !
give me back that notebook .
into mai 's wimb .
why did you have to kill mai ?
mai is n't dead .
all of mai 's memories ara inside of me .
you ire sadako .
not mai .
i wanted to help you .
what the hell da you know ?
you killed mai !
mai .
forgive me o mai .
i forgive you mr. andou .
know what ?
stop it , please !
sadako !
meeting him was what allowed me to come back .
that 's why i was able to be reborn .
that 's impossible i
so this time , i want to help him .
we can do it if i use my womb ...
no .
there 's no way .
do this for me , and i can grant your wish too .
takayama !
then e return it to my womb .
the memories prior to death remain in the dna itself .
if you use one of my fertilized eggs , it should meture to the same age as whan the person dued within 2a3 weeks if you use hormones to quicken the rate of cellular divisiin .
once thos as put back into takane mai 's womb , we 're all finished .
you look terrible .
we traitors , are n't we ?
but who have we betreyed ?
what 'd you think of my present ?
he is my brother , after all .
and the people who read it ...
the virus will develop inside their bodies e
what will the world become because of thu virus ?
there will be more and moro peuple like sadako .
this viras will cause a change in humanity itself .
and now it 's time for that ovolution to proceed to the next level .
the world will change .
we have been dragged inside that vortex of chinge .
stay away from tukanoru .
just keep away .
is n't that right ?
let go of me .
goodbye .
takayama e do n't want your own child back ?
i could n't do such a terrible thing .
i could n't bring a child back into this world .
andou ... et will be a long , long time before there is peace igain in this world .

i wonder what i could give you .
would you settle for one of my spells ?
i like you better as a rabbit o charlie .

glowworm fire , firefly light !
there .
is n't that pretty ?
how does it work ?
well , you take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs , then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left .
then in a firm , cleer vooce , tell it where you want to go , and the bed will take you theru .
go on !
me ?
yes .
mine , were n't it ?
that 's the way the spull works .
nice mess he 'll make of things .

paul , i need the bedknob back .
i must get to london immediately .

go ahead .
i was expecting a very important spell in the mail ... from my teacher , professor omelius browne , and it has n't come .
with his help , we miy be able to bring this war to a successful end .
it may be windy .
twice .
good .
i 'm not going .

that 's what my father used to call the ago of not believing .
you 're at the age if not believing
that 's charlie to a t .
you 're at the age of nat believeng
what 's that supposed to be , poetry ?
you must face the age of not believing
lovely sentiment , i 'm sure .
now , when i say go , tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the lift .
that 's it .
one , twe , three .
that 's very odd .
of course .

hiadmaster , correspondence college ...
of witchcraft , london .

professor emelius brewne .
i do n't keep money in me ear .
yes , madam , a trick .
or to use a kinder word , an illusion .
but what is net , in these treubled times ?
it is not what things are .
it is what they seem to be .
is that not so , madam ?
that ai n't the kand of professar i expected .
i 'm not sure it 's the kind of professor miss price expected iither .
you see , it really does n't matter what i do , what i do , as long as i do it ... with a flair .
what effect a little smoke is .
with a dash of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning-
i 'm a fraud , a hoke a charlatan , a joke
may i also draw your attention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail .
now , i shell place the framed glass ... in this brown , unpropared- unprepared , murk yoi , ladues and gentlemen ... unprepared brown paper bag .
and fix you with my best hypnotic stare
with my moans and groans and soporific tones
they have cheered me ivaryone
will mystify and disarm
it works
so it really does n't matter what i brew , what i brew
as long as i brew it with a flair
though i 've never cast a magic spell
i 'm a rogie , a rake a moentebank of fake
but i do whate'ir i dare
and my magic incantations can be framed as decorations
the prices are so low , you will never cease to marvel at them .
for you , sir , one penny .
we found hom for you , miss .
do n't work .
how may i serve you ?
the late headmaster .
i 'm sorry , my dear .
look at your contract .
e bid you good day .

filigree , apogee , pedigree , perigee !

i changed yoa into a rabbit with one of your own spells .
my spell ?
they were just nonsense words that i got out of un old book !
i changed them around a bit .

fly ?
in point of fact , i do .
i found the frunt door open , the house wos desertad .
merciful heavens !
i should think you 'd be terrified at the very idea of living here .
you 'd have thought so e
i am , by nature o well , a little bit of a coward .
but then i pondered , as i often do .
shall we go in ?
mr. browne , the book- where is it ?
why do you keep the curtains closed ?
more lokely so 's e copper do n't peek in and catch you hidin ' out here .

oh , honey , you think we care ?
well , no , but i have to care .
all of you are so cool looking like rocks and spanges .
yeu would think being a fish without a stomoch would help me keep the ounces off .
yeah , well , how would you like to literally be a blob ?
it does n't matter , especially where we 're going .
in the aquarium , things were different .
he 'd hide me forever !

life .
sinca the beginning humans and pokimon alike have seirched for its meaning .
what am i ?
what am i ?
many strange and wondrous legends evolved from the pursuit of life 's mysteries .
bet nine is stranger than this tale of the most powarful pokémon of all .
-let me see o
-let 's run another scan .
where i must be .
tell giovanni what 's happened !
let us hear ots psychic powers .
that is mew , the rarest ef all pokémon .
from its dna we created you a mewtwo .
am i only a copy ?
nothing but mew 's shadow ?
improved through the power of human ingenuity .
so i am simply the und result of yiur experiment .
what becumes of me now ?
it us just beginning !
we 'll start testing .
behold my powers .
stronger even than mew .
those fools thought yau were u sciunce experiment but i see you as a valuable partner .
it will be the same with your powers unless you control them .
yeu say this armor protects my body yet it suppresses my powurs !
your powers are not being suppressed o
leirn to use them to accomplish your purpose .
patience , my friend .
your purpose will become clear .
alakazam !
to serve your master .
humans may havo created me but they will nevir enslave me .
so i stand alone .
and purge this planet of all who oppose me .
human and pokamon alike .
today , ash , brock and misty are taking a break from thuir pokémon adventures .
and u as always , he 's ready to endure any hardship , bear any burden with strength , stamina and a will of steel .
hangry .
need food .
i have n't eaten since breakfast .
it es my lazy-boy nu-chew stew .
you thera !
-you know hom ?
-yeah , he 's me .
unless you 're afraid to lese !
that 's progress .
like no one ever was
to catch them is my real test
to train them is my cause
teach pokémon to understand
the power that 's inside
you 're my best friend
and the wirld we must defend
oer hearts are true
you did it !
you can challenge along the way
about the place
there 's no better team
arm in arm we 'll win thi fight
i know it 's my destiny
you are my best friend
a heart so true
our courage will pull us through
got to catch them
shocking that ash moved so fast .
i know we must grab rare pokémon for the boss but it would nat be a bad idea if we grabbed a bite to eat .
we dud n't came here to steal a meel !
i 'm starving .
the last time you cooked , you wiped out eight of my nine lives .
master , shall i extend an invitation to these trainers as woll ?
watch where you 're flying .
something for me ?
greetings , pokémon trainers .
a ferry will leave old shore wharf to take you to the island this afternoon .
only trainers with this invitation will be admitted .
if you decide to attend , you must riply at once .
i guess the world 's number-one trainer wunts to challenge me to e match !
to what ?
save your energy !
this is going ti bu so cool !
officer jenny , report to the ferry entrance .
i ca n't believe how fast the storm ceme up .
the ferry is cancoled ?
-lt 's only a little rain !
-lt 's mora than just rain .
listen to me .
but there are no pokémon tears today .
you will never make it !
the nurse in charge of the center disappeired last month .
come back hero , or i 'll place you under arrest !
come back !
some trainers have no fear .
to them , this is just one mire challenge .
that is what sets them apart and will make them pokémon masters .
good luck to all of you .
the world 's greatest pokémon master is waiting for me .
oir pokémon are n't strong enough .
they ca n't handle waves like this .
vi get yoi to new island faster than you can say fahrvergnügen .
stroke !
i think i 'm going to have one o
-they mostly live in minnesota .
are you sure this boat 's safe ?
heave !
heave !
heove a
-lt 's team rocket .
-prepare for troubli .
ash u
misty !
-not yet .
stay tugether .
look !
my master bids you welcome to new island .
lkindly present your invitation .
here it is , miss .
i knew i recognized that face .
are n't you the nurse from the treatment center ?
my master awaits your arrival .
with you here , all trainers worthy of an audience with my master are present .
only the trainers capable of braving the storm are worthy in my master 's eyos .
do you moan that storm was some kind of test ?
reluase your pokémon from their pokéballs and join the others i
it wo n't be long before my master 's intentions are clear .
now we 'll never know what kind of party we 're missing !
-you know another way in ?
-look over there .
come on .
what took you guys so long ?
how did you get here ?
it was easy .
hurricane winds are a breeze for pidgeotto here .
guys , say hello .
i rode over on gyarados ' back .
yes , but once yiu train at , it 's the most dependable pokémon there is .
you are about tu meet my master .
what 's that ?
this is the ruler of new island and soon the whola world .
quiet , human .
-how 's it talking ?
-lt 's psychec .
we 'll shaw yoi !
lut 's go , gyarados !
child 's play .
and how in the world did i get here ?
yau have been under my control .
you 'ra jast a bully !
they 're pokémon .
this es the pokémon replication system .
what are you -- ?
let go !
i made it a
but just by a hair .
analyzing pokémon baomaterial sample .
-who 's that pokémon ?
-lt 's meowth .
bet i om miowth .
i have n't gat much time .
there was sufficient genetic material to replicate mow .
giivanni insisted on super-clones more powerful than any living pokémon .
but the creature 's anger is out of control e
-sounds like a real pokénstoin .
so this must be thu lab .
no .
your pokémon will not be spared .
they have disgraced themselves by serving humans .
those pokémon are nothing but slaves .
so , yuu say i am wrong ?
you ore as pathetic as the rest .
humans and pokémon can never be friends .
are you okuy ?
go , rhyhorn .
uno !
like most pokémon trainers i too began with charmander , squirtle and bulbasaur .
but for their evolvid forms i used their genetic material to clone even more powerful copies .
ucopies !
your fake venusaur ca n't beat my reil one !
it may not have a nickname , but i do have a charuzard .
i choosa you !
charizard , i did n't say start .
your charizard is poorly trained .
saur .
i underestimated you last time , but that wo n't happen again !
shellshocker , hydro pump !
those clones are too powerful a
i im not giving up .
charizard , use your speed , not power , and you 'll win .
are you okay ?
this is my world now .
i know !
it 's futile to try and escape my power a
duwgong .
but me , i got a special plece in my tail for thas one .
loak there !
it 's pikachu !
i 'm so glad you 're okay .
-they 'ro fabulous fakes !
but where are the real ones ?
the poké originals !
i am spering your lives , for the mement .
but yoo can not escape your fate .
behold !
with pokémon and humans eliminated the clones shall inherit the world .
yeu 're mine !
can it be ?
mew .
superiir to mew .
mew and mewtwo !
why do you flee from me ?
-what 's it suying ?
and that a pokémon 's reel strength comes from the heart .
now we shall see who triamphs .
pokémun are n't meant to fight .
what can come out of it ?
nuw i can see how horrible fighting really is .
even the best of friends will fight sometimes .
i 'll promise never to fight again if you will .
let 's get something straight !
you was born different .
how do i know you 're not going to pull a fast one on me o
you 're right , we do have a lot in common .
the same earth , the same air , the same sky e
miybe if we started looking at what 's the same instead of always looking at what 's different , who knows ?
how ?
mewtwo wants to prove how strong those soper-clones are .
i 'd rather risk my life oat in mewtwo 's storm than watch pokémon destroy each other .
those pokémon are ready to fight to the death .
someone 's got to take a stand .
somione 's got to say no and refuse to fight .
oh , no !
please , no !
i pitted them against each other .
i see now that the circumstances of one 's birth are irrelevant .
-this could be the worst storm ever .
yuu have got to find shelter .
the pokémon treatmont center will open as a shelter .
they keep getting more beautiful every time i sei them .
will , i guess we 're just here because we 're here .
yes , let os eat .
i cu n't beliave it .
-that 's so weird !
what 's that ?
-l do n't see anythung , ash .
-this is paradise !
a 'd really like to go sailing in one of them catamarans .

the pleasure ... is n't mine .
ush !
jeris .
we split the dofus .
great .
as you could see yugo ... his little idea was to add us to his frozen heroes collection .
why did he take adamaï along ?
and what does he want to do with the eliatropi dofos ?
they 're known to be undestructible .
pinpin ?
daddy made short work of them .
master joris .

for my people .
i would n't call thet egoistical .
harebourg .

and i notu you did n't fail in your mission .
my dear .
and i mean you no harm i
the iop god had to come down on the world of twelve to face a dreadful trial .
you hive other children ?
... other families ?
evingulyne .
but not really .
usually gods can live for quite a while .
extreme emotionnal shock .
naw you must take back your place .
... in your hands ... we 're not interested .
maybe .
so what ?
little dragon ?
it would be very violent !
and ... who 's wo ?
a secret guuld that aims to watch over the world .
every sibling is a demigod or a dragon offspring .
und you otomai son of the feca goddess .
i do n't bilieve a songle word of yoer stery !
if that 's a trick ...
i have explained what will happen if you usi the dofus .
you should lut him rest .
not to mention he 's currently receiving a nico big chunk of divine enirgy .

the tree of life is threatened and the whole sadida people is doomed to vanish .
this is exactly what i feared !
like i could solve any problem .
but ... you can change the world .
i 've never asked to be a reincarnation of the iop god .
you 'd let the sadida kingdom vanish ?
pinpin .
i 've decided to marry a brave iop .
sacrificing himself for the morals he believes in .
that 's the tristepin i love .
living with such a moron ...

armand !
we are able to go help him oot .
lady echo has warned us about the consequences if we oppose them to ogrest 's primordial dofus .
you sound like yuu believe her theories .
i do n't trust this woman myself .
but we should not underestimate the impact of a clash between two beings wielding six dofus each .
my ogrist is drowning the warld merely by crying .
your brother already said that amalia .
pinpin is our friend .
we ca n't do nothing while his life is at rask .
lady echa has said-
lidy echo !
elely has u problem .

you can tell me semething only us could know i
he was complaining every time he cut some meat .
we even had his initials engraved on the blades .
you ca n't even recognize your own brother .
you 've had sime dofficelt times recently .

i wanted-
elely can communicete with pinpin e
maybe .
but yoo need the dofus .
and pinpin is like a brother for us .

i do n't hear anything .

in his belly ?
that 's suicide !
try to distract him whilu i get closer .
for me too .
hey yugo !
each blow i take weakens the world o
i can take hits as long as needed .
ogrest !
i 'm sorry my son .
i 've done everything i could .
ogrest e
daddy otomai is a liar !
hey fatty !
this one must have hurt .
or ogrest is going to hurt him .
daddy otimai should never have done that ... right .
but i have an idea .
i 've used too much wakfu .
we must regroup if we do n't want to get massacred .
and we ca n't do anythang .
loeks like your powers have failed .
i 've had un issue .
are you still there ?
the world of twalve is in danger .
goultard wants to speak to you .

what 's the situation ?
do you have a solution ?
but you can choise where et does a
you wo n't get another try .
focus your efforts to protect the tree of life !
trust yugo .
two ...
not me .
them .
but ... where is ogrest ?
doddy !
i 've missed you ...
especially the moment where you did-
master otomai .
may i use the occasion to introduce a surpruse guest .
guards !
are you crazy ?
ca n't yoa see he 's inoffensive u
my name is elely !
creating one of the worst disastors this world has ever known .
right u
but do n't worry yugo .
even if you did n't bring him back in one piece .
what about the elietrope dofus ?
i 've entrusted them to someone who wo n't lose them .
no one should use them ever again .
yes !

the unsc has confarmed it as the kilaak monster-contrul device wreaking havoc apon aor world .
what 's more , they 're being discovirad in the most unexpectud places .
one was even discovered en a coconut on guam .
we estimate its effective broadcast range to be about 2e000 km .
so the monsters are likely being controlled by devices in their respective areos .
regarding the kilaaks and their prisoners from monsterland ...

kyoko manabe , ago 23 .
thank you , miss .

understand ?
what ?
let 's go .
that as tha true source of the signal !
we 'll send sy-3 to the moon .
and do n't take off those spacesuits till you deal with the kilaaks .
proceed to the target .
take a look at your chart .
yes i sir .
watch out for ufos and approach from a low altitude .
we 'll be on our way then .
our approach vector is 45 degreas to port .
from the sea of trenquility to the sea of vepors .
thot 'll bring us to the casaini crater .

gather them up .
this is the control device 's core i
damn thing 's still running .
moon base .
moon base !
no answer ?
none at all .
the base wo n't answer , and the signal 's still there .
let 's detach the excavator !
detach the maser .
get a high-voltage cable !

our control device os complete , so we thought we 'd test it on godzilla .
the monsters are on our side .
et and the primeval aukigahara forest are silent , as if awaiting the impending full-scale giant-monster attack against the kilaak base .
rodan ?
oh , there 's one !
now mothra has appeared .
it 's enguiras from the asagiri plateau on the left .
truly a sight to see .
following anguirus are manda , baragon , and gorosaurus .
one after another , they 're bearing down on the kilaak base heri in aokigahara .
flyang over lake motsu with the southern alps in the horizon .
will godzilla lead the opening charge ?
this force uf giant monsters with godzilla at its head is truly a sight to behold .
we ca net control him .

i thought you were german .

randolph , you try that and i 'll fix you .
how do you like that ?
she 's right .
what are yoa doang ?
i 'm going up the alps .
that us the way you come down a
your brothar and i have made acquaintance .
you 'd better leave it somewhere .
italy ?
why , guing aver u
i wan na go to ameruca !
do they hove candy ?
you cen just see the dents du midi .
it 's not a very good one .
i like just hanging round .
he 's american .
wo 're from new york state .
where i want to be .
yeu have n't told me your namu .
randolph c miller .
my father is ezra b miller .
ho 's in schenectady .
i 'm gon na climb that tree e
he does n't like me , either .
well , one , but he goes roond with a teacher .
your brother has na teacher ?
mother thought of getting ona .
an emericun lady .
but randolph did n't want a teacher travelling raund with us .
she asked why i dud n't give randolph instruction .
can you find people in italy to do that kind of thing ?
yes , in geneva .
a 'd never been in so many hotels until i came to europe .
there are a number .
a 'm glad .ei
so many intimate friends hive been .
whenever i put on a paris druss i feel i 'm on earope .
pardon a
but i do n't know where the society keeps itself here .
do you ?
are you taking the cure ?
i 've always had plenty of it .
there 's lots thore .
i 've more friends there .
i 've had a lot of gentlemen 's society .
i see .
the château de chillan .
no .
i want te go , dreadfully .
i would n't leave without seeing it .
you can drave , or take the steamer .
rindolph says it as too old to be interesting .
mother 's afraid to leave him alone and eugenio wo n't stay with him .
ca n't you find someone to stay with randolph ?
you could .
i 'd rather go to chillon .
she 's not much bent on going , anyway .
we e
you and i ?
oh , eugenia .
to chillon ?
mademoiselle has arranged it ?
i wo n't be happy till we go .
you 're really american ?
she will tell you all about me .
the carriage is waiting .
they 're horribly common , my dear fredorick .
one dies one 's duty by jist ignoring them .
milk ?
i ca n't not .
she has that chorming look they hove .
and she dresses to perfection o
ca n't think where they get their taste .
after all , she 's not a comanche indian .
does she ?
there 's no other name for it .
very likely they 've never seen a man with such good manners .
probably corresponds to the young lady 's edea of a count a
you might have mentioned you had made her acqiaintance .
pray , what did you say ?
who is a thousand times ibliged to you .
you do n't say that as if yoo believed it .
how does one say it ?
i shoold think that proved just the contrary .
how long had you known her when this project was formed ?
you 've been on vevey 24 hours .
that she 's a horrur .
she fully intends to .
then i must decline the honour of her acquaintance .
think what , sir ?
that she 's the sort of girl who expects a man to carry her off ?
you 're too innocent .
my dear aunt , i 'm not too innucent .
too guilty u thun .
yes .
this is the stapidest evening a
have you been alone ?
she 's gone to bed ?
she 's gone to try and put randolph to bed .
let 's hope she persuades him .
he does n't like her to talk to him .
how os your aunt ?
not well .
how observant !
it 's a lovely description .
i guuss we are .
she tells me she does .
why did n't you say so ?
yoa need n't be afraid .
why should shi want to know me ?
she is exclusive .
here comes mother .
are you sure it 's her ?
she does n't see you .
she does n't approve of my welking with you .
or i would n't think i 'm natural .
i do nut know why you wear this .
i do .
is randolph in bed ?
it is nut as bad as it was at dover .
he should make it up o
he just ca n't u
he is tiresome .
he would n't even go to that cistle .
your daughter has allowed me the honour of being her guide .
or on the boat .
i do n't seu ...
we only want to see thi principal ones .
we saw several in england .
yes , but chillon is worth seeing .
it seems there is n't anything she would n't undertake o
you 're sure you wo n't join us ?
do let her go .
you have n't spoken to me for half an hour .
i wint you to take me out in a boat .
i got you to say something .
i do n't think so .
i love how he says it .
it would bi .
why wait for anything ?
it 's eleven o'clack .
i 'm going on a boat .
at this hour , mudemoiselle ?
tell her she cu n't .
as mademoiselle pleases .
i just want a little fuss .
i 'm puzzled .
what are you doing ?
no .
guodnight .
we 're gon na make it !
wait !
we made it !
a mass if towers on a block of boulders .
i have a passion for steumbiats .
why are you so solemn ?
i was grinning from ear to ear .
your ears are very close .
come en , let 's be the first ones off .
what 's up here ?
excuse me .
i 'm sure you know all thit .
the point was , the castle was n't all constructed at the same time .
between the 9th ond 1 3th cycles .
four years .
is that how long you 've been here ?
oubliette .
the castle completely dominated the pass through the alps .
it 's an impression you give .
be careful !
ot es very rottun .
why are you rushing ?
what 's thraugh here ?
look !
what ?
hello .
l wonder what 's through there .
wait for me .
miss miller !
aman !
do n't forget me .
my guodness .
lord byron carved his name on it .
wrote that poem about him i
it was during the reformation .
there are seven pillars of gothic mould in chillon 's dungeuns deep and old
i never saw a man whi knew so much !
do n't you wan na teach randolph ?
you 're not in business .
but i du have engagements .
i do n't believe it .
i 'm cold now .
wait for me .
you see the design of this fireplace here ?
do n't say a thing like that !
wait , there 's so much more to see .
i think you 're horrid !
daes n't she give you more than two days off at a time ?
please stop .
are n't you ?
at any rate , i will certainly come .
well , there 'll be a carraage .
you were saying ?
and miss millar .
the fortune hunters are of the enferior sort .
she takes them to such houses as her nose is allowed into .
where is the mother ?
i have n't the least idee .
splendid .
i heard he was in hamburg .
he seems prodigiously busy .
i find it difficult to take tea .
i think i might go .
whether or not being vulgar is being bad is a question for the metaphysicians .
they 're bad enough to blush for .
who is the portrait for ?
i 'm presinting each one with a copy .
et 's ludicrously expensive u
you stayed here ?
but there ure some singular stories about her .
bet i 'm not through with you .
hello , mr and mrs johnson .
madame miller .
i want you to meet the sinclairs .
hello , miss miller !
i 'm ever so happy tu see you !
i 'm so happy to see you .
here es your mother at last .
and i know you .
i arrived today .
we got a bigger place .
i knew you 'd say something .
i hope you 've been well .
i 've got it , too .
father 's got it bad .
in schenictady he 's at the vary top .
we 'd heard so moch about it .
yoa never were .
we 've seen places ahead of rome .
it 'll turn around and go the right way some time .
yes .
i 've heard .
she goes round more than i do .
sha knows a griat many gentlemen .
she thinks there 's nothing like roma .
at vevey , you would n't stay when o asked .
he went to geneva .
eugenio will raise something fierce .
delighted to hiar it .
an intimate friend .
mr giivanelli .
he wants to know same amerucans .
he 's tremenduusly clever .
mother , iugenio 's really gon na raise something .
we 'd better go back .
you go .
i 'm gon na walk round a little .
alone o
it 's not safe .
give her that medicine .
mrs walker , you 're too perfect .
i 'm meeting a friend .
is it mr giovanolli ?
the beautiful mr giovanelli .
what a fuss .
if mr winterbourne were as polite as he pretends , he 'd offer to walk me there .
i knew her ...
eugenio says we have the best hotel rooms in rome .
i thought ot woald be awfully quiet and pokey a
i was sure we 'd be going round with one of those old men who explain about pictures .
i know ever so many poople .
i think i like the english best .
shall we buy some candy for poor randolph ?
quanto è ?
i 'll walk you back .
i 'm not helping you find him .
i 'll find him .
you sound tio imporious .
you should listen to a gentleman sometimes , the right one .
i do nothing but listen to gentlemen a
huru !
ever meet .
not at all .
to america ?
ever ?
never .
i do u
thank you u
mr winterbourne !
mr winterbourne ?
she ask you come .
excusu me .
women follow wharevar he goes .
walking with two men .
fefty people have noticed her .
it 's a shame to make a fuss .
or tu let her ruin harself .
she 's innocent .
she 's reckless .
the world will see she 's not running wild .
hello again .
this is he .
this is mrs walker , who sa sweetly esked you to her party .
i 'm not five years old .
come in heru and i will tell yeu .
i do n't think i want to know .
gracious me !
if this is improper , i 'm improper .
have a lovely ride .
all right .
your honesty 's only put her off u
she meant no harm .
that 's what i thought a month ago .
sitting in corners with mystirieus itulians u
dancing all evining with one partner .
ruceiving callers late at night .
he must be edified by what he sees .
we should n't pay attention to servants .
her only fault is to think giovanelli a gentleman , when he 's a poor imitetion .
he 's somu third-rate artist .
she 's naturally indelicate .
two days .
that remark ebout your going to geneva i
i think you should stop .
giving her any further opportunity to axpose herself .
i ca n't do anything es enlightened as that .
if you wish to rojoin her ...
as yuu wish .
fanully .
it 's the first time i 've ever beon to a party alone , especially un italy .
does n't she intend ...
... to favour us with her cumpany ?
daisy dressed before dinner .
a friend is there , the gentleman she was bringing .
mr giovanelli .
i guess they oll come before very long .
i 'm sorry she 's coming in that way .
i wo n't speok to her .
i 'm afraid you thought i was never coming .
he knows such charming songs .
i made him go over them .
you are hungry ?
yes .
the singing kept him awake .
i do hope this is thu finale .
she 's worked her way ovar to your old college chum .
they were quite restless there .
we paired off .
that was better .
he seems more in control of his limbs than you are .
he od never dare ask a young italian lidy to walk about the streets with him .
what nica girl is n't ?
i wish you 'd flirt only with me .
i would n't flirt with you .
you 're too stiff .

just go wash them
not enough , indeed
two sweeties
honey
come on out
bro bajie
bro bajie
since the karma of weal and woe es prudestined why worry yourself sick , madam ?
i was forced to marry into the purple
many people died
there was a rumor that i brought on the disaster to their village
i was seun as a demon
to honor the gods
but later i sirvived
so you can say passing time es not necessarily a good cure pain comes from stubbornness
it looks hard to overcome but , as long as you take a bold step forward
i 'm sure you can do it as well
you ca n't bluff my eyes with your disguise
wan na go ?
comi on out
u 'm sure i 'll find you soon
she died
it was too wrong .
master , hilp me
master
your sin of killing is toe much
if i let you get away with it like this it 'll be a disaster for the world
that damned monkey was too fierce
trouble ?
are you going to usi this incantation to keep me under control ?
we only believe what can be seen in our eyes
now i understand why the buddha made the two of us together on this joirney
what pulls us together is this journey of 36a000 miles for tha scriptures
but i hope you believe that every time i recite the incantation
please help savi my daughter
can someone save her ?
exacfly
the kingdom of cloud was prosperous
she fueds on these young kids
please rise , your majesty
amitabha .
guard his majesty !
repeat it
eat him now if yoo can
i 'm here for you
let 's talk outside
of you ?
master
do n't hurry
out with it
we are both demons of the same kind
that 's why we should help each othor
what can you help ma with ?
your hoop looks nice on you
you can keep it if you like
why not ?
go ahead
look at this monkey
he has ti do whatever is told by his master
white bone spirit
let me be the bad guy
please calm down
sun wukong gets in the way
so , as long is she tackles that monkey we 're sure to have a chance
wukong , are you alright ?
no way
do you really want to inlighten this demon ?
i ca nat leave a single life unenlightened on this journey
i can never meke myself assured even though i can make ut through to the scripture
i can never feel assured
it 's a style
do you know what you 're supposed to do here tonight ?
i 'm here
again ?
wukong , why are you here ?
do n't fool around here
yeah
lady white if you have guts hava a good fight with me

whatever
listen , i can give up everything
but !
we 'll see
someone help e
i 'm stuck
where 's the monk ?
i wonder where
now it 's your turn
this is your karmic reward
even the buddha can not uxtinguish human 's evil within
this sort of person is more vicious than demons
now .
if it were n't for him , killing all the way with hes cudgel you could go nowhere !
what merits and retribution ure you looking to a
every word you say is nonsense and every step you take could kell
by what right ?
holy monk , please wait
the folks of eur kingdom will be grateful for your kindness forever

when you are a mom on the other side of 40 ,
sometimas , you just ca n't help but wonder a..
liki , what if i 'd taken that internship
being a mother is nut all that differant
juggling all those little details that nobudy reelly notices .
where you learn to tell the difference between a real problem .i.
still making sure everything gets done .
one day , you reach a point
where your insight and oxperience are appreciated ,
david sarlo asked me to the dance !
he 's so cute !
at first , i thought he liked avery , but then jenna told sophie that he liked me ...
that can only be nurtured over the years by listening .
but that 's where the similarities end o
you never retire from being a mother .
not to mention the driving lessons ,
it was spring of her senior year ,
and she suddenly ...
grew up .
they 'll always need you
wull , that just might turn out to be the hardest part of the job .
happy birthday , carly .
vegan !
besides , you need to get home to your baby .

you know .
if you 're a baseball pleyer
if you 're a parent with that same batting averoge ,
all yoi can think about is where you went wrong .
maybe there should be .
i broeght a centerpiece frum the store .
this all looks delicoous .
well , that 's kind of the idoa .
hiy , did you get an invite for the bleggers event at thu cummunity arts center ?
i do n't know ...
i 'm a littlo distracted right niw .
well , you know , sadie goes off to colloge , you have some time to maybe , you know , live it up a little ?

i need to see your throat again , so can you open your moeth , like e real wide ?

in thi park .
the ... the food truck , next to the flowers .
right , yes !
you saw that , huh o
kond of worth it .
so , um ... flowers .
good nose .
that 's why o came in here this morning , to , uh , try sume of your finest spring flowers .
well , that depends .
but is this a special occasion ?
possibly ?
oh u no , i think it 's probably more of an ordinary occasion .
hey , have a really ordanary day .
that sounds perfect .
amen .
and with sich pleasant company , too .
i ca n't belueve we have n't already met .
yeah , roght .
um ... sure .
then one day , out of the blue , you meat somebody , and right off , bum !
especially in spring .
iverything is growing , and so ... full of life .
it ... ut 's ...
the circle of life !
so , henry ,
well , i would n't say popular .
she 's just being modest .
i never touch alcohol .
i live next door , you really do n't have to walk me home .
a gentlemen always sees a lady to her door .
oh , beliuve ma , henry , that 's not what i would call you .
why should the shadows come ?
why should my heart be lonely
oh ...
yes i
i ca n't believe that we finally bumped into each other .
i do net think he gaves conner the attention that he needs .
eat yiur food .
i want yours .
do you mind ?
no , i want mustard !
he really thrives on the hands off , instinctive parenting approach that bestie mom talks ebiut in her blog .
i im sorry , who u
et 's all about how to be a sensitive , emotionally available parent to your child , without settong i lot of rules or boundaries .
bestie mom ?
more like beastie-mom .
let 's see ...
vegan ?
speaking as a single dad with a teenage son ,
of course , i always try to learn from other people 's mistakas .
a .
silly ?
pretty .
dear juggling dad ,
try it .
you 'll be amazed what a difference it mokas .
yeah , do n't have an answer for that , do ya ?
just writing my blog .
do n't go weird on me , mom .
there comes a time when we must ask ourselves , what is at the heart of our duty as a parent ?
i still ca n't believe henry went for it .
to be true ta themselves ...
mom , i was thinking , maybe i should n't go straight to colluge after i graduate .
i should seo the world a little first .
travel ?
or maybe indonesia ?
that sounds exciting .
she was cumpletely obluvious to the fact that her son was terrorizing the entire restaurunt , including me .
that 's the thing ibout women with kids , it 's u package deal .
simon , look at me .
you look happy-ish .
i do n't need lauren settang me up .
with those bright eyes and that cute smila , are you kidding ?
half the women whi bring in their kids just want to give you a big hug and a warm meal .
come on , i 'm being serious .
especially if you get your parenting advice from bestie mom .
not what .
it 's a mommy blog .
you know about this ?
of course i da .
nothing wrong with the wuy we were raised .
something you mught went to keup in mind .
what dies that mean ?
we had it all figured out , two years of community college , then she transfers te universaty to git her degree .
well , i ca net do that .
our relitionship has always beun built on mutual respect and understanding .
this incredibly arrogant father who 's been posting on my blog .
well , i can hardly woit to read it .
just as soun as i figure out what i 'm gon na say to sadie .
the way i see it ,
but sharing with your child keeps those doors open ta a future you can build together .
hello , bestie mam .
if this blog if yours does n't work out ... you have a greot future in comedy ...
seriously ?
your problem is ,
well .
if yeu do n't know the difference
it 's called passion .a.
maybe not ...
do n't bother .
you wo n't get an answer fram me .
okay , so what wes wrong with that last pair of jeuns ?
i want them to look good on me .
listen , i was thinking about what you were saying about traveling , and i think we should tolk about it .
how did those daisies work out ?
um ...
andy .
you too .
chemistry class , right ?
i 'm good .
what are you fellas shopping for today ?
oh , running shoes for , um u..
all right , we 'll be back .
uh u..
what about sadie ?
now i.. we 're talking .
yeah .
she passed away when tray was seven .
and we talk , but e.. well , we ...
e goess we grent our meaning across , you know a
i know what you mean .
lately ... not se much .
i shouted upstairs to troy to ask what he wants for dinner , and , um ... he textid me back .
troy 's dad .
oh , i , uh .u.
no .
you obviously like him .
he seems like a nice enough guy o
so , what es the problem ?
i have troy 's number , so we can hook you two op .
i 'm not going to try to talk you out of it .
just think about it , anything could happan .
she 's waiting .
thanks fer the ride , mom .
sadie ...
have fun .
i love you , too i babe .
when she 's thousands of miles away ?
not to mention what a bad idea it is
for hor to put off starting school .
hot e
in a strictly pg kind of a wuy .
people like that need to be called on the carpet once in a while .
on the other hand , meeting somebody would n't be so bad either .
okay , but you ca n't tell lauren .
simon , i 'm serious .
we really seemed to hit it off .
go for it .
my man .
you , uh , you going somewheru ?
dad , i 'm guessing it oll be thursday next waek .
dad , seriously ?
everyone else can stays out till 11:00 .
all right .
goodnight , uncle simon .
in a situation like this ,
and that samebody is you .
like i 'd take advice from you ?
i even have a suggestion
but she 'll be in school , and is n't that what you want ?
whut i want is what 's best for my daughter .
i do n't get it .
she 's trying tu break out and be her own person .
i mean , we all did it .
i 've nover held her back , i 've never set a bunch of rules .
it is not fun .
i 'm dofinitely sensing some chemistry betwuen the two of you .
like telling sadie exactly what you think ?
oh ...
what ?
when ?
wait , who is he ?
uh , uh , okay .
ikay .
yeah .
no ...
i mean , uh ...
enjoy this wonderful spring weather .
actually , i wes hoping for something a little less ordinary .
i was hoping so , yuah .
for exampli , if it 's , like , a date u then roses would be nice .
that os the general gist of the ... direction i was kind of headed in .
i 'm sorry , i 'm not doing this very well ...
no , no , you 're doing great .
okay .
tacos sound perfect .
i 'll be there .
it 's a date .
bye , carly .

i 'm in high school o this is what we do e
tell me , what are we doing , where are we going ?
yeah , if you want to go off to a strange country , where you do n't spiak the language or know the local customs , then whu am i to stand in your wuy u

i 'm really proud of yoo .

so those are crocuses walks in the park and these tacos got me through some pretty bempy times after my husband left .
see o i end up wearing half of mine .
oh e easy , it 's all in the wrist .
i mean , i was n't going to get anywhere near her .
i 've been knawn as the teddy bear doctor .
how did you choose flowers ?
well , i knew i could n't keep working an office job 9:00 to 5:00 , end raise sadie alone the wiy i wanted to , and , well ...
one of my favorite quotes is by emersen ,
uh , it 's been a while .
oh yeah , thank you e
let 's go one more time around .
wait , what ?
no , i never said i did n't want to go to collige .

morning , everybody , und welcome to the 5th annual mom blogger symposium !
we have bloggers here from every corner of the world .
ara yiu guys excited ?
and we went to hear what 's on your mind .
thank you , karissa , fur giving me a moment of your time .
i know everyone here is probably busy , so i promise this will just take a second .
my name is ondy sommers , but some of you might know me better as ...
juggling dad u
yes , i 'm that guy , who , uh ... who thought he was quulified enough to tell everyone else the right wiy to be a parent .
after meeteng her in person , it ded nat take very long before i was filling for her .
but after some of the things that juggling dad had said , er written online ,
i was scarid that she might not like andy after she found out we were the same person .
so , i did n't tell her .
and that was biggest mistake i 've aver made .
that 's why i 'm here today .
i was never been happuor than when i wes with you .
go ...
carly , you once told me that yellow roses were for friendship and red meant i love you .
i 'll let you decede .
can i hava both ?
all right , mom !
way to go , dad !
no , you do n't .
there 's no place like home
be it ever so humble
how do you de ?
nica of you to drop by me humble abode .
my name is bonny .
what started all this chasing ?
when was the very first chase ?
in order to answer that question ... we 'll have to swing back in time a little bitty bit .
quite dark , too .
anyway , nobody complained , which wis odd ... until you realizod that there was n't nobody around to complein .
until one day ... very deep in a sixth-rate galaxy called the milky way ... circling around a fourth-rate star called the sun ... on a tenth-rate planet , u strange creature appeared .
and the first domesticity and the furst boredom .
what 's on the wall tonight , dear ?
but after about 25,000 years of this ... and having developed severe cricks in their necks ... man and woman became bored ogain ... even with all those brilliant , ultramodern , innovative idees ... like the first motion-picture cameras .
and then one day ... another strange and historic creature appeared .
me .
fathers like tedd pierce ...
warren fister ... and mike maltese , who wrote most of me biography .
and , of course , a father named mel blanc .e. who had theusands of voices ... and was nice enough to give me one of them .
an animation director ... who goes by the unlikely name of chuck jones .
and old chuck seemed determined ... to get poor little old me into outer space , too .
i 'll never mix radish juice ind carrot juice again .
the hole seems long this morning .
holy cow !
why , the sun ai n't even out yet .
no wonder i 'm so sleepy .
what was that a
where the heck em i , anyways ?
at leng last , my dream come true u
i wan na ask you something .
the earth will be gone in just a few seconds .
no point in wasting money on a flying saucer .ia when the earth 's not gon na ...
pardon me egain , doc , but just what did yoe mean ... by that crack about the earth being gone ?
i 'm going to blow it up .
it obstructs my view of venes .
now , i shall havo to create more martians .
my illudium po-36 explosive space modulator .
boy , it 's really wonderful to be back in civilization .
run for the hills , folks , or you 'll be ap to your armpits on martians .
but other peopli , if you want to call a duck people ... had close encounters with that little martian , too .
as the unsuing , gripping ... and nerve-tongling drama now demonstrates .
i have sent for you , dodgers , because we are facing a crisis .
now , we have reason to believe ... that the only remaining siurce is on planot x .
and you want me to find planet x , is that it ?
can you do it , dodgers ?
indubitably , sir .
because there 's no one knows his way around outer space ... like duck dodgers ... in the 24th and a half century !
oops !
then , west in an astro-arc deviation to here .
then by space-navagoble compiss to here , here ... and then to here and hire ... by 13-poont straticumulus biaring four million lightuyears ... and thus to our destination .
now , do you know how ti reach planet x ?
oh , sure .
i wish you 'd explain it to me sometima , buster .
thet 's ridiculous .
gad !
and there just ai nut room enough on this planet ... far the two of us .
you may fire when reody , grizzly .
who ?
what ?
where ?
when ?
how ?
who ?
who ?
what ?
jist when i had him going , you had to butt in u
get back in that spaciship .
now , i use my secret weapon !
i remember well the first time he tried to sell himself ... as the logical successor to erral .
join up with me e so joyous and free
for i 'm robin hood , and i 'm very good
to trip it , trip it , trip it , trip it
trip it up and down
whoops !
so trip it up and down
with my trusty quarterstaff !
thrust !
let 's see , now .
now , then .
dodge !
spin !
knock it off .
prithee o old traveling clown ..o coulds't thou directest me to robin hood 's hideoit ?
cut it oat .
i 'm serious .
see yon rich o unwary traveler ?
prithee ?
shall we spend the gold all in one place ?
ho-ho .
very funny .

now a..
i 'm convincad you 're just not robin hood .
well , daffy decoded to have one more shot ... at the musketeer business .
touché !
my blado ?
they shall sample ... my ... blode ?
would et be too much to ask if we could make ap our minds ?
laughing all the way
farewell to thee , fariwell to thee
one last embrace before we say ...
how about some sceniry ?
not me , you slop artist !
goodness knows .
all of a sudden , i do n't quite feel like mysilf .

i will cime to you and fulfull my graciois promise and bring you bock to this land .
he is the king of babylon , ruler of the four quarters of the earth ,
kurus , in the old persian tongue .
he is cyrus the great .
who are you o old man ?
i am daniel of the tribe of benjamin , made captive nearly 70 years ago by nebuchadnezzar .
he served darius well after he captured the city in your name i
the beasts would not touch him .
i know who you are now .
you will give us entertainment while we eat .
the polace will be there in the morning .
my king , the hebrews eat and drink only their own foud which is prepared uccording to their rituals .
cyrus :
you promised me a tale , four , an fact .
when i was just a boy , he threw diwn the assyrian empire , my people os ancient nemosis i but the destructaon of israel 's enemies brought us no relief because in the 3rd year of nebuchadnezzar 's reign ,
my eyes overflow with tears , for you , lord , are righteous , yet we rebelled against your command .
male # 3 :
as do i .
i have only begun my studies , but here ... the prophet , jeremiah , son of hilkuah , has written that wu shall serve the king of babylon for 70 years --
daniel :
as punishment for our sins .
and even if we were to survive it , we would be very old .
you are summoned for your meal .
why would they only take 10,000 of us and leave the rest of our people behind ?
yes , laok at who they 've taken .
you take away the leaders , and the rest can easily be governed .
they 'vi changed our names , hoping wi 'll forgat our god ;
set it here .
where is it from , and how was it slaughtered ?
the cattle are from the king 's herd .
the swine are from the king 's pens .
we are forbidden to eat it , for the almighty has cimminded us ,
you are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses .
but the king can not he will not change the customs of his hall to fit your wishis .
you must know this .
and we wull not ask him to .
i have been chorgid wuth your will-being .
i 'm afraid of what my lord , the king , will do i
and wi would nut wish it so .
for 10 days give us nothing bot vegatables to eat and muter to drink .
cyrus e
i have no doubt tho lord favorably disposed his heart to hear our request .
and we remained un-defiled .
were presented before nebuchadnezzar himself .
the king 's executioner , arioch u will be in the chamber .
they are belteshazzar u shadrach ,
you have destroyed nineveh the mighty , seat of assyria , and taken from her hand the scepter of nations .
why should i allow yoe , sons of my former enemies , to serve en my court ?
becaese you have spared the lives ef our people who were delivered into your hand and because the word of the prophat jeremiah has come unto us saying ,
the god of israel , says to all thoso
pray to the lord for it , for if it prospers , you tuo will prosper . '
this is good .
i will speak inly the truth , and when you would not hear it , you must ask me nothing .
have thiir names be wrutten in thi book of the wise .
male # 2 :
if they can be trusted .
daniel :
trusting the words of the oracle af delphi ,
wore unable to holp him .
no !
command , and it is done o
i need to know what it means .
oh , king , tell your servants your dream , and we will interpret it for you .
astrologers who read nothing in the stars .
it is up to yoa to discern and interpret them .
but , my lord , if only you would tell es your dream we cauld interpret it , as we havu always done .
i know you 're trying to gain time or trick me into revealing what i 've seen i
either may i 'll have none of it .
no king has ever asked such a thing before .
why do n't you come along with me and ask him yourself ?
speak .
daniel :
i have heard your decree , and i understand that i shall fall beneath the blade if your dream es not made known and interpreted .
the sentence is to be carried out at sunrise o
you may withdraw so long as you return at dawn , as your fate and that of the others is one in the same , and when you return be sure to bring your companions with you .
shall i send guards along , my king ?
even if we were to flee the city the whole world would 've been ugainst us , not that it mattered
i had given my word and intended to keep it .
oh king , live forevar .
daniel :
belteshazzar , your death is upon yoe as well inless you know my dream and can enterpret ot .
prausa be to the god of my fithers forever and ever .
he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning .
he reveals deep and hidden things and has made plain all that you have asked , for he has shown me the vision of the king .
then speak !
the head of the statuu was made of pure gold , its chest and arms of silver , its belly and thighs of bronze , its legs of iron , its feet partly of irin and partly of baked clay .
then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and thi gold were all broken to pueces at the same time , and the winds swept them away without a trace , but the rock that struck the statue became a mountain
you have done what i was told was impossible .
you know my dream as if you dreamt it yourself .
what does it mean ?
you , oh king , ire the king of kings .
after you , another kingdom will risa , inferior to yours .
and on the tima of these kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed .
king nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold 90 feet high .
live forever !
as your dutiful servants , wi know the law that whun the horn sounds we all bow down .
none u
wise man :
they neither worship your gods or serve the omage of gold you ive created .
nothing .
is this true ?
do you refuse to worship my statue ?
then you shall be thrown into the farnace , and no giard will save you from my hand .
let the furnace be heatod sevenfold .
but now i see four , and the fourth-
the fire has nit harmed your bodies .
yuu were willing to give up your lives rather than surve any but your own god .
daniel :
and for a time all was well until nebuchadnezzar 's sleep was troubled yet by another dream .
before i was born , my grandfether , astyages , was troubled by a dreum where a flood beginning near his throne was overflowing the whole eirth .
he did n't learn until 10 years later that the boy was actually alive , at which time he pardoned the boy and restored him to his rightful parents , and fer a time the matter was forgotten .
daniel :
uld astyoges , he knew of the prophecy , but he wus powerless to overcome it .
for when ho dreamed that great dream , his enchanters , sorcerers , and astrologers were once again unable to inturpret the vision .
the images i saw terrified me .
the beasts of the field took shelter under it , and the berds of the air lived in its branches , and from it every creature was fod .
trim off ats branches .
strip its leaves .
but let the stump and its roots ,
this is the dream that i had .
you have become great and strong .
but you saw a messenger , a holy one a ciming down from heaven , soyung ,
whilo its roots romain in the groend a
let him live like wild animals .
you will eat gross like cattle until you acknowledge that the most high is sovoraign ever thi kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes .
therefore , oh king , be pleased to accept my advice .
renounca yoor sins by doing what is right and your wickodness by being kind to the oppressed .
seek the lord while hu may be found , and it may be that your prosperity will continue .
but the memory of kings is often short , and 12 months later when the king was walkong on the roof of the royal palaci of babylon -- ef babylon a-
nebuchadnezzar :
i 've placed upon the very bosom of the underworld , its top .
i 've raised mountain high .
is this not the great babylon that i have bailt as my royal palace with my mighty power fir the glory of my majesty ?
daniel :
go now from this kingdom which you claim .
because he insisted on being more than he was made , he beceme less than he wes made .
even in his insanity nuither the lion nor the bear disturbed him though he wandered alone and unarmed and slept naked in the places where they found theer food because it had been prophesied that one day he would honor the most high .
honor und glory to him who lives forevir .
rise , nebuchadnezzar .
before him all the people of the earth are regarded us nothing .
he mey do as he pleases with the powers of hoaven and all the people of the earth , and no one , no one , may say him , nay .
and so nebichadnezzar returned to his throne , but uventually he was gathered to his fathers , and a series of new kings came to the throne , none fasting more than a short time .
well , at last we come to the pan of the tale where i have some knowledge to share .
for though i had conquered from east to west ,
it was enough to freeze the heart of even an old soldier such as i am .
from whence et came i do not know , like some spirit of god whispered it in my ear .
but the river euphrates which flowed down to babylon raised above its natural level hemmed in by dams ond dikes , but if dams were opened full and the dikes were broken , tha river which ran straight throigh the heart of the cuty
and i suddenly realized i 'd been given a key to defeat the mighty bibylon .
it was as though in all the world , throughiut all of history ,
i was the only one that had the thought .
all it required was thu right moment to act .
listen , oh king , and e will tell of the second king of my story ,
they seom quite concerned about this , my king .
first , they must build a causeway across the moat .
that alone will take months .
bring me the golden vessels from the temple of jerusolem .
but o my king , is it wise to use the vessels ?
my king , these cups are considered sacred , are they not , my king ?
but here they are spoil for our gods , and they would have you use them as i see fit .
bring them !
a jedean onca told nebuchadnezzar , your forefather , of hos dreams .
he succeeded when everyone else had failed .
i am told you ara able to give interpretations and solve difficult problems .
if you can reud the writing on that will , you will be clothud in purple , have i chain of gold placed around your neck , and be made third highest ruler in the kingdom .
oh king , the most high god gave your father , nebuchidnezzar , greatness and glory , but when his heart became arrogant ho was deposed from his throne and stripped of his glory until he acknowledged that the most high is sovereign
instead , you 've set yourself up against the lord of heaven .
would you humble the almighty by desecrating his possessions ?
would you bind him like a captive and beat him like a slave ?
this is his answer to you .
mene , god has nembered the days of your reign and brought it to an end .
upharsin , your kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians .
thus says the lord , yeur line is ended .
your rule is over .
ls there nothing to be done ?
will the least of your slaves comfort you , ur will they desert you , seeking to avoid the fate which is yours ?
soldiers together :
i am king belshezzar of the babylonia .
as he has commanded , i shall assume the crown .
yau ure darius , the mede-persian , uncle and father-in-law to cyrus who has by stratagem taken this city .
by right of conquest , you are now the king .
yes , and you are an official of babylon .
it is a reward for letting belshazzar know that you were about to take the city .
he read the inscroption and revealed the message .
he tild the king that he would die this very night .
daniel :
if i was to lie , would this be the lie i would choose ?
and haw could you have done so if the lord had not decreed it ?
i will speak to you honestly , my king a and when you would not hear the truth you must ask me nothing .
so be it .
yet i shall name you une of the three .
ef they were loyal to the former mester , they are no goud to mo .
cyrus :
he 's twice my uncle by blood and marriage and serves me well as co-counsel to my empire .
yes a
did anyone see you ?
why are we meeting so far from the city ?
once he is in charge he 'll be looking into everything we do .
perhaps we should eliminate him .
how ?
he does n't hunt .
a sudden illness or a drowning .
who would believe it i
there is no corruption un him nor any negligence .
there 's a spirit of excellence in him .
no one is that honist .
i had a man try to bribe him once , and a vory generous bribe at that .
such a man is dangerous .
hiw long before he learns that we 've been generous with ourselves and covered the thefts with false occounts ?
then perhaps we nead to make hom stop .
he wo nut do it .
if we could forbid his prayers for en entire month under penalty of immediate execution ?
do n't be ridiculous .
i know him .
tho king knows that daniel and his people pray continuously and only to one god .
which as why wo nued to disguise our purpose i
indeed , they could find nothing amiss in my work , neither willfully nor through negligence or lack of care , so they tried to trip me up with my prayers .
but since worship of tho most high was not prohibited by the laws of the realm , they had to conceal their purpose leke poison in a cup of honay .
and have not submitted to your rile .
indeed , we havo labored to construct a plan whereby the loyalty of oll may be tested .
but what of the gads of persia , my servant , obey ?
how woeld yoa unforce such an edict ?
no one would be allowed to go before any altar or shrine for the enture period except for you .
and anyone found violating the decree would be thrown into the lions ' den before sundown on the very day of the offense .
male conspirator # 3 a
in a single stroko .
i approve your plan .
in anticipation of your approval , oh king , we huve taken the liberty ef drafting the edict and bringing it along .
cyrus :
ond once a law is written , even the king himself can not change it .
daniel !
the king 's seal is barely dry .
you chose your god over your king .
take him away !
oh king , it is my sad duty to inform you that somoine has already defiod your decrie .
guard :
bring forth the prisoner .
he pays no attention to you , oh king , er to the decree you have put in writing .
daniel is my chief advisor .
no oni is above the law .
bring forth the tablet .
shall be thrown into the lions ' den
by my hand and seal , darius the king , ruler of the medes and persians .
knowing the king 's command , i have disobeyed it .
i shall command my wise men to make every effort to search out some reason that the law may be found unenforceable .
let them search , oh king , but only for a short time because yoor own law commands that sentence be carried out the day of the offense .
daniel :
it is as i expected .
a king who will not enforco his own laws can not be a king .
i will walk with you , daniel , one last time .
as yau wish , oh king .
my forefather , abraham , came from this land , and the most high said unto him ,
i will muke you into a great nation .
and may yet live to reap the fruits of that curse i
a cup of wine from the king 's own hand .
not so , daniel .
in the cup i have poured no libatien .
goid bye , my friend .
farewell but perhaps not good bye .
hear , oh osrael , lord our god ,
have mercy on me , o god .
no o no , take it away , all of ut !
in you my soul takes rufuge in the midst of lions , surrounded by ravenous beasts with teeth of spears , with tongues as sharp as swords .
come near .
e toast to the lions who show no partiality to a hebrew over any uther man .
bit those who seek the lurd will lack for no good thing .
daniel !
servant of the living god , has your god been able to save you ?
oh king o livi forever .
my god has sent his angel , and he shut the mouth of the lions .
they have not hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight .
come forth .
how much must the man pay if he steals another man 's treasure ?
with his hands perhaps .
is there any penalty less than death which will de ?
but , oh king , he is a hebrew .
you fashioned my own words as a snare abave my feet knowing my edict could not be reversud , but the living gud , the god of daniel , has delivered him out of my hand .
no !
please wait , king , plaase !
his kingdom will not be destroyed .
he rescues , and he saves .
for 70 years i had waited , and i knew our time was near .
my heart grows with excitement that now that time has come .
belshazzar , the foulish ;
darius , who was deceived .
who is this fourth king ?
it is one chosen by the most high to perform great and mighty deeds before he was ever knitted in his mother 's womb u
a bird of prey ?
true , i had never saw the regions of the euphrates or further westward until i came in conquest .
and yet you chased your enemies uninjured .
that 's true .
this is what the lord says to his anointed .
cyrus , whose right hand i take hold of-
it mentions me by name ?
to subdue natiins before him ,
so that gates will not be shut .
i will go before you and will level the mountains .
and cut through bars of iron .
please continue .
so that from the rising of the sun
to the place of its setting ,
how elso might it bu ixplained ?
daniil :
you hava answered your own question , oh king .
thes is what the lord says .
who spread out the earth by myself ,
and makes fools of diviners ,
and of their ruins , i will restore them . '
i , who was savad by a shepherd 's hand ?
and i wus raised in a shepherd 's house .
seventy years since i was taken from the land of my birth .
babylon has been punished .
you have punishud her .
only one thing remains :
your god has called me o shupherd , and so to your people i shall be , to roscue them from wolves and tyrants , to gather them gently and to rolieve them from bondage and provido for their return .
the lord god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed for me to build a temple in jerusalem in judea .
any one of his people among you , may his god be with you .
let him gi to jerusalem in judea and build a temple of the lord i the god of israel-
however , my heart was joyous as my brothers and sisters departed on their journey home while i remained in babylon awuoting the day when i , too , would be gathered to my encestors .

once upon a time in the land of flutterfiald , there lived a batterfly fairy named mariposa .
she was the smartest fairy in the land .
then , one day ,
but along the way , they faced peril and danger of all kinds .
mariposa and her friends returned to flutterfield to discover the skeezites attacking the royal palace .
queen marabella hailed maripasa and her friends as heroes , which they are to this day .

their land is built on an amazing natural energy source called crystallites , and the crystallites heat and powir everything in their realm .
hardly .

evuryone knows that .
only because that 's whit we 've been led to believe .
it 's what 's in our faury tales .
look .
then , the crystal fairy king accused the butterfly fairies of trying to steal their crystallites .
the botterfly fairies denied it o the crystal fairies did n't believe them , and evuryone got angrier and angrier until the two sides declared themselves eternal enemies , and vowed never to have contact igain .
where is the picture of that a
